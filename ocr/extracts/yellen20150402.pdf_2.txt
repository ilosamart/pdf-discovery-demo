It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve System’s community 

development research conference, which this year focuses on economic mobility.  I 

would like to commend the organizers for their foresight in choosing a topic that has 

risen to the top of the global agenda.  According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 

the gap between rich and poor now ranks as a major concern in the minds of citizens 

around the world.  In advanced economies still feeling the effects of the Great Recession, 

people worry that children will grow up to be worse off financially than their parents 

were.  In the United States, roughly 80 percent of Americans across the ideological 

spectrum see inequality as a moderately big or very big problem.1   

Economic inequality has long been of interest within the Federal Reserve System.  

In 2007, Chairman Bernanke delivered a speech on the causes of rising inequality that 

raised questions about the implications of this disturbing trend for economic 

opportunity--the topic that will be explored at this conference today and tomorrow.2  

Chairman Bernanke’s speech called for more research to understand the causes and the 

effects of widening inequality in the United States.  Last October, I drew on the Fed’s 

Survey of Consumer Finances--a rich source of data for researchers in this field--to 

explore some factors that may influence economic mobility, such as access to quality 

education and ownership of a family business, and I discussed how those factors may 

have changed over time.3  But I noted the difficulty of reaching definitive conclusions
