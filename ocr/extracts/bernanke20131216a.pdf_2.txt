Paul and Alan have me at a disadvantage.  Each of us was asked to reflect on our 

own term in office.  But they have the benefit of perspective, whereas my term still has a 

short time to run.  Moreover, work on some of the Federal Reserve’s most important 

challenges of the past few years--notably, achieving a full economic recovery from the 

crisis and putting in place a new financial regulatory system--is still ongoing.  

Nonetheless, I will offer a few thoughts on the past very eventful eight years. 

The Federal Reserve’s extraordinary response to the financial crisis and the Great 

Recession that followed was, in one sense, nothing new.  We did what central banks have 

done for many years and what they were designed to do:  We served as a source of 

liquidity and stability in financial markets, and, in the broader economy, we worked to 

foster economic recovery and price stability.  However, in another sense, what we did 

was very new--it was unprecedented in both scale and scope, and it made use of a number 

of tools that were new, or at least not part of the standard central bank toolkit.  We found 

that these new tools were necessary if we were to fulfill the classic functions of a central 

bank in the context of a 21st century economic and financial environment. 

 When the financial system teetered near collapse in 2008 and 2009, we responded 

as the 19th century British essayist Walter Bagehot advised, by serving as liquidity 

provider of last resort to stressed financial firms and markets.1  But we did so in an 

institutional environment that was very different, and in many ways much more complex, 

than the one that Bagehot knew.  For example, the recent crisis involved runs on financial 

institutions, as occurred in classic panics.  But in 2008, rather than a run of retail bank 

deposits, the runs occurred in various forms of short-term, uninsured wholesale funding,
