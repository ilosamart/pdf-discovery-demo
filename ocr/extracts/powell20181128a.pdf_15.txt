Conclusion 

I’d like to conclude by putting financial stability and our two new reports in a 

longer-term context.  To paraphrase a famous line, “eternal vigilance is the price of 

financial stability.”  We will publish these reports regularly as part of our vigilance.   

Over time, some may be tempted to dismiss the reports entirely or to 

overdramatize any concerns they raise.  Instead, these reports should be viewed as you 

might view the results of a regular health checkup.  We all hope for a report that is not 

very exciting.  Many baby boomers like me are, however, reaching an age where a good 

report is, “Well, there are a number of things we should keep an eye on, but all things 

considered you are in good health.”  That is how I view the Financial Stability Report out 

today.   

We hope that this report and the Supervision and Regulation Report will be 

important tools, sharing Federal Reserve views and stimulating public dialogue regarding 

the stability of the financial system.
