balance sheets.  They use higher interest rates to compensate for the lack of liquidity in these 

loans or to cover higher processing costs because community banks lack economies of scale, and 

they use balloon payments as a simple way to limit their interest-rate risk.  To the extent that 

regulations require additional operational procedures for such loans that are prohibitively 

expensive, raise the liability associated with making them, or create capital requirements that are 

out of proportion to the riskiness of the loans, community banks could be closed out of these 

products altogether.  

How concerned should we be if community banks start pulling out of mortgage lending? 

To answer this, I think it is important to answer three more fundamental questions.  First, how 

important is community bank lending to the overall mortgage market?  Second, how important is 

mortgage lending to the community banking model?  And third, are there any indications that 

community bank lending poses the same risks as the subprime lending that shared many of the 

same characteristics?  

How important is community bank lending to the overall mortgage market? 

One of the advantages of working at the Federal Reserve is having access to what I 

believe is one of the finest research staffs anywhere.  Because of the Federal Reserveâ€™s role in 

the economy and financial stability, we have teams of top-notch economists and financial 

analysts to help policymakers reach the best possible understanding of economic and financial 

trends.  But they are equally valuable in assessing the effects of regulatory policy.  So I asked 

Federal Reserve staff to examine available data to try to come up with answers to my questions 

about mortgage lending and community banks.  I would like to share with you the answers they 

uncovered.
