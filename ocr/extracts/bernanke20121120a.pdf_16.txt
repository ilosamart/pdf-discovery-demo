pushing the expected period of low rates further into the future, we are not saying that we 

expect the economy to remain weak until mid-2015; rather, we expect--as we indicated in 

our September statement--that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will 

remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.13  In 

other words, we will want to be sure that the recovery is established before we begin to 

normalize policy.  We hope that such assurances will reduce uncertainty and increase 

confidence among households and businesses, thereby providing additional support for 

economic growth and job creation. 

Conclusion 

In sum, the U.S. economy continues to be hampered by the lingering effects of the 

financial crisis on its productive potential and by a number of headwinds that have 

hindered the normal cyclical adjustment of the economy.  The Federal Reserve is doing 

its part by providing accommodative monetary policy to promote a stronger economic 

recovery in a context of price stability.  As I have said before, however, while monetary 

policy can help support the economic recovery, it is by no means a panacea for our 

economic ills.  Currently, uncertainties about the situation in Europe and especially about 

the prospects for federal fiscal policy seem to be weighing on the spending decisions of 

households and businesses as well as on financial conditions.  Such uncertainties will 

only be increased by discord and delay.  In contrast, cooperation and creativity to deliver 

fiscal clarity--in particular, a plan for resolving the nation’s longer-term budgetary issues 

without harming the recovery--could help make the new year a very good one for the 

American economy.
