reduced purchases of goods and services, allowed stimulus-related spending to decline, 

and have put in place further policy actions to reduce deficits.  I was relieved that the 

Congress and the Administration were able to reach agreement on avoiding the full force 

of the “fiscal cliff” that was due to take effect on January 1.  While a long-term plan is 

needed to reduce deficits and slow the growth of federal debt, the tax increases and 

spending cuts that would have occurred last month, absent action by the Congress and the 

President, likely would have been a headwind strong enough to blow the United States 

back into recession.  Negotiations continue over the extent of spending cuts now due to 

take effect beginning in March, and I expect that discretionary fiscal policy will continue 

to be a headwind for the recovery for some time, instead of the tailwind it has been in the 

past.  

A second tailwind in most recoveries is housing.  Residential investment creates 

jobs in construction and related industries.  Before the Great Recession, housing 

investment added an average of 1/2 percentage point to real GDP growth in the two years 

after each of the previous four recessions, considerably more than its contribution to 

growth at other times.6  

   During this recovery, in contrast, residential investment, on net, has contributed 

very little to growth since the recession ended.  The reasons are easy to understand, given 

the central role that housing played in the Great Recession.  Following an extended boom 

in construction driven in large part by overly loose mortgage lending standards and 

unrealistic expectations for future home price increases, the housing market collapsed--
