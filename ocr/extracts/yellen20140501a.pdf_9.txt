Tailored Community Bank Supervision 

One theme that has come through loud and clear in this outreach is concern about 

regulatory burden.  The financial crisis has prompted significant changes to regulation, so the 

Federal Reserve understands this concern and strives to minimize regulatory burden for all 

institutions, including community banks.  At the same time, we are taking a fresh look at how we 

supervise community banks and possible ways that supervision can be smarter, more nimble, and 

more effective.  In that regard, and consistent with my earlier points about too big to fail, we 

know that a one-size-fits-all approach to supervision is often not appropriate.  In recent years, we 

have taken a number of actions to tailor supervisory expectations to the size and complexity of 

the banking organizations we supervise.    

The first step is taking a disciplined approach to judging which supervisory policies 

should apply to community banking organizations.  This involves not only weighing the costs 

and benefits of proposed rules and their implementation, but in some cases also asking whether it 

makes sense for a specific policy to apply to community banks.   

In other cases, it may not make sense to exclude community banking organizations 

entirely from the scope of a supervisory policy, but we may be able to scale expectations to the 

size and complexity of the supervisory portfolio, to minimize the burden where possible and 

appropriate.  The final capital rules for community banks that I mentioned earlier illustrate this 

kind of tailoring.  

Let me turn now to upcoming changes in the accounting standard for credit losses on 

loans and securities.  We have heard the concern that overly complex accounting rules in this 

area would increase costs with little benefit for the users of community bank financial 

statements.  We are working with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to help
