Thank you to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for this 

opportunity to share my perspective and some of my goals as a Federal Reserve Board 

governor on issues of interest to you and many in your states.1 

I emphasize that word “perspective” because the view from Washington can be 

very different from how things look in your states and communities.  No one knows that 

better than I do, of course, because not so long ago, I was sitting where you are, enjoying 

the dinner provided by CSBS and hearing the perspective from Washington.  I’m still 

enjoying the dinner tonight, but find I am now, so to speak, also on the menu.  And in this 

position, as part of the Federal Reserve but also still deeply rooted in my experience as a 

community banker and state regulator, I’ll offer my thoughts on forging a closer 

relationship and strengthening communication between the Board of Governors and state 

banking commissioners.   

First, to establish some context, let me say a few words about the Fed’s role and 

perspective on supervising community banks.  The lion’s share of community banks are 

those with total assets of $500 million or less, with the Fed defining the sector as those 

with up to $10 billion in assets.  The Federal Reserve directly supervises 731 state-

chartered community banks, which is only a small share of the number of state-chartered 

banks overseen by CSBS members.  The fact that this is only a small share of the total 

might sound to some people like the Federal Reserve has only a small role in community 

banking.  But it’s important to remember that the Fed is the primary federal supervisor 

responsible for all bank and thrift holding companies, a total of 3,912.  This includes the 

vast majority of all community banking organizations.  The Fed also influences the
