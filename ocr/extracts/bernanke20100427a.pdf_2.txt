I am pleased to be here today at the first meeting of the National Commission on 

Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.  The President has assigned Chairman Bowles, 

Chairman Simpson, and their colleagues the very substantial task of charting a path to 

fiscal sustainability for the United States.  The deliberations of this commission are 

especially timely because some of the fundamental sources of long-term fiscal 

imbalances are no longer distant forecasts, but instead are unfolding in the here and now.   

The task of developing and implementing sustainable fiscal policies is daunting, 

but meeting this challenge is absolutely essential.  History makes clear that failure to 

achieve fiscal sustainability will, over time, sap the nation’s economic vitality, reduce our 

living standards, and greatly increase the risk of economic and financial instability.  

Long-Term Fiscal Challenges 

Our nation’s fiscal position has deteriorated appreciably since the onset of the 

recession and the financial crisis.  The exceptional increase in the deficit has in large part 

reflected the effects of the weak economy on tax revenues and spending, along with the 

costs of policy actions taken to ease the recession and steady financial markets.  As the 

economy and financial markets continue to recover, and as the actions taken to provide 

economic stimulus and promote financial stability are phased out, the budget deficit 

should narrow over the next few years.   

However, even after economic and financial conditions have returned to normal, 

in the absence of further policy actions, the federal budget appears set to remain on an 

unsustainable path.  A variety of projections that extrapolate current policies and make 

plausible assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show a structural budget 

gap that is both large relative to the size of the economy and increasing over time.
