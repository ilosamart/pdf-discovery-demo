The Outlook 

  We continue to work with the large banks that participated in 

the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (popularly known as the stress tests) to 

ensure that they have sufficient capital to support lending, even as many of these 

institutions repay their government capital.   

In my view, the outlook for economic activity depends importantly on our ability 

to build on the progress to date in improving the operation of financial markets and 

restoring the flow of credit to households and businesses. 

Although household wealth has received a boost from the gains in the stock 

market over the last nine months and from the stabilization in house prices, household 

balance sheets remain weak.  In 2009, household income received some temporary 

support from the tax cuts and transfer payments enacted with the fiscal stimulus package 

and from the extensions of unemployment insurance.  Over the coming year, households 

should begin to see gains in income associated with an improvement in the labor market, 

and the drag on spending from past declines in real net worth should ease.  As their 

income and balance sheets improve, consumers should have better access to credit.  

Favorable trends in income and employment should also bolster consumer confidence, 

although one risk I see to the outlook for household spending is the possibility of a rise in 

the personal saving rate as consumers choose to shore up their balance sheets rather than 

spend.  While good in the long run, increased saving means consumers are providing less 

of a short-run boost to the economy.
