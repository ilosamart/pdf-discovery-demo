Ultimately, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by a number of 

factors, including demand for nonreserve liabilities, such as currency (which has been 

rising), and, importantly, the quantity of reserves necessary to remain reliably on the flat 

portion of the reserve demand curve.  Survey results suggest that banks have greatly 

increased their demand for reserves in the post-crisis period.  Responses to the September 

2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey report that banks would be comfortable with a level 

of reserves in the system in the neighborhood of $800 billion, taking into consideration 

the level of interest rates at the time.4  In part, this increased demand reflects a response 

to regulatory changes introduced after the crisis.  These changes include, importantly, the 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which has improved banks’ liquidity resilience by 

requiring firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover potential outflows 

during times of stress.  Reserves, along with Treasury securities, are favored under the 

LCR, and, consequently, firms currently meet a sizable fraction of their LCR 

requirements by holding reserves.      

Notwithstanding survey results, the level of reserve demand remains quite 

uncertain.  It is possible that, over time, the preferences of banks will shift, or that 

demand will prove more price elastic than banks are currently expecting.  As I have 

discussed previously, bank holdings of reserves to meet LCR requirements could shift 

toward Treasury securities, as aggregate reserves decline, without much upward pressure
