Good afternoon.  Thank you Dan, and thank you to everyone gathered here and others 

throughout the System who are listening in.  

To members of Congress, Secretary Lew and others from the administration and fellow financial 

regulatory agencies who are with us today, welcome to the Federal Reserve.  Many friends and 

family of mine are here, including my spouse, George, my brother, John, and my sister-in-law, 

Alison.  I am honored also to welcome back former Chairman Greenspan.  

I want to particularly thank President Obama for the honor of being asked to lead the Federal 

Reserve and carry on its important work.  When I accepted his offer, I promised the president I 

would do my very best, working with my Fed colleagues, to help restore the health of the 

economy and promote a strong and stable financial system. 

I am repeating this promise, in this distinguished company and to all others listening because that 

is what this ceremony is about.  The oath I have affirmed, identical to the one taken by everyone 

serving the Federal Reserve, is a public promise to carry out my duties guided by no interest 

other than the public’s interest.           

Today’s event comes, as many of you know, a busy month after I began my duties as Chair.  In 

that short time, the Board has taken significant steps to further strengthen financial regulation, 

and I have discharged one of my most important responsibilities, accounting for the Fed’s 

actions and explaining its policies in our semi-annual report to Congress.  I’ll do more of that 

explaining in two weeks, when I respond to questions from the media after the next meeting of 

the Federal Open Market Committee.
