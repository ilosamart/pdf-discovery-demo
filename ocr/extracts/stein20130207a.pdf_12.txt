Nevertheless, I want to urge caution here and, again, stress how hard it is to 

capture everything we’d like.  As I said, ideally we would total all of the ways in which a 

given asset class is financed with short-term claims.  Repos constitute one example, but 

there are others.  And, crucially, these short-term claims need not be debt claims.  If 

relatively illiquid junk bonds or leveraged loans are held by open-end investment vehicles 

such as mutual funds or by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and if investors in these 

vehicles seek to withdraw at the first sign of trouble, then this demandable equity will 

have the same fire-sale-generating properties as short-term debt.

  One is naturally 

inclined to look at data on short-term debt like repo, given its prominence in the recent 

crisis.  But precisely because it is being more closely monitored, there is the risk that next 

time around, the short-term claims may take another form. 

With this caveat in mind, it is worth noting the pattern of inflows into mutual 

funds and ETFs that hold high-yield bonds, shown in exhibit 6.  Interestingly, the picture 

here is almost the reverse of that seen with dealer financing of corporate bonds.  Assets 

under management in these vehicles were essentially flat in the years leading up to the 

crisis, but they have increased sharply in the past couple of years.

  This observation 

suggests, albeit only loosely, that there may be some substitutability between different 

forms of demandable finance.  And it underscores the importance of not focusing too 

narrowly on any one category.

 Indeed, Shleifer and Vishny’s (1997) classic treatment of fire sales is based not on a leverage 

mechanism, but on rapid performance-based flows out of open-end funds.

 Some observers point to the significant increase in collateralized loan obligation (CLO) issuance in 2012 

as a further symptom of “leverage” in the market.  While demand for leveraged loans from CLOs may play 

a role in driving loan issuance, pricing and loan structure, it should be noted that CLO equity does not 

represent a form of demandable short-term financing   and hence does not have the potential to contribute 

to fire-sale dynamics in the same way as, say, repo financing.
