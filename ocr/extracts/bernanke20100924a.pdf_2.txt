 Thank you for giving me this opportunity to return to Princeton.  It is good to be 

able to catch up with old friends and colleagues and to see both the changes and the 

continuities on campus.  I am particularly pleased to see that the Bendheim Center for 

Finance is thriving.  When my colleagues and I founded the center a decade ago, we 

intended it to be a place where students would learn about not only the technicalities of 

modern financial theory and practice but also about the broader economic context of 

financial activities.  Recent events have made clear that understanding the role of 

financial markets and institutions in the economy, and of the effects of economic 

developments on finance, is more important than ever. 

The financial crisis that began more than three years ago has indeed proved to be 

among the most difficult challenges for economic policymakers since the Great 

Depression.  The policy response to this challenge has included important successes, 

most notably the concerted international effort to stabilize the global financial system 

after the crisis reached its worst point in the fall of 2008.  For its part, the Federal Reserve 

worked closely with other policymakers, both domestically and internationally, to help 

develop the collective response to the crisis, and it played a key role in that response by 

providing backstop liquidity to a range of financial institutions as needed to stem the 

panic.  The Fed also developed special lending facilities that helped to restore normal 

functioning to critical financial markets, including the commercial paper market and the 

market for asset-backed securities; led the bank stress tests in the spring of 2009 that 

significantly improved confidence in the U.S. banking system; and, in the area of 

monetary policy, took aggressive and innovative actions that helped to stabilize the 

economy and lay the groundwork for recovery.
