purchases may have spillovers to foreign financial conditions--by lowering term 

premiums and the associated longer-term foreign bond yields--that are greater than 

conventional monetary policy.    

To explore possible differences, it is useful to compare two different approaches 

to policy normalization, each of which is designed to have identical effects on aggregate 

domestic activity and thus, at least in the long run, on inflation.  At one extreme, a central 

bank could opt to tighten primarily through conventional policy hikes, while maintaining 

the balance sheet by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets.  At the other extreme, a 

central bank could rely primarily on reducing the balance sheet, while keeping policy 

rates unchanged in the near term. 

The question is whether there are circumstances in which the choice of 

normalization strategies, which are similarly effective in achieving domestic mandates, 

might matter for the global economy.  Where the two approaches have entirely equivalent 

effects, the central bank could freely substitute between them without changing the 

composition of home demand, and net exports, the exchange rate, and foreign output 

would also be unaffected.   

Conversely, under different assumptions about the transmission channels of 

monetary policy, alternative approaches to normalization can have quite different 

implications for foreign economies.  Most prominently, the exchange rate may be more 

sensitive to the path of short term rates than to balance sheet adjustments, as some 

research suggests.4  Although several papers using an event study approach find on 

balance little disparity in the exchange rate sensitivity to short-term compared to long-
