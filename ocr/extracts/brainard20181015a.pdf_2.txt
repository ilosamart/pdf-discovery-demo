Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here in Denver for a few days to visit with 

community leaders working to support affordable housing, workforce development, and 

small businesses across the Mile High City.  So far, I have had a chance to hear firsthand 

about the housing affordability challenges facing many Denver families, which are 

requiring some families to make difficult choices between paying rent and paying for 

other necessities, and the associated challenges of homelessness.  I have also had the 

opportunity to see the incredible work underway in Denver to ensure that individuals and 

families in need have access to safe, affordable shelter and the healthcare and case 

management services they need to get back on their feet.  

Not only is Denverâ€™s approach to service delivery a national model, but your use 

of Social Impact Bonds to fund those programs is also at the forefront of innovation in 

the community development sector.  I can see there is a lot of pride in what you are 

accomplishing locally, and I look forward to seeing more groundbreaking work during 

the remainder of my time here. 

Every few months, I try to make a visit such as this one to better understand how 

different communities across the country are experiencing the economy.  Promoting 

community development is one of the key purposes and functions of the Federal Reserve, 

and it requires that we have a strong understanding of the impacts of financial policies 

and practices in communities in all of our Districts.1   

I have heard about the important role the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 

has played in strengthening community investment, so I am happy to have this 

opportunity to learn about your perspectives, as bankers here in Denver, on opportunities
