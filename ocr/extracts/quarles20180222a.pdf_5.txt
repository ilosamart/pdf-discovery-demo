With the balance sheet normalization plan set to remain on autopilot, barring a 

material deterioration in the economic outlook, the federal funds rate remains our primary 

tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  At our January meeting, the Federal 

Open Market Committee decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate 

between 1-1/4 percent and 1-1/2 percent.2  In this range, monetary policy remains 

accommodative.  I anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be 

appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 

percent objective.  Of course, it should go without saying that I will keep a close eye on 

economic indicators--and their implications for the outlook for inflation and real 

activity--and adjust my views on appropriate monetary policy accordingly. 

I would like to wrap up with a word on the financial sector.  The Federal Reserve 

and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the better part of the past decade 

building out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime.  At this point, we have 

completed the bulk of the work of post-crisis regulation.  As such, now is an eminently 

natural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts. It is our responsibility to 

ensure that they are working as intended, and--given the breadth and complexity of this 

new body of regulation--it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially 

with the benefit of experience and hindsight.
