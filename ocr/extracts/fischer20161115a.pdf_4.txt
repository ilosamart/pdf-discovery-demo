evidence of reduced liquidity.  Figure 2 shows that average trade size in the corporate 

bond market has indeed declined since 2006 but has been relatively stable in the past four 

years.  Nevertheless, this decrease may reflect a number of factors, including changes in 

technology or the types and preferences of institutions engaged in trades, so it may not 

indicate a reduction in market liquidity.  Certainly, the length of this trend, roughly a 

decade, seems on its face more consistent with a secular trend such as technological 

change.  Turnover in the corporate bond market has declined as well, though this 

evidence is also not a definitive sign of reduced market liquidity.  The decline in turnover 

is not driven by a reduction in trading volume, but it is the result of a robust growth of the 

denominator, debt outstanding.       

3.  Liquidity during times of stress 

Market participants further express concern about the potential for market 

liquidity to become less resilient during times of stress, when it is needed the most.  

However, evidence on this front is difficult to gather.  Some argue that market liquidity is 

resilient because financial markets appear to have functioned fairly well during recent 

episodes of high market volatility, such as following the Brexit vote or earlier this year, 

when oil prices were low and stock market volatility was high.  Others argue that it is not. 

According to a recent study, the cost of trading distressed corporate bonds appears to be 

higher now than in the recent past.5  Specifically, the authors find that, before the crisis, 

the cost of a $1 million bond transaction increased about 0.7 percent following a 

downgrade, but--after the Volcker rule--the cost following a downgrade rose 2.4 percent.
