however, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal 

Reserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4.  Initially, the 

unemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell 

sharply.  Moreover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery 

was significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with 

underwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential 

borrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign 

growth prospects.  In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented 

actions to help lower longer-term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate 

(the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short-term interest 

rates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large quantities of 

longer-term Treasury debt and agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15   

These actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby 

helping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions over time.  

The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly 

above the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level.  

Although other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how 

much slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away 

                                                 
inflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal 
Reserve Act.
