generally interpreted the new guidance as requiring a sponsor to consolidate a SPE under 

circumstances in which the sponsor retains loan-servicing obligations and exposure to the equity 

tranche of the securitization.   

Following the publication of FAS 166 and 167, the federal banking agencies adopted new 

rules requiring banking organizations to hold risk-based and leverage capital against assets of the 

newly consolidated SPEs.4  These rules eliminated a provision in the bank capital requirements 

that permitted a banking organization to exclude from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets 

the assets of an ABCP program that the banking organization sponsored and was required to 

consolidate.  As a result, bank sponsors of ABCP conduits and certain other securitizations must 

now hold levels of regulatory capital commensurate with the exposure arising from the implicit 

support they provide.  

Collateralized Borrowing Arrangements and Financial Stability  

 Turning now to financial stability concerns raised by short-term wholesale funding more 

generally, I want to focus on collateralized borrowing arrangements.  These collateralized 

borrowing arrangements consist largely of securities financing transactions (SFTs), a term that 

generally refers to repo and reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities margin 

lending.  Lenders are willing to extend credit on a secured basis because these transactions are 

usually short-term, over-collateralized, backed by reasonably liquid securities, subject to daily 

mark-to-market and re-margining requirements, and exempt from the automatic stay in 

insolvency proceedings.  In the most common practice, a broker-dealer uses SFTs to finance
