 It's a pleasure to be here this morning to address the 2012 California Bankers Association 

Bank Presidents Seminar.  Before joining the Federal Reserve, I spent most of my career in 

banking, much of it as president of a community bank.  So I know how important these 

conferences can be as you try to meet the expectations of regulators, customers, employees, 

communities, and shareholders--and to do so safely and profitably--with limited resources.  For

never made a single sub-prime loan, found themselves struggling for survival.  This was 

particularly the case for banks in states like California that were most heavily impacted by a 

sharp deterioration in real estate markets and a significant increase in unemployment.

some improvement in community banks in California and across the country. 

 But while the effects of the economic crisis are receding, bankers are now facing a wave of 

increased regulatory requirements.  For the most part, the new regulations are directed at the 

largest institutions, whose failure would pose the greatest risk to the financial system, or at the
