to say that financial stability had not been important to financial regulators, but this stability was 

implicitly assumed to follow from having sound individual banks.  

Over the years, of course, banking regulation evolved.  For example, regulation expanded 

to encompass fair and open access to financial services for consumers.  And, as developments in 

financial markets and deregulation over the past several decades led to a more concentrated 

financial sector in which bank holding companies could engage in a much broader range of 

activities, supervision was tiered within the bank regulatory agencies based on the size and 

complexity of the regulated institutions.  But the financial crisis provoked a fundamental rethink 

of the aims of prudential regulation. 

There is now more widespread agreement that these aims should vary according to the 

size, scope, and range of activities of banking organizations.  Most significantly, banks of a size 

and complexity such that serious stress or failure could pose risks to the entire financial system 

need regulation that incorporates the macroprudential aim of protecting financial stability.2   

There is also a good argument that very large banks that fall short of this level of systemic 

importance should nonetheless be regulated with an eye to macroprudential aims, such as the 

ability of the banking system as a whole to provide credit.   

Although individual community banks may be an important source of credit, particularly 

in local economies outside urban areas, neither systemic risk nor broad macroprudential 

considerations are significant in thinking about prudential regulation of community banks.  So 

what should the aims of such regulation be?  The basic answer is it should protect the deposit
