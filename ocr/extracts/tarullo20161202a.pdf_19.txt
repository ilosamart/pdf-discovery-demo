banks may lie in efforts to streamline the number of rules that apply to them and to reduce the 

number of separate compliance exams and exercises to which they are subject.  While especially 

applicable to small banks, this point has broader application, as in our earlier-mentioned proposal 

to exempt most banks with less than $250 billion in assets from the qualitative component of our 

annual CCAR exercise. 

My third suggested consideration in rationalizing the regulatory regime is a caution 

against being excessively attracted to simple answers to a set of risks posed by complicated and 

diverse activities.  There is no question, in my mind at least, that regulations can become 

excessively complicated.  A prime example is the Basel II approach of basing banksâ€™ capital 

requirements on their internal models.  It is exceedingly difficult and costly for supervisors to 

validate those models rigorously and, even so, the potential remains for intentional or 

unintentional mistakes that are hard to detect in a timely manner.  But this example does not 

mean that the simplest possible regulation is always optimal.   

Consider, in this regard, the idea of substituting a somewhat higher leverage ratio 

requirement for all other capital standards and many other regulatory requirements.  While this 

idea has a surface appeal, since the imposition of, say, a 10 percent leverage ratio on the current 

balance sheets of large banks would yield a very well-capitalized set of banks.  But one needs to 

look at the dynamic effects of such a requirement.  Since a higher leverage ratio would also make 

banks significantly less profitable, and with the constraints of risk-based capital and liquidity 

requirements lifted, they would be strongly incentivized to change the composition of their 

balance sheets dramatically, shedding safer assets like Treasuries in exchange for riskier but 

higher-yielding assets.  After all, with a leverage ratio as the only significant constraint, the 

regulatory cost of a short-term Treasury bill is identical to that of a junk bond.
