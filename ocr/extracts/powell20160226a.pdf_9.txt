The authors acknowledge that the distinction between rules and discretion is too 

simple to capture the problems that monetary policymakers face.17  I would say the same

Lessons Learned and Suggested Improvements 

Before turning to the paper’s conclusions, I would like to put the Federal 

Reserve’s communications into a broader context.  In recent years, the FOMC has 

adopted many new and significant communications tools.  Since the fall of 2007, 

policymakers have submitted projections in conjunction with four FOMC meetings each 

year; in 2012, those projections were augmented to include each participant’s path for 

appropriate monetary policy.  In 2011, the Chairman began holding quarterly press 

conferences.  In 2012, the Committee first released its statement on Longer-run Goals 

and Monetary Policy Strategy, which formalized the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation 

objective and is reaffirmed each year at the January meeting.  These and other changes 

have kept the Federal Reserve among the world’s most transparent central banks in its 

communications with the public.

analysis in the paper’s concluding section, which lays out lessons learned and suggested 

improvements.  The discussion of what is colloquially known as the “dot plot” included 

in the SEP is particularly interesting.  The dot plot represents each FOMC participant’s
