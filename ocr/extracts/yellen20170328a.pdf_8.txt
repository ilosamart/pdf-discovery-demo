strategy.  However, not every student wants a two- or four-year degree or will have the 

financial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree.  To support 

programs aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of 

Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages 

for workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas.17  

The Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers 

online and in workshops.  Educational programs and training that lead to better paying 

and more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lower-

income workers.   

Workforce Development Programs in Action 

In the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful 

initiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development.18  As you 

know, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable 

effort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw 

                                                 
17 Top occupations noted across all MSAs included the following: registered nurses; first-line supervisors 
of office and administrative support workers; sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing; business 
operations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system 
analysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first-line supervisors of construction trades and 
extraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first-line supervisors of mechanics, installers; and 
construction laborers.  See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying 
Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies, Federal Reserve Banks of 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland:  FSB of Cleveland), available at

opportunity-occupations.aspx.  
18 For a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015 
publication Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century (available at 
https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transformworkforce) developed by the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce 
Development at Rutgers University.  In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are 
currently engaged in a System workforce development initiative that will gather up-to-date perspectives 
from employers and organizations engaged in worker training and education.  This initiative will include a 
series of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a 
capstone conference in October in Austin, Texas.
