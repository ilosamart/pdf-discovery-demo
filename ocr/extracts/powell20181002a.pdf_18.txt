Figure 1.  Unemployment Rate and Overall Inflation Rate

      Note:  Inflation is the four−quarter change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, with data through 2018:Q2 and 
projections through 2020:Q4.  The projections are an average of projections from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  FOMC projections are from September 2018. 
SPF and CBO projections are from August 2018.  All projections run through 2020:Q4.  The SPF value for the unemployment rate in 
2020 is the midpoint of the annual forecast for 2020 and 2021.
