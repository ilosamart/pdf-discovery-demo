threat to financial stability due to the regulations and supervisory programs that are designed to 

improve GSIB resolvability.  These measures include, among others, the proposed total loss 

absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, the proposed qualifying financial contracts early termination 

rule and related International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols, and efforts to 

ensure firms engage in strong recovery and resolution planning.  

It is true that these efforts have improved GSIB resolvability in recent years.  But these 

efforts are ongoing, rather than complete.  More importantly, while there is certainly a 

relationship between the goals of strengthening the resiliency of the most systemically important 

firms and making them more readily resolvable should they nonetheless fail, those are still 

separate regulatory aims.  The demise of a very large financial institution would cause 

substantial damage to the economy and the financial system even if it was not so disorderly as to 

threaten the system entirely.  Note, in this regard, that the Dodd-Frank Act requires both more 

stringent prudential standards for systemically important firms and a process for promoting the 

orderly resolution of these same firms.  While the complementarity of these and other elements 

of a regulatory program always warrant consideration, and while adjustments in all aspects of the 

program should be made as conditions and practices evolve, current work on orderly resolution 

is surely no argument against the promotion of systemic stability and macroprudential aims by 

integrating the surcharge requirement with CCAR.   

Changes to the treatment of planned dividends and share repurchases  

The shift to a stress capital buffer approach would provide a mechanism for addressing 

two issues related to capital distribution limitations under CCAR.  The first is the arguable 

inconsistency between, on the one hand, the existing CCAR assumption that all planned 

dividends and share repurchases would proceed during the two-year planning horizon, regardless
