Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC).  And we encourage financial institutions to 

work collectively through arrangements such as FS-ISAC so that threat information can be 

shared promptly and effectively.  

Collaboration among many stakeholders on cybersecurity is critical to progress.  The 

Federal Reserve has been working with, and will continue to work with, other financial 

regulatory agencies on harmonizing cyber risk-management standards and regulatory 

expectations across the financial services sector.  

Specifically, we are focused on aligning our expectations with existing best practices, 

such as the National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s Cybersecurity Framework, and 

identifying opportunities to further coordinate cyber risk supervisory activities for firms subject 

to the authority of multiple regulators.  We support industry efforts to improve harmonization 

across the sector, which are complementary to achieving our regulatory safety and soundness 

goals. 

Conclusion 

 The Federal Reserve continues to work toward improving both post-crisis regulation and 

our approach to cybersecurity.  I hope that my intention to lay out the broad principles guiding us 

as we move forward was helpful.  And while many of the areas will require additional work and 

may not have fast results, the Federal Reserve is committed to getting it right, and I look forward 

to those efforts.
