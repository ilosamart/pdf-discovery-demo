U.S. firms.  To finance its euro-denominated lending, it funds itself by issuing insured 

euro deposits to its local retail deposit base.  By contrast, to finance its dollar-

denominated lending, it raises funds in the wholesale dollar market.   

Because the bank’s dollar liabilities are uninsured, an adverse shock to the bank’s 

perceived creditworthiness will result in a spike in its dollar funding costs.  At the same 

time, the cost to the bank of funding in euros is unchanged to the extent that its euro 

deposits are insured.  So we might expect such a shock to induce the bank to shift its 

funding away from the U.S. wholesale market and toward the European deposit market.  

But what are the consequences of this adjustment, both for the geographic distribution of 

its lending and for the functioning of foreign exchange (FX) swap markets?3   

Note that if the bank wants to maintain the volume of its dollar-based lending, it 

will have to tap its insured deposit base to raise more euros and then swap these euros 

into dollars using the FX swap market.  However, if the induced funding realignment is 

big enough, and if arbitrageurs have limited capacity to take the other side of the trade, 

this large swap demand can cause a breakdown in the usual covered-interest-parity (CIP) 

relationship--a breakdown of the sort that we have seen during times of extreme market 

stress.  In this case, the direction of the deviation would be such that the cost of synthetic 

dollar borrowing--in other words, euro borrowing combined with an FX swap--would go 

up and would approach that of the now-elevated cost of funding directly in the wholesale 

dollar market.   

And given that any method of dollar funding--direct or synthetic--has become 

more expensive relative to euro funding, it then follows that an adverse shock to a global 

                                                 
3 A foreign exchange swap is the simultaneous exchange of one currency for another in the spot market and 
an agreement to reverse this transaction at a later date at a pre-specified exchange rate.
