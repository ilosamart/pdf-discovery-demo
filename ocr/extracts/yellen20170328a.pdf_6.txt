5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about 

triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11   

While high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish 

high school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12  The 

advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher 

earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for 

African Americans and Hispanics.   

Improving educational levels in low- and moderate-income communities is a 

long-term task.  At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the 

sometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially 

lower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates.13  Thus, a starting 

point is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality 

of primary and secondary schooling.

college education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from the

it was $603.  These amounts compare with median weekly earnings of $1,501 for men and $1,117 for 
women with a bachelor’s or higher degree.
