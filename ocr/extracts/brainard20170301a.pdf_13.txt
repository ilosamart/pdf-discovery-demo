this, the Committee could choose to implement policy by adjusting the supply of reserves 

to offset such shocks.  Or, the Committee could decide to maintain the current floor 

system, in which a buffer of reserves, sufficient to accommodate any sizable shocks to 

reserves demand and supply, is maintained, thereby obviating the need for high-

frequency adjustments to the supply of reserves.  The Committee’s normalization 

principles suggest that any buffer would be the minimum amount needed to efficiently 

and effectively implement policy.10   

Because of changes in structural and short-term factors since the crisis, it is 

difficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still 

maintaining effective interest rate control.  Thus, as the balance sheet gradually declines, 

it will be important to carefully monitor money markets for indications that any further 

reduction in the supply of reserves will begin to put upward pressure on money market 

rates.  At that point, the amount of reserves will likely be close to the minimum amount 

necessary to satisfy demand at the target rate.11

11 Some experts have made financial stability arguments in favor of maintaining a level of reserves that is 
somewhat larger than needed for monetary control alone.  In the past, the demand for safe short-term assets 
has sometimes been met by an increased supply of private-sector short-term debt, which has been 
associated with increased leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation.  Some argue that a greater 
supply of safe short-term public debt could help prevent these potentially destabilizing developments from 
occurring.  See Robin Greenwood, Samuel G. Hanson, and Jeremy C. Stein (2016), “The Federal Reserve’s 
Balance Sheet as a Financial-Stability Tool,” paper presented at “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy
