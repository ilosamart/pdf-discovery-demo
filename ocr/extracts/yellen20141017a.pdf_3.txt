nation’s history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on 

equality of opportunity.   

Some degree of inequality in income and wealth, of course, would occur even 

with completely equal opportunity because variations in effort, skill, and luck will 

produce variations in outcomes.  Indeed, some variation in outcomes arguably contributes 

to economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save, 

invest, and undertake risk.  However, to the extent that opportunity itself is enhanced by 

access to economic resources, inequality of outcomes can exacerbate inequality of 

opportunity, thereby perpetuating a trend of increasing inequality.  Such a link is 

suggested by the “Great Gatsby Curve,” the finding that, among advanced economies, 

greater income inequality is associated with diminished intergenerational mobility.3  In 

such circumstances, society faces difficult questions of how best to fairly and justly 

promote equal opportunity.  My purpose today is not to provide answers to these 

contentious questions, but rather to provide a factual basis for further discussion.  I am 

pleased that this conference will focus on equality of economic opportunity and on ways 

to better promote it.  

In my remarks, I will review trends in income and wealth inequality over the past 

several decades, then identify and discuss four sources of economic opportunity in 

America--think of them as “building blocks” for the gains in income and wealth that most 

Americans hope are within reach of those who strive for them.  The first two are widely 

recognized as important sources of opportunity:  resources available for children and
