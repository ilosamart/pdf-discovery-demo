capital standards on the basis of all exposures in the host jurisdiction and, indeed, that they 

manage their risks in that country across all their affiliates. 

“Balkanization” and Home-Host Responsibilities 

 To return to the issue of Balkanization, three things should now be apparent.  First, in its 

new capital regulations applicable to FBOs, the United States is more a follower of the pattern 

set by the EU than it is an initiator of new kinds of requirements.  Of course, a few foreign banks 

would prefer the old system under which they held relatively little capital in their very extensive 

U.S. operations.  But that was neither safe for the financial system nor particularly fair to their 

competitors--U.S. and foreign--that hold significant amounts of capital here.  Indeed, a firm that 

is genuinely well capitalized, including holding the G-SIB surcharge at its global consolidated 

level, should require only moderate adjustment efforts during the transition period established in 

the FBO rule. 

 Second, there is considerable scope for a foreign bank to integrate its U.S. operations 

with its global activities within the rule the Federal Reserve adopted last month.  For example, 

while foreign firms with more than $10 billion in non-branch assets have some additional 

reporting requirements, only when U.S. non-branch assets rise above $50 billion do the 

quantitative Basel capital requirements become applicable to the U.S. subsidiaries.  Moreover, no 

capital requirements apply to branches so long as their parent is subject to home-country 

consolidated capital rules consistent with Basel standards.  The U.S. operations of FBO branches 

and subsidiaries will not be subject to “due from” restrictions.  They remain free to lend money 

to their worldwide affiliates; they must simply do so with a more stable funding base.  Finally, I 

note that many FBOs, like many U.S.-based banks, have made considerable progress in reducing
