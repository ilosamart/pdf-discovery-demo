households in the panel started the crisis with zero or negative net worth and thus had 

scant resources to fall back on to maintain their standard of living during bouts of 

unemployment.  

Unemployment and declines in wealth obviously can make it difficult for a 

household to pay its debts on time.  The survey update found that lower-income 

households fell behind on their payments at a substantially higher rate than higher-

income households.  Among households with debt, about 11 percent of those with 

incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution fell 60 days or more behind on at 

least one of their obligations in 2009, compared with nearly 3 percent of those in the 

highest tenth of the income distribution.   

 Just as lower-income households weather financial storms with more difficulty, 

the same is true of communities.  Even before the crisis, some neighborhoods, towns, and 

cities were in distress.  Those areas already lacked sufficient assets such as strong public 

schools and community facilities, and rising unemployment and falling tax revenues 

reduced the funds available for public services even as needs increased.  Often, residents 

were disproportionately unbanked or underbanked and relied on expensive alternative 

financial service providers.  In communities with already low housing values--due, for 

instance, to oversupply caused by population shifts--the wave of foreclosures that began 

in 2007 sent the number of vacant properties soaring, causing additional problems. 

 In short, the financial crisis and recession touched many families and 

communities.  But those that were struggling before the crisis were often 

disproportionately affected.
