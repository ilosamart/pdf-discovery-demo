To the extent that the neutral rate remains low relative to its historical value, there 

is a high premium on guiding inflation back up to target so as to retain space to buffer 

adverse shocks with conventional policy.  In this regard, I believe it is important to be 

clear that we would be comfortable with inflation moving modestly above our target for a 

time.  In my view, this is the clear implication of the symmetric language in the 

Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. 

Before concluding, it is worth considering the possible implications of a sustained 

period of low neutral rates and low unemployment for financial imbalances.  Historically, 

extended periods with very low unemployment rates tend to be associated with below-

average spreads of expected returns on risky assets over safe interest rates--low bond risk 

premiums, for example, or low equity premiums.  Although, to some extent, low risk 

premiums and rising asset valuations may be consistent with strong economic 

fundamentals, such as low default rates and strong corporate earnings, there have also 

been episodes when a very strong economy and low unemployment rate have led to 

overvaluation of asset prices, underpricing of risk, and growing financial imbalances.   

Thus, in today’s environment, it is important to be vigilant to the signs that asset 

valuations appear to be elevated, especially in areas such as commercial real estate and 

corporate bonds, as well as the exceptionally low levels of expected volatility.  

Nonetheless, there are few signs of a dangerous buildup of leverage or of maturity 

transformation, which have traditionally been important contributors to financial 

instability.  This is due, in no small measure, to the improvements in capital, liquidity, 

and risk management made by the financial institutions at the core of the system, which
