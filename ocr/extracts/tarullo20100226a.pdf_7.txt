Many legislative proposals would extend the perimeter of regulation so that rules 

designed to promote financial stability would apply to firms that currently are not subject 

to prudential regulation because they do not own a commercial bank.  The legislation 

passed by the House, for example, would subject any firm whose failure could have 

serious systemic consequences to consolidated supervision, including minimum capital 

and liquidity requirements.   

Supervisory oversight is being reoriented in several notable ways.  As I mentioned 

earlier, the crisis revealed the serious shortcomings in the risk-management systems of 

many large firms.  As we found during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program that 

the Federal Reserve led early last year, the risk-management prerequisite of good 

information management was simply lacking at many firms.  Accordingly, we are placing 

increased emphasis on the ability of firms to assess their own capital needs, particularly 

in periods of stress, both to supplement minimum capital requirements and to ensure that 

relevant information on firm risks is readily available to supervisors.   

More fundamentally, the supervisory perspective of the Federal Reserve has been 

refocused by modifying the scope of consolidated supervision and by coordinating much 

more closely the supervision of our largest financial institutions.  In the years preceding 

the crisis, supervision of bank holding companies was principally focused on protecting 

the commercial banks within a holding company.  Too little attention was paid to the 

risks faced, and created, by the entire holding company, including in affiliates principally 

involved in trading and other capital market activities.  Supervisory attention is now 

focused on the risks that may develop anywhere within large holding companies, 

regardless of whether there is an immediate threat to the federally insured bank.
