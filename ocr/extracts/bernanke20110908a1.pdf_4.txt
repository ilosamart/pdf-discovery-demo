second half looks likely to pick up.  However, the incoming data suggest that other, more 

persistent factors also have been holding back the recovery.  Consequently, as noted in its 

statement following the August meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters than it did at the 

time of the June meeting, with greater downside risks to the economic outlook.  

One striking aspect of the recovery is the unusual weakness in household 

spending.  After contracting very sharply during the recession, consumer spending 

expanded moderately through 2010, only to decelerate in the first half of 2011.  The 

temporary factors I mentioned earlier--the rise in commodity prices, which has hurt 

householdsâ€™ purchasing power, and the disruption in manufacturing following the 

Japanese disaster, which reduced auto availability and hence sales--are partial 

explanations for this deceleration.  But households are struggling with other important 

headwinds as well, including the persistently high level of unemployment, slow gains in 

wages for those who remain employed, falling house prices, and debt burdens that remain 

high for many, notwithstanding that households, in the aggregate, have been saving more 

and borrowing less.  Even taking into account the many financial pressures they face,

more upbeat picture.  Manufacturing production has risen nearly 15 percent since its 

trough, driven importantly by growth in exports.  Indeed, the U.S. trade deficit has 

narrowed substantially relative to where it was before the crisis, reflecting in part the
