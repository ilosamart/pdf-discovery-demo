good times believe that certain firms will not be allowed to fail, they will demand 

relatively little compensation for risk, thus weakening market discipline; in addition, 

creditors will not have much incentive to monitor the firms’ risk-taking.  As a result, as 

predicted by principal-agent theory, firms thought to be too big to fail tended to take on 

more risk, as they faced little pressure from investors and expected to receive assistance 

if their bets went bad.  This problem is an example of what economists refer to as moral 

hazard.  The resulting buildup of risk in too-big-to-fail firms increased the likelihood that 

a financial crisis would occur and worsened the crisis when it did occur. 

One response to excessive risk-taking is stronger oversight by regulators, and the 

recent legislation and the rules and procedures being developed by the Federal Reserve 

and other agencies will subject systemically critical firms to tougher regulatory 

requirements and stricter supervision.  The Federal Reserve has also been involved in 

international negotiations to raise the capital and liquidity that banks are required to hold.   

However, the problem of too-big-to-fail can only be eliminated when market participants 

believe authorities’ statements that they will not intervene to prevent failures.  If creditors 

believe that the government will not rescue firms when their bets go bad, then creditors 

will have more-appropriate incentives to price, monitor, and limit the risk-taking of the 

firms to which they lend.  The best way to achieve such credibility is to create 

institutional arrangements under which a failure can be allowed to occur without 

widespread collateral damage; if failures can take place more safely, the authorities will 

no longer have an incentive to try to avoid them.  The financial reform legislation took an 

important step in this direction by creating a resolution regime under which large, 

complex financial firms can be placed in receivership, but which also gives the
