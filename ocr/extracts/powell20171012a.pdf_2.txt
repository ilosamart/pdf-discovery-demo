Thank you for inviting me to speak here at the Institute of International Finance 

Annual Membership meeting.  I am pleased to note that there have been signs lately that 

a sustainable global recovery may finally be materializing.  This is certainly good news, 

although significant risks and uncertainties remain.  One important question is how the 

emerging market economies (EMEs) will fare as global monetary conditions normalize.  

In our intertwined world, prospects for these economies are a significant driver of 

prospects for the United States and other advanced economies.  In my remarks today I 

will argue that, despite the risks and uncertainties, EMEs are likely to manage that 

normalization reasonably well.  

As many observers have noted, EME economic prospects are strongly linked to 

the evolution of capital flows.1  Accordingly, I will first review the recent rebound in 

EME capital inflows and analyze the drivers of this rebound.  Against this backdrop, I 

will then discuss how the prospects for EMEs depend on three factors:  Vulnerabilities in 

the EMEs themselves; the evolution of advanced-economy monetary conditions, 

including those in the United States; and market responses to that evolution.  As always, 

my comments here represent my own views.   

The Rebound in Economic Growth and Capital Flows in Emerging Markets  

After real GDP growth plummeted in many EMEs during the Global Financial 

Crisis (GFC), economic activity rebounded sharply (slide 1).  But that recovery proved to 

be short lived and was followed by a notable, widespread fall in EME growth as 

advanced economies remained sluggish, economic imbalances in China mounted, and 

commodity prices plunged.  Lately, however, the streak of weak growth in the EMEs
