time when real GDP growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment 

continues to fall. The shift from headwinds to tailwinds may be expected to push the 

shorter-run neutral rate above its longer-run trend in the next year or two, just as it fell 

below the longer-run equilibrium rate following the financial crisis.  Notably, the sizable 

fiscal stimulus in the pipeline is likely to continue to bolster the short-run neutral rate 

over the next two years.  The relatively rich level of current asset valuations relative to 

historical levels is another factor that could push the short-run neutral rate above its 

longer-run value.  As was noted in the recent FOMC minutes, corporate credit spreads are 

very narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after 

taking into account the low level of interest rates.12  Business and consumer confidence is 

high, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest. 

The Outlook 

Having provided some context for how we might assess policy, I will turn to 

some observations on the outlook.  By any measure, overall growth in the second quarter 

was strong.  Real GDP increased at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate, a very rapid pace nine 

years into the expansion.  Looking ahead, it seems likely that growth will remain solid.  

Confidence is high, private domestic demand momentum is solid, and recent fiscal 

stimulus will continue to work its way through the economy, at least for the next year or 

so. 

The labor market is also strong.  So far this year, payroll gains have averaged 

more than 200,000 per month, a step-up from the 2017 pace and well above estimates of 

the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  Among prime-age
