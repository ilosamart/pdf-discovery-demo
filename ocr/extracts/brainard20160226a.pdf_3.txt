experienced a rapid drop in unemployment to 5.1 percent, as low as pre-crisis levels, and 

labor force participation has remained relatively strong.  In contrast, unemployment in the 

euro area was 10-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down just 1-3/4 percentage points 

from its recent peak and still well above pre-crisis levels.  Accordingly, market 

participants have expected policy in the United States and the United Kingdom to 

become less accommodative, while remaining very accommodative over the medium 

term in the euro area.3 

In Japan, expectations of monetary policy divergence have reflected Japan’s long 

period of disappointments on its inflation target to a greater extent than its remaining 

resource gap.  Japan’s unemployment rate is 3.3 percent, already below the previous 

cyclical trough, and the International Monetary Fund estimates the output gap to have 

been the same in Japan and the United States in 2015 at 1-1/2 percent.  However, with 

inflation in Japan previously having been near zero for an extended period and inflation 

expectations under pressure, the Bank of Japan’s commitment to increasing inflation 

expectations and moving inflation up to its 2 percent target has led market participants to 

expect extremely accommodative monetary policy to persist for quite a while.   

Currently, however, there are smaller differences among the major economies on 

measures of realized and expected inflation than there are on resource utilization.  In 

2015, the 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in 

the United States was 0.6 percent, while headline inflation in the United Kingdom, euro 

area, and Japan were 0.2 percent.  All inflation rates are well below target.  Of course, to
