the natural rate represents a tight labor market and is associated with upward inflation 

pressure.      

Figure 3 repeats figure 2 but replaces unemployment with labor market slack as 

measured by unemployment minus the CBO’s current estimate of the natural rate of 

unemployment at each point in time.6  Periods of tight labor markets are shaded.  During 

the Great Inflation, inflation generally rose in the tight, shaded periods and fell in the 

unshaded ones, just as conventional Phillips curve reasoning predicts.   

From 1995 to today, the large and persistent swings in the gap between 

unemployment and the natural rate were associated with, at most, a move of a few tenths 

in the inflation rate.  Comparing the shaded and unshaded regions, you might see some 

association between slack and the minor ups and downs in inflation, but the pattern is not 

at all consistent.  It is evidence like this that fuels speculation about the Phillips curve’s 

demise.     

Whether dead, sick, or merely resting, many of the questions about the Phillips 

curve come down to figuring out what changed between these two periods, and why.  Let 

us turn to a conceptual framework for examining these questions more systematically.  

A Simple Framework for Understanding Changes in the Jobs-Inflation Relationship 

A natural starting point is the simplest form of a Phillips curve equation, which 

posits that inflation this year is determined by some combination of current labor market 

                                                 
6 This estimate is the CBO’s current assessment of what the natural rate was at each period in the sample, 
not a measure of the natural rate as perceived in real time.  I discuss the importance of this distinction in 
Powell (2018).
