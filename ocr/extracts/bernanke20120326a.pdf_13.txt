about one-sixth of those already unemployed for more than 27 weeks managed to find a 

job within a month.   

If the recent increase in long-term unemployment were being driven by structural 

factors rather than, say, the severity of the recession, then the job-finding rates of the 

long-term unemployed should have fallen sharply relative to those out of work for only a 

few weeks.  But that’s not what we’re seeing.  Rather, as figure 13 shows, the job finding 

rates of the more recently unemployed and the long-term unemployed all fell over the 

recession in roughly the same proportion, and they remain low.

  This pattern is 

consistent with cyclical factors accounting for the bulk of the recent increase in long-term 

unemployment.  Similarly, the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries 

and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall of aggregate demand rather a worsening 

mismatch of skills and jobs.  Counterexamples like the energy boom in the upper 

Midwest, where there may be some mismatch in the geographic location of suitably 

skilled workers or an overall shortage of potential workers with relevant skills, might best 

be interpreted as the exceptions that prove the rule; a mismatch story would suggest that 

strong labor demand would be appearing in more sectors or geographical areas by now. 

An empirical relationship that economists have long used to interpret 

developments in the labor market is known as the Beveridge curve (figure 14).  That 

curve--named after the British economist William Beveridge--compares unemployment 

(the number of workers looking for employers) to job vacancies (the number of workers 

that employers are seeking).  In good times, when the unemployment rate is low, 

businesses are growing and workers are harder to find, so job vacancies tend to be high.
