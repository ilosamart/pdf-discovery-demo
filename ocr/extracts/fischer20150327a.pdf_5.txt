by banks--with the exception of taking government-insured deposits--a nonbank financial 

institution likely conducts a similar activity.   

In many cases, nonbanks engage in maturity and liquidity transformation and are 

levered, so they have vulnerabilities similar to those of banks, but lack the benefit of 

access to a lender of last resort.  While banks may be more central to the payment system, 

nonbanks are also involved.  Moreover, banks and nonbanks are interconnected in many 

ways--for example, through derivatives, lines of credit, and other services provided by 

banks to nonbanks--and many markets depend on banks that act as dealers or that provide 

other services.  In addition, many nonbanks are owned by bank holding companies, 

which may provide capital and liquidity guarantees to nonbank subsidiaries.  

Not surprisingly, the growth of the nonbank sector has tended to increase the 

complexity of the financial system.  When banks provide loans directly to households and 

businesses, the chain of intermediation is relatively short and simple.  With the growth of 

nonbank lending, intermediation chains have lengthened, often involving both banks and 

other nonbank financial institutions.  For example, in the old days, a bank would 

originate a mortgage and hold it in its portfolio.  Today, a bank might originate the same 

mortgage, but instead of holding that loan on its balance sheet, it could securitize it--in 

effect, sell it--and the resulting security might be purchased with the help of short-term 

funding provided by a money market mutual fund.  And the process might not end there: 

Next that mortgage-backed security might be sold and repackaged into several new 

securities, and so on.  In such examples, the number of institutions that might be involved 

in the provision of a single mortgage credit can easily go from one (the originating bank)
