Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Decisions  

Since the beginning of the year, the FOMC has made several important decisions 

about how it will implement monetary policy and how it will conclude the process of 

normalizing the size of its balance sheet.  These decisions have been made over several 

meetings and have been part of an ongoing process of the Committee’s deliberations.  

Please allow me to summarize them now. 

The FOMC decided at its January meeting to continue to implement monetary 

policy in a regime with an ample supply of reserves—a regime often referred to as a floor 

system.14  Such a system, which has been in place since late 2008, does not require the 

active management of reserves through daily open market operations.  Instead, with an 

ample level of reserves in the banking system, the effective federal funds rate will settle 

at or slightly above the rate of interest paid on excess reserves (IOER).15  This system has 

proven to be an efficient means of controlling the policy rate and effectively transmitting 

the stance of policy to a wide array of other money market instruments and to broader 

financial conditions.  The FOMC continues to view the target range for the federal funds 

rate as its primary means of adjusting and communicating the stance of monetary policy, 

although in doing so, we must and do take into account how our balance sheet size,
