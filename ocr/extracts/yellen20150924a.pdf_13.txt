suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’ 

long-run inflation expectations.20  

To summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported 

goods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longer-

term trend that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations.  As some will 

recognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is 

commonly referred to as an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.21  Total inflation in 

turn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food 

and energy.   

An important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect 

that variations in resource utilization, import prices, and other factors will have on 

inflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long-run inflation 

expectations.  Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation 

consequences of a gradual increase in the level of import prices--perhaps occurring in 

response to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar--that 

causes the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time.22  First, consider the 

                                                 
20 See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013), who make a related point in the context 
of inflation forecasting.  Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level--as opposed to its 
contour--cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE 
price index.   
21 See Tobin (1972) and Friedman (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectations-
augmented Phillips curve.  Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of 
research in economics.  In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian 
framework--in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form 
of adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts--to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003, 
chapter 3, for a textbook treatment).  Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ 
importantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource 
utilization as drivers of inflation dynamics. 
22 In this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization 
induced by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices.
