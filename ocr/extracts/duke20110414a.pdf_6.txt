in starting a business, and personal finances may also be most important in sustaining the

turndown rate was fairly modest--about 12 percent.  Moreover, for those small business 

owners who received credit, more than 90 percent of those surveyed actually received as 

much credit as they had requested.  These results are perhaps surprising given that two of 

the past five years were ones with very tight credit conditions by historical standards, and 

anecdotal evidence suggests that many lines of credit, for businesses and for households, 

were cut during the recent financial crisis.  

Furthermore, small business lending is an important part of overall bank lending, 

especially at community banks.  According to regulatory data, small loans to businesses, 

a proxy for loans to small businesses, constituted 23 percent of total business loans 

outstanding at commercial banks at the end of 2010.5  Over the past several years, this 

share has fluctuated between 22 and 27 percent of banks’ business lending.  In addition, 

at community banks with less than $1 billion in assets, the share is higher--around 66 

percent--whereas at larger banks with more than $10 billion in assets, the share is lower--

16 percent.

business owners are consistent with other survey evidence collected by the National 

Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).  In fact, over the past five years, small
