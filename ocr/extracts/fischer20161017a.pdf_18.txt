then the model’s fiscal policy reaction function is allowed to adjust the tax rate so as to 

return the ratio of federal deficits to GDP to its previous target level.  The government-

debt-to-GDP ratio is therefore allowed to permanently increase. 

Tax cut.  The model’s fiscal policy reaction function is suspended for 10 years, 

similar to the case of the government spending shock described previously.  A sequence 

of shocks to the FRB/US model’s equation for the average federal personal income tax 

rate (TRFP) is constructed such that the resulting decrease in taxes increases the federal 

budget deficit very similarly to the government spending shock described previously, in 

order to make the two simulations of comparable magnitude.  After 10 years, the personal 

federal tax rate is allowed to adjust to bring the ratio of government deficits to GDP back 

to the baseline target level.  The government-debt-to-GDP ratio is permanently increased.
