longer-term loans their customers need.  If funding becomes scarce, banks become less 

willing to extend credit.  To maintain the flow of credit to businesses and consumers, the 

Federal Reserve provides short-term credit to sound depository institutions as needed.  To 

ensure that banks use the facility only as a backup source of funds, Federal Reserve loans 

are usually made at an above-market rate.  

In the Panic of 2008, liquidity needs were not confined to the banking system.

The shadow banking system, made up of investment banks, money market funds, finance 

companies, and investors in a wide range of debt securities, provided a large part of the 

credit that fueled our economy.  When panic set in, it froze lending in banks and 

nonbanks alike and produced funding pressures across a wide range of markets and 

institutions.  The actions taken by the Federal Reserve to fight the crisis were quite 

traditional in the sense that, for years, central banks have been providing liquidity by 

lending to financial intermediaries.  But they were unconventional in that the concepts 

had to be adapted to fit markets and lenders that had never been supported by the Federal 

Reserve before.   

Now, I didn’t live through the banking crises of the distant past or those that 

might have occurred in other countries.  But I can tell you what it was like at the center of 

the most recent crisis.  Funding was drying up for one institution after another and for 

one market after another.  Our efforts to provide liquidity were criticized by some as 

bailouts for the banks.  I can understand how it could seem that way, but I also know that 

every action the Fed took was directed at improving the economy rather than the well-

being of the banks.
