Innovation in digital finance, loosely referred to as fintech, is capturing 

imaginations from Silicon Valley to Chicago to Wall Street.  Weâ€™re seeing a steady 

stream of announcements of new startups and partnerships, and consumers are 

downloading fintech apps at an even faster pace.  

Financial products, services, and transactions lend themselves to successive 

waves of technological disruption because they can readily be represented as streams of 

numerical information ripe for digitization.  However, as technological tools used by the 

industry change over time, it is important to keep sight of their impact on the public, 

whether it be on families seeking to own their own home, seniors seeking financial 

security, young adults seeking to invest in education and training, or small businesses 

attempting to smooth through volatile revenues and expenses.   

Current developments in the digitization of finance are important and deserving of 

serious and sustained engagement on the part of policymakers and regulators.  The 

Federal Reserve Board has established a multi-disciplinary working group that is engaged 

in a 360-degree analysis of fintech innovation.  We are bringing together the best 

thinking across the Federal Reserve System, spanning key areas of responsibility, from 

supervision to community development, from financial stability to payments.  As 

policymakers, we want to facilitate innovation where it has the potential to yield public 

benefit, while ensuring that risks are thoroughly understood and managed.  That 

orientation may have different implications in the arena of consumer and small business 

finance, for instance, as compared with payment, clearing, and settlement in the 

wholesale financial markets. 1
