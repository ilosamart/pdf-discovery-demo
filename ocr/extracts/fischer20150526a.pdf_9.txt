Spillovers to EME asset markets were significantly stronger.  Inflows to EME investment 

funds reversed sharply, EME currencies depreciated, and other asset prices declined.17  

II. Normalization of Monetary Policies 

The cumulative effects over half of a decade of the extraordinary actions by the 

Federal Reserve and other central banks will need to be unwound in the coming years as 

the U.S. and other economies make progress toward economic recovery.  In the 

normalizing of its policy, just as when loosening policy, the Federal Reserve will take 

account of how its actions affect the global economy.   

The taper tantrum episode notwithstanding, most EMEs have generally weathered 

the wind-down of our asset purchases reasonably well so far.  The actual raising of policy 

rates could trigger further bouts of volatility, but my best estimate is that the 

normalization of our policy should prove manageable for the EMEs.  We have done 

everything we can, within the limits of forecast uncertainty, to prepare market 

participants for what lies ahead.   

The Federal Reserve and other central banks are going to great lengths to 

communicate policy intentions and strategies clearly.  Given this, markets should not be 

greatly surprised by either the timing or the pace of normalization.  In fact, it bears 

mentioning that, following the taper tantrum, when the Fed started to taper its purchases, 

there was little reaction from markets.   

                                                 
17 Powell (2013) notes that EMEs with larger current account deficits experienced both greater 
depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields in mid-2013, suggesting that, 
while a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the retrenchment from EME assets, 
investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the reactions.
