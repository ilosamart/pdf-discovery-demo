conditions are stressed.  And countries that offer high prospective returns but have weak 

policy frameworks or other structural vulnerabilities may be particularly sensitive to 

fluctuations in international investment associated with global risk factors.7   

International spillovers from monetary policy have been a contentious issue going 

back at least to the 1920s.  To facilitate the United Kingdom’s return to the gold standard 

at its pre-war parity in 1925, which valued the pound above purchasing power parity, the 

Fed cut interest rates substantially.  Britain’s subsequent departure from gold created 

further challenges for the Federal Reserve; tight U.S. money policy in the wake of the 

exit of the sterling bloc from gold in the fall of 1931 helped keep the United States on 

gold until 1933 but exacted high economic costs on the United States and other countries 

remaining on gold.8  During the Bretton Woods period, overly expansionary U.S. 

monetary policy starting in the second half of the 1960s was exported to trading partners 

through the system of fixed exchange rates.  More than a decade later, the Fed’s 

aggressive tightening under newly appointed Chairman Paul Volcker had unwelcome 

contractionary effects on other economies.  However, the Fed’s success in achieving a 

permanent reduction in inflation through tight monetary policy bolstered the credibility of 

policies focused on achieving low and stable inflation, and many other countries 

followed.

7  Studies using panel data typically have found that country-specific factors help explain cross-sectional 
differences in international investment and capital flows.  See, for example, Furceri, Guichard, and 
Rusticelli (2011); Fratzscher (2012); and Luca and Spatafora (2012).  Avdjiev and Takáts’s (2014) study of 
cross-border bank lending during the taper tantrum shows a larger pullback for countries with weaker 
current account balances, and Sahay and others (2014) find that country-specific market reactions during 
this period also were affected by high inflation, weak growth prospects, and relatively low reserves.
