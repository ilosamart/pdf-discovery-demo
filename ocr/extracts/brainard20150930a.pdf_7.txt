Since large banks are unlikely to become as knowledgeable about local economic 

conditions or as adept at small business relationship lending as community banks, there 

may be some limits to their expansion in this segment of lending. 

Online Alternative Lenders 

In recent years, online alternative lenders have also made inroads into small 

business lending.  There has been a lot of speculation about the effect of this sector on 

traditional banks:  Will it disrupt their activities, broaden their reach, or maybe a little of 

both?   

Focusing specifically on nonbank alternative online lenders or online marketplace 

lenders, it is important to underscore that the online space is highly dynamic, with a 

number of business models emerging and evolving.  I will touch on two business models 

in particular, recognizing that as these business models are tested, it is likely that some 

will prove more successful than others, and that some may adapt in ways that will cause 

us to revise our segmentation of online alternative lending.8  First, online balance sheet 

lenders generally use their own capital to fund small business credit products that are 

originated either directly on their platforms or indirectly through brokers or referral 

                                                 
8 As the industry has evolved, alternative online lenders have increasingly been referred to as marketplace 

lenders, a term that helps emphasize the growing institutional investor base of the sector.  So while peer-to-

peer lenders initially allowed individual borrowers to connect with individual lenders, individual lenders 

increasingly are being replaced by institutional investors who are turning to online marketplace lenders for 

investment opportunities.  Because some balance sheet lenders are now originating small business loans for 

institutional investors to purchase, balance sheet lenders are also often referred to as marketplace lenders. 

In the Treasury Department’s recent Request for Information, they defined online marketplace lending as 

“the segment of the financial services industry that uses investment capital and data-driven online platforms 

to lend either directly or indirectly to small businesses and consumers.” (See U.S. Treasury, 2015, p. 6.)
