without home equity to tap through sale or borrowing and limiting their ability to sell their 

houses to move in order to reduce expenses or find employment.  At the same time, many face 

reduced income, as 9.7 percent of the workforce is unemployed and 5-3/4 percent is working 

only part time while still desiring full-time employment.  Although low interest rates on 

mortgages helped keep mortgage payments relatively low from an historical perspective, 

households remain quite burdened by debt payments.  The household debt service ratio, which 

represents the share of household after-tax income obligated to debt repayment, peaked near 14 

percent in 2007 before dropping off to about 12-1/2 percent recently.  Despite its recent decline, 

this ratio is still above its average of 12 percent over the past 30 years.  Much of this recent drop 

reflects the largest annual decline in aggregate consumer credit outstanding in the nearly 70-year 

history of the series. 

Small Business 

Data that would indicate underlying borrower demand is much harder to find for small 

businesses than it is for consumers.  Nonetheless, a number of indicators suggest that demand for 

credit by small businesses is down.  Over the past two years, the National Federation of 

Independent Business (NFIB) monthly economic trends survey has consistently found that the 

problem reported as being most important by the largest number of small businesses was poor 

sales.  The NFIB survey also shows that, despite a slight improvement in the last couple of 

months, the percentages of firms planning capital expenditures, increasing inventories, or finding 

it a good time to expand facilities are still very low by historical standards.  These findings 

suggest that some potential borrowers are likely on the sidelines waiting for a good reason to 

expand or build inventories.
