servicers’ workforces lack the knowledge and capacity to deal with the immensity of the 

mortgage crisis. 

 In order to do their jobs well servicers need strong internal procedures and 

controls.  Recent events suggest that servicers may be lacking in this regard, to the 

detriment of consumers, and, quite possibly, to the detriment of the investors to whom 

they are contractually obligated to maximize revenue.  I recognize that many servicers 

have stepped up and diligently tried to improve their work; I applaud and encourage 

them.  However, lingering problems remain and I suspect that these may be due to 

deferred maintenance and investment on a significant scale.  In boom times, servicers had 

the luxury of building out relatively lean systems that efficiently processed the more 

routine aspects of the business, but they do not appear to have planned for the 

infrastructure that would be needed during a serious down cycle.  As you know, 

consumers hold the losing end of this stick.   

  More seriously, recurring issues that have dogged some elements of the 

servicing industry go beyond misaligned incentives to simple bad business practices.  

One recurring problem that has triggered litigation involves the servicer’s handling of 

fees.  When a servicer does not properly carry out its primary duty of collecting and 

appropriately allocating mortgage payments, it can cost homeowners money and, in the 

most extreme cases, cause a homeowner to be pushed into premature default.  Some 

servicers obtain unwarranted or unauthorized fees from borrowers after engaging in 

unfair collection practices, or through other conduct that causes borrower default, such as 

misapplied payments, padded costs, erroneous charges, late fees, and so on.
