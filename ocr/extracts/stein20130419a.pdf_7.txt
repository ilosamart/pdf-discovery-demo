message of this research is that capital regulation is important to ensure solvency, but 

once a reliable regime of capital regulation is in place, liquidity problems can be dealt 

with after the fact, via some combination of deposit insurance and use of the LOLR. 

It follows that if one is going to make an argument in favor of adding preventative 

liquidity regulation such as the LCR on top of capital regulation, a central premise must 

be that the use of LOLR capacity in a crisis scenario is socially costly, so that it is an 

explicit objective of policy to economize on its use in such circumstances.  I think this 

premise is a sensible one.9  A key point in this regard--and one that has been reinforced 

by the experience of the past several years--is that the line between illiquidity and 

insolvency is far blurrier in real life than it is sometimes assumed to be in theory.  Indeed, 

one might argue that a bank or broker-dealer that experiences a liquidity crunch must 

have some probability of having solvency problems as well; otherwise, it is hard to see 

why it could not attract short-term funding from the private market. 

This reasoning implies that when the central bank acts as an LOLR in a crisis, it 

necessarily takes on some amount of credit risk.  And if it experiences losses, these losses 

ultimately fall on the shoulders of taxpayers.  Moreover, the use of an LOLR to support 

banks when they get into trouble can lead to moral hazard problems, in the sense that 

banks may be less prudent ex ante.  If it were not for these costs of using LOLR capacity, 

the problem would be trivial, and there would be no need for liquidity regulation:  

Assuming a well-functioning capital-regulation regime, the central bank could always 

avert all fire sales and bank failures ex post, simply by acting as an LOLR. 

                                                                                                                                                 
are solvent and that the loans are adequately collateralized.  See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1999), Lombard 
Street:  A Description of the Money Market (London:  King; reprint, New York:  Wiley). 
9 This is, of course, not to say that the LOLR should not be used in extreme circumstances--only that doing 
so comes with a cost, so policy should seek to reduce the likelihood that it will have to be used.
