desirable qualities of homeownership as an investment, but perhaps have less of the risk.  

Such instruments should be simple and transparent and might include a savings 

commitment component.  Although households will likely need to take on some risk in 

order to accumulate wealth, the risk should not have the potential to destroy a 

household’s financial security.  Continued research in this area is badly needed. 

Looking Forward 

 Looking forward, I unfortunately can envision no quick or easy solutions for the 

problems still afflicting the housing market.  Even once it begins to take hold, recovery in 

the housing market likely will be a long, drawn-out process.  For its part, the Federal 

Reserve will continue to use its policy tools to support the economic recovery and carry 

out its dual mandate to foster maximum employment in the context of price stability.  As 

the economic recovery progresses and potential homebuyers become more confident 

about the durability of the recovery, it seems probable that more families will be willing 

to enter the housing market. 

 The other factors weighing on the housing market--the high share of distressed 

sales, the large inventory of vacant homes, and tight mortgage credit--are not affected as 

directly by macroeconomic policy.  Alleviating these conditions will require a different 

set of responses.  Next I will discuss some Federal Reserve initiatives in these areas, and 

highlight areas in which work still remains to be done. 

 The high share of distressed sales and the large inventory of vacant homes stem, 

in large part, from the elevated levels of foreclosures.  Federal Reserve officials have 

stated time and again over the past several years that we believe that lenders and servicers 

should work actively with troubled borrowers to pursue mortgage modifications
