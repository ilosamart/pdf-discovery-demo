The subsequent efforts to reform our regulatory framework have been focused on 

limiting the reemergence of the vulnerabilities that precipitated and exacerbated the 

crisis.  Changes in bank capital regulation under Basel III have significantly increased 

requirements for loss-absorbing capital at global banking firms--including a surcharge for 

systemically important institutions and a ceiling on leverage.  The Federal Reserveâ€™s 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, process, a descendant of the 

2009 stress test, requires that large financial institutions maintain sufficient capital to 

weather extreme shocks, and that they demonstrate that their internal planning processes 

are effective; in addition, public disclosure of the results facilitates market discipline.  

The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate 

excessive reliance by global banks on short-term wholesale funding and to otherwise 

constrain risks at those banks.  Further steps are under way to toughen the oversight of 

large institutions and to strengthen the financial infrastructure, for example, by requiring 

central clearing with greater transparency for the trading of most standardized 

derivatives. 

 Oversight of the shadow banking system also has been strengthened.  For 

example, the new Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated some nonbank 

firms as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, subject to consolidated 

supervision by the Federal Reserve.  In addition, measures are being undertaken to 

address the potential instability of short-term wholesale funding markets, including 

reforms to money market funds and the triparty repo market.9   

Of course, in a highly integrated global financial system, no country can 

effectively implement the financial reforms I have described in isolation.  The good news
