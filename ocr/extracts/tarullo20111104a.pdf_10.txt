complications when a home jurisdiction places into receivership a firm with significant assets, 

subsidiaries, and contractual arrangements in other countries.  A comprehensive, treaty-like 

instrument for a global bank resolution regime is almost surely not achievable in the foreseeable 

future, and perhaps well beyond that.  But there should be room for more limited cooperation 

agreements, coordinated supervisory work on resolution plans, and other devices to make the 

orderly resolution of a large internationally active firm more feasible. 

Similarly, the limits of even well-conceived liquidity requirements suggest a second item 

that warrants attention in international fora--namely, the problems connected with wholesale 

funding channels over the last several years.  Broadly speaking, threats to financial stability can 

arise in two ways: first, through the rapid deterioration or failure of a large institution with 

leverage sufficient to produce widespread knock-on effects and, second, through the breakdown 

of a significant market in which large numbers of leveraged actors depend upon similar sources 

of liquidity and backup liquidity.  While these two sources of systemic risk can be, and usually 

are, related, the latter has not been the subject of the broad reform agenda directed at the former. 

You will note that the Basel III liquidity standards do not require global banks to reduce 

their usage of wholesale funding; instead, they require a bank that uses more volatile funding 

sources to hold more liquid assets.  This requirement is critical to a sounder financial system, to 

be sure, but it does not address completely the potential instability associated with wholesale 

funding--even in the regulated institutions subject to these requirements, much less in the rest of 

the financial system.  We will need further measures if we are to mitigate the risks of runs seen 

in 2007–2008 and, somewhat less dramatically, more recently.  Because the risk of runs in 

wholesale funding manifests itself in different ways in different countries’ financial systems, the 

appropriate response will likely be a mix of national and international actions, not an
