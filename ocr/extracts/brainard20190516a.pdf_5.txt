persistently below the Federal Reserve’s target and could change their behavior in a way that 

reinforces that expectation.  Expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation 

because wage and price behavior by businesses and households is partly based on expectations of 

future inflation. 

While low inflation and low interest rates have many benefits, the new normal presents a 

challenge for the conventional approach to monetary policy, in which the Federal Reserve could 

rely on changes in the level of the federal funds rate to achieve its inflation and employment 

goals.  In past recessions, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage 

points in order to support household and business spending and hiring.  With the long-run neutral 

rate low and with underlying trend inflation somewhat below target, nominal interest rates are 

likely to remain below those levels, which therefore leaves less room to cut rates as much as 

needed.  With less room to ease financial conditions and support economic activity using our 

conventional policy tool, the economy may endure prolonged periods during and after recessions 

with short-term interest rates pinned at their effective lower bound.  That, of course, was what 

happened following the financial crisis, when the Federal Reserve kept interest rates close to 

zero from December 2008 through November 2015.   

That constraint limits the Federal Reserve’s ability to provide stimulus through its 

conventional tool and thus could tend to leave inflation lower than it would otherwise be, and 

unemployment higher.  The experience of several years with the federal funds rate pinned at its 

effective lower bound and actual inflation below our target could weigh on expectations for 

future inflation and thereby influence the behavior of households and businesses that helps 

determine wages and prices.  The experience of a sustained period of low inflation could depress 

underlying trend inflation by feeding into lower inflation expectations, further reducing nominal
