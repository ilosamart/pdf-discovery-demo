Financial Markets and Monetary Policy—Extracting Signal from Noise 

Because the true model of the economy is unknown, either because the structure 

is unknown or because the parameters of a known structure are evolving, I believe 

policymakers should consult a number and variety of sources of information about 

neutral real interest rates and expected inflation, to name just two key macroeconomic 

variables.  Because macroeconomic models of r* and long-term inflation expectations are 

potentially misspecified, seeking out other sources of information that are not derived 

from the same models can be especially useful.  To be sure, financial market signals are 

inevitably noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much 

about the cyclical or structural position of the economy.12  However, persistent shifts in 

financial market conditions can be informative, and signals derived from financial market 

data—along with surveys of households, firms, and market participants, data, as well as 

outside forecasts—can be an important complement to estimates obtained from 

historically estimated and calibrated macroeconomic models.13  

                                                 
12 Uncertainty regarding r*, u*, and long-term inflation expectations is not the only source of uncertainty 
that has implications for monetary policy.  Edge, Laubach, and Williams (2005) show how the duration of a 
productivity shock can affect even the direction of the best monetary policy response.  Erceg and others 
(2018) find that even in conditions of substantial output gap uncertainty and uncertainty about the slope of 
the Phillips curve, a notable response to the estimated output gap in a Taylor-type rule is generally 
beneficial.  And Eusepi and Preston (2018) show that replacing model-consistent expectations with forms 
of adaptive learning means that some, but not all, of the key results regarding best conduct in monetary 
policy under full information carry through. 
13 Like many others, I believe that monetary policy should respond to financial market fluctuations when 
they have material implications for our outlook for employment and inflation, but monetary policy should 
not generally target asset prices themselves. 
    The Federal Reserve uses survey data and conducts surveys of its own on a range of macroeconomic and 
financial conditions.  Among the surveys the Fed conducts are the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on 
Bank Lending Practices and the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms.  In 
addition, the staff at the Federal Reserve Board uses disaggregated and high-frequency data to estimate the 
state of the economy in real time.  Such data include disaggregated labor market data from ADP and data 
on expenditures from credit card transactions.
