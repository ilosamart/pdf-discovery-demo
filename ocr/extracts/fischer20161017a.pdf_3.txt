more detail on the link between economic growth and interest rates.  One theme that will 

emerge is that depressed long-term growth prospects put sustained downward pressure on 

interest rates.  To the extent that low long-term interest rates tell us that the outlook for 

economic growth is poor, all of us should be very concerned, for--as we all know--

economic growth lies at the heart of our nation’s, and the world’s, future prosperity.  

A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to 

adverse shocks that can put it in a recession.  That is the problem of what used to be 

called the zero lower bound on interest rates.  In light of several countries currently 

operating with negative interest rates, we now refer not to the zero lower bound, but to 

the effective lower bound, a number that is close to zero but negative.  Operating close to 

the effective lower bound limits the room for central banks to combat recessions using 

their conventional interest rate tool--that is, by cutting the policy interest rate.  And while 

unconventional monetary policies--such as asset purchases, balance sheet policies, and 

forward guidance--can provide additional accommodation, it is reasonable to think these 

alternatives are not perfect substitutes for conventional policy.  The limitation on 

monetary policy imposed by low trend interest rates could therefore lead to longer and 

deeper recessions when the economy is hit by negative shocks. 

And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial 

stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it 

harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers.  I should say that while 

this is a reason for concern and bears continual monitoring, the evidence so far does not 

suggest a heightened threat of financial instability in the post-financial-crisis United 

States stemming from ultralow interest rates.  However, I note that a year ago the Fed did
