I would like to thank the conference organizers for the opportunity to offer a few 

remarks on the causes of the 2007-09 financial crisis as well as on the Federal Reserve’s 

policy response.  The topic is a large one, and today I will be able only to lay out some 

basic themes.  In doing so, I will draw from talks and testimonies that I gave during the 

crisis and its aftermath, particularly my testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry 

Commission in September 2010.

  Given the time available, I will focus narrowly on the 

financial crisis and the Federal Reserve’s response in its capacity as liquidity provider of 

last resort, leaving discussions of monetary policy and the aftermath of the crisis to 

another occasion. 

Triggers and Vulnerabilities 

 In its analysis of the crisis, my testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry 

Commission drew the distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities.  The triggers of 

the crisis were the particular events or factors that touched off the events of 2007-09--the 

proximate causes, if you will.  Developments in the market for subprime mortgages were 

a prominent example of a trigger of the crisis.  In contrast, the vulnerabilities were the 

structural, and more fundamental, weaknesses in the financial system and in regulation 

and supervision that served to propagate and amplify the initial shocks.  In the private 

sector, some key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage; excessive dependence 

on unstable short-term funding; deficiencies in risk management in major financial firms; 

and the use of exotic and nontransparent financial instruments that obscured 

concentrations of risk.  In the public sector, my list of vulnerabilities would include gaps 

in the regulatory structure that allowed systemically important firms and markets to
