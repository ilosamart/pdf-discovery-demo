best way of ensuring that monetary policy decisionmakers continue to follow sensible 

and rational policies; and third, it is the best way of informing the private sector of the 

basis on which monetary policy decisions are made and will continue to be made. 

With respect to forward guidance: its role has been and continues to be important 

in the long period in which eventual liftoff has been the key interest rate decision 

confronting the FOMC and the focus of market expectations.  However, as monetary 

policy is normalized, interest rates will sometimes have to be increased, and sometimes 

decreased.  Market participants will be able to form their expectations of future interest 

rates on the basis of three elements: first, the policy record of the FOMC, which might be 

approximated as a reaction function; second, their analysis of the current economic and 

financial situation and outlook; and, third, whatever guidance the FOMC will provide as 

to how it sees monetary policy decisions likely to unfold given the economic situation 

and outlook.  It is likely that explicit long-term forward guidance will play less of a role 

in monetary policy after liftoff than it has during the past few years. 

Policymakers’ behavior is sometimes summarized as a reaction function, which 

can be an algebraic description of how the interest rate is set--for instance, a Taylor-type 

rule in which the federal funds rate reacts simultaneously to the rate of inflation and 

expectations of inflation as well as to the rate of unemployment and expected changes in 

the level of unemployment.21  However, a simple rule of that sort will, by necessity, leave 

out many factors that appropriately influence monetary policy, such as financial 

developments, temporary divergences in relationships between different measures of 

21 Svensson (1997) notes that the reaction function might take the form of a “targeting rule” expressing how 
the policymaker’s target variables are expected to move over time.  Bernanke (2010) discusses the practical 
importance of targeting forecast, as opposed to realized, variables.
