credit because the value of their collateral has dropped.  Businesses that have maintained 

strong cash flows through the recession are particularly concerned about the potential for 

devalued collateral to reduce their credit access and, in some cases, to create an additional 

strain on balance sheets as cash and other assets are required to shore up collateral 

positions that no longer meet underwriting standards.  In addition, small businesses and 

banks alike attribute a significant portion of the tightened credit environment to 

regulatory uncertainty and, in particular, to concern about the classification of assets by 

bank examiners.   

I do not believe it is appropriate or even possible for regulators to urge banks to 

make loans that are outside their risk tolerance or that would be unsafe or unsound.  But 

we can and should be sure that supervisory policies do not impede the flow of credit to all 

eligible borrowers.  Thatâ€™s why the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies have 

worked so hard during the past few years to ensure that while banks appropriately 

recognize loan problems they also can continue to make loans that are safe and sound.  

The financial regulators have issued guidance to provide clarity and consistency 

regarding the supervisory treatment of new loans, problem loans, and different loan 

workout approaches because we understand how important regulatory certainty is to 

bankers, who must make decisions about whether and to whom they should lend.  The 

interagency guidance stressed the importance of continuing to make prudent loans to 

creditworthy customers;1 clarified standards for commercial real estate (CRE) loans and
