responsible, transparent, efficient, and serves the needs of consumers and market 

participants alike.   

 Clearly, the recent mortgage crisis has highlighted the potential ramifications of a 

mortgage market that is not functioning well.  Data do not create the market, but they do 

help us understand what is happening in the market.  HMDA data cannot solve all market 

problems, but the time is ripe for reviewing and revising the data elements, standards, and 

reporting formats. With the benefit of hindsight, we can now answer the question:  Do 

policymakers have adequate and reliable data sufficient to assess market conditions and 

craft policy responses?     

 HMDA has three purposes.  One purpose is to provide the public and government 

officials with data that will help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of 

the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.  A second is to help 

government officials target public investment to promote private investment where it is 

needed.  A third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory 

lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, such as the 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

 Todayâ€™s hearing is intended to serve as a venue to:  discuss whether or not the 

2002 revisions to Regulation C  provided useful and accurate information about the 

mortgage market; gather information that will help assess the need for additional data 

elements or improvements; and identify emerging issues in the mortgage market that may 

require additional research.  As I said earlier, we are also interested in any comments on 

the implementation of the HMDA elements of the regulatory reform legislation.
