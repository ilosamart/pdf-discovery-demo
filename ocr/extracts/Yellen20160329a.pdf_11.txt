bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and 

early 1990s.  Since this time, measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from 

both surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stable, making it easier to keep 

actual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and 

pronounced swings in the unemployment rate.  

Lately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have 

drifted down.  Market-based measures of longer-run inflation compensation have fallen 

markedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly 

from their all-time lows.  Similarly, the measure of longer-run inflation expectations 

reported in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers has drifted down somewhat 

over the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it 

has fluctuated since the late 1990s.   

The shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument that inflation 

expectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive.  Analysis carried out at the Fed 

and elsewhere suggests that the decline in market-based measures of inflation 

compensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premiums and 

liquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations.6  In addition, the longer-

run measure of inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey has historically 

exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, which suggests that 

this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current 

circumstances.7  Moreover, measures of longer-run expected inflation gleaned from

decline over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead.  However, these
