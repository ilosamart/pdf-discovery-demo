Further, the health of the community banking sector has improved significantly 

since the financial crisis.  Over the past decade, the majority of community banks have 

maintained high common equity tier 1 capital levels--consistent with the “well-

continue to remain strong.  That requires bankers and supervisors alike to stay vigilant in 

the management and supervision of risks facing these institutions and the community

concentrations of credit risk, and be mindful that strong lending activity can strain 

liquidity.  For example, concentrations of commercial real estate are rising, and are quite 

high at some banks, prompting us to remind bankers of the difficulties that such 

concentrations presented in the past.

effort to understand the emerging risks related to agricultural lending, the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Kansas City facilitates a National Agricultural Credit meeting 

semiannually.  In late March of this year, the Federal Reserve will be hosting this 

meeting in Washington, D.C.  In April, the Board will meet with the Community 

Depository Institution Advisory Council.  I view meetings like these as important
