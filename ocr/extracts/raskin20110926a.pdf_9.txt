Balance Sheet Operations 

Since late 2008, the FOMC has engaged in two rounds of large-scale asset 

purchases (LSAPs).  The first round of LSAPs involved purchases of about $1.4 trillion 

in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt securities and about 

$300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities; those purchases were executed during 

2009 and the first quarter of 2010.  The second round of LSAPs--often referred to as 

QE2--involved an additional $600 billion in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities 

and was completed at the end of June of this year.   

By purchasing longer-term securities in the open market, the Federal Reserve can 

exert downward pressure on longer-term yields, thereby reducing private borrowing rates 

and raising household wealth.  Consequently, just as with conventional monetary policy, 

LSAPs help boost consumer spending, business investment, and net exports.  And the 

resulting increase in aggregate demand helps generate a stronger pace of job creation.

At last week’s FOMC meeting, the Committee announced that we intend to 

extend the average maturity of our securities holdings over the coming months by selling 

$400 billion of short-term Treasury securities and purchasing an equivalent amount of 

long-term Treasury securities.  This maturity extension program--referred to by some as 

Operation Twist--should exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help 

make broader financial conditions more accommodative, thereby supporting a stronger 

economic recovery.  Indeed, recent work by an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of
