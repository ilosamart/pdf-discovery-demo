More recently, actions by the Administration and the Congress to reduce the budget 

deficit have led to further tightening of federal fiscal policy.   

As I already mentioned, both the tax legislation signed into law in January and the 

sharp spending cuts associated with sequestration will likely significantly hinder GDP 

growth this year.  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that these 

changes in fiscal policy would reduce GDP growth by 1-1/2 percentage points this year 

relative to what we otherwise would have achieved.3  Looking further ahead, fiscal policy 

seems likely to remain restrictive at the federal level.     

The headwinds from the housing sector have eased, and housing market activity is 

likely to continue to contribute to GDP growth over the next few years.  These headwinds 

had been substantial, as the aftermath of the financial crisis and housing bubble left many 

homeowners underwater on their mortgages, a large overhang of vacant homes, and 

mortgage credit very hard to obtain for anyone without an excellent credit record and a 

sizable down payment.  The rise in house prices over the past year or so has lifted 

household net worth and pushed some homeowners above water on their mortgages.  

These developments may help to ease credit for many households as well, although 

mortgage credit remains very tight.     

In a speech last month, I described how the net decline in housing wealth since 

the recession has had particularly acute effects on the balance sheets of lower- and 

middle-income households, which tend to hold a relatively high share of their total wealth 

in their homes.4  Households at the bottom of the income distribution have also had a
