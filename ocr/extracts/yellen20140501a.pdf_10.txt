ensure that the new standard, which is an important component of financial reform efforts, can 

be implemented in a reasonable and practical way for community banks.  We have stressed to 

FASB that its proposal should not require community banks to utilize complex modeling 

processes.  We expect that a final standard will permit loss-estimation techniques that build upon 

current credit-risk management techniques used by community banks.15  We will work with 

community banks to help implement the new standard when it is final.  In addition, our 

supervisory guidance will emphasize that regulatory expectations for implementation of the 

standard will differ based on bank size and complexity.   

 In addition to tailoring our rules, we are also taking steps to tailor and improve our 

examination processes to be more efficient and effective.  For example, we are currently in the 

process of developing and adopting common technology tools across the Federal Reserve System 

that should allow our examiners to more effectively focus their time and enhance the consistency 

of our examination processes nationwide.   

Furthermore, we are exploring ways that our community bank examiners may be able to 

complete more examination work off site.  For example, for banks that have electronic loan files, 

examiners may be able to read these files off site rather than on the bank premises.  We are also 

seeking ways to utilize the financial information that we collect from banks to tailor the 

examination procedures that are used on site, with less work being required at institutions with
