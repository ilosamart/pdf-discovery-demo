The EMV rollout that is taking place right now is a good example. 

The market should be the primary driver of change, and government should avoid

concerns from the public regarding barriers or gaps in regulatory regimes that may create 

disincentives for developing new, safe products.  Policymakers can also bring industry

sit at the drafting table to create a blueprint for a safer and more efficient payment 

system.  

Complacency is everyone’s enemy.  Unfortunately, the firms involved in the 

payment system are not the only ones innovating:  criminals have an ever-increasing 

arsenal of cyberweapons at their disposal.  That brings me to my second point.

You will be attacked.  Criminals today are often motivated, intelligent, well-

organized and well-funded.  They also have varied interests:  some seek financial gain, 

while others hope to disrupt our nation’s financial institutions and payment system.  What 

should we be doing to prepare?  One clear area of focus needs to be on implementing 

preventive tools, or simply put, defensive tactics.  You won’t survive the game if you

The deployment of EMV chip cards in the United States represents an important 

step forward.  But we should not stop there.  For many years, traditional authentication 

methods like signatures and static passwords have been used to verify that an individual
