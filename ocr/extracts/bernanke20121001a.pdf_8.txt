What’s the Relationship between Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy? 
 
 That brings me to the second question:  What’s the relationship between monetary 

policy and fiscal policy?  To answer this question, it may help to begin with the more 

basic question of how monetary and fiscal policy differ.  

In short, monetary policy and fiscal policy involve quite different sets of actors, 

decisions, and tools.  Fiscal policy involves decisions about how much the government 

should spend, how much it should tax, and how much it should borrow.  At the federal 

level, those decisions are made by the Administration and the Congress.  Fiscal policy 

determines the size of the federal budget deficit, which is the difference between federal 

spending and revenues in a year.  Borrowing to finance budget deficits increases the 

government’s total outstanding debt.

the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors and presidents of Federal Reserve Banks.  

Unlike fiscal policy, monetary policy does not involve any taxation, transfer payments, or 

purchases of goods and services.  Instead, as I mentioned, monetary policy mainly 

involves the purchase and sale of securities.  The securities that the Fed purchases in the 

conduct of monetary policy are held in our portfolio and earn interest.  The great bulk of 

these interest earnings is sent to the Treasury, thereby helping reduce the government 

deficit.  In the past three years, the Fed remitted $200 billion to the federal government.  

Ultimately, the securities held by the Fed will mature or will be sold back into the market.  

So the odds are high that the purchase programs that the Fed has undertaken in support of 

the recovery will end up reducing, not increasing, the federal debt, both through the
