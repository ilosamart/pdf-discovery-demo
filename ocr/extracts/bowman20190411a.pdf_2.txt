Today I would like to share a few observations on innovation as it relates to the business 

of community banking. In particular, I will focus on opportunities for community banks to 

innovate through collaboration with fintech firms. I’ll also discuss the role our regulatory 

structure plays in those relationships.1  

Community banks, like just about every other industry, are learning to adapt to a new 

world of rapid innovation and shifting consumer expectations. Consider the personal loan 

market. TransUnion estimates that, about a decade ago, fintech lenders generated less than 1 

percent of personal loans.2 Today, fintech firms originate a larger share of personal loans than 

banks.3 This is not all bad news for banks, though. And we should not simply assume that gains 

by fintech lenders are necessarily at the expense of banks. A large share of fintech lending is 

actually originated by bank partners working with fintech firms. Similarly, the funds that flow 

between a fintech lender and borrowers almost always travel across the payment services of a 

bank. So, while the changes in the market pose potential competitive threats to banks, the 

changes also raise potential new opportunities for banks. This is especially true for community 

banks, which are frequently the banks working most closely with fintech lenders.
