phased-in capital requirements will be meaningfully higher for these institutions because 

of the greater threat their failure would pose to the financial system and to the broader 

economy.  Second, these institutions are for the first time becoming subject to rule-based 

liquidity regulation, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Net Stable Funding 

Ratio, and liquidity stress testing.2  These innovations are in part designed to address the 

firms’ vulnerabilities to damaging runs on their short-term financing, runs that occurred 

repeatedly during the crisis and clearly increased its severity.  Third, we now have 

rigorous, forward-looking capital stress testing that recognizes the dynamic nature of the 

financial system and guards against the excessive optimism that can build during a credit 

boom.   

These three reforms are well advanced and, in my view, have left the G-SIBs far 

stronger than they were before the crisis.  Together, they significantly reduce the 

probability of a large bank failure.  But they would leave us short of meeting the 

overriding objective of eliminating the too-big-to-fail conundrum without a fourth 

reform--a viable resolution mechanism that could handle the failure of these institutions 

without severe damage to the economy.  Until recently, no nation has had a way of 

handling such failures without that degree of damage.   

Authorities around the world have been working to develop an approach to 

resolving large financial firms that credibly imposes losses on shareholders and debt 

holders consistent with the basic tenets of our capitalist system, but does so in a way that 

protects the rest of the financial system and the real economy from severe damage.  The
