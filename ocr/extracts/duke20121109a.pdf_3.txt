these rules will be effective January 1, 2013, forcing them to potentially make changes with little 

preparation.  We have received a large number of comments and want to closely consider each 

issue.  Therefore, the agencies this morning announced that we do not expect that any of the 

proposed rules would become effective on January 1, 2013.3  Further, the agencies offered the 

assurance that institutions will have time for transition once the rules are effective.   

Before the proposals were issued, our staff of economists and analysts conducted 

research to estimate the potential impact of the proposed rules.  Their analysis indicated that the 

vast majority of community banks would already meet the new standards.  Nevertheless, it was 

critically important to hear directly from community banks to better understand how individual 

institutions and their business plans might be affected by the proposals.   

Admittedly, the capital proposals were quite lengthy and in many cases applied only to 

the largest banking organizations.  So, for the first time in a regulatory proposal that I’m aware 

of, short summaries were added to the capital proposals to explain more clearly which aspects 

were likely to affect community banks.  The objective was to spare community bankers from 

having to wade through the many elements of the proposals that would apply almost exclusively 

to the largest institutions, and to encourage them to comment on those elements of the proposals 

most likely to affect their institutions.  Judging from the number of comments we received from 

community banks, I would conclude that the summaries were at least somewhat helpful, and I 

hope that this innovation will become a standard part of large regulatory proposals in the future. 

We expected the summaries to make a difference in the volume and detail of the 

responses we received, but still we weren’t content to just issue the proposals and wait for 

comments.  So the Federal Reserve planned a systematic effort to solicit and understand the
