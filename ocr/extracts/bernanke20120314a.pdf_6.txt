and benefits of new rules.  Supervision is conducted through the Federal Reserve’s 

decentralized structure of 12 regional Reserve Banks, which helps us tailor our 

examinations and supervision to the size, complexity, risk profile, and business model of 

each institution.   

Community bankers tell us repeatedly that they are concerned about the changing 

regulatory environment.  One particular worry is the implementation of the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  It is important to 

emphasize that the Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act largely in response to the “too 

big to fail” problem, and that most of its provisions--regarding, for example, capital, 

liquidity, and risk management--apply only, or principally, to the largest, most complex, 

and internationally active banks.  These new standards are not meant to apply to, and 

clearly would not be appropriate for, community banks.  We will work to maintain a clear 

distinction between community banks and larger institutions in the application of new 

regulations.  

Conclusion 

To conclude, I would like to reemphasize the importance that my colleagues on 

the Board and I place on the Federal Reserve’s relationship with community banks.  The 

Fed is committed to fair, consistent, and informed examinations that take into account the 

size, complexity, and individual circumstances of each bank we oversee.  We will do all 

we can to support the banks’ safety and soundness and eliminate unnecessary costs.  

Despite economic uncertainties, the condition of community banks is improving.  That’s 

good news not only for banks, but for their communities and the national economy as 

well.  Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your meetings.
