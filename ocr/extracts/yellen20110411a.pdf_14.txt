predominant explanation of why the rate of unemployment remains elevated and rates of 

resource utilization more generally are still well below normal levels. 

Commodity Prices and the Real Economy 

As I have indicated, the recent run-up in commodity prices is likely to weigh 

somewhat on consumer spending in coming months because it puts a painful squeeze on 

the pocketbooks of American households.5  In particular, higher oil prices lower 

American income overall because the United States is a major oil importer and hence 

much of the proceeds are transferred abroad.  Monetary policy cannot directly alter this 

transfer of income abroad, which primarily reflects a change in relative prices driven by 

global demand and supply balances, not conditions in the United States.  Thus, an 

increase in the price of crude oil acts like a tax on U.S. households, and like other taxes, 

tends to have a dampening effect on consumer spending.6   

The surge in commodity prices may also dampen business spending.  Higher food 

and energy prices should boost investment in agriculture, drilling, and mining but are 

likely to weigh on investment spending by firms in other sectors.  Assuming these firms 

are unable to fully pass through higher input costs into prices, they will experience some 

compression in their profit margins, at least in the short run, thereby causing a decline in 

the marginal return on investment in most forms of equipment and structures.7  

Moreover, to the extent that higher oil prices are associated with greater uncertainty about 

the economic outlook, businesses may decide to put off key investment decisions until 

                                                 
5 It should be noted that commodity price increases do boost the incomes of commodity producers.  For 
example, the recent surge in food prices has generally boosted the incomes of farmers and others with ties 
to the agricultural sector. 
6 Staff analysis at the Federal Reserve Board indicates that a dollar increase in retail gasoline prices--a little 
more than has occurred over the last year--reduces real household disposable income by nearly 1 percent 
and hence tends to exert a significant drag on consumer spending. 
7 Increased investment in energy-conserving technologies would likely provide a partial offset to the 
various factors damping capital spending outside the commodity-producing sectors.
