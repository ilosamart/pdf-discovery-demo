I would like to thank the event organizers for inviting me to participate in this 

year’s Community Banking Research and Policy Conference.  Supporting the health and 

vitality of America’s community banks is an important priority for me.  Community 

banks have long been a central provider of finance to Main Street America.  Despite the 

challenging environment of the past several years, community banks have continued to 

play a significant role in a number of key market segments.   

Today I want to focus on one of the most important of those segments--the 

provision of credit to small businesses--and to explore how the traditional role of 

community banks may be affected by the growing role of online lenders.  Some view the 

growth of online platforms as a challenge to community banks in their traditional core 

businesses.  But it is also possible that the very different strengths of community banks 

and online lenders could lead to complementarity and collaboration in the provision of 

credit to small business while recognizing there are important risks that must be managed 

by banks and borrowers.  By working together, lenders, borrowers, and regulators can 

help support an outcome whereby credit channels are strengthened and the possible risks 

are being proactively managed. 

Small Businesses, Small Business Credit, and the U.S. Economy 

Small businesses make up a large and vitally important segment of the U.S. 

economy.  And their vitality hinges centrally on their access to credit. 

More than three-fourths of American businesses have fewer than 10 employees 

and another nearly one-fourth have between 10 and 500 employees.1  In addition to
