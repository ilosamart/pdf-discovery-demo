  As illustrated, quite literally, by a chart that New York Fed staff produced a few years 

ago, the term “shadow banking system” encompasses a wide variety of institutions that engage in 

credit intermediation and maturity transformation outside the insured depository system.1  In my 

remarks today, I want to concentrate on short-term wholesale funding and, especially, the pre-

crisis explosion in the creation of assets that were thought to be “cash equivalents.”  Such assets 

were held by a range of highly risk-averse investors, who were in many cases not fully cognizant 

that the “cash equivalents” in their portfolios were liabilities of shadow banks--the institutions 

depicted in the memorable graphic.   

In some cases, the perception of claims on shadow banks as cash equivalents was based 

on explicit or implicit promises by regulated institutions to provide liquidity and credit support to 

such entities.  In other cases, the perception came about because market participants viewed the 

instruments held on the balance sheets of shadow banking entities--notably highly rated, asset-

backed securities--as liquid and safe.  While reliance on private mechanisms to create seemingly 

riskless assets was sustainable in relatively calm years, the stress that marked the onset of the 

financial crisis reminded investors that claims on the shadow banking system could pose far 

more risk than deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Once 

reminded of their potential exposure, investors engaged in broad-based and sometimes disorderly 

flight from the shadow banking system.   

This experience of the run on the shadow banking system that occurred in 2007 and 2008 

reminds us that similar disorderly flights of uninsured deposits from banks lay at the heart of the 

financial panics that afflicted the nation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The
