rate target a few times a year until, by the end of 2019, it is close to our estimate of its 

longer-run neutral rate of 3 percent. 

The term “neutral rate” requires some explaining.  It is the rate that, once the 

economy has reached our objectives, will keep the economy on an even keel.  It is neither 

pressing on the gas pedal to make the car go faster nor easing off so much that the car 

slows down.  Right now our foot is still pressing on the gas pedal, though, as I noted, we 

have eased back a bit.  Our foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make 

sure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an unexpected shock, 

given that we don’t have much room to cut interest rates.  In addition, inflation is still 

running below our 2 percent objective, and, by some measures, there may still be some 

room for progress in the job market.  For instance, wage growth has only recently begun 

to pick up and remains fairly low.  A broader measure of unemployment isn’t quite back 

to its pre-recession level.  It includes people who would like a job but have been too 

discouraged to look for one and people who are working part time but would rather work 

full time. 

Nevertheless, as the economy approaches our objectives, it makes sense to 

gradually reduce the level of monetary policy support.  Changes in monetary policy take 

time to work their way into the economy.  Waiting too long to begin moving toward the 

neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial 

instability, or both.  In that scenario, we could be forced to raise interest rates rapidly, 

which in turn could push the economy into a new recession. 

The factors I have just discussed are the usual sort that central bankers consider as 

economies move through a recovery.  But a longer-term trend--slow productivity
