Conclusion 

In conclusion, I believe that both forward guidance and large-scale asset 

purchases have been effective tools for providing additional monetary accommodation 

under circumstances in which conventional monetary policy has been constrained by the 

zero lower bound on the federal funds rate.  My colleagues on the FOMC and I are  

regularly reviewing the asset purchase program in light of incoming information, and we 

will adjust the program as needed to promote our statutory mandate of maximum 

employment and stable prices.  Recognizing the importance of market expectations to the 

effectiveness of unconventional policies, the Committee will continue to seek ways to 

enhance the clarity and effectiveness of our monetary policy communications.
