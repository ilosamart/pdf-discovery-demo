just a fact of life that we are likely to be in a low-rate environment for a considerable 

period of time, in light of the economic outlook.  It is not a choice at the margin.  While 

we are going to have to pay careful attention to the attendant financial stability issues and 

be prepared to intervene with supervisory and regulatory tools as needed, I would find it 

hard to accept the proposition that we should preemptively resolve them by, say, starting 

to raise the federal funds rate today.  The potential damage that could be caused by 

choking off the recovery is too great. 

Second, one can argue that, by reducing term premiums, LSAPs in particular have 

potentially significant benefits in terms of financial stability.  A major source of problems 

during the recent crisis was the excessive maturity transformation undertaken by financial 

firms.  Put simply, these firms were relying too much on short-term debt.  One of the 

thrusts of regulatory reform has been to attack this problem--for example, via the 

constructs of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio that are a 

part of Basel III.  However, a complementary way to deal with the problem is to 

influence the underlying incentives for short-term debt issuance.  And these incentives 

are in turn shaped by the structure of rates and term premiums in the market.   

As I noted earlier, a natural response for any firm facing an unusually low term 

premium is to adjust its capital structure by issuing cheap long-term debt to replace its 

shorter-term debt.  It is therefore not surprising that the average debt maturity of large 

nonfinancial firms has increased notably over the past few years.  Moreover, the same 

pattern shows up among large financial firms--they too have been significantly 

lengthening their average debt maturity.20
