This widening inequality has been described as the result of a broader trend 

toward “occupational polarization.”4  This theory posits that the diffusion of computer-

related technologies, the related automation of routine work, and an increased capability 

for firms to move their activities offshore have combined to concentrate job creation in 

the poles of either high-skill, high-wage employment or low-skill, low-wage work.  The 

high-skill occupations increasingly require at least a bachelor’s degree.  Demand has 

shifted away from traditional middle-class occupations.  The kinds of workers who would 

have been employed in a traditional manufacturing or administrative job now often end 

up in lower-paying jobs. 

Younger workers have historically filled many of the lower-paying service-sector 

jobs that are now more likely to be taken by less-educated adults.  Thus, occupational 

polarization may be responsible for some of the rapid decline in employment and labor 

force participation among young people over the past decade.  While part of this decline 

is likely attributable to the pursuit of additional education, employment and participation 

rates have also fallen for those youth who are not attending school, suggesting that 

education-related explanations are not the whole story.  Indeed, research by the Federal 

Reserve Board’s staff has found that greater crowding-out from adults can account for 

much of the decline in youth participation.5  This crowding-out may have undesirable 

long-term consequences for the current generation of younger adults, as some research
