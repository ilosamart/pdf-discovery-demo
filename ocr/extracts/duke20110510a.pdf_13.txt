There are jobs available in the Washington, D.C., market, but mostly high-skilled jobs for 

which low-income residents are unqualified.”  As with the San Francisco survey, the 

results from this tool provide useful data for Richmond policymakers and District 

stakeholders. 

Virtual Collaboration 

The growth in survey and other tools is intended to expand the Federal Reserve’s 

outreach efforts and to ensure that we are responsive to the entire population.  As we 

continue to improve the tools we use, we hope to continue to engage each of you in the 

conversation. 

In the past, collaboration often required outlays of scarce time and financial 

resources to attend face-to-face meetings.  We are increasingly exploring ways to use 

technology to effectively expand our reach.  For example, the System is using live web-

streaming to share key conferences through a YouTube channel as well as sharing 

information through webinars.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has 

introduced a series of podcasts with information on topics from foreclosure responses to 

perspectives on real estate.12  Finally, as noted earlier, the Board just released three video 

reports about strategies for addressing REO and vacant properties.13  If I have sparked 

your interest, I hope you will visit the Board’s website to watch the videos.   

Conclusion 

It is clear that it will take all of us working together to solve the problems that 

face communities today.  Collaboration among government, nonprofits, and our partners
