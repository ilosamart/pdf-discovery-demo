counterparties.  The authors posit that banks deal with this uncertainty by appealing to the 

“maximin principle”:  Each seeks to maximize profits under the assumption that the 

network is configured in the worst possible manner from its own perspective.  Because 

each behaves as though the network structure is “stacked against it,” when banks learn of 

an adverse liquidity shock, each tends to sell more of its illiquid assets and withdraw 

more funding from its counterparties than it would if it had access to complete 

information about the structure of interbank credit relationships.  As in Shin’s model, this 

excessive deleveraging can create a vicious cycle, magnifying the effects of the initial 

shock. 

The four models we’ve discussed thus far are aimed at exploring general features 

of financial networks.  As such, they are necessarily somewhat abstract.  With a few 

narrow exceptions, they treat all market participants as similar in size and in range of 

activities, and they use relatively simplistic network structures.  In the past few years, 

research on financial networks has moved beyond stylized models of interbank 

relationships to examine the propagation of shocks in more-realistic settings.  Recent 

research by Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia and by Cont, Moussa, and Santos examines how 

shocks propagate in network structures in which some banks are larger and more 

interconnected than others.

Using numerical simulations, Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia show that, in 

concentrated networks, contagion occurs less frequently and is less severe for low 

degrees of network connectivity.  Contagion is significantly more likely at higher levels 

of connectivity.  In a concentrated financial network with a few key players, and when 

liquidity shocks are targeted at the most connected institutions, distress at highly
