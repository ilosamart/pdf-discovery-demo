remains stubbornly depressed.3  Nonetheless, recent data on claims have shown some 

softening, and I will be watching a broad set of labor market indicators carefully, 

including the payrolls data for February, which will be released tomorrow. 

Just as the economy is performing well on the maximum-employment goal set by 

the Congress, it is also close to meeting our price-stability mandate.  Following many 

years of low readings, the core price index for consumer purchases for the 12 months 

through December was up 1.9 percent.4  That reading lines up with the median Summary 

of Economic Projections (SEP) forecast from a year ago.  So inflation is very close to the 

Committee’s 2 percent objective and its earlier expectation.   

Even so, we will need to be vigilant to ensure inflation achieves 2 percent on a 

sustained basis.  As I have observed for some time, underlying trend inflation may be 

running slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Many statistical filtering 

models put underlying inflation modestly below 2 percent, and some survey measures of 

inflation expectations are running somewhat below pre-crisis levels.  Similarly, the 

difference between the yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities is 

lower than it was before the crisis, and that difference may provide some insight into 

market participants’ views of underlying inflation.5   

The fact that estimates of underlying trend inflation remain a bit on the soft side 

reinforces the evidence that the Phillips curve is very flat, a key element of the post-crisis 

                                                 
3 For the share of overall income going to workers, see, for instance, data on the labor share in the nonfarm 
business sector--available from the FRED database on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at 
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173--and Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017). 
4 I focus on the core measure because food and energy prices are volatile, and total inflation has generally 
fluctuated around core inflation.  The alternative Dallas trimmed mean measure tells a similar story. 
5 Brainard (2017) provides more details on these factors.
