Thank you to my colleague Pat Harker for the invitation to join him here this 

evening.  In my time at the Federal Reserve, I have found that hearing directly from 

people around the country about how their communities are experiencing the economy is 

vital to carrying out my responsibilities.  It helps me to understand what is working well 

and what the challenges are, and it provides ideas on how to improve economic 

opportunities.  Today I look forward to hearing your perspective on the economy and the 

banking business in and around Scranton.   

Before hearing from you, I was asked to provide my perspective on the national 

economy.  Recent data suggest the economy is growing solidly.  Consumer spending is 

robust, buoyed by the strong labor market and continued strong confidence.  Last week’s 

strong jobs report provided reassurance that employment has continued to expand at a 

healthy pace.  Payrolls have risen at a 170,000 monthly pace over the past three 

months—more than enough to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.  The 

unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, wages are growing at a moderate pace, 

the percentage of prime-age adults who are employed is close to its pre-crisis peak, and 

claims have been hovering around historic lows.  Furthermore, financial conditions 

overall remain quite supportive of continued employment and output growth. 

By contrast, capital spending by businesses has been lackluster, and indicators of 

business sentiment have been soft.  The recent G-20 summit provided a constructive 

change in tone about trade discussions, but business sentiment and investment plans will 

likely remain sensitive to uncertainty around trade and the global outlook.  Fiscal policy 

is also a source of uncertainty, with both the debt ceiling and the federal budget needing 

to be resolved.
