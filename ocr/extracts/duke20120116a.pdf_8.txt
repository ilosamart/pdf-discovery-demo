helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long-term Treasury rates, which 

had widened during the financial crisis.   

Reducing longer-term rates influences the economy in much the same way as 

lowering the expected path of short-term rates.  For instance, the decline in longer-term 

rates lowers the cost and increases the availability of capital and credit, which in turn 

encourages business expansion.  In the most recent episode, another important result of 

lower rates has been a reduction in debt service burdens from existing debt.  Households 

in particular have significantly reduced mortgage payments through refinancing.  And 

when I see the small business owners that I used to lend to, they tell me that they could 

not have survived the downturn without low rates.   

Monetary policy decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC).  While all 12 Reserve Bank presidents and all members of the Board of 

Governors participate in FOMC discussions, the voting members of the FOMC are made 

up of the members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank 

of New York, and four of the remaining presidents on a rotating basis.

In normal times, monetary policy is implemented through the purchase or sale of 

securities, which affects the supply of bank reserves and so has an effect on short-term 

interest rates.  But monetary policy also works by influencing expectations of future 

short-term interest rates and thereby affecting longer-term rates and asset prices.  Central 

bank communications can help individuals, businesses, and investors formulate their 

expectations for interest rates and inflation in the future and thus influence their actions 

today.  Recognizing the importance of communications as a policy tool, the FOMC has
