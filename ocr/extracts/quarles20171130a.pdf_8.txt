their balance sheets may be in question.  Moreover, this inability to meet the demand for extra 

liquidity can have spillover effects to other areas of the financial system.   

Earlier in our history, the United States frequently witnessed bank runs that severely 

disrupted financial and economic activity, an example of what can happen when people lose faith 

in a payment system.  In response, Congress ultimately introduced both a central bank and 

deposit insurance programs to help regulate fluctuations in the supply of liquidity in order to

clear how a private digital currency at the center of a large-scale payment system would behave, 

or whether the payment system would be able to function, in times of stress. 

Central-Bank-Issued Digital Currency   

Given that privately developed digital currencies may raise important financial stability

their own digital currency as a 21st century analogue to paper currency.  I would urge caution, 

particularly for countries like the United States with highly developed banking systems and 

ongoing robust demand for physical cash. 

As a practical matter, I believe that consideration of a central-bank-issued digital 

currency to the general public would require extensive reviews and consultations about legal

be the subject of serious cyberattacks and could be widely used in money laundering and terrorist 

financing.  The effect of all this would significantly divert our focus from work to improve or 

establish new private-sector retail payment systems based on existing institutions.  The prospect
