aimed for a more complete term structure in order to protect against maturity mismatches within 

and beyond the one-year mark, and to create stronger incentives for firms to extend the maturity 

of their funding arrangements.   

 Considerable attention was paid to these and other concerns during the consultative and 

deliberative processes in the Basel Committee.  As I mentioned earlier, the seriousness with 

which central bankers and regulatory agencies took these concerns is evidenced by the fact that 

the NSFR was subject to considerable revision over the last four years.  I anticipate we will hear 

similar, and perhaps additional concerns, from a variety of perspectives when the federal banking 

agencies issue a proposed rule next year to implement the NSFR in the United States.  This 

process should result in a regulation that reduces the probability of banks coming under short-

term funding pressures.  Maintaining more stable funding, such as retail deposits and term 

funding with maturities of greater than six months, will help avoid the spiral of fire sales of 

illiquid assets that deplete capital and exacerbate market stress. 

Unlike the LCR--and the originally finalized version of the Basel NSFR--the newly 

finalized NSFR also begins to address the risks associated with matched books of securities 

financing transactions.  On its face, a perfectly matched book might seem to pose little risk to the 

firm, since it could run off assets as it lost funding.  In reality, however, a firm may be reluctant 

to proceed in so symmetrical a fashion.  In such a context, “running off assets” may mean 

denying needed funding to clients with which the firm has a valuable relationship.  Moreover, 

even if the firm does run off assets, a firm with a large matched book will almost surely be 

creating liquidity squeezes for these other market actors.  To partially address these risks, the 

NSFR will require firms to hold some stable funding against short-term loans to financial firms.
