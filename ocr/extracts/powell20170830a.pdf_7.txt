level of granularity that is more appropriate for management to remediate, with board oversight.  

The new proposed framework is designed to make boards more effective in holding management 

accountable in these efforts.  While we have proposed that most MRAs and MRIAs be addressed 

in the first instance to management and not to the board, the board would continue to receive 

MRAs where board practices are at issue or where management has failed to promptly and 

adequately take the required actions.  The board would also continue to receive copies of 

examination and inspection reports, including formal communications with the institution.  In the 

parlance of the proposed guidance I just outlined, we fully expect the board to actively manage 

the information flow related to MRAs and to hold management accountable for remediating 

them.  In doing so, a board may choose to track progress and closure of MRAs through an 

appropriate board committee, rather than getting into the granular detail on every individual 

MRA.   

Conclusion 

 We need financial institutions that are strong enough to support economic growth by 

lending through the economic cycle.  To achieve that goal, we need strong and effective boards 

of directors at firms of all sizes.  A strong and effective board provides strategic leadership and 

oversight, which is much more challenging and important than checking off lists of assigned 

tasks.  I look forward to our continuing dialogue on this subject today and in the months to come, 

and reviewing carefully the comments received on the proposal.
