try to maximize their own compensation, given the rules of the game.  Sometimes they 

discover vulnerabilities in these rules, which they then exploit in a way that is not optimal 

from the perspective of their own organizations or society.  If the damage caused is 

significant enough, the rules themselves adapt, driven either by internal governance or by 

political and regulatory forces.  Still, it is possible that at different times in this process, 

the rules do a better or worse job of managing the incentives of the agents. 

To be more specific, a fundamental challenge in delegated investment 

management is that many quantitative rules are vulnerable to agents who act to boost 

measured returns by selling insurance against unlikely events--that is, by writing deep 

out-of-the-money puts.  An example is that if you hire an agent to manage your equity 

portfolio, and compensate the agent based on performance relative to the S&P 500, the 

agent can beat the benchmark simply by holding the S&P 500 and stealthily writing puts 

against it, since this put-writing both raises the mean and lowers the measured variance 

of the portfolio.

  Of course, put-writing also introduces low-probability risks that may 

make you, as the end investor, worse off, but if your measurement system doesnâ€™t capture 

these risks adequately--which is often difficult to do unless one knows what to look for--

then the put-writing strategy will create the appearance of outperformance.   

Since credit risk by its nature involves an element of put-writing, it is always 

going to be challenging in an agency context, especially to the extent that the risks 

associated with the put-writing can be structured to partially evade the relevant 

measurement scheme.  Think of the AAA-rated tranche of a subprime collateralized debt 

obligation (CDO), where the measurement scheme is the credit risk model used by the

 Jurek and Stafford (2012) argue that implicit put-writing of this sort accounts for much of the apparent 

measured alpha in hedge funds.
