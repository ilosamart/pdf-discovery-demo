within an organizational structure and with an institutional culture and set of values.  I am 

very proud of my colleagues at the Fed for the hard work and creativity they have 

brought to bear in addressing the financial and economic crisis, and I think we and they 

have been well served by a culture that emphasizes objective, expert analysis; 

professionalism; dedication; and independence from political influence.  Whatever the 

Fed may have achieved in recent years reflects the efforts of many people who are 

committed, individually and collectively, to pursuing the public interest.  Although the 

Fed undoubtedly will face some difficult challenges in the years ahead, our people and 

our values make me confident that our institution will meet those challenges successfully.
