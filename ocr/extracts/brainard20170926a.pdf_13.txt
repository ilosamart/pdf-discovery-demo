At least some of these explanations potentially relate to the growing divide 

between large metro areas and other areas of the country.  As noted earlier, the opioid 

epidemic appears to be particularly acute in smaller cities and rural areas.  In addition, 

employment in non-metro areas tends to be more concentrated in manufacturing, which is 

the sector that has experienced the largest decline in employment from automation and 

globalization.29  Similarly, research suggests that workers in less populous areas have 

been more likely to be directly affected by increased import competition from China due 

to the geographical distribution of industries.30  And for many less populous areas, job 

opportunities are less diverse than in bigger cities, so that when a plant shuts down, there 

are fewer local alternative job opportunities for unemployed workers, especially with 

comparable levels of employment security or benefits.   

These striking results naturally raise the question of whether we are seeing 

heightened migration from the less populous areas to the larger metros with greater 

economic opportunity.  A conventional assumption in economics is that regional 

differences should narrow over time as workers move toward areas where jobs are more 

plentiful and wages are higher.31  In reality, Americans’ propensity to move is currently 

at its lowest level in many decades.  In 2016, the fraction of the population that had 

moved within the United States in the past year was 11 percent, down from 17 percent or 

more in the early 1980s, with the steepest decline in the fraction of people moving longer 

distances, across county or state lines.32  The evidence suggests that the decline in
