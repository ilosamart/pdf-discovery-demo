 Among the most serious and most insidious barriers to competition in financial 

services is the too-big-to-fail problem.  Like all of you, I remember well the frightening 

weeks in the fall of 2008, when the failure or near-failure of several large, complex, and 

interconnected firms shook the financial markets and our economy to their foundations.  

Extraordinary efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC), and other agencies, together with similar actions by our counterparts 

in other countries, narrowly averted a global financial collapse.  Even with those 

extraordinary actions, the economic costs of the crisis have been very severe; but I have 

little doubt that, had the global financial system disintegrated, the effects on asset values, 

credit availability, and confidence would have resulted in a far deeper and longer-lasting 

economic contraction.  It is unconscionable that the fate of the world economy should be 

so closely tied to the fortunes of a relatively small number of giant financial firms.  If we 

achieve nothing else in the wake of the crisis, we must ensure that we never again face 

such a situation. 

 The costs to all of us of having firms deemed too big to fail were stunningly 

evident during the days in which the financial system teetered near collapse.  But the 

existence of too-big-to-fail firms also imposes heavy costs on our financial system even

or interconnected, or systemically critical for the authorities to permit its failure, its 

creditors and counterparties have less incentive to evaluate the quality of the firmâ€™s 

business model, its management, and its risk-taking behavior.  As a result, such firms 

face limited market discipline, allowing them to obtain funding on better terms than the
