over the course of several exercises and was made possible by the extensive collection of data 

from the banks.  These data have allowed supervisors to build models that are more sensitive to 

stress scenarios and better define the riskiness of the firms’ different businesses and exposures.   

The second innovation since the SCAP was the use of the supervisory stress test as a key 

input into the annual supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy at the largest bank holding 

companies.  The crisis demonstrated the importance of forward-looking supervision that 

accounted for the possibility of negative outcomes.  By focusing on forward-looking post-stress 

capital ratios, stress testing provides an assessment of a firm’s capital adequacy that is 

complementary to regulatory capital ratios, which reflect the firm’s performance to date.  

Although we view this new approach to capital assessment as a significant improvement over 

previous practices, we are aware that the true test of this new regime will come only if another 

period of significant financial or economic stress were to materialize--which is to say that we 

will not have a strong test of the effectiveness of stress testing until the stress tests undergo a real 

world stress test.  The same comment, mutatis mutandis, applies to the overall changes in 

methods of bank regulation and supervision made since September 15, 2008. 

Third, supervisory stress testing has been on the leading edge of a movement toward 

greater supervisory transparency.  Since the SCAP, the Fed has steadily increased the 

transparency around its stress testing processes, methodologies, and results.  Before the crisis, 

releasing unfavorable supervisory information about particular firms was unthinkable--for fear of 

setting off runs on banks.  However, the release of the SCAP results helped to calm markets 

during the crisis by reducing uncertainty about firm solvency.  Indeed, only one of the 10 firms 

deemed to have a capital shortfall was unable to close the identified gap on the private markets.  

Our experience to date has been that transparency around the stress testing exercise improves the
