aftermath of the most recent crisis, an increase in consumer caution, along with a 

tightening of credit conditions, helped boost saving, leading to a necessary deleveraging 

of households, but at the expense of consumption growth.  As I mentioned earlier, 

investment has also been noticeably weak in recent years, likely reflecting increased 

restraint on the part of businesses unsure of the outlook for demand and their profits.     

Another factor holding back U.S. growth has been repeated shocks to the global 

economy, sometimes amplified by vulnerabilities growing out of the crisis.  The effects 

of a number of these shocks have spilled over to the United States, including those 

stemming from the euro-area debt crisis as well as occasional concerns about the strength 

and durability of emerging market growth, especially in China.  These foreign 

developments contributed to a 15 percent appreciation of the broad dollar since mid-

2014, which, along with weak foreign economic activity, weighed on U.S. export growth.  

Concern over the strength of foreign demand also contributed to a steep decline in the 

price of oil at around the same time.  Historically, lower oil prices have been a positive 

for U.S. growth, but the tremendous rise in domestic shale oil production over the past 

decade has created a powerful counterweight that has offset some of the benefit of lower 

prices.  In the immediate aftermath of the decline in oil prices, investment in the energy 

sector fell off precipitously, pushing down aggregate investment as well. 

Regarding structural explanations for slow growth, demographics are likely 

playing a role.  In a development that predates the crisis, relatively flat labor input, as 

measured by hours worked, has weighed on growth.  In part, the sluggishness of labor 

input just reflects long-term demographic trends as baby boomers age and retire.5
