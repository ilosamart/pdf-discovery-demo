institutions operating in the United States.  Moreover, in light of provisions in Gramm-Leach-

Bliley that permitted a foreign bank to be a financial holding company (FHC), the Federal 

Reserve announced in 2001 that a bank holding company (BHC) in the United States that was 

owned and controlled by a well-capitalized and well-managed foreign bank generally would not 

be required to meet the Board’s capital requirements normally applicable to BHCs.

My second example relates to the massive fraud uncovered at the Bank of Credit and 

Commerce International (BCCI) and its subsequent collapse in 1991, which highlighted the need 

for more effective supervision of banks operating in multiple countries.  The Foreign Bank 

Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991 (FBSEA) required foreign banks to receive approval from 

the Board before establishing a branch or agency in the United States.

  The law required the 

Federal Reserve, in turn, to determine that the foreign bank is subject to “comprehensive 

supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis” in its home country before approving an 

application either to open a branch or to acquire a U.S. subsidiary bank.   

It is further worth noting that changes in U.S. law and regulatory practice affecting 

foreign banking organizations have often corresponded to changes in international regulatory 

agreements.  For example, FBSEA was enacted at the same time as the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision was working to address the problems revealed by BCCI--an effort that bore 

fruit the next year in changes to the so-called Basel Concordat, which established minimum 

standards for the supervision of international banking groups.
