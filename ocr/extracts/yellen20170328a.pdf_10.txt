focus on first-time work experiences, and Somerville is now seeking to expand the

My second observation is that career and technical education (CTE) programs, 

which have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential.  For some time, 

vocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it 

was associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that 

denied them the opportunity for the best education.  But more recently, CTE has been 

refined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers 

gain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires 

technical proficiency.  These programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields 

such as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and 

financial services.   

This point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE 

programs and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and 

training to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training 

process.  WorkAdvance, a regional sector-specific program, is a good example.  It 

delivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for 

unemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities.22  An evaluation of the program 

last year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective
