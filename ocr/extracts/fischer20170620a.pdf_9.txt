the crisis.  In 2008, new U.S. government policies were introduced to address the lack of 

modifications.  These policies helped in three ways.  First, they standardized protocols for 

modification, which provided servicers of private-label securities some sense of common 

practice.  Second, they provided financial incentives to servicers for modifying loans.  

Third, they established key criteria for judging whether modifications were sustainable or 

not, particularly limits on mortgage payments as a percentage of household income.  This 

last policy was to ensure that borrowers could actually repay the modified loans, which 

prompted lenders to agree more readily to the modification policies in the first place.  

Ireland and Spain also aimed to restructure nonperforming loans.  Again, 

government involvement was necessary to push these initiatives forward.  In Ireland, 

mortgage arrears continued to accumulate until the introduction of the Mortgage Arrears 

Resolution Targets scheme in 2013, and in Spain, about 10 percent of mortgages were 

restructured by 2014, following government initiatives to protect vulnerable 

households.24  Public initiatives promoting socially desirable mortgage modifications in 

times of crises tend to be accompanied by explicit public fund support even though 

government guarantees may be absent in normal times. 

What Has Been Done?  What Needs to Be Done?  

With the recent crisis fresh in mind, a number of countries have taken steps to 

strengthen the resilience of their housing finance systems.  Many of the most egregious 

practices that emerged during the lending boom in the United States--such as no- or low-

documentation loans or negatively amortizing mortgages--have been severely limited.  

Other jurisdictions are taking actions as well.  Canadian authorities withdrew government
