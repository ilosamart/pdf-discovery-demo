compelling argument that all types of community development finance, whether in the 

form of a loan or an investment, have greater impact when they serve as patient, reliable, 

committed sources of financing.  

One possible approach to address these distortions and provide more effective 

incentives is to create a separate, comprehensive community development test to evaluate 

community development loans and qualified investments through a similar lens, possibly 

along with community development services.  A separate, comprehensive community 

development test could encourage banks to provide the patient, committed financing--in 

the form of loans as well as investments--that community development organizations 

value the most.  This is important because banks are uniquely situated to evaluate the 

community development finance projects in the states where they operate and to provide 

the smaller, more complex, and often more impactful, investments that don’t attract 

institutional investors.  If banks cannot be confident ex ante that they will get the benefit 

of CRA consideration for these efforts, which may be time-consuming to evaluate and 

structure, it is not surprising they would instead gravitate toward activities they know will 

count.5    

In addition to these broad changes to what and how community development 

activities should be counted, we recognize there are several definitional issues that merit 

consideration.  For example, many commenters advocated for an expansion of the 

definition of “community development” to include loans to or investments in community 

                                                 
5 We recognize that the agencies will need to give careful consideration to how to weight community 
development loans, investments, and services, so as not to harm the complex system of community 
development financing that is dependent largely on CRA-motivated investments.
