impose an annual fee to provide disclosures
before annual renewal. In addition, card issuers
that offer credit insurance must inform custom-
ers of any increase in rate or substantial decrease
in coverage should the issuer decide to change
insurance providers.

Fair Credit Billing Act

The Fair Credit Billing Act establishes proce-
dures for the prompt correction of errors on
open-end credit accounts. It also protects a
consumer’s credit rating while the consumer is
settling any disputes.

Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection
Act

The Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection
Act requires lenders to disclose terms, rates, and
conditions (APR, miscellaneous charges, pay-
ment terms, and information about variable rate
features) for home equity lines of credit with the
applications and before the first transaction under
the home equity plan. If the disclosed terms
change, the consumer can refuse to open the
plan and is entitled to a refund of fees paid in
connection with the application. The Act also
limits the circumstances under which creditors
may terminate or change the terms of a home
equity plan after it is opened.

Regulation AA/Credit Practices Rule
(issued under the Federal Trade
Commission Act)

The Credit Practices Rule prohibits lenders from
using certain remedies such as confessions of
judgement; exemption waivers; wage assign-
ments; and nonpossessory, nonpurchase money,
security interests in household goods in connec-
tion with consumer credit contracts. The rule
also prohibits lenders from misrepresenting a
cosigner’s liability and requires that lenders

provide cosigners with a notice explaining their
credit obligation as a cosigner. It also prohibits
the pyramiding of late charges.

Regulation CC/Expedited Funds
Availability Act

The Expedited Funds Availability Act requires
that all banks (including branches of FBOs),
savings and loan associations, savings banks,
and credit unions to make funds deposited into
checking, share draft, and NOW accounts avail-
able according to specified time schedules, and
to disclose their funds availability policies to
their customers. The law does not require an
institution to delay the customer’s use of depos-
ited funds but instead limits how long any delay
may last. The regulation also establishes rules
designed to speed the return of unpaid checks.

Fair Credit Reporting Act

The Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes pro-
cedures for correcting mistakes on a person’s
credit record and requires that a consumer’s
record only be provided for legitimate business
needs. It also requires that the record be kept
confidential. A credit record may be retained
seven years for judgements, liens, suits, and
other adverse information, except for bankrupt-
cies, which may be retained ten years. If a
consumer has been denied credit, a cost-free
credit report may be requested within 30 days of
denial.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is
designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and
unfair debt collection practices. It applies to
third party debt collectors or those who use a
name other than their own in collecting con-
sumer debts.
