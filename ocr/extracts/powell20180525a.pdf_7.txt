crisis.  We make a great deal of information regarding the stress tests public, including 

the scenarios we use, portfolio-level projected losses for participating firms, and, of 

course, the results.  We have also proposed for public comment a range of ways to further 

enhance the transparency of the supervisory stress tests.  This detailed disclosure 

provides the public with a wealth of information on how these institutions would perform 

under severe stress.  And this transparency both enhances public confidence and holds 

banking regulators accountable for their judgments.   

At the Federal Reserve we use a variety of additional means to enhance public 

understanding of our supervisory and financial stability efforts and judgments.  The 

Board’s Vice Chairman for Supervision testifies before the Congress twice a year.  The 

Board staff’s assessment of financial stability is discussed four times a year at Federal 

Open Market Committee meetings, and these discussions are summarized in the 

meeting’s published minutes.  And, since 2013, the semiannual Monetary Policy Report 

to the Congress has contained a review of financial stability conditions.  

The Way Forward  

The post-crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar.  Some of these new 

policies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and 

challenging for all involved.  As a result, transparency and accountability around 

financial stability tools present particular challenges.  We will continue to strive to find 

better ways to enhance transparency around our approach to preserving financial stability.  

Efforts to engage with the public--including consumer groups, academics, and the 

financial sector--are likely to lead to improved policies.  Moreover, ongoing dialogue will 

work to enhance public trust, as well as our ability to adapt to new threats as they emerge.
