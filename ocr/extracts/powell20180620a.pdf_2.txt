Nine years into an expansion that has sometimes proceeded slowly, the U.S. 

economy is performing very well.  Growth is meaningfully above most estimates of its 

long-term trend--though admittedly, that trend is not as strong as we would like it to be.  

The labor market is particularly robust, with unemployment at its lowest level since April 

2000.  Inflation has moved up close to our 2 percent objective, although we have yet to 

see it remain near that objective on a sustained basis.   

Today, most Americans who want jobs can find them.  High demand for workers 

should support wage growth and labor force participation--the latter a measure on which 

the United States now lags most other advanced economies.1  A tight labor market may 

also lead businesses to invest more in technology and training, which should support 

productivity growth.  And groups such as some racial and ethnic minorities that still have 

higher unemployment and lower participation rates could see increasing benefits from a 

tight labor market.2  In short, there is a lot to like about low unemployment.    

Achieving our statutory goal of maximum employment in a context of price 

stability and financial stability is both our responsibility and our challenge.  Earlier in the 

expansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary 

policy was clear.  But with unemployment low and expected to decline further, inflation 

close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the case for 

continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.

labor markets.
