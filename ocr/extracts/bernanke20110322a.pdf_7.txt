systemically important financial firms.  The too-big-to-fail problem is a pernicious one that has a 

number of substantial harmful effects.  Critically, it reduces the incentives of shareholders, 

creditors, and counterparties of such firms to discipline excessive risk-taking.  And it produces 

competitive distortions by enabling firms with large systemic footprints to fund themselves more 

cheaply than other firms because of the implicit subsidy of too-big-to-fail status.  This 

competitive distortion is not only unfair to smaller firms and damaging to competition today, but 

it also spurs further growth by the largest firms and more consolidation and concentration in the 

financial industry.  A financial system dominated by too-big-to-fail firms cannot be a healthy 

financial system. 

The act addresses the too-big-to-fail problem with a multi-pronged approach.  Under it, 

we are developing more-stringent prudential standards for banking firms with assets greater than 

$50 billion and all nonbank financial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council.  These more-stringent standards will include stronger capital and 

leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, and single-counterparty credit limits, as well as 

requirements to periodically produce resolution plans and conduct stress tests.  Our goal is to 

produce a well-integrated set of rules that meaningfully reduces the probability of failure of our 

largest, most complex financial firms and that minimizes the losses to the financial system and 

the economy if such a firm should fail.  In doing so, we aim to force these firms to take into 

account the costs that they impose on the broader financial system, soak up the implicit subsidy 

these firms enjoy due to market perceptions of their systemic importance, and give the firms 

regulatory incentives to shrink their systemic footprint.   

Complementing these efforts, the Federal Reserve has been working for some time with 

other regulatory agencies and central banks around the world to design and implement a stronger
