What about the West, where urbanization is happening more quickly than anywhere else? 

In fact, the average western small town grew 7.8 percent in those seven years, which is roughly 

the same healthy pace of growth registered in western towns and cities from the smallest to the 

largest.   

With a nod to Mark Twain, the message here is that reports of the death of small towns, 

at least in the West, have been greatly exaggerated.  I don’t mean to minimize the challenges 

small towns face, because they are considerable, or suggest that western small towns are immune 

to them, because they certainly are not.  But the more positive message I come away with here is 

that a rising tide of prosperity in the West seems to be lifting communities large and small, and 

that the many instances of small towns in decline that we all hear about are counterbalanced by 

other small towns growing healthily.  Another lesson is that population growth and the attendant 

economic growth in the West is not zero sum, and that small towns can still grow healthily while 

the metropolises of the West continue to attract people, partly from outside the region.  I will 

return to the issue of how the economies of the urban and rural West differ, but the backdrop is 

that population data are promising for both. 

Banking in the West 

Now that I have outlined how the economy of the West relates to that of the rest of the 

United States, let me do the same for banking in the West.  There is a lot to this topic, but my 

focus is banking as it is experienced at the retail level by households and small- and medium-

sized businesses.  Again, I use the Census Bureau’s list of 13 states to define the West, and for a 

simpler comparison, and in honor of Frank Church, I will refer to the other 37 states as “eastern” 

even though they cover several regions.  Some of you are old enough to remember Frank 

Church, the U.S. Senator from Idaho--a Stanford grad and hero of mine when I was a teenager.
