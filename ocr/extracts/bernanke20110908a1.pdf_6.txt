These restorative forces are at work today, and they will continue to promote 

recovery over time.  Unfortunately, the recession, besides being extraordinarily severe as 

well as global in scope, was also unusual in being associated with both a very deep slump 

in the housing market and a historic financial crisis.  These two features of the downturn, 

individually and in combination, have acted to slow the natural recovery process.   

Notably, the housing sector has been a significant driver of recovery from most 

recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time--with an overhang of 

distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for builders and potential 

homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about 

continued house price declines--the rate of new home construction has remained at less 

than one-third of its pre-crisis peak.  Depressed construction also has hurt providers of a 

wide range of goods and services related to housing and homebuilding, such as the 

household appliance and home furnishing industries.  Moreover, even as tight credit for 

builders and potential homebuyers has been one of the factors restraining the housing 

recovery, the weak housing market has in turn adversely affected financial markets and 

the flow of credit.  For example, the sharp declines in house prices in some areas have 

left many homeowners “underwater” on their mortgages, creating financial hardship for 

households and, through their effects on rates of mortgage delinquency and default, stress 

for financial institutions as well. 

As I noted, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 played a central role in sparking 

the global recession.  A great deal has been and continues to be done to address the 

causes and effects of the crisis, including extensive financial reforms.  However, although 

banking and financial conditions in the United States have improved significantly since
