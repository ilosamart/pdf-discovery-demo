     Note: The table displays basis point changes from close of business on the day before the announcement to close of business on the day of  
the announcement, with the exception of Aug.11 to Nov. 2, 2010, which shows the interperiod change.  Changes in the 10-year nominal Treasury 
yield are computed using a smoothed yield curve estimated by staff from off-the-run Treasury coupon securities.  Changes in the yield on 10-year 
Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are computed by staff using a smoothed inflation-indexed yield curve.  Changes in the yield on  
30-year mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are computed using Bloomberg data on securities issued by Fannie Mae.  Changes in the yield on  
10-year BBB corporate bonds are computed using a smoothed yield curve estimated by staff using Merrill Lynch data.
