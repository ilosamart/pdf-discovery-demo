 Two areas where the case for reform in the short-run is compelling are money market 

funds and the tri-party repo market.  The requirement adopted by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) in 2010 for a greater liquidity buffer in money market funds was a step in the 

right direction, but the combination of fixed net asset value, the lack of loss absorption capacity, 

and the demonstrated propensity for institutional investors to run together make clear that 

Chairman Schapiro is right to call for additional measures.  As to the tri-party repo market, there 

are several important concerns.  A major vulnerability lies in the large amount of intraday credit 

extended by clearing banks on a daily basis.  An industry initiative to address the issue led to 

some important operational improvements to the tri-party market, but, to be frank, fell short of 

dealing comprehensively with this problem.  So it now falls to the regulatory agencies to take 

appropriate regulatory and supervisory measures to mitigate these and other risks.  

Conclusion 

It is sobering to recognize that, more than four years after the failure of Bear Stearns 

began the acute phase of the financial crisis, so much remains to be done--in implementing 

reforms that have already been developed, in modifying or supplementing these reforms as 

needed, and in fashioning a reform program to address shadow banking concerns.  For some time 

my concern has been that the momentum generated during the crisis will wane or be redirected to 

other issues before reforms have been completed.  As you can tell from my remarks today, this 

remains a very real concern.  

Still, I would like to conclude on a somewhat different--though I think not inconsistent--

note.  Almost by definition, prudential reforms are injunctions to firms or markets about what 

they should not do.  Even affirmatively stated requirements to maintain specified capital ratios 

can be understood as prohibitions upon extending more credit, purchasing another instrument, or
