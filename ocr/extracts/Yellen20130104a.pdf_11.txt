connected banks spreads widely through the rest of the system.  In this sense, the 

intuition of Allen and Gale--that highly connected networks are resilient to systemic 

shocks--can be misleading.  In an empirical study of 3,000 Brazilian banks, Cont, 

Moussa, and Santos find that, not surprisingly, institutions with larger interbank 

exposures tend to be more systemically important.  But, critically, they also find that an 

institutionâ€™s position within the financial network plays a significant role.  A bank that 

does business with a large number of relatively weak counterparties may have greater 

systemic importance than an institution with a similar number of counterparties that are 

better equipped to manage potential losses. 

The work of Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia and that of Cont, Moussa, and Santos 

suggest that detailed and comprehensive data on the structure of financial networks is 

needed to understand the systemic risks facing the financial system and to gauge the 

contributions to systemic risk by individual institutions.  I will describe in a moment how 

the Federal Reserve is using such data to enhance its understanding of the OTC 

derivatives market.  This line of research suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to the 

regulation of financial intermediaries may not be appropriate.   

So, what have we learned from this brief tour through recent research on 

interconnectedness and systemic risk?  We have seen how interconnectedness can be a 

source of strength for financial institutions, allowing them to diversify risk while 

providing liquidity and investment opportunities to savers that would not be available 

otherwise.  But more-numerous and more-complex linkages also appear to make it more 

difficult for institutions to address certain types of externalities, such as those arising 

from incomplete information or a lack of coordination among market participants.  These
