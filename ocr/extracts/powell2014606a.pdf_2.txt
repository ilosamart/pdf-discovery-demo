Thank you for inviting me here today.  I should say at the outset that the views 

that I offer are my own and not necessarily those of any other member of the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

You have asked about the effectiveness of forward guidance.  My view is that 

forward guidance has generally been effective in providing support for the economy at a 

time when the federal funds rate has been pinned at its effective lower bound.  

The FOMC has provided various forms of forward guidance since 2009, both for 

rate policy and for asset purchases.  I will focus today mainly on rate policy.  There is 

more than can be said in five minutes, however, so I will leave the rest to our discussion 

afterward. 

In my view, forward rate guidance has helped reduce medium and longer-term 

interest rates, and by doing so has provided meaningful support for the economy.  First, 

by increasing public understanding and market confidence in the path of rates, guidance 

has helped reduce term premiums.  Second, by communicating that rates would remain 

lower for longer than market participants might otherwise have expected, guidance has 

lowered medium- and longer-term rates through the expectations channel.  Finally, even 

when guidance has initially been well aligned with market expectations, it has reduced 

the likelihood that rate expectations will subsequently shift upward in ways that the 

Committee does not intend.  Event studies as well as market-implied quotes and surveys 

corroborate the view that guidance has reduced medium- and longer-term interest rates 

and has held down volatility as well.  To be sure, there have also been times when 

forward guidance and market expectations have diverged, with resulting spikes in 

volatility.  Such situations may be difficult to avoid, given the use of new,
