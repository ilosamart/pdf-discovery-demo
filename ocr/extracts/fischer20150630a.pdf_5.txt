in the view of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), likely to reach 2 percent 

within about two years.   

Let me provide an update on recent progress toward the attainment of these goals 

and its effects on the current stance of the Federal Reserveâ€™s monetary policy. 

U.S. economic activity and inflation 

The U.S. economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, with the most 

recent estimate being that real GDP declined 0.2 percent at an annual rate.  Household 

spending slowed, while both business investment and net exports declined.  Much of this 

slowdown seemed to reflect transitory factors, including harsh winter weather, labor 

disputes at West Coast ports, and probably statistical noise.  Confirming that view, the 

latest monthly data on real consumption provide welcome evidence that consumer 

demand is rebounding, and that economic activity likely expanded at an annual rate of 

about 2.5 percent in the second quarter. 

In addition, U.S. labor markets have continued to improve.  For the first five 

months of this year, payroll job gains have averaged 217,000 per month.  These gains are 

lower than those seen late last year but are still substantial, and they are above the rate 

needed to maintain the rate of unemployment at a constant rate of labor force 

participation.  The unemployment rate has moved lower this year and registered 

5.5 percent in May.  Both long-term unemployment and involuntary part-time 

employment declined as well.  While these developments represents considerable 

progress toward strengthening of the labor market, some room remains for further 

improvement.
