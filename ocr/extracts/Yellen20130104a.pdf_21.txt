Even in light of the significant costs of initial margin, it seems clear that some 

requirements are needed.  The current use and application of initial margin is 

inconsistent, and a more robust and consistent margin regime for non-centrally-cleared 

derivatives will not only reduce systemic risk, but will also diminish the incentive to 

tinker with contract language as a way to evade clearing requirements.  Robust and 

consistent initial margin requirements will help prevent the kind of contagion that was 

sparked by AIG:  They would serve, in effect, to limit the effects of interconnectedness 

within the financial network.  The failure of a financial counterparty could be contained 

in the manner described by Allen and Gale.  As I noted in connection with variation 

margins, initial margin requirements would also improve transparency because derivative 

market participants will know that their counterparties are at least partially insulated from 

defaults.  Of course, these benefits need to be appropriately balanced against the burdens 

imposed by initial margin.  But it seems highly unlikely that the status quo is consistent 

with achieving the goals of the G-20 to reduce the potential for systemic risk in the OTC 

derivatives markets that could threaten the financial system.   

Finally, let me turn to data requirements.  Both the research that I have 

highlighted today and practical experience demonstrate that market, prudential, and 

systemic risk authorities need detailed information on derivatives transactions and 

bilateral positions to assess evolving market risks and to execute their financial stability 

responsibilities.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve has already used preliminary information 

from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporationâ€™s Trade Information Warehouse to 

construct network graphs of the CDS market such as the one illustrated in figure 4.  The 

data enable identification, for example, of firms, such as A and B in figure 4, that are
