GDPNow forecast, which was quite accurate in its prediction of the first estimate of first-

quarter GDP growth, is projecting second-quarter GDP growth of only 0.8 percent.2   

Second, it would not be the first time this recovery has proceeded in fits and 

starts.  The underlying momentum of the recovery has proven relatively susceptible to 

successive headwinds, which have kept overall economic growth well below the average 

pace of previous upturns.   

My own reading is that earlier, more optimistic growth projections may have 

placed too much weight on the boost to spending from lower energy prices and too little 

weight on the negative implications for aggregate demand of the significant increase in 

the foreign exchange value of the dollar and large decline in the price of crude oil.  

Turning first to the expected positive effects, at a time when a lot of the growth 

burden is riding on U.S. consumers, consumers appear to be disinclined to spend much of 

the gains from cheaper prices at the pump, preferring, it seems, to strengthen household 

balance sheets instead.  Relative to expectations predicated on the boost to real income 

from lower gas prices, consumer spending so far this year has been undeniably weak, 

especially given a backdrop of improving labor market prospects, solid consumer 

sentiment, and improving credit availability.  Consumer spending is reported to have 

increased at an annual rate of only 1.8 percent in the first quarter--far below the 

5.3 percent increase in household real disposable income.  Moreover, monthly data on 

expenditures through April do not suggest a large bounceback going into the second 

quarter.
