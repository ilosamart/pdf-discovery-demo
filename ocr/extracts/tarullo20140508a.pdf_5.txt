The prudential regulatory structure was too narrow in that it did not extend to firms and 

activities outside of banking organizations, even those that could pose a threat to financial 

stability, because the soundness of the federal deposit insurance system was not implicated.  

Thus Lehman Brothers, whose failure did seriously shake the financial system, was not subject to 

even the microprudential standards applicable to bank holding companies.  The run on the repo

years of largely deregulatory measures that had preceded the crisis.  The turmoil that attended the 

collapse of several large nonbank financial institutions, and the extraordinary government

financial system as a whole.  This perspective was embraced by Congress in the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which directed federal banking 

and market regulators to add to their existing mandates the responsibility for protecting financial

on the basis of total assets—to which different regulatory requirements are to apply.  Most 

prominently, section 165 requires that “in order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial 

stability of the United States,” the Federal Reserve Board is to establish for all bank holding
