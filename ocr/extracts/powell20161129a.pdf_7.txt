growth from about 3 percent to about 2 percent--a seemingly small difference that would 

make a huge difference in living standards over time.3 

How much of this decline is just a particularly bad business cycle, and how much 

represents a long-run downshift?  To get at that question, let’s take a deeper look at the 

growth slowdown.  We can think of economic growth as coming from two sources:  more 

hours worked (labor supply) or higher output per hour (productivity).  Hours worked 

mainly depends on growth in the labor force, which has been slowing since the mid-

2000s as the baby-boom generation ages.  As you can see, the labor force is now growing 

at only about 0.5 percent per year (figure 9).  Another way to see this is through the 

sustained increase in the ratio of people over 65 to those who are in their prime working 

years (figure 10).  This long-expected demographic fact has now arrived, and it has 

challenging implications for our potential growth and also for our fiscal policy.4 

The unexpected part of the growth slowdown reflects weak productivity growth 

rather than lower labor supply.  Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per 

year since 2010--the smallest five-year rate of increase since World War II and about 

one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 11).  The slowdown in productivity has 

been worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by the crisis 

(figure 12).  Given the global nature of the phenomenon, it is unlikely that U.S.-specific 

factors are mainly responsible.
