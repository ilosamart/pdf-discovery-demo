Moreover, the benchmark for “normal” tends to be defined in terms of pre-crisis 

standards that involved policy settings well away from the lower bound, at least initially, 

because it may take some time to learn about important changes in underlying financial 

and economic relationships.  For example, the factors underlying what we now 

understand to be the new normal of persistently low interest rates were in many cases 

initially viewed as temporary headwinds.  In these circumstances, a standard policy 

framework calibrated around the pre-crisis or “old” normal may be biased to 

underachieving the inflation target in a low neutral rate environment.  The kind of policy 

framework that Bernanke proposes, which pre-commits to implementing the makeup 

principle based on the actual observed performance of inflation during a lower bound 

episode, could guard against premature liftoff and help prevent the erosion of longer-term 

inflation expectations. 

Monetary policymakers operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty 

and therefore have to weigh the risks of tightening too little or too late against those of 

tightening too much or too soon.  While past experience has conditioned U.S. 

policymakers to be highly attentive to the risks associated with a breakout of inflation to 

the upside, as in the 1970s, they balance these risks against those associated with 

undershooting the inflation target persistently, as in Japan in the late 1990s and the 2000s.   

In weighing these risks, the standard approach is typically designed to achieve 

“convergence from below,” in which inflation gradually rises to its target.  Given the lags 

in the effects of monetary policy, convergence from below would necessitate raising 

interest rates preemptively, well in advance of inflation reaching its target.  Moreover, 

particularly in the early stage of a recovery, this kind of preemptive approach tends of
