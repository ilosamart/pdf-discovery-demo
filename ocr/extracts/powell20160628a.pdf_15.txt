I expect our economy to continue to make progress.  Monetary policy will need to 

remain supportive of growth, as we work through the challenging global environment.  

As always, it will be important to carefully monitor economic developments in order to 

assess the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives 

of maximum employment and price stability.
