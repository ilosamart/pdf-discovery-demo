result if clients and customers believe the firm is always seeking an advantage over them that, 

literally or metaphorically, is buried in the fine print.   

This second concern recalls the much-discussed issue of whether a trading mentality has 

migrated to other parts of large financial firms, so that the position communicated by 

management to both employees and others is that the firm has no “customers” or “clients,” only 

counterparties.  While such an attitude is typical for trading in anonymous markets or with 

equally sophisticated institutions, it hardly seems designed to engender trust on the part of those 

who have ongoing relationships with the firm.  This tendency may pose another challenge in 

managing complex banking organizations—the need to foster different kinds of norms and 

expectations across the different parts of the firm, which may do business with individuals and 

institutions of widely varying financial expertise. 

To encourage behavior among their employees that reflects something other than a 

narrow mentality of compliance and constraint, firms need to take tangible steps that reinforce 

stated norms such as respect for customers.  Some interesting possibilities along these lines are 

suggested in a recent book by Thomas Huertas, a former U.K. banking regulator.2  Although 

Huertas focuses directly on how banks can avoid suffering losses from conduct and operational 

risks, his proposals would also serve the purpose just noted.  One idea is that firms develop a 

score for conduct risk.  While analogous to long-established scoring systems for credit risk, this 

method would, in his words, “include ranking the business or product against factors that 

frequently give rise to conduct issues, including without limitation the sophistication of the 

customer, the complexity of the product, the level of training of the staff, and so on.”  A second, 

complementary idea is for the firm to have a formal system in place to, again in Huertas’ words,
