of these policies.3  Moreover, the estimates imply that these macroeconomic effects are 

only now manifesting themselves in full, reflecting the inherent lags in the monetary 

transmission mechanism.  Of course, such estimates have a wide band of uncertainty 

around them.   

As is well known, a number of potential costs might be associated with QE and 

the Fed’s elevated balance sheet.  Among these are the possibility that elevated securities 

holdings and low interest rates could pose risks to financial stability, possible effects on 

the Fed’s income and remittances to the U.S. Treasury, and possible difficulties in 

conducting policy normalization.4  Such potential difficulties arise because the level of 

reserve balances will be very high when the FOMC begins to raise the federal funds rate, 

and, consequently, the Federal Reserve will employ new tools, which have their own 

benefits and costs, to implement monetary policy.   

Despite these potential costs, we think that asset purchases have had a meaningful 

effect in promoting economic recovery and helping to keep inflation closer to the 

FOMC’s 2 percent goal than would otherwise have been the case. 

Policy Normalization 

Turning to policy normalization, the FOMC and market participants anticipate 

that the federal funds rate will be raised sometime this year.  We have for some years 

been considering ways to operate monetary policy with an elevated balance sheet.

4 Reflecting securities holdings from the asset purchases, the Federal Reserve has remitted about 
$500 billion to the U.S. Treasury from 2008 to 2014 and is expected to have cumulative net income from 
2008 to 2025 that is far higher than would have been the case in the absence of these asset purchases.
