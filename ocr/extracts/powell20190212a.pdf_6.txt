Mobile for work.  He wasn’t gone long, though, before he felt called to return to make his 

home here in the Delta.  Since moving back, Tim has founded several businesses, as well 

as a nonprofit that helps people of color start and grow their own businesses. 

Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development 

As with Tim and his clients, entrepreneurship opportunities can motivate residents 

who have left rural communities to return home--or to keep them from moving away in 

the first place.  Business ownership represents an important source of income and wealth 

for both owners and their employees.  Recognizing this fact, successful communities find 

ways to help residents turn what they know and do best, including skills they may have 

gained from industries in decline, into profitable small businesses.10  One example of a 

community taking this approach is Clarksdale, Mississippi. 

About 10 years ago, civic and business leaders assessed what made Clarksdale 

special and how those characteristics could help the community thrive.  Since Clarksdale 

calls itself “Home of the Blues,” attracting tourists using the local Blues culture seemed 

promising.  Over the years, Clarksdale has created new jobs by investing to improve its 

downtown, and has supported local businesses that cater to tourists interested in the 

community’s musical heritage. 

This growth is also creating new businesses not directly related to tourism--

businesses such as Urgent and Primary Care of Clarksdale.  Dr. Mary Williams opened 

her urgent care facility last spring, partly in response to the closure of nearby Quitman 

                                                 
10 Such support systems generally include consistent and easily accessible ways for potential business 
owners to find the advice, financing, and education they need to be successful.  See Federal Reserve Bank
