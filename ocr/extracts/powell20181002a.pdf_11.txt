inflation expectations.  And we are aware that it could be very costly if those expectations 

were to drift materially.  As you probably know from our public communications, we 

carefully monitor survey- and market-based proxies for expectations, and we do not see 

evidence of a material shift in longer-term expectations (figure 6).  The survey measures 

have been particularly steady for some time.15  The financial market-based measures 

include both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component, so 

they tend to move around much more than the surveys, but we see no evidence of a 

material change in these measures, either.  

The risks to inflation expectations are, of course, two sided.  Until this summer, 

inflation had remained stubbornly below 2 percent for several years.  And major 

economies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with disinflationary forces.  

Thus, we have been and will remain alert for possible downward drift in expectations.  

Some argue the contrary case--that by only gradually removing accommodation as the 

unemployment rate has fallen, the FOMC may have fallen behind the curve, thereby 

risking an upward drift in expectations.  From the standpoint of contingency planning, 

our course is clear:  Resolutely conduct policy consistent with the FOMC’s symmetric 2 

percent inflation objective, and stand ready to act with authority if expectations drift 

materially up or down. 

Could Inflation Pressures Move up More than Expected in a Hot Economy? 

A second risk is that labor market tightness or tightness in other parts of the 

production chain might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected--the “revenge of 

                                                 
15 That is, movements in these measures have been modest, especially taking into account precision of the 
surveys.
