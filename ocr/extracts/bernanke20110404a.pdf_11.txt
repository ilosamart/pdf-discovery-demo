years leading up to the crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated joint 

efforts with other regulators and market participants to improve clearing arrangements for 

credit default swaps.  However, for several reasons, the willingness of market participants 

to move all derivatives transactions to clearinghouses was limited.  Notably, many 

believed that the standardization of derivatives contracts that is needed for multilateral 

clearing imposed too high a cost on end users with needs for customized arrangements.  

Market participants also were concerned that the establishment of clearinghouse 

guarantees might require implicit subsidies from clearinghouse members with stronger 

credit to those with weaker credit. 

 These calculations, however, were substantially changed by the galvanizing 

events of 2008, notably the development of large and uncertain counterparty credit risks 

in many bilateral derivatives agreements.  On the heels of the crisis, the Group of Twenty 

countries endorsed a policy of mandatory central clearing for standardized OTC 

derivatives.  The aim was to reduce systemic risk in the financial system more broadly as 

well as to improve the transparency of the OTC derivatives markets.  In the United 

States, title 7 of the Dodd-Frank Act incorporated a mandatory clearing policy for 

standardized derivatives.  Other major countries are following suit.  In the spirit of 

keeping a close eye on the basket, as dependence on clearinghouses grows, private-sector 

participants and regulators will need to review risk-management and member-default 

procedures for financial market utilities to ensure that they meet high standards of safety. 

 As I mentioned, strengthening the financial infrastructure is indeed a key theme of 

the Dodd-Frank Act.  Title 8 addresses several prudential issues associated with clearing 

and settlement.  One important provision provides additional authority for U.S. regulators
