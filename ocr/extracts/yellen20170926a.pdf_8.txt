the possibility that some slack still remains in the labor market.  If so, the economy could 

sustain a higher level of employment and output in the longer run than now anticipated--a 

very beneficial outcome, albeit one that would require recalibrating monetary policy over 

time in order to reap those benefits and compensate for the accompanying reduction in 

inflationary pressures. 

A related question is whether the unemployment rate alone is an adequate gauge 

of economic slack for the purposes of explaining inflation.  Although the unemployment 

rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators 

have shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10  As the solid blue line in figure 

6 illustrates, the employed share of the “prime-age worker” population--that is, persons 

from ages 25 to 54--remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11  But employment rates 

for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining 

employment opportunities for less-skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving 

disability insurance, and other worrisome trends.12  Similarly, although the share of part-

time workers who would like a full-time job is still somewhat above where it stood 

                                                 
10 Several years ago, I discussed the interpretation of a wide range of labor market indicators at length 
(Yellen, 2014). 
11 The employment-to-population ratio for all persons aged 16 and over has recovered much less than the 
prime-age ratio since 2007, in large part reflecting the ongoing retirement of the baby boomers and a rise in 
school attendance rates for young adults aged 20 to 24 (Aaronson and others, 2014).  Schanzenbach and 
others (2017) estimate that the substantial overall employment-to-population gap that opened up in the 
wake of the financial crisis finally closed in July 2017. 
12 The labor force participation rate for prime-age men has been declining for decades.  Evidence suggests 
that a portion of the decline is attributable to a reduction in the demand for low-skilled workers resulting 
from advances in technology and globalization.  For a general discussion of the decline in male labor force 
participation, see Aaronson and others (2014).  For a discussion of the role played by technical factors in 
this decline, see Deming (forthcoming) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011); for a discussion of the role of 
globalization, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016).  In addition to these 
factors, Autor and Duggan (2003) and French and Song (2014) present evidence suggesting that increases 
in the number of people on disability rolls have also been important.  Relatedly, an alarming deterioration 
in health outcomes among low-education workers, including a rise in deaths related to alcohol, drugs, and 
suicide, may be having an adverse effect on both male and female employment (Case and Deaton, 2017).
