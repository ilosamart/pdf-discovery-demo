equity to consolidate their card debt and lower their monthly payments.1  In this adverse 

economic environment, it is perhaps not surprising that the charge-off rate on credit cards 

more than doubled from about 4 percent in 2007 to more than 9 percent in 2009.  The rate 

of charge-offs has since declined from its peak but remains elevated.  All told, we 

estimate that the rise in charge-offs can account for about one-third of the net decline in 

revolving credit growth from 2007 to 2009.   

Another possible explanation for the decline in outstanding balances might be that 

households, in an effort to repair their balance sheets or bring down their debt burdens, 

have begun paying down their credit card balances faster than usual.  But, on the whole, 

the data do not indicate that faster paydown is a significant factor.  Historically, 

households tend to repay their credit card balances at a faster rate during good economic 

times and tend to slow this rate when economic activity is weak.  And, over the past 

several years, this tendency appears to have held up.  In 2006, the rate of credit card 

repayment was well above its long-run trend, probably reflecting strong incomes as well 

as ample home equity that could be tapped to pay off more expensive card debt.  

However, beginning in 2007, as housing markets weakened and unemployment climbed, 

households began to pay off their card debt at a significantly slower pace--a trend that 

extended into 2008 and 2009 as the economic downturn worsened.  All told, the drop in 

the payoff rate has been more pronounced than in the recessions of 1990-91 and 2000-01.  

More recently, however, this trend has reversed, and as of August 2010, the repayment 

rate had risen to a more typical level.  While this increase likely reflects a gradual 

improvement in the ability of cardholders to repay their debt, it could also be attributed to 

                                                 
1 On average since 2003, about half of the respondents to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers who took cash out during a mortgage refinancing have reported using the funds to 
pay down other debt.
