We are here to honor two exceptional public servants and the great institution 

they helped build.  Let’s consider for a moment why the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 

has succeeded and how Carroll Wright and Janet Norwood contributed to that success. 

In 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the 

federal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and 

objective information on American workers.  That task fell to Carroll Wright, who had 

won the confidence of workers and management as chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of 

Labor Statistics in the years after that state became the first to legalize labor unions.   

At that point, before the United States itself had recognized such rights and before 

the federal government could agree on labor standards, the public needed an 

unimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers.  Under Carroll Wright, 

what was then called the Bureau of Labor investigated major labor disputes and issued 

reports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation.  

He initiated the collection of data on hours, wages, and prices and was responsible for 

many important advances that successively improved the reliability of these data.  The 

respect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to 

the dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness 

about the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace.   

In the U.S. Constitution, there is not a requirement that government statistics be 

accurate and free of political influence or bias.  Carroll Wright recognized that this 

simple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government’s effort to 

reduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward.  He and 

others are responsible for a fundamental feature of our democracy that is now often taken
