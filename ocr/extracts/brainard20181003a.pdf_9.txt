infrastructure.  This could ultimately benefit all consumers by lowering costs, increasing choice, 

and improving quality.   

 In that regard, we are also seeking comment on whether the Reserve Banks should 

consider developing a liquidity management tool that would operate 24/7 in support of services 

for real-time interbank settlement of faster payments.  The tool could support settlement services 

provided by the private sector or the Reserve Banks.    

 The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to promote a payment system that serves the 

evolving needs of the public.  We hope to solicit as wide a range of views as possible as we 

consider these and possibly other options to support prompt, secure, and resilient settlement in a 

24/7 world.  To that end, the Federal Register notice poses a series of questions related to 

whether an RTGS is the appropriate strategic foundation for interbank settlement of faster 

payments.  We also solicit views on the appropriate role for the Federal Reserve in such a 

system.  We look forward to hearing from, and learning from, a broad array of stakeholders, 

including those who are actively involved in the provision of payment and banking services, as 

well as representatives of the consumers, households, and businesses who rely on the ability to 

make and receive payments every day. 

 The future of payments will be determined by the actions we take today.  We can wait 

and watch how these issues evolve on their own.  But this will likely result in a fragmented 

patchwork of systems that entails inefficiencies and risks and could leave behind many 

households, small businesses, and smaller banks.  Alternatively, we can work with other 

stakeholders to embrace innovation and design a faster payments infrastructure for the future to 

promote broad access and resilience.
