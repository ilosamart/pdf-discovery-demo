emerging markets more broadly, and weak growth trajectories are now the norm in much 

of the world, pushing down interest rates globally.   

The broad-based reduction in interest rates in the rest of the world, by increasing 

demand for U.S. assets, puts upward pressure on the dollar, which in turn implies 

downward pressure on the U.S. neutral rate.  One way to think about the spillover from 

abroad is how much adjustment in the federal funds rate might be necessary to insulate 

domestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar that is expected to persist.  Let’s 

take the roughly 15 percent real appreciation of the dollar that we have seen since June 

2014.  According to the Board’s FRB/US model, it would require lowering the path of 

the federal funds rate by roughly 1 percentage point over the medium term to insulate 

domestic employment from the 15 percent stronger exchange rate in inflation adjusted 

terms.  In the neighborhood of the zero lower bound, this shift down implies a delay in 

the date of liftoff and a shallower path for the federal funds rate over several years.  In 

effect, this spillover from abroad implies some limitations on the extent to which U.S. 

monetary conditions can diverge from global conditions. 

Going forward, many observers expect global growth to stabilize and eventually 

move higher, easing pressure on the dollar and on commodity prices and leading to a 

higher neutral interest rate globally.10  However, as foreign economies face structural as 

well as cyclical adjustments, the speed at which the stabilization and recovery of foreign 

growth takes place is highly uncertain, and there is a risk that this influence on the neutral 

rate could fade very slowly.  Moreover, there are downside risks to the foreign outlook.
