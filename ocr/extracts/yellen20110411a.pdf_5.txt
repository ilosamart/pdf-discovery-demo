while droughts in China and Russia and other weather-related supply disruptions have 

contributed to the jump in global food prices.   

 In contrast, the arguments linking the run-up in commodity prices to the stance of 

U.S. monetary policy do not seem to hold up to close scrutiny.  In particular, some 

observers have pointed to dollar depreciation, speculative behavior, and international 

monetary linkages as key channels through which accommodative U.S. monetary policy 

might be exacerbating the boom in commodity markets.  Let me address each of these 

possibilities in turn. 

 First, it does not seem reasonable to attribute much of the rise in commodity 

prices to movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Since early last 

summer, the dollar has depreciated about 10 percent against other major currencies, and 

of that change, my sense is that only a limited portion should be attributed to the Federal 

Reserve’s initiation of a second round of securities purchases.  By comparison, as I noted 

earlier, crude oil prices have risen more than 70 percent over the same period, and 

nonfuel commodity prices are up roughly 40 percent.  Put another way, commodity prices 

have risen markedly in all major currencies, not just in terms of U.S. dollars, suggesting 

that the evolution of the foreign exchange value of the dollar can explain only a small 

fraction of those increases.   

 A second potential concern is that U.S. monetary policy is boosting commodity 

prices by reducing the cost of holding inventories or by fomenting “carry trades” and 

other forms of speculative behavior.  But here, too, the evidence is not compelling.  Price 

increases have been prevalent across a wide range of commodities, even those that are 

associated with little or no trading in futures markets.  Moreover, if speculative
