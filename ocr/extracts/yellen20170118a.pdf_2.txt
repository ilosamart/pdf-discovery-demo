In addition to monetary policy, we--in collaboration with other regulatory 

agencies at both the federal and state levels--oversee banks and some other financial 

institutions to ensure they operate safely and soundly and treat their customers fairly.  We 

monitor the financial system as a whole and promote its stability to help avoid financial 

crises that could choke off credit to consumers and businesses.  We also reliably and
