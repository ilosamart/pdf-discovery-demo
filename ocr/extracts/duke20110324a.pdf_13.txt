Business owners whose wealth rose were also more likely to have applied for business 

credit, but the rate of denial and for those who feared denial was nearly the same for business 

owners who gained wealth as for those who lost wealth (figure 13).  In this case, the pattern of 

denial does not match the variations in individual circumstances.  Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have 

any history for this series so it is impossible to tell how it has changed over time.  But the 

striking similarity in credit approval rates for business loan requests by business owners who 

gained and those who lost wealth would seem to support anecdotal reports at the time--that 

business credit was hard to obtain even for good borrowers.  

Conclusion 

The results I have discussed today are among the first details to emerge from our panel 

study of changes in family finances over the financial crisis.  The data show significant 

heterogeneity in the wealth changes that families experienced during the period of the financial 

crisis between 2007 and 2009.  Any consequent macroeconomic wealth effect depends on the 

distribution of gains and losses and the propensities of the families that experienced those 

changes.   

Research remains to be done on how all those factors come together, but the data offer at 

least a suggestion of what may emerge.  Among the preretirement age group, those who gained 

and those who lost wealth during the financial crisis generally appear to act as if they had lost 

wealth--in that there are signs of delayed retirement and greater desire to save and to avoid risk.  

In addition, there appears to be an asymmetric reaction to wealth shocks that could be a factor in 

the slow recovery of spending.   

Business owners had much wider changes in wealth than those reported for the general 

population and the changes were related to the conditions of the industries in which the
