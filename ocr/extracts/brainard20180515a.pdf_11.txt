customers and counterparties as a core part of banking operations.  Even allowing for the 

inevitable imperfect information that may result, it would seem natural for the financial industry 

to be able to leverage institutional information and trust in ways that allow for more efficient 

methods to achieve consensus than proof of work.  Consequently, the industry and the academic 

community have focused a great deal of attention on various consensus methods that can provide 

greater scalability either by leveraging trust, which relaxes some operational and incentive 

constraints, or possibly by devising methods without trust that are much less resource intensive.  

Some of the technology firms working with the financial industry are taking different approaches 

in this fast-moving arena. 

Another important challenge for the industry has been leveraging distributed ledger 

technology while preserving the confidentiality of transactional information.  At its core, 

distributed ledger technology is a shared ledger across multiple nodes in a network, likely 

representing multiple firms and legal entities.  Ownership records and transactions flows from 

accounts on such a ledger are typically copied and stored on all the nodes in the network.  The 

financial industry, however, must develop distributed ledgers that adhere to laws, regulations, 

and policies that protect important information of the parties and their customers.  Clearly, a 

model where every entity on the network can see everyone elseâ€™s account holdings and 

transactions history will not satisfy broad industry confidentiality requirements.  In addition, 

stored data that may be protected cryptographically today may not be protected as the technology 

continues to advance, which adds even more difficulty and urgency to the work on 

confidentiality.   

The industry has been working to develop approaches to preserve confidentiality so that 

only the authorized parties relevant to a transaction can see the details recorded on the ledger.
