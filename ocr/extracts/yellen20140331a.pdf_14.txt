one key to success is “collaborative leadership,” when governments, businesses, and 

nonprofits unite behind one focused approach.  The Working Cities Challenge promotes 

that principle by inviting smaller Massachusetts cities to consider how they would use 

collaborative leadership to unite their communities to address a major challenge for 

lower-income residents.  Twenty cities competed for $1.8 million in funding from the 

state and other sources.  Six cities were awarded funds this past January, but many more 

will benefit from the spread of a new approach to capacity building that Fed research 

shows helps communities thrive.   

Leadership recruitment is also at the heart of a grassroots-oriented program called 

Economic Avenue that was developed by the Kansas City Fed.  In Northeast Kansas City, 

Kansas, residents and neighborhood leaders are forming a leadership council that will 

have responsibility for managing the program, which aims to create and grow local 

businesses, create jobs, and promote homeownership.  The bank’s community 

development staff is providing education and training to get the council off the ground, 

will measure and evaluate its progress, and assist in connecting leaders to resources and 

other programs.  

These examples are just a few among many throughout the Federal Reserve 

System.  By testing ideas, developing better measurement tools, convening interested 

parties, and sharing the Federal Reserve’s skills and knowledge with our partners at the 

national and local levels, we aim to serve as a catalyst to improve lives.   

Through these initiatives, together with the use of monetary policy and steps to 

safeguard the financial system, the Federal Reserve is committed to strengthening 

communities and restoring a healthy economy that benefits all Americans.  It is my hope
