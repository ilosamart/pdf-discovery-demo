assets are not perfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios.4  For example, some institutional 

investors face regulatory restrictions on the types of securities they can hold, retail 

investors may be reluctant to hold certain types of assets because of high transactions or 

information costs, and some assets have risk characteristics that are difficult or costly to 

hedge. 

Imperfect substitutability of assets implies that changes in the supplies of various 

assets available to private investors may affect the prices and yields of those assets.  

Thus, Federal Reserve purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), for example, 

should raise the prices and lower the yields of those securities; moreover, as investors 

rebalance their portfolios by replacing the MBS sold to the Federal Reserve with other 

assets, the prices of the assets they buy should rise and their yields decline as well.  

Declining yields and rising asset prices ease overall financial conditions and stimulate 

economic activity through channels similar to those for conventional monetary policy.  

Following this logic, Tobin suggested that purchases of longer-term securities by the 

Federal Reserve during the Great Depression could have helped the U.S. economy 

recover despite the fact that short-term rates were close to zero, and Friedman argued for 

large-scale purchases of long-term bonds by the Bank of Japan to help overcome Japan’s 

deflationary trap.5

Schwartz (1982).  Nelson (2011) discusses the relevance of Friedman’s views for recent Federal Reserve 
policy.  For modern treatments of the portfolio balance channel in a macroeconomic context, see Andrés, 
López-Salido, and Nelson (2004).  The portfolio balance channel would be inoperative under various 
strong assumptions that I view as empirically implausible, such as complete and frictionless financial 
markets and full internalization by private investors of the government’s balance sheet (Ricardian 
equivalence).
