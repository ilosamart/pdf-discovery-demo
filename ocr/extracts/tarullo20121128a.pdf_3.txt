While I do not aim to resolve this afternoon the complicated interaction among these 

perspectives and considerations, I will try to outline a practical and reasonable way forward. 

To be effective, a new approach must address the vulnerabilities that have been created 

by the shift in foreign bank activities, in keeping with sound prudential policy and congressional 

mandates in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  At the same 

time, a modified regulatory system should maintain the principle of national treatment and allow 

foreign banks to continue to operate here on an equal competitive footing, to the benefit of the 

U.S. banking system and the U.S. economy generally.

Foreign Bank Regulation in the United States 

Regulating the U.S. operations of foreign banks presents unique challenges.  Although 

U.S. supervisors have full authority over the local operations of foreign banks, we see only a 

portion of a foreign bank’s worldwide activities, and regular access to information on its global 

activities can be limited.  Foreign banks operate under a wide variety of business models and 

structures that reflect the legal, regulatory, and business climates in the home and host 

jurisdictions in which they operate.   

Despite these difficulties, the United States has traditionally accorded foreign banks the 

same national treatment as domestic banks, and U.S. regulators generally have allowed foreign 

banks to choose among structures that they believe promote maximum efficiency at the 

consolidated level.  Under the statutory scheme established by Congress, permissible U.S. 

structures include cross-border branching and direct and indirect subsidiaries, provided that they

 The principle of “national treatment” in the context of financial and other services is that a host country should 

treat a foreign-owned service provider no less favorably than like domestic service providers.  Of course, differences 

in business organization, domestic regulatory systems, and other factors mean that there must sometimes be 

determinations whether foreign and domestic firms are “like” one another in relevant respects.
