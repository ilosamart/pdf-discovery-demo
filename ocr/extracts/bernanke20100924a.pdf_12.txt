distribute model, recent legislation requires regulatory agencies, including the Federal 

Reserve, to develop new standards applicable to securitization activities that would better 

align the incentives faced by market participants involved in the various stages of the 

securitization process.7

Information economics and principal-agent theory are also essential to 

understanding the problems created by so-called too-big-to-fail financial institutions.  

Prior to the crisis, market participants believed that large, complex, and interconnected 

financial firms would not be allowed to fail during a financial crisis.  And, as you know, 

authorities both in the United States and abroad did in fact intervene on a number of 

occasions to prevent the failure of such firms--not out of any special consideration for the 

owners, managers, or creditors of these firms, but because of legitimate concerns about 

potential damage to the financial system and the broader economy.  However, although 

the instability caused by the failure or near-failure of some large firms did indeed prove 

very costly, in some sense the real damage was done before the crisis.  If creditors in 

  And the Securities and Exchange Commission has been charged 

with developing new rules to reduce conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies. 

                                                 
7 The requirements related to credit risk were contained in section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203 (July 2010); with regard to compensation 
practices, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve Issues Proposed 
Guidance on Incentive Compensation,” press release, October 22,

Compensation,” joint press release, June 21,

 Why might government intervention be needed to improve private-sector incentives, when incentives 
presumably exist for the private-sector principals and agents to work out the best incentive structure for 
themselves?  The possibility of problems arising regarding collective action when a firm has many 
shareholders is one rationale.  The standard reason for intervening in banks’ risk-taking practices is the 
existence of deposit insurance, which itself distorts private risk-taking incentives by eliminating any 
incentive of depositors to monitor the activities of their bank; for an early discussion, see John Kareken and 
Neil Wallace (1978), “Deposit Insurance and Bank Regulation:  A Partial-Equilibrium Exposition,” 
Journal of Business, vol. 51 (July), pp. 413-38.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve invoked a “safety and 
soundness” rationale for its guidance on incentive compensation practices.  More generally, as the crisis 
revealed, bad incentives can lead to problems that affect not just the individuals involved but the broader 
financial system as well; such spillovers suggest that regulation can help improve outcomes.
