understates the actual degree of labor market slack.  A decline in the unemployment rate 

could, for example, primarily reflect the exit from the labor force of discouraged job 

seekers.  That is an important reason why the Committee will consider a broad range of 

labor market indicators.  I will discuss some of the additional indicators I plan to consider 

in judging the strength of the labor market in connection with the Committee’s current 

asset purchase program.
 
 

The Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchase Program 

Turning next to that program, the Federal Reserve initiated a new asset purchase 

program last September, extending it in December, under which the Federal Reserve is 

currently buying agency-guaranteed MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-

term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  As with the guidance for the 

federal funds rate, the Committee tied the new program to labor market conditions, 

stating that purchases would continue until there is a substantial improvement in the 

outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.

  The FOMC’s earlier large-

scale asset purchase programs, in contrast, were fixed in size and carried out on a 

specified schedule.  The Committee has also noted that, in determining the size, pace, and 

composition of its asset purchases, it would take appropriate account of the likely 

efficacy and costs of such purchases.   

The purpose of the new asset purchase program is to foster a stronger economic 

recovery, or, put differently, to help the economy attain “escape velocity.”  By lowering 

longer-term interest rates, these asset purchases are expected to spur spending, 

particularly on interest-sensitive purchases such as homes, cars, and other consumer

 The Committee also indicated that it expects the asset purchase program to end well before the target for 

the federal funds rate is raised.
