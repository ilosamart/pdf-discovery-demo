productivity, gains in labor productivity have been meager in recent years.  One broad 

measure of business-sector productivity has risen only 1-1/4 percent per year over the 

past 10 years in the United States and only 1/2 percent, on average, over the past 5 years.  

By contrast, over the 30 years from 1976 to 2005, productivity rose a bit more than 

2 percent per year.  Although the jury is still out on what is behind the latest slowdown in 

productivity gains, prominent scholars such as Robert Gordon and John Fernald suggest 

that smaller increases in productivity are the result of a slowdown in innovation that is 

likely to persist for some time.4     

Lower long-run trend productivity growth, and thus lower trend output growth, 

affects the balance between saving and investment through a variety of channels.  A 

slower pace of innovation means that there will be fewer profitable opportunities in 

which to invest, which will tend to push down investment demand.  Lower productivity 

growth also reduces the future income prospects of households, lowering their 

consumption spending today and boosting their demand for savings.  Thus, slower 

productivity growth implies both lower investment and higher savings, both of which 

tend to push down interest rates.5

5 These effects are what we would expect from our textbook models; they are also at work in the FRB/US 
model being used here.  The empirical evidence on the link between trend growth and long-run equilibrium 
interest rates is mixed.  Laubach and Williams (2003) find evidence of a link that is consistent with the 
predictions of models such as FRB/US.  However, in their well-known paper, Hamilton et al. (2016) 
conclude that while “the theoretical presumption that there is a link between aggregate growth and real 
rates is very strong,” the empirical link between the real equilibrium interest rate and real GDP growth is 
weak.  As stressed by Hamilton et al. there a great deal of uncertainty over the relationship between growth 
and interest rates, likely, in part because of the multitude of shocks to which the economy is subject.  A 
structural model, such as FRB/US, provides one method of estimating the link between growth and interest 
rates by examining the reaction of the interest rate to a clearly defined shock to the trend growth rate.  
However, this reaction occurs within the model economy, and is therefore subject to the particular structure 
and assumptions of the FRB/US model.
