uncertainty associated with this approach should be substantially reduced by the plan to publish 

an updated list of the covered financial institutions each November, along with an indication of 

the bucket to which each firm would have been allocated based on data from the preceding year.  

The Basel Committee will release by the latter part of 2014 additional information relevant to the 

surcharges that will be applied beginning in 2016 -- the thresholds for each surcharge “bucket” 

and the denominator reflecting the universe of global banking institutions against which each G-

SIB will be measured.  To further advance the goals of transparency and predictability, we will 

continue to work within the Basel Committee to ensure that the indicators used to determine the 

systemic-risk ranking of a firm are clear and based upon publicly available information sources.  

If additional information is needed by firms to allow for effective capital planning, the Basel 

Committee should be prepared to develop and release additional guidance. 

Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to impose more stringent capital requirements 

on all bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, not just the U.S. firms that are 

on the list of G-SIBs and will thus have capital surcharges.  No decision has yet been made as to 

whether the more stringent capital requirement to be applied to firms other than those on the 

eventual list of G-SIBs will be in the form of a surcharge.  However, analysis of the systemic 

footprints of other U.S. bank holding companies suggests that even if surcharges were to apply, 

their amounts would be quite modest, at least based on current characteristics of the other bank 

holding companies.   

The third thread of reform in capital regulation is the establishment of regular stress 

testing and capital planning.  Unlike the first two threads, there is no international framework 

that parallels our domestic changes, though stress testing is receiving increased attention in a 

number of other jurisdictions.  These reforms build on the stress test we performed at the height
