pace of recovery in most emerging market economies from the global financial crisis has 

been impressive.  In short, in the past few decades the emerging market economies have 

made significant strides in raising living standards.  Hundreds of millions of people have 

benefited from this progress, with many millions lifted out of poverty.2  To be sure, the 

gap with the advanced economies remains substantial, but it has been narrowed 

significantly.  

These developments raise the question:  How have the emerging market 

economies achieved such strong results in recent decades?  The answer is complex, of 

course, and I can only scratch the surface of these issues today; but I hope to lay out some 

key themes and provide some food for thought. 

Fostering Growth in Developing Economies:  The Washington Consensus 

Ironically, the rapid growth of the emerging market economies reflects in part the 

low levels of development at which they began.  In the economic-growth derby, in 

contrast to most types of competitions, starting from far behind has its advantages.  For 

example, all else being equal, domestic and foreign investors are attracted to the higher 

returns they receive from investments where capital is relatively scarce, as is generally 

the case in poorer countries.  In the 19th century, the United States drew capital from all 

over the world to finance railroad construction; although not all of these investments paid 

off, overall they helped generate enormous increases in wealth by reducing transport 

costs and fostering economic integration within the North American continent.  Similarly, 

emerging market economies in recent decades have attracted substantial foreign 

investment in new manufacturing capacity, in part to take advantage of low labor costs.

fewer people living below the $1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 than 25 years earlier.
