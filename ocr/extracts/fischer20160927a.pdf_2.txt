I am very pleased to visit today with the students and faculty of the Howard 

University Economics Department.  First, a fact that you know but others may not:  The 

Howard University Economics Department is the only producer of economics Ph.D.’s 

among the nation’s historically black colleges and universities, and it has been teaching 

economics to undergraduates for nearly a century.1 

Speaking as one economist to a group among whom I hope will be many future 

economists, let me start by saying that pursuing a degree in economics can bring many 

rewards.  First, an economics degree provides many possible career paths.  The 

discipline’s logical, structured approach to problem solving is valued in many settings, 

including academia, banking, business, consulting, government, and law.  Economics 

majors typically receive salaries that represent a good return on their educational 

investment.  Second, in addition to career prospects and financial rewards, economics 

offers a means of engaging in many of society’s most pressing issues.  The study of 

economics provides a rigorous, analytic perspective on human behavior.  It commands 

respect and has the ability to influence policies that address important issues.  A degree in 

economics will help you understand and participate in these policy debates, putting you 

in a good position to change the world for the better. 

Next, I would like to discuss two current questions that economists are actively 

debating:  First, why is participation in our nation’s labor force declining?  And, second, 

what can be done to improve economic mobility (the ability to climb the economic
