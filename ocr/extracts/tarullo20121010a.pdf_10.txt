economic growth and other considerations where it is used as an informing concept for a 

regulatory exercise or a factor to be considered in regulatory approvals.  Moreover, one does not 

really find in the statute or in its legislative history an implicit theory of financial stability from 

which to infer answers to the regulatory questions just noted.  Instead, Dodd-Frank directs 

regulation at a number of perceived vulnerabilities created by large financial firms in particular, 

and to some degree in the financial system as a whole.  To the extent one can fairly induce an 

underlying principle, it is that the moral hazard associated with too-big-to-fail institutions should 

be counteracted in a variety of ways. 

 The emphasis on too-big-to-fail institutions is both understandable and appropriate in 

light of the experiences of 2008, including the major injections of government capital to stabilize 

some of the nation’s largest firms.  And the absence of an informing, grand unified theory of 

financial stability is hardly surprising in light of the history to which I alluded earlier.  Indeed, 

two years after passage of Dodd-Frank, there is not really an officially embraced consensus 

theory of how financial stability is undermined.  The first report of the new Office of Financial 

Research – one of the more useful analyses of financial stability issued by the official sector – 

does not attempt a theory of financial stability.  It defines financial stability descriptively rather 

than analytically, “that the financial system is operating sufficiently to provide its basic functions 

for the economy even under stress,”22 and pragmatically tries to identify risks and vulnerabilities. 

Yet much of the theoretical work on financial stability of the last several years has 

suggested that financial instability is, in important ways, endogenous to the financial system, or 

at least the kind of financial system that has developed in recent decades.  The Office of 

Financial Research report just cited went on to note that the financial crisis had “served as a 

painful reminder that the financial system is prone to internal instability.”23  Contributions to the
