The three key components of AI--algorithms, processing power, and big data--are all 

increasingly accessible.  Due to an early commitment to open-source principles, AI algorithms 

from some of the largest companies are available to even nascent startups.4  As for processing 

power, continuing innovation by public cloud providers means that with only a laptop and a 

credit card, it is possible to tap into some of the world’s most powerful computing systems by 

paying only for usage time, without having to build out substantial hardware infrastructure.  

Vendors have made it easy to use these tools for even small businesses and non-technology 

firms, including in the financial sector.  Public cloud companies provide access to pre-trained AI 

models via developer-friendly application programming interfaces or even “drop and drag” tools 

for creating sophisticated AI models.5  Most notably, the world is creating data to feed those 

models at an ever-increasing rate.  Whereas in 2013 it was estimated that 90 percent of the 

world’s data had been created in the prior two years, by 2016, IBM estimated that 90 percent of 

global data had been created in the prior year alone.6 

The pace and ubiquity of AI innovation have surprised even experts.  The best AI result 

on a popular image recognition challenge improved from a 26 percent error rate to 3.5 percent in 

just four years.  That is lower than the human error rate of 5 percent.7  In one study, a 

combination AI-human approach brought the error rate down even further--to 0.5 percent.
