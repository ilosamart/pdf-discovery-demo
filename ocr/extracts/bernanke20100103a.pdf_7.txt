positive numbers that describe how strongly the policy rate should respond to deviations 

of inflation from its target and of output from its potential. 

As we would expect, the Taylor rule tells policymakers that interest rates should 

be higher when inflation is above target, ( 0 , or when output is above its 

potential, 0.  Taylor (1993) estimated the long-run real value of the federal 

funds rate to be about 2 percent.  The equation for the Taylor rule accordingly shows that 

when inflation and output are equal to their targets, the federal funds rate--which is 

expressed here in nominal terms--should equal 2 plus the rate of inflation.  Equivalently, 

when inflation and output equal their targets, the real value of the federal funds rate 

should equal 2 percent. 

 To make the Taylor rule equation shown in Slide 2 operational, one needs to 

specify numerical values for the coefficients a and b, choose appropriate indicators of 

inflation and output, and specify a target rate for inflation and a measure of potential 

output.  In his 1993 paper introducing his eponymous rule, Taylor suggested setting both 

a and b equal to 0.5.  So, for example, according to the original Taylor rule, if output 

rises 1 percent relative to its potential, then, all else equal, the Federal Reserve should 

raise its policy rate by 0.5 percent, or 50 basis points.  Following Taylor’s suggestions for 

parameter values, in Slide 3 we show by the dashed red line the values of the federal 

funds rate implied by the Taylor rule for the period from 2000 to the present, with 

inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the Fed’s assumed inflation target 

set to 2 percent, output measured by real GDP, and the output gap as estimated 

retrospectively by the Federal Reserve’s primary forecasting model, the FRB/US model.
