more diverse set of small business borrowers.  In some cases, partnerships between 

community banks and online platforms may help expand access to credit for consumers 

and small businesses, and help banks retain and grow their customer base.   

As regulators, we also want to help the various stakeholders anticipate and 

carefully manage the associated risks.  Of course, third-party and vendor risks are factors 

that banks should always take into account when introducing new products and services.  

Taking the time to identify and mitigate risks is a prudent step that banks can take to 

avoid unintended consequences when entering into partnership agreements with 

alternative online lenders.  In addition, banks should consider whether the partnerships 

provide new opportunities to diversify their portfolios if they are purchasing loans, and 

whether the partnerships provide opportunities to offer new products that are a good 

strategic fit for their bank and their customers.21   

It is also important for banks to carefully consider regulatory compliance.  When 

purchasing consumer loans originated by online alternative lenders, banks should 

examine whether fair lending or unfair or deceptive acts or practices issues result from 

the origination and underwriting methods used by online alternative lenders.22  To the 

extent that the underlying algorithms used for credit decisionmaking use nontraditional 

                                                 
21 If a bank is considering a referral partnership, the following questions could help identify potential risks:  

Do existing customers have a need for the product or are there less expensive products that would better 

serve borrower’s needs?  Are the features, risks, and terms of the products offered through the referral 

program explained clearly and conspicuously, or are they buried in a lengthy document full of “legalese” 

that makes it difficult for borrowers to make a truly informed choice?  Finally, are the products offered 

through the referral partnership consistent with what would be recommended to a family member?  (See 

Curran, 2013.) 
22 There are several regulatory compliance-related questions that banks should consider.  For example, have 

the loans offered or the lending platform to be partnered with been reviewed for compliance with 

applicable federal and state laws?  Have the loans originated by the partnering lending platform been 

reviewed from a consumer fairness standpoint?  When assessing referral partnerships, have any issues been 

identified that would lead to disparate treatment of customers if banks selectively refer customers to online 

alternative lending partners?  (See Federal Reserve System Community Banking Connections Advisory 

Board, 2014).
