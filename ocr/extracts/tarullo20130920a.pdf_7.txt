The Crockett speech holds up very well today.  With the benefit of the experience 

gained from the intervening financial crisis, an intense period of analysis from a 

macroprudential perspective, and a variety of regulatory initiatives, I offer these five 

propositions both to reinforce and to supplement the views Sir Andrew expressed 13 

years ago. 

Five Propositions for a Macroprudential Approach to Regulating Financial 

Institutions 

1.  A Macroprudential Perspective Should Dominate the Regulation and 

Supervision of Large Financial Institutions.  Sir Andrew entitled his speech “Marrying 

the Micro- and Macro-Prudential Dimensions of Financial Stability,” suggesting an equal 

partnership between the two regulatory dimensions, as he called them.  My own sense is 

that we need to concentrate our post-crisis efforts to reshape the regulation and 

supervision of large financial institutions on measures reflecting the macroprudential 

dimension, at least for a time.  This view is consistent with the Congressional emphasis 

on financial stability and systemic risk considerations in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

To be sure, idiosyncratic problems such as certain operational risks may threaten 

large institutions, and traditional regulation and supervision surely have an important 

ongoing role to play.  But the dynamics observed during the financial crisis of highly 

correlated asset holdings, shared risks, and contagion among the largest firms suggest that 

the well-being of any one of these firms cannot be considered in isolation from the well-

being of the system as a whole.  Severe problems at such institutions are far more likely

 Elsewhere I have discussed this emphasis at some length. See Daniel K. Tarullo (2012), “Financial 

Stability Regulation,” speech delivered at the Distinguished Jurist Lecture, University of Pennsylvania Law 

School, Philadelphia, PA, October 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121010a.htm.
