I do not need to trumpet the benefits that community banks provide right now.  But I will 

highlight that post-crisis research regarding these banks is moving front and center and shows 

that these banks provided public benefits in the crisis and in the recovery stage after the crisis.

For example, data show that community banks played an important cushioning role in the 

aftermath of the collapse of the market for jumbo mortgages.  When the market for private-label, 

mortgage-backed securities collapsed in 2007, so too did jumbo mortgage lending as liquidity 

dried up.

  In the immediate aftermath, despite a substantial reduction in jumbo lending as a 

share of the overall mortgage market, the data indicate that the share of community bank jumbo 

mortgage lending held steady.  Such lending actually increased at community banks that were 

not dependent on correspondent banking and at those that were sufficiently well capitalized and 

more profitable.  And, by their sheer numbers and their central role in local communities, these 

banks are vital and competitive players in a highly diverse landscape for financial services.  They 

often provide competitive options where none would otherwise exist, thereby lower borrowing 

costs for businesses and consumers.   

Whether we single them out for special advantage is a question for legitimate debate.  

What I do know is that what we most certainly should not do is hinder them from engaging in a 

fair fight.

 To highlight the importance of such research, the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank 

Supervisors will host a conference on “Community Banking in the 21
st
 Century” at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. 

Louis on October 2-3, 2013.  More information is available at: http://www.stlouisfed.org/banking/community-

Case of the 2007 Collapse of the Private-Label RMBS Market,” (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System, August 15), www.federalreserve.gov/events/conferences/2011/rsr/papers/CalemCovasWu.pdf.  

Publication is also forthcoming in the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking.  This paper did not specifically 

address community bank lending, but the authors conducted subsequent analysis of community bank data using the 

methodology set forth in the paper.
