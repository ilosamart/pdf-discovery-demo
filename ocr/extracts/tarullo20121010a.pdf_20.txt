But would prohibiting that transaction mean that the current small group of very large, integrated 

financial firms would have their market positions essentially protected by the financial stability 

considerations?  Such an outcome would be ironic indeed.  The Federal Reserve could, if it so 

chose, avail itself of the discretion to balance different effects by allowing the merger on pro-

competition grounds.  Such a decision would place the Fed in the position of effectively deciding 

broader questions of industry structure in the context of a single case.  But, then again, a 

prohibition of the merger would do the same, the only difference being the substantive structure 

being chosen. 

Yet even before this kind of balancing of positive and adverse effects was reached, there 

would surely be an argument that ensconcing the existing large integrated firms would itself 

increase risks to financial stability, since these firms that are each the product of prior mergers 

might be the only ones capable of growing more in key parts of the financial services market.  

Here again, the absence of a theory of financial stability that informs the law complicates the 

problem, though it is not altogether clear that convergence around such a theory would solve it. 

The foregoing questions underscore the difficulties entailed in anticipating the range of 

financial issues that may be presented in merger cases and in trying to resolve the issues that 

have been anticipated solely through consideration of hypotheticals.  This conclusion is one of 

the reasons the Federal Reserve decided not to develop and issue a rule or detailed guidance on 

the financial stability factor.  There simply isn’t the accumulation of experience and of 

thoughtful evaluation of these issues by people both in and out of government to inform 

something akin to the merger guidelines published by the antitrust agencies.   

Accordingly, the Federal Reserve is very much taking a case-by-case approach to these 

reviews.  As described in a recent order, “the Board expects that it will generally find a
