has repeatedly demonstrated, these sorts of fundamentals only explain a small part of the 

variation in the prices of assets such as equities, long-term Treasury securities, and 

corporate bonds.  The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call 

“changes in discount rates,” which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff 

that we don’t understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor 

sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered 

investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad 

heading of internal market dynamics.  

 This observation reminds us that it often doesn’t make sense to try to explain a 

large movement in asset prices by looking for a correspondingly large change in 

expectations about economic fundamentals.  So while we have seen very significant 

increases in long-term Treasury yields since the FOMC meeting, I think it is a mistake to 

infer from these movements that there must have been an equivalently big change in 

monetary policy fundamentals.  Nothing we have said suggests a change in our reaction 

function for the path of the short-term policy rate, and my sense is that our sharpened 

guidance on the duration of the asset purchase program also leaves us close to where 

market expectations--as expressed, for example, in various surveys that we monitor--were

seen in the past couple of weeks are inconsequential or can be dismissed as mere noise.  

To the contrary, they potentially have much to teach us about the dynamics of financial 

markets and how these dynamics are influenced by changes in our communications 

strategy.  My only point is that consumers and businesses who look to asset prices for
