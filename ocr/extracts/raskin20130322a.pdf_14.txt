The Role of Business 

Now let’s shift back to the private sector. In particular, to the question of whether 

businesses can be competitive in the current marketplace and still provide a pathway out 

of poverty for their employees.  The Hitachi Foundation recently set out to answer this 

question by identifying firms that provided upward job mobility for their employees.  

They found that the identified employers showed noteworthy consistency in how they 

train and educate workers, develop career ladders, and craft supportive human resources 

policies and other motivators.  They also found some evidence to indicate that the 

companies benefited from strategic and financial returns while their lower-wage workers 

also benefited from increased earnings and career advancement.18,19 

“Anchor institutions,” such as hospitals and universities, which are firmly rooted 

in their locales, can also be powerful engines for job creation in their communities. 

Anchors may include cultural institutions, health care facilities, community foundations, 

faith-based institutions, public utilities, and municipal governments.  These institutions 

have the potential to generate local jobs through targeted procurement purchases of food,

19 While the common perception may be that businesses do not invest in employee training, a survey by the American 
Society for Training and Development indicated that employers committed $172 billion in 2011 to employee training.  
See American Society for Training and Development (2011), “2011 State of the Industry Report Shows Increased 
Spending, Commitment for L&D,” December 20, www.astd.org/Publications/Blogs/ASTD-Blog/2011/12/2011-State-
of-the-Industry-report-Shows-Increased-Spending-Commitment-for-LD. This investment, however, traditionally funds 
the highest-educated and highest-paid employees. The Hitachi Foundation has suggested that considering a reallocation 
of even a small portion of these funds toward frontline workers would offer benefits to both employers and employees.  
As an example of these employer practices, right here in our backyard, the Community Foundation for the National 
Capital Region piloted the “Career Navigators” program with three hospitals in Maryland’s Montgomery County and 
one in the District of Columbia to help employees navigate a pathway to better jobs with their current employer.  These 
hospitals concluded that investing in training and education for top-performing, entry-level staffers in positions such as 
housekeeping, food service, and patient transport could provide a pipeline for the skilled employees that the hospitals 
would rely upon in the future.  Employees receive support with literacy and college-readiness training, career coaching, 
and scholarships.  The program also helps hospitals document internal career pathways and train the human resource 
staff to serve as career coaches.  Throughout these efforts, the participating hospitals have reported enhanced employee 
engagement, reduced errors, and improved performance.
