that these and other Americans face.  Education and training, of course, are vital.  Later 

today, I will visit one program that helps workers in West Philadelphia learn new skills 

and then connects them with potential employers, an initiative in which government, 

businesses, and local institutions are working together successfully.   

While the economy has made great strides toward the FOMC’s objective of 

maximum employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation 

objective.  Inflation has run persistently below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the past 

several years even as the labor market strengthened significantly.5  Over the 12 months 

through April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about 1 

percent.  But I remain optimistic, because two factors that have been holding down 

inflation will likely prove only temporary.  First, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since 

the middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products, 

significantly restraining overall inflation.  At about the same time, the foreign exchange 

value of the dollar strengthened, holding down prices of imported goods.  But oil prices 

have stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this year.  And, 

since the beginning of the year, the dollar has been roughly unchanged against a broad 

basket of currencies.  As the downward pressure on prices from these two forces 

dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to 

2 percent.  

                                                 
5 The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but very low inflation typically 
means very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset 
adverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that recessions and the associated job losses 
would be more severe and persistent.  In addition, persistent and unexpectedly low inflation may 
significantly raise the real cost of making mortgage and other loan payments if accompanied by (as is 
typically the case) smaller-than-anticipated nominal income gains.
