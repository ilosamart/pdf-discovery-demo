The question of whether to “lean against” the credit cycle through supervisory 

policy--and when, and with what tools--is a difficult one.16  An important threshold 

question is whether supervisors will be able to correctly and in a timely manner identify 

“dangerous” conditions in credit markets, without too many false positives and without 

unnecessarily limiting credit availability by interfering with market forces.  Interesting 

recent research seeks to identify observable variables that could be used to monitor credit 

conditions and detect trends that could threaten the performance of the real economy in 

the future.17  This research is promising, and it could be used by supervisors to inform 

their thinking as it develops further.  In the meantime, unless there is a plausible threat to 

the core of the system or potential for damaging fire sales, I would set a high bar for 

supervisory interventions to lean against the credit cycle.  Such interventions would 

almost surely interfere with the traditional function of capital markets in allocating capital 

to productive uses and dispersing risk to the investors who willingly choose to bear it.   

Finally, another issue to consider when contemplating such intervention is that, 

particularly in the United States, activity is free to migrate outside the commercial 

banking system into less regulated entities.  As supervisory scrutiny has increased in 

recent years, a growing number of nonbanks have become involved in the distribution of 

leveraged loans.  Migration of this activity could be either a net positive or a net negative 

for financial stability, depending on whether it actually transfers risk irrevocably from the 

16 The U.S. banking agencies, following the lead of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, created a 
countercyclical capital buffer that could be activated during periods of excess aggregate credit growth.  The  
Basel proposal can both “lean against the cycle” and create a capital cushion to absorb losses from the 
likely increase in defaults.
