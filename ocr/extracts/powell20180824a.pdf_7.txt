that shortfall was temporary--perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis--or was part of a 

new normal.  

These assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further 

revision.  To return to the nautical metaphor, the FOMC has been navigating between the 

shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be 

shifting navigational guides.  Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two 

much discussed historical episodes--the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the 

“new economy” period of the late 1990s.  

Shifting Stars and the Great Inflation 

While the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways, the 

shifting of the stars is not one of them.  Figure 2 illustrates the Congressional Budget 

Office’s (CBO) current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and 

potential GDP growth from 1960 to 2000.5  Viewed against the ups and downs observed 

over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer-run values are not all that dramatic.  

Of course, these CBO estimates benefit from many years of hindsight, whereas monetary 

policy must be based on assessments made in real time.  The Great Inflation period 

vividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises.  

Around 1965, the United States entered a period of high and volatile inflation that 

ended with inflation in double digits in the early 1980s.  Multiple factors, including 

monetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation.  Many researchers have 

concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis

run values have only been reported since 2009.
