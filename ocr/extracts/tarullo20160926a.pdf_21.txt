Default of a common counterparty and the reaction of central counterparties 

Currently, the annual stress test incorporates a counterparty default scenario component 

for the eight G-SIBs that measures direct credit loss.  However, this component does not 

consider the potentially large second-round effects of the default of a major financial institution, 

including an increase in the probability of default of other counterparties as a result of the initial 

default and requirements for larger margins from derivatives counterparties.  Of particular 

interest is the role of central counterparties (CCPs) in alleviating or transmitting stress from the 

default of one of their members.  By regulatory design, CCPs have increased in prominence in 

the post-crisis environment because they can lead to greater efficiency and transparency in 

trading.  But this increased role makes it important to understand the impact they may have in 

stressed conditions.  For example, CCPs collect prefunded resources that can mitigate the impact 

of a default, but also can call on surviving clearing members for additional financial resources if 

those pre-funded resources are exhausted.  

Promoting transparency 

Transparency has played an important role in making stress testing such a key part of 

post-crisis prudential regulation.  Transparency of the scenarios and results gives investors and 

analysts valuable information about the condition of the tested banks, thereby contributing to 

market discipline.  It also allows the public to evaluate the job that the Federal Reserve is doing.  

For example, analysts can compare our loss estimates for specified portfolios under specified 

stress conditions with their own evaluations--an exercise that can inform both the analysts and 

us.   

There are three areas in which transparency considerations need to be applied.  First is the 

set of scenarios applied in the annual exercise.  We release essentially all details of the scenarios
