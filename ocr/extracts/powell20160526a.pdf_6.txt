the crisis (figure 3).  Given the global nature of the phenomenon, changes in factors 

specific to the United States are probably not the main drivers.   

One factor holding back productivity in recent years has been the meager growth 

in the business sector’s capital stock (figure 4).  This weakness is consistent with the 

weak recovery in demand.4  Another important factor is the marked decline in total factor 

productivity (TFP) growth (figure 5).  TFP is that part of productivity that is not 

explained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of 

technological innovation.5  A broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be 

contributing to lower TFP.6  There is strong evidence that the slowdown in TFP growth 

in the United States preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or 

use information technologies.7

FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 21), 
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/perspectives-on-the-recent-weakness-in-
investments-20140521.html.  Their analysis indicates that investment growth over the expansion has been 
consistent with a model using business output growth and the user cost of capital.  In a second model, they 
show that the modest increases in the capital stock are consistent with the increase in labor supply and TFP.   
5 Over long periods of time total factor productivity is primarily driven by innovation, knowledge and the 
efficiency with which inputs are put to use owing to the evolution of business practices as well as the 
influences of public capital stock, government regulations and other factors.  Over shorter periods of time 
TFP will also capture the variations in the intensity of utilization of inputs, such as capacity utilization and 
hours per worker.  Disentangling TFP from capital deepening and hours worked can be challenging.

Entrepreneurship in U.S. Job Creation and Economic Dynamism,” Journal of Economic Perspectives,

Recession,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29, no. 1 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of 
Economic Research).  Some have argued that part of the TFP slowdown may actually be a measurement 
problem, owing to the difficulty in measuring the productivity of health care, information technology, and 
other services.  Others see the evidence for that claim as weak.  For example, a recent paper finds little 
evidence that the slowdown arises from growing mismeasurement in information-technology-related goods 
and services.  See David M. Byrne, John G. Fernald, and Marshall B. Reinsdorf (2016), “Does the United 
States Have a Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic 
Activity, March 4, www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2016/byrne-et-al-productivity-
