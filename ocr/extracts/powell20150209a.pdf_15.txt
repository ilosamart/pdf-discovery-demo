urge caution regarding current proposals that threaten just such political influence and 

place restrictions on the very tools that so recently proved essential in preventing a new 

depression.  Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve, including its conduct of 

monetary policy, is extensive, but no doubt could be improved in ways that do not 

threaten the Fedâ€™s effectiveness.  I would welcome discussions with the Congress about 

ways to aid its important oversight of monetary policy.  There may be differing views of 

how Congress can best carry out this responsibility, but there can be no disagreement 

about the purpose of such oversight, which is to help the Federal Reserve succeed in 

promoting a healthy economy and a strong and stable financial system.  Those are the 

goals Congress assigned the Federal Reserve a century ago, and I am optimistic that 

Congress and the Fed will continue to work together to pursue them on behalf of the 

American people.
