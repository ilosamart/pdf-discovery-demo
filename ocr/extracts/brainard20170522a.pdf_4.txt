the FOMC to navigate the current recovery in a way that has likely brought more people 

back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed, aggregate 

unemployment-rate target based on pre-crisis norms, in effect, achieving more inclusive 

growth.  This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips curve relationship 

between unemployment and inflation is extremely flat for reasons we do not fully 

understand.  

When we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we often find 

significant and persistent racial disparities.4  For many decades, the unemployment rate 

of African Americans has been nearly double the national unemployment rate, with little 

indication that the relative difference is narrowing or that it can be fully accounted for by 

education or sectoral mix; the unemployment rate for Hispanics also has consistently 

been higher than the national unemployment rate.5  Similarly, during the Great 

Recession, the unemployment rates of African Americans and Hispanics rose more 

sharply and rapidly than for workers as a whole.6  Even though the unemployment rates 

of these groups are back around their pre-recession levels, they remain higher than the 

national average.  We can also see persistent disparities by gender, such as the well-

known wage premium earned by men relative to women with similar experience and 

expertise.7  With its focus on inclusive growth, this Institute could give us important 

insights on how far the overall economy is from full employment, as well as the barriers

references therein for research on racial and gender differences in the labor market.  
5 Cajner and others (2017) find that the higher, more cyclical unemployment of African Americans than 
whites cannot be fully accounted for by differences in education, age, marital status, and state of residence.
