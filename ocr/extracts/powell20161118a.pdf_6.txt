Finally, of course, China looms large in any discussion of the global trade slowdown.   

Not only is China’s trade being affected by all of the factors just discussed, but on-going 

structural changes within the Chinese economy, including rebalancing toward domestic demand, 

are exerting an independent effect on world trade flows.  So, let’s look next at China in more 

detail.7 

China 

After years of rapid export-led growth, China is now among the world’s leaders in both 

exports and imports.  China’s exports now account for 14 percent of the world’s total, compared 

with only 4 percent 15 years ago.  At the same time, China’s industrialization and export model 

has greatly increased its own demand for imports of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and parts 

and components.  In recent years, however, growth in both Chinese imports and Chinese exports 

has slowed markedly.  These developments have had a significant effect on global trade.  One 

simple way to measure that effect is to consider what would have happened if China’s trade had 

not decelerated.  As shown in slide 7, under a counterfactual in which China’s trade growth had 

not slowed relative to its GDP since 2011, global trade would still be growing as a share of 

GDP.8 


7 Another explanation that has been put forward for much of the decline in world trade relative to world GDP is an 
increased weight of EMEs in the contribution to global growth together with the property that EMEs have lower 
income elasticities of trade than advanced economies do. (See European Central Bank, 2016.)  However, more 
broadly, the literature does not seem to suggest that income elasticities are significantly lower for EMEs (for 
example, Lui and others, 2013).  Also, while trade financing constraints—another potential explanation—played 
some role during the severe trade slowdown during the Global Financial Crisis, trade financing does not appear to 
have become more difficult since 2011 and likely has not been a significant factor in the slowdown in recent years.
