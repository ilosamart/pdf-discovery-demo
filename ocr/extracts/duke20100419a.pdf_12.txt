women, when compared to earnings for similar workers who did not attend community college.  

The majority of these gains were from math, science, and other technically oriented courses.7  

In addition to the need to bridge a substantial skills gap in many job markets, the 

challenge of connecting the residents of poor neighborhoods to jobs often entails overcoming 

informational and transportation barriers.  These problems are illustrated by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Boston’s research and fieldwork in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Springfield was one of 

the concentrated poverty case studies.  The Boston Bank noted that Springfield residents with a 

high school education were less likely to be employed than similarly educated residents of 

comparable cities.  The Reserve Bank’s research found that Springfield area employers rely 

heavily on referrals from existing employees in the screening process for entry-level jobs.  

Unfortunately, many residents of the poor neighborhoods of Springfield lack connections to 

current jobholders, putting them at a disadvantage relative to other job seekers.  In many cases, 

they also lack the transportation options necessary to reach potential jobs.  For example, 

manufacturing, construction, and other jobs suitable to the residents’ competencies increasingly 

require that they commute outside of Springfield’s urban core.  However, low car-ownership 

rates among inner-city residents and limited public transportation options during nights and 

weekends and to suburban locations can exacerbate the challenges of connecting with job 

opportunities.  As a follow up to the case study, the Boston Bank recommended expanded 

training, internship, mentorship, outreach, and other programs designed to develop Springfield’s 

human capital and job market connections.  Moreover, the Reserve Bank has encouraged 

employers and public officials to devise solutions to address commuting difficulties.
