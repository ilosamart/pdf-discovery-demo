factors when making credit decisions.  In particular, they often respond with greater 

agility to lending requests than their national competitors because of their detailed 

knowledge of the needs of their customers and their close ties to the communities they 

serve.  

While community banks have certain natural advantages, they also face an array 

of challenges, stemming from both the current economy and, to some extent, from their 

business model.  The close ties of community banks to local economies is a source of 

strength, as I mentioned, but those close linkages have drawbacks as well, most notably 

the resulting concentration of exposures to those same local economies.  Strong 

community banks take measures to counteract this risk, but it is not possible to fully 

manage it away.  Thus, the fortunes of communities and their banks tend to rise and fall 

together.  Community banks must also manage concentration risks arising from their 

specialization in certain categories of lending.  For example, larger banks have used their 

scale to gain a pricing advantage over community banks in volume-driven businesses 

such as consumer lending.  This strategy, in turn, has exacerbated a long-standing trend 

toward a greater concentration of community bank lending in certain areas less dependent 

on volume, such as loans secured by commercial real estate.  Community banks will need 

to continue their ongoing efforts to prudently diversify their revenue sources. 

Like larger banks, community banks are also being affected by the state of the 

national economy.  Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been 

frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending.  As I will discuss 

later, actual and prospective changes in the regulatory landscape have also raised 

concerns among community bankers.  These headwinds notwithstanding, measures of the
