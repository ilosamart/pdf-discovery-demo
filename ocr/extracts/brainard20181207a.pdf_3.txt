are now growing around 3 percent, the highest level since the crisis.  These are welcome 

developments.  

While the most recent reading on core personal consumption expenditures, or 

PCE, inflation ticked down, indicators of underlying trend inflation remain encouraging 

overall, providing little signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, 

and reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be close to our target of 2 percent, on 

the other (figure 1). 

The economy has grown 3 percent over the past year, and there are good reasons 

to expect growth to remain solid next year, supported by the strong underlying 

momentum in domestic demand.  Consumer spending looks to be robust going into the 

fourth quarter, and ongoing gains in income and employment provide positive 

fundamentals.  In addition, business investment should be solid, even with recent declines 

in oil prices.  Sizable fiscal stimulus has provided an important boost to demand this year 

and will likely contribute somewhat further next year, given the usual lags in outlays and 

in the effects of tax cuts on business and household spending.   

The most likely path for the economy is positive, although some tailwinds that 

have provided a boost are fading, and we may face some crosscurrents.  The global 

growth that provided a strong tailwind going into this year has moderated.  The earlier 

strong growth in Europe and Japan appears to be softening toward trend.  China is 

shifting to an accommodative policy stance to contend with a challenging trade 

environment and lagged effects from its earlier tightening.  Here at home, the impetus to 

growth from fiscal policy is likely to fade going into 2020.  And after being exceptionally 

accommodative, financial conditions have tightened in recent months.  Financial
