But it is also true that little research has been undertaken that distinguishes 

between banks and nonbanks, or highlights how their interactions are driven by economic 

incentives.  Such research could guide regulator efforts to collect data and set policies to 

limit possible instabilities associated with interconnectedness.  At one level, this is not 

surprising:  As we all know, models are abstractions; nonetheless, improving the 

conceptual toolkit with which we gauge interconnectedness along practical dimensions is 

clearly needed.18 

Summary 

My current assessment of the risks to financial stability remains tentative and 

subject to change as we learn more or conditions shift.  Policymakers and researchers 

need better models and data to understand the interconnections between the banking 

system and nonbank financial institutions.  Indeed, one of the themes of this conference is 

data needs, and the focus on this issue is an important aspect of this conference.   

History has demonstrated that risks evolve in response to regulatory pressure and 

the animal spirits that emerge as memories fade, as well as to animal spirits.  As a result, 

the infrastructure needed to learn the things we don’t know needs to be put in place.  An 

essential element of that infrastructure is learning the lessons of history – both the lessons 

of what happened, and the fact that supervisors and regulators will on occasion be 

surprised.  Learning those lessons is not as simple a task as it may sound.  But it is 

certainly a far more important task than it sounds. 

                                                   
18 In a sense, this section has discussed what soon after the collapse of Lehman Brothers began to be called 
“macroprudential supervision”, by which at that stage was meant supervision that focused on the dynamics 
of the financial system that resulted from interactions among financial institutions, of which the worldwide 
impact of the Lehman failure was the outstanding example. Over the course of a few years, the term 
“macroprudential policies” began generally to be used as a description of sector-specific policy instruments 
that could be used to deal with potential instabilities in a particular sector, usually the housing sector.
