In fact, Los Angeles’s peak unemployment rate in 2010 was the highest ever recorded in 

this city in the almost four decades during which local-area statistics have been 

published.  In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the contraction in the housing sector 

has been even more extreme than for the nation as a whole.  Home prices have fallen 

nearly 40 percent from their peak, while the issuance of building permits for the 

construction of new homes dropped nearly 90 percent.  

At the national level, the economy has been recovering for more than two and a 

half years.  But the pace of this recovery has been slower than the pace of prior 

recoveries.  Over the past 50 years in the United States, real GDP has typically expanded 

10 percent cumulatively during the 10 quarters immediately following the trough of a 

recession.  By contrast, real GDP has only risen 6 percent over the 10-quarter period 

since the bottom of the most recent recession.  Indeed, it was only in the third quarter of 

last year that real GDP finally returned to the level that it had attained prior to the 

recession.  However, measured on a per capita basis, households’ real disposable 

personal income still was below its pre-recession peak at the end of last year.  Moreover, 

as of March of this year, employment at the national level had risen by only 3-1/2 million 

jobs, less than half of the number of jobs lost during the recession, and the unemployment 

rate was still significantly elevated at 8.2 percent.   

Even though general economic activity and labor market conditions have 

improved modestly in the past two and a half years or so, house prices have continued to 

trend down, albeit at a slower pace than in 2007 and 2008.  And single-family housing 

starts have shown no noticeable increase since their low point in the middle of 2009, 

although multifamily construction has been rising with the expanding demand for rental
