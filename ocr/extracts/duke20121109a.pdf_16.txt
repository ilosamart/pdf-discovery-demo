banks are important to the mortgage market, that they are able to relieve some capacity 

constraints at the margin, that mortgage lending is important to their balance sheets and their 

profitability in the aggregate, and that they are a source of responsible lending.  Their lending is 

likely most important in the market for non-standard properties or borrowers.  

Having confirmed these conditions, I am convinced that the best course for policymakers 

would be to abandon efforts for a one-size-fits-all approach to mortgage lending.  Balancing the 

cost of regulation that is prescriptive with respect to underwriting, loan structure, and operating 

procedures against the lack of evidence that balance sheet lending by community banks created 

significant problems, I think an argument can be made that it is appropriate to establish a 

separate, simpler regulatory structure to cover such lending.  Such a regime should still establish 

appropriate safeguards to protect consumers, but it should do so in a way that recognizes the 

characteristics of community bank lending, perhaps by focusing on appropriate disclosures and 

relying on regular on-site supervision to test for appropriate underwriting and loan structuring.  

I originally requested this information to help me understand the implications of 

mortgage risk weightings in the capital proposal.  But as I investigated the data, I realized that 

the regulatory burden surrounding mortgages extends beyond the capital rules and that 

addressing the problem will take more than a tweak here or an exemption there.  I think it will 

require a different approach.  The regulators cannot, on their own, craft a new approach to 

regulating mortgage lending by community banks.  However, I hope that this data will be useful 

to bankers and policymakers as they discuss more broadly the establishment of a regulatory 

regime that preserves the important role of community banks in mortgage lending.
