Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Alternatives to the Use of 
Credit Ratings in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Banking 
Agencies

ACTION: Joint Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  
 
SUMMARY:  The regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the agencies) 
include various references to and requirements based on the use of credit ratings issued 
by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs).  Section 939A of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), enacted on July 
21, 2010, requires the agencies to review their regulations that (1) require the use of an 
assessment of credit-worthiness of a security or money market instrument and (2) make 
reference to, or have requirements regarding, credit ratings.  The agencies must then 
modify their regulations to remove any reference to, or requirements of reliance on, credit 
ratings in such regulations and substitute in their place other standards of credit-
worthiness that the agencies determine to be appropriate for such regulations.   
 
 This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) describes the areas in the 



 2

agencies’ risk-based capital standards and Basel changes that could affect those standards 
that make reference to credit ratings and requests comment on potential alternatives to the 
use of credit ratings.

I. BACKGROUND  

 The agencies’ regulations and capital standards include various references to and 
regulatory requirements based on the use of credit ratings issued by NRSROs.1  Section 
939A of the Act requires each Federal agency to review “(1) any regulation issued by 
such agency that requires the use of an assessment of the credit-worthiness of a security 
or money market instrument; and (2) any references to or requirements in such 
regulations regarding credit ratings.” 2  Each Federal agency must then “modify any such 
regulations identified by the review … to remove any reference to or requirement of 
reliance on credit ratings and to substitute in such regulations such standard of credit-
worthiness as each respective agency shall determine as appropriate for such 
regulations.”  In developing substitute standards of credit-worthiness, an agency “shall 
seek to establish, to the extent feasible, uniform standards of credit-worthiness” for use 
by the agency, taking into account the entities it regulates that would be subject to such 
standards.3   

 Through this advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), the agencies are 
seeking to gather information as they begin to work toward revising their regulations and 
capital standards to comply with the Act.  This ANPR describes the areas in the agencies’ 
general risk-based capital rules,4 market risk rules,5 and advanced approaches rules6 
(collectively, the risk-based capital standards) where the agencies rely on credit ratings, 
as well as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) recent 
amendments to the Basel Accord.7  The ANPR requests comment on potential 

                                                 
1A nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) is an entity registered with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an NRSRO under section 15E of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934.  See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7, as implemented by 17 CFR 240.17g-1.  On September 29, 2006, the 
President signed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (“Reform Act”) (Pub. L. 109-291) into law.  
The Reform Act requires a credit rating agency that wants to represent itself as an NRSRO to register with 
the SEC. 
 
2 Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, section 939A (July 21, 2010).  Although the agencies have 
conducted a broad review of their risk-based capital regulations to identify all references to credit ratings 
and consider alternatives, the agencies note that section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act limits the required          
review of agency regulations to those pertaining to a credit-worthiness assessment of a security or money 
market instrument.

alternatives to the use of credit ratings.8   

II. Risk-Based Capital Standards 

 In June 2009, the agencies, as part of the international Joint Forum Working 
Group on Risk Assessment and Capital, participated in a stocktaking exercise to identify 
the use of credit ratings in relevant statutes, regulations, policies and guidance.9  The 
agencies have identified multiple regulations that must be brought into compliance with 
Section 939A of the Act.  Included among these regulations are the agencies’ risk-based 
capital standards.  

 The agencies’ risk-based capital standards reference credit ratings issued by 
NRSROs (credit ratings) in four general areas: (1) the assignment of risk weights to 
securitization exposures under the general risk-based capital rules and advanced 
approaches rules;10 (2) the assignment of risk weights to claims on, or guaranteed by, 
qualifying securities firms under the general risk-based capital rules;11 (3) the assignment 
of certain standardized specific risk add-ons under the agencies’ market risk rule;12 and 
(4) the determination of eligibility of certain guarantors and collateral for purposes of the 
credit risk mitigation framework under the advanced approaches rules.13  In 2008, the 
agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking14 that sought comment on 
implementation in the United States of certain aspects of the standardized approach in the 
Basel Accord.  The Basel standardized approach for credit risk (Basel standardized 
approach) relies extensively on credit ratings to assign risk weights to various exposures.  
(Throughout the rest of this ANPR, references to the Basel standardized approach are 
references to the Basel Accord rather than the 2008 proposal.)    

 In 2009, the Basel Committee published the following documents that were 
designed to strengthen the risk-based capital framework in the Basel Accord: Revisions to 
the Basel II Market Risk Framework (Revisions Document); Enhancements to the Basel 
II Framework (Enhancements Document); and Strengthening the Resilience of the 
Banking Sector.15  In the Enhancements Document, the Basel Committee introduced

the use of external credit ratings in the regulations of the OCC.

Act.

III.  Request for Comment  

 This ANPR seeks comment on standards of credit-worthiness other than credit 
ratings that may be used for purposes of the risk-based capital standards.  The various 
alternative approaches in this ANPR may present challenges of feasibility in varying 
degrees.  The agencies would appreciate commenters’ views on the feasibility of 
implementing the suggestions for alternative approaches in this ANPR and any 
methodologies that commenters may provide.    

                                                                                                                                                 
Committee and International Organization for Securities Commissioners); “Enhancements to the Basel II 
Framework” (July, 2009, Basel Committee); and “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector” 
(December, 2009, Basel Committee). 
16 For simplicity, and unless otherwise indicated, this ANPR uses the term “banking organization” to 
include banks, savings associations, and bank holding companies. 
17 These operational criteria would require a bank to have a comprehensive understanding of the risk 
characteristics of its individual securitization exposures; be able to access performance information on the 
underlying pools on an on-going basis in a timely manner; and have a thorough understanding of all 
structural features of a securitization transaction.  Enhancements Document, paragraphs 565(i)-(iv).

a.  Credit-worthiness Standards 

 Section 939A of the Act requires the agencies to establish, to the extent feasible, 
uniform standards of credit-worthiness to replace references to, or requirements of 
reliance on, credit ratings for purposes of the agencies’ regulations.  The agencies are 
therefore considering alternative credit-worthiness standards, including those currently in 
use in the agencies’ regulations, supervisory guidance, and market practices.  The 
agencies recognize that any measure of credit-worthiness will involve a tradeoff among 
the principles listed below.  For example, a more refined differentiation of risk might be 
achievable only at the expense of greater implementation burden.  In evaluating any 
standard of credit-worthiness for purposes of determining risk-based capital 
requirements, the agencies will, to the extent practicable and consistent with the other 
objectives, consider whether the standard would:   

 Appropriately distinguish the credit risk associated with a particular exposure 
within an asset class; 

 Be sufficiently transparent, replicable, and defined to allow banking organizations 
of varying size and complexity to arrive at the same assessment of credit-
worthiness for similar exposures and to allow for appropriate supervisory review; 

 Provide for the timely and accurate measurement of negative and positive changes 
in credit-worthiness;  

 Minimize opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage; 

 Be reasonably simple to implement and not add undue burden on banking 
organizations; and 

 Foster prudent risk management. 

 Question 1: The agencies seek comment on the principles that should guide the 
formulation of credit-worthiness standards.  Do the principles provided above capture the 
appropriate elements of sound credit-worthiness standards?  How could the principles be 
strengthened? 

b.  Possible alternatives to credit ratings in the risk-based capital standards 

 The agencies’ existing risk-based capital standards include a range of approaches 
to differentiating credit risk.  At one end of the spectrum, the agencies’ general risk-based 
capital rules provide a relatively simple approach to measuring and differentiating risk 
based on the use of broad risk buckets.  This approach requires all corporate exposures, 
for example, to receive the same risk weight, regardless of the variation in risks that exist 
across corporate exposures. At the other end of the spectrum, the agencies’ advanced 
approaches rules require a banking organization to make its own assessment of the credit 
risk of a corporate exposure, subject to a number of agency-prescribed standards.  This 
assessment is then used as an input into a supervisory formula to calculate minimum risk-



 9

based capital requirements.  The agencies’ rules also incorporate other methods for 
assessing risk-based capital requirements, including the use of NRSRO ratings. 

 The agencies are considering a wide range of approaches of varying complexity 
and risk-sensitivity for developing credit-worthiness standards for the risk-based capital 
standards.  These include developing risk weights for exposure categories based on 
objective criteria established by regulators, similar to the current risk-bucketing approach 
of the general risk-based capital rules.  The approaches also include developing broad 
qualitative and quantitative credit-worthiness standards that banking organizations could 
use, subject to supervisory oversight, to measure the credit risk associated with exposures 
within a particular exposure category.  These general approaches present certain 
advantages and disadvantages.  In considering these approaches, the agencies will 
evaluate the extent to which the alternatives meet the principles described above. 

 Risk Weights Based on Exposure Category:  One way to eliminate references to 
credit ratings in the risk-based capital standards would be for the agencies to delete all of 
the sections in their risk-based capital regulations that refer to credit ratings and retain the 
remainder of the general risk-based capital rules.  Under this approach, all non-
securitization exposures generally would receive a 100 percent risk-weight unless 
otherwise specified.  For example, certain sovereign and bank exposures would be 
assigned a zero percent or a 20 percent risk weight, respectively.  Alternatively, the 
agencies could revise the risk-weight categories for exposures by considering the type of 
obligor, for example, sovereign, bank, public sector entity (PSE),18 as well as considering 
other criteria, such as the characteristics of the exposure, which could increase the risk 
sensitivity of the risk-based capital requirements by providing a wider range of risk-
weight categories.  

 Exposure-Specific Risk Weights:  Under this approach, banking organizations 
could assign risk weights to individual exposures using specific qualitative and 
quantitative credit risk measurement standards established by the agencies for various 
exposure categories.  Such standards would be based on broad credit-worthiness metrics.  
For instance, exposures could be assigned a risk weight based on certain market-based 
measures, such as credit spreads; obligor-specific financial data, such as debt-to-equity 
ratios; or other sound underwriting criteria.  Alternatively, banking organizations could 
assign exposures to one of a limited number of risk weight categories based on an 
assessment of the exposure’s probability of default or expected loss.   

 As part of an exposure-specific approach, the agencies are considering whether 
banking organizations should be permitted to contract with third-party service providers 
to obtain quantitative data, such as probabilities of default, as part of their process for 
making credit-worthiness determinations and assigning risk weights.  While this method 
could increase risk sensitivity, consistent application across exposure categories and 
across banking organizations could be more difficult to achieve.   

                                                 
18 A PSE exposure is an exposure to a state, local authority, or other government subdivision below the 
sovereign entity level.   



 10

 Alternatively, the agencies could consider an approach for debt securities similar 
to that adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, under which a 
third party financial assessor would inform the agencies' understanding of risks and their 
ultimate determination of the risk-based capital requirement for individual securities.19  
One potential drawback of this approach is excessive reliance on a single third-party 
assessment of risk.  

 Regardless of the approach used, the agencies would establish strict quantitative 
and qualitative criteria to ensure that the methodology employed is consistent with safe 
and sound banking practices.   

 Question 2:  What are the advantages and disadvantages for each of these general 
approaches?  What, if any, combination of the approaches would appropriately reflect 
exposure categories and the sophistication of individual banking organizations?  What 
other approaches do commenters believe would meet the agencies’ suggested criteria for 
a credit-worthiness standard?  If increasing reliance is placed on banking organizations to 
assign risk weights for credit exposures using the types of approaches described above, 
how would the agencies ensure consistency of capital treatment for similar exposures?  
How could the use of third-party providers be implemented to ensure quality, 
transparency, and consistency?  

c. Exposure-specific options for measuring credit-worthiness 

 The broad approaches discussed above could be applied in various ways across 
the agencies risk-based capital rules as well as existing exposure categories.  While the 
range of approaches is potentially applicable to all exposure categories, the sections 
below provide a more detailed discussion of how the approaches might be implemented 
by exposure categories.   

i. Sovereign Exposures 

 The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules risk weight exposures to sovereign 
entities based on membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD).20  However, under the Basel standardized approach, a banking 
organization would assign a risk weight to a sovereign exposure based on the external 
credit rating of the sovereign by a credit rating agency.21  The current market risk rule 
and the Basel modified market risk framework also make use of ratings for sovereign 
exposures.      

 There are several alternative methodologies that could be used to risk weight 
sovereign exposures that have different implications for risk sensitivity.  One option

countries comprises all full members of the OECD, as well as countries that have concluded special lending 
arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) associated with the IMF’s General

would be to assign risk weights for sovereign exposures based on whether the sovereign 
is a member of an organization other than the OECD, such as the G-20 or the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision, or whether it participates in the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) New Arrangements to Borrow.  This type of approach would be 
operationally simple, but would not recognize differences in credit-worthiness among the 
individual member nations within an organization.  An additional degree of risk 
sensitivity could be incorporated into this approach by adding additional criteria beyond 
membership in a given organization.  For instance, a higher risk weight could be assigned 
to an exposure to a sovereign entity if it had restructured its debt within a specified period 
of time or if its credit-worthiness deteriorated based on some market indicator (for 
example, credit spreads).    

 The agencies could also consider incorporating into standards of credit-worthiness 
country risk classifications generated by the OECD, the World Bank, or a similar 
organization.  This approach could assign risk weights according to the relative credit risk 
of each risk classification or designation.  Under such an approach, exposures to 
sovereigns classified as having lower credit risk would receive lower risk weights, and 
exposures classified as higher risk would receive higher risk weights.   

 A third option would be to differentiate the credit risk of sovereign exposures 
based on certain key financial and economic indicators.  For example, risk weights could 
be assigned based on one or more ratios such as gross debt per capita, real gross domestic 
product growth rate, or government debt and foreign reserves.  Such a treatment would 
require the agencies to select specific ratios and acceptable data sources, for example, 
from the IMF or the OECD.   

Question 3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods?  How can the agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  
Should the agencies consider other international organizations?  Which financial and 
economic indicators should the agencies consider?  What are the implications or potential 
unintended consequences?  Are there other methods for assessing risk-based capital 
requirements for sovereign exposures that would meet the principles described in section 
III?  Commenters are asked to provide quantitative as well as qualitative support and/or 
analysis for proposed alternative methods.  

ii. Public Sector Entity (PSE) exposures 

The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules assign risk weights to PSE 
exposures based on the repayment source for the exposure (for example, whether the 
exposure is a general obligation, revenue, or industrial revenue bond) and membership of 
the PSE’s sovereign government in the OECD.22  Under the Basel standardized approach, 
PSE exposures would be risk weighted based on the credit rating of the exposure or the 

                                                 
22 See 12 CFR parts 208 and 225, Appendix A, § III.C (Board) ; 12 CFR part 325, Appendix A, § II.C 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 567.6 (OTS).

risk weight of the sovereign.23  The current market risk rule and the Basel modified 
market risk framework also make use of credit ratings for PSE exposures.     

One approach would be to continue to use the general risk-based capital rules’ 
treatment of differentiating the risk of PSEs based on the type of exposure, the sovereign 
of incorporation, and by how revenues are collected for the PSE exposure.     

Alternatively, the agencies could provide some incremental risk sensitivity by 
differentiating revenue bond issuers by type of service or business.  As with sovereign 
exposures, risk weighting could be based on several financial and economic measures.  
For example, the agencies could assign risk weights based on one or more ratios, such as 
a relevant debt service obligation to cash flow ratio (for example, debt to revenue), and/or 
debt to market value of certain assets (for example, real estate).  The agencies also could 
incorporate credit spreads to help differentiate credit risk among PSE exposures.  Other 
options include permitting banking organizations to assign risk weights to PSE exposures 
based on the applicable risk weight of the sovereign of incorporation, or using data 
obtained from qualified third parties to inform credit-worthiness assessments based upon 
a set of objective criteria established by the agencies. 

Question 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods for calculating risk-based capital requirements for PSE exposures?  How can the 
agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  Which services and 
businesses, or financial and economic measures, should the agencies consider?  What are 
the implications or potential for unintended consequences?  Are there other methods for 
assessing risk-based capital for PSE exposures in a relatively risk sensitive manner that 
would meet the principles described in section III?  Commenters are asked to provide 
quantitative as well as qualitative support and/or analysis for proposed alternative 
methods.   

iii. Bank exposures 

The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules generally assign a 20 percent risk 
weight to exposures to U.S. depository institutions and foreign banks.24  Long-term 
exposures to banks not incorporated in OECD countries are assigned a 100 percent risk 
weight.  Under the Basel standardized approach, bank exposures would be risk weighted 
based either on the risk weight of the sovereign or the credit rating of the exposure.25  The 
market risk rule and the Basel modified market risk framework also use ratings for bank 
exposures.   

One option for risk weighting bank exposures is to continue to use the general 
risk-based capital treatment, which bases the risk weight for bank exposures on whether 
the sovereign where the bank is incorporated is a member of the OECD.  Another method 
for risk weighting bank exposures could be based on several financial measures and

25 Basel Accord, paragraphs 60-64.

market indicators.  For example, the agencies could assign risk weights based on one or 
more ratios such as funding (for example, core deposits to total liabilities) and/or credit 
quality (for example, non-performing items to total assets).  This method also could be 
supplemented for banks with publicly traded securities with market-based information 
such as a banking organization’s unsecured bond spreads over comparable Treasury 
securities.   

Question 5: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods for calculating risk-based capital requirements for bank exposures?   How can 
the agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  Which financial and 
market indicators should the agencies consider?  What are the implications or potential 
for unintended consequences?  Are there other methods for assessing risk-based capital 
for bank exposures in a relatively risk sensitive manner that would meet the principles 
described in section III?  Commenters are asked to provide quantitative as well as 
qualitative support and/or analysis for proposed alternative methods.   

iv. Corporate Exposures 

Under the agencies’ general risk-based capital rules, corporate exposures 
generally26 receive a risk weight of 100 percent,27 whereas under the Basel standardized 
approach, banking organizations would be allowed to use credit ratings to assign risk 
weights to corporate exposures.28  The current market risk rule and the Basel modified 
market risk framework also use credit ratings for corporate exposures.    

One option for risk weighting corporate exposures would be to continue to use the 
treatment provided in the general risk-based capital rules and require banking 
organizations to risk weight all corporate exposures at 100 percent.  Another method 
would be to differentiate the credit risk of corporate exposures based on financial and 
economic measures appropriate to the borrower.  For example, the agencies could allow 
banking organizations to assign risk weights based on balance sheet or cash flow ratios, 
such as current assets to current liabilities, debt to equity, or some form of debt service to 
cash flow ratio (for example, current interest and maturities to current cash flow from 
operations).  Alternatively, some corporate exposures for publicly traded firms could be 
risk weighted on the basis of market-based measures, such as credit spreads, equity-price 
implied default probability, and measures of capital adequacy and liquidity.   

Finally, the agencies could allow banking organizations to assign risk weights 
based upon a more flexible set of objective criteria that the agencies would establish by 
rule.  As a part of their process for making credit-worthiness determinations and 
assigning risk weights, banking organizations would be allowed to consider external data, 
including credit analyses (but not credit ratings) provided by third parties, that met 
standards established by the agencies.

weight.

Question 6: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods?  What are the implications or potential for unintended consequences?  If all 
banking organizations are allowed to calculate their own capital requirements for 
corporate exposures, how can the agencies ensure consistent and transparent 
implementation (for example, where there may be material differences in how financial 
statements are typically presented or differences in chosen financial ratios)?  What 
different approaches or other financial or market criteria would commenters recommend?  
Are there other methods for assessing risk-based capital for corporate exposures in a 
relatively risk sensitive manner that would meet the principles described in section III?  
Commenters are asked to provide quantitative, as well as qualitative, support and/or 
analysis for proposed alternative methods.    

v. Securitization Exposures 

Under the agencies’ general risk-based capital rules, a banking organization may 
use credit ratings to assign risk weights to certain securitization exposures.29  Generally, 
when a banking organization cannot, or chooses not to use the ratings-based approach, it 
must either “gross-up” the exposure or hold dollar-for-dollar capital against the exposure.  
These latter methods are designed to capture the risk of unrated or low rated exposures 
that typically are subordinate in the capital structure of a securitization.  Under the 
advanced approaches rules and the Basel standardized approach, a banking organization 
is required to use a ratings-based approach when available to assign risk weights to 
traditional and synthetic securitization exposures.30  Both the advanced approaches rules 
and the Basel standardized approach also provide alternative approaches for determining 
the capital requirements for exposures that do not qualify for the ratings-based approach.  
The market risk rule and the Basel modified market risk framework also use credit ratings 
for securitization exposures.   

Prior to the implementation of the recourse, direct credit substitutes, residual 
interests and mortgage- and asset-backed securities rule in 2001 (recourse rule),31 the 
agencies’ general risk-based capital rules did not rely on credit ratings to determine risk 
weights for securitization exposures.  In addition to establishing a risk-weighting 
framework based on credit ratings, the recourse rule established an alternative risk-
weighting framework for certain securitization exposures (a gross-up treatment reflecting 
the risk of more subordinated tranches of securitizations).  The agencies could apply the 
risk-based capital rules in effect prior to the implementation of the recourse rule, which 
would eliminate all references to credit ratings.  This would result in all securitization 
exposures receiving the same risk weight regardless of the amount of subordination in the 
securitization structure.  Alternatively, the agencies could:

 Require that banks apply the aforementioned “gross-up” treatment under which a 
bank must maintain capital against its securitization exposure, as well as against all 
more senior exposures that the bank’s exposure supports in the structure.  The 
grossed-up exposure would then be assigned to the risk weight appropriate to the 
underlying securitized exposures.  

 Differentiate the credit risk of the “grossed-up” securitization exposure based on 
financial and structural parameters of the underlying or reference pool of 
instruments, as well as the exposure itself.  For example, risk weights could be 
assigned based on the securitization transaction’s overcollateralization ratio, 
interest coverage ratio, or priority in the cash flow waterfall. 

 Assign the most senior securitization exposure in a transaction a risk weight based 
on the underlying exposure type and the aggregate amount of subordination that 
provides credit enhancement to the exposure.  For example, the greater the amount 
of subordination, the lower the risk weight to which the senior exposure would be 
assigned.  However, this approach would only apply to the senior-most tranche 
and would not distinguish between exposures with significant credit support and 
those where the support had been reduced or eliminated by losses.   

 Adopt the Basel Committee’s approach to calculating capital requirements for 
securitization exposures that is based on the level of subordination and the type of 
underlying exposures in the Revisions Document.  The approach would use a 
“concentration ratio” to set the minimum risk-based capital requirements for 
securitization positions.  The concentration ratio is equal to the sum of the notional 
amounts of all the tranches divided by the sum of the notional amounts of the 
tranches junior to or pari passu with the tranche in which the position is held 
including that tranche itself.  The capital requirement is 8 percent of the weighted-
average risk weight that would be applied to the underlying securitized exposures 
multiplied by the concentration ratio. If the concentration ratio is 12.5 or higher, 
the position would be deducted from capital.  Under this approach, the capital 
requirement would be no less than that which would result from a direct exposure 
to the underlying assets.   

 Design a risk-weighting approach based on a supervisory formula.  Building on the 
capital requirements of the underlying exposures, the agencies could recognize 
multiple sources of risk related to securitizations and impose provisions that limit 
some forms of arbitrage.  Under the advanced approaches rules, for example, 
banking organizations are allowed to use the supervisory formula approach (SFA) 
to calculate minimum regulatory capital requirements for certain securitization 
exposures.32  This approach uses exposure-specific inputs, including the capital 
requirement of the underlying exposures as if held directly by the banking 
organization.  The inputs required for calculating the capital requirement of the

section 45 (OTS).

underlying exposures are not always available for investing banking organizations.  
Nevertheless, the agencies could develop a simplified version of the SFA that 
could be applied by all banking organizations. Depending upon the parameters 
used in the SFA, this approach could increase risk sensitivity, as well as potentially 
increasing transparency in the securitization market.   

Question 7: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches for  
calculating risk-based capital requirements for securitization exposures?  How can the 
agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  Which parameters or 
measures of subordination and structure should the agencies consider?  What are the 
implications or potential for unintended consequences?  How can the agencies ensure that 
an alternative approach meets the criteria for a credit-worthiness standard?  What other 
approaches or specific financial and structural parameters that would be appropriate 
standards of credit-worthiness for securitization exposures?  Commenters are asked to 
provide quantitative as well as qualitative support and/or analysis for proposed alternative 
methods. 

vi. Guarantees and Collateral 

The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules generally limit the recognition of 
third-party guarantees to those provided by central governments, U.S. government 
agencies, banks, state and local governments of OECD countries, qualifying securities 
firms, and multilateral lending institutions and regional development banks.  The general 
risk-based capital rules recognize collateral in the form of cash, securities issued or 
guaranteed by OECD central governments, securities issued by U.S. government 
agencies or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, and securities issued by multilateral 
lending institutions and regional development banks.33   

Under the Basel standardized approach, guarantor eligibility is based on the credit 
rating of the guarantor’s unsecured long-term debt security without credit enhancement 
that has a long-term external credit rating.34  In addition, financial collateral includes, 
among other things, long-term debt securities that have an external credit rating of one 
category below investment grade or higher and short-term debt securities that have an 
external credit rating of at least investment grade.35   

The advanced approaches rules recognize the risk reducing effects of financial 
collateral and guarantees.36  Eligible financial collateral includes long-term debt 
securities that have a credit rating of one category below investment grade or higher and 
short-term debt securities that have a credit rating of at least investment grade.37

Guarantors eligible for double default treatment include those entities that a banking 
organization assigns a probability of default equal to or lower than the probability of 
default associated with a long-term credit rating in the third-highest investment grade 
category.38   

One option would be to expand the use of the recognition of collateral and 
guarantees as provided in the general risk-based capital rules, that is, by substituting the 
risk weight appropriate to the guarantor or collateral for that of the exposure.  This 
approach would have to be modified to exclude mention of external credit ratings for 
certain securities firms.  The agencies could also incorporate into the recognition of 
collateral and guarantees some of the credit-worthiness standards discussed above for 
sovereign, PSE, bank, and corporate exposures.    

Question 8: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative 
approaches?  What are the implications or potential for unintended consequences?  Are 
there other approaches that would more appropriately capture the risk-mitigating effects 
of collateral and/or guarantees without adding undue cost or burden?  Commenters are 
asked to provide quantitative as well as qualitative supporting data and/or analysis for 
proposed alternative methods. 

d.  Burden 

The agencies recognize that any measure of credit-worthiness will involve a 
tradeoff among the objectives discussed in this ANPR.  As previously noted, the agencies 
recognize that a more refined differentiation of credit-worthiness may be achievable only 
at the expense of greater implementation burden.  The agencies seek comment on the 
costs and burden that various alternative standards might entail.  In particular, the 
agencies are interested in whether the development of alternatives to the use of credit 
ratings would involve, in most circumstances, cost considerations greater than those 
under the current regulations. 

Question 9: What burden might arise from the implementation of alternative 
methods of measuring credit-worthiness at banking organizations of varying size and 
complexity?  Commenters are asked to provide quantitative as well as qualitative support 
for their burden estimates.  In addition to the cost burden, the agencies seek comment on 
the feasibility of implementing various alternatives, particularly for community and mid-
sized banks.
