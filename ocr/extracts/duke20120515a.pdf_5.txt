this calls into question the notion that housing prices cannot stabilize until the foreclosure 

pipeline is worked off.  I believe that this reduction in inventory, even in the face of a 

steady supply of foreclosed homes, is a result of a sharp contraction in normal 

homeowner activity and an equally sharp expansion of investor activity.  Certainly, as 

prices fell, many existing homeowners withdrew their homes from the market either 

because they were unwilling to sell at low prices or because they were unable to sell if 

they could not receive enough money from the sale to pay off their mortgages. 

At the same time, a significant portion of the inventory has been absorbed by 

investors attracted by low prices and increasing rental rates.  So far, the investors 

purchasing single-family properties have been primarily small investors who have had 

difficulties obtaining financing to purchase more than a handful of properties.  Recently, 

however, anecdotes have been proliferating about investors establishing entities to 

purchase and manage a larger number of properties--on the order of several hundred to 

several thousand of them.  In addition, pilot programs are currently under way to solicit 

larger-scale investor interest in properties owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  If 

successful, these programs could act to simultaneously reduce the number of distressed 

sales and meet the elevated demand for rental housing. 

Recent indicators of housing construction activity have also been somewhat 

encouraging.  Housing starts and permits have edged up from very low levels, and 

builders’ and Realtors’ ratings of housing market conditions have stepped up a fair bit.  In 

addition, multifamily starts have risen steadily, likely in response to higher apartment 

demand and falling vacancy rates.
