I want to compliment the organizers and others for gathering an outstanding group 

of researchers and papers for this conference.  Understanding why some groups 

persistently fare better than others in the job market and how these disparities may affect 

the economy’s overall performance is vitally important to the Federal Reserve.  While 

opportunity and inclusion have long been central to American values, it is increasingly 

clear that they are also central to the strength of our economy.1   

As directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is to promote 

maximum employment and stable prices.  In fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a 

similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment.  That is because the level of 

maximum employment depends on “nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 

dynamics of the labor market,” which “may change over time and may not be directly 

measurable.”2  Understanding how close the labor market is to our full-employment goal 

requires consulting a variety of evidence along with a healthy dose of judgment.  The 

recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes in the 

economic landscape serves us well by requiring FOMC participants to develop a nuanced 

understanding of labor market developments.   

This approach to maximum employment has allowed the FOMC to navigate the 

current expansion in a way that has likely brought more people back into productive 

employment than might have been the case with a fixed unemployment rate target based
