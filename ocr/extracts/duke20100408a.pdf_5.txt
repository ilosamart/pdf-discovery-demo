 In closing, I would like to thank the educators here today for your dedication to 

Washington-area students. Your role is vital to preparing them with the skills they will need to 

grow into financially successful adults.  I am pleased to be a part of this conversation among the 

private and public sectors, as well as the education community, about how best to empower 

students with the confidence and savvy to navigate their financial worlds.
