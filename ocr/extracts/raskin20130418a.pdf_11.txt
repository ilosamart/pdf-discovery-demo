severe distress and a pullback in spending that was ultimately widespread across 

households.   

Inequality and the Recovery 

I have argued that rising inequality and stagnating wages may have led 

households to borrow more and to pin their hopes for economic advancement on rising 

home values, developments that exacerbated the severity of the financial crisis and 

recession.  Now we are nearly four years into the recovery, which has been weak.  In my 

view, this same confluence of factors has also contributed to the tepid recovery. 

If my theory about why households overextended themselves before the financial 

crisis is correct, then it is likely also true that households have had a rude awakening in 

the years since.  Not only did they receive an unwelcome shock to their net current 

wealth, but they also undoubtedly have come to realize that house prices will not rise 

indefinitely and that their labor income prospects are less rosy than they had believed.  As 

a result, they are curtailing their spending in an effort to rebuild their nest eggs and may 

also be trimming their budgets in order to bring their debt levels into alignment with their 

new economic realities.  In this case, the effects of the plunge in net wealth and the jump 

in unemployment on subsequent spending have been long lasting and lingering.   

Overall debt levels remain higher than before the house price boom, and many 

families continue to struggle to keep up with their monthly payments.  Although many 

households have significantly reduced their debt levels, many others probably have far to 

go.10  It is hard to know just what the optimal debt-to-income ratio is, but, in my view, 

                                                 
10 In contrast to the decrease in overall debt, student loans have continued to rise at a solid pace.  The 
outstanding level of student loan balances is nearly twice its level five years ago and now represents the 
largest component of consumer (nonmortgage) lending.  The increase in student loans is likely related to 
broader developments in the recession and exposes the households holding these loans to new risks.
