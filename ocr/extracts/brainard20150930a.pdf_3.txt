constituting the vast majority of firms in the United States, small businesses account for 

about one-half of private-sector employment.2  And small firms, especially new small 

firms, are an even greater source of net new jobs in our economy.3  Thus, ensuring that 

creditworthy small businesses have access to credit is vitally important. 

Discussions of small businesses, along with their credit needs, often fail to 

appreciate the tremendous heterogeneity that exists among these firms and, consequently, 

the variation in their credit needs.  Small businesses include plumbers and electricians, 

medical and dental offices, dry cleaners and hair salons, restaurants and bodegas, as well 

as growth-oriented tech start-ups and small manufacturers.  They range in size from 

having zero employees--which accounts for a very large share of small businesses--to the 

much smaller share of small businesses with a few hundred employees.  Although some 

small businesses aspire to grow quickly, many others are unlikely to grow much at all.  

While some have audited financial statements, most small businesses do not.  Some have 

assets that can be pledged as collateral, but many do not.  Some have a long history of 

solid, profitable performance, while others have short histories or a mixed track record 

with regard to profitability.   

Not surprisingly, there is also considerable variation in the credit needs of small 

businesses.  Some small businesses, particularly very small firms in knowledge or service 

industries, may have little or no need for credit.  Larger small businesses, and those that 

require a substantial amount of equipment or need to hold sizeable inventories, tend to 

have greater credit needs.  Among small businesses that do need credit, funds may be
