Another factor we consider when assessing labor market slack is the elevated 

number of workers who are employed in part-time jobs but would prefer to have full-time 

work--in other words, those classified as “part time for economic reasons.”  At around 

4-1/2 percent of employment, the share of such workers is notably larger than has been 

historically typical in a growing economy.  Some portion of the greater share of workers 

who are part time for economic reasons may reflect structural rather than cyclical 

factors.3  For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing and 

toward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part-time workers, 

may be boosting the share of part-time jobs.  Despite these structural trends, which make 

it difficult to know where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons 

may settle in the longer run, I continue to think that it probably remains higher than it 

would be in a full-employment economy.   

Other indicators also generally corroborate the view that while the labor market 

has improved, it still has not fully recovered.  For example, the rate at which employees 

quit their jobs for other opportunities has tended to go up in a strong economy, since 

more workers voluntarily leave their jobs when they have greater confidence about their 

ability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires.  

Indeed, the quits rate has picked up as the labor market has improved over the past few 

years, but it still is not as high as it was through much of the early 2000s.  Another 

important indicator is the number of available positions, or job openings, that employers 

currently have posted.  Job openings have increased significantly over the past year and a
