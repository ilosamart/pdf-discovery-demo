the revival of the housing market and our recovery from recession, I gave a speech 

advocating a series of measures at the national and state levels to contain the damage to 

homeowners in November 2010.  To my dismay, here we are in 2011, with a recovery 

that is still being dragged down by serious housing problems that will require not just 

economic talent--but, significantly, legal talent--to address.  

 I want to talk this morning about a couple of those legal challenges.  Of course, 

these remarks are intended to express my own views, and they do not necessarily reflect 

the opinions of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market 

Committee. 

Housing Market Conditions 

Six years after house prices first began to fall, we are still dealing with the 

aftermath of the housing bubble.  Nationally, house prices have fallen by nearly one-third 

since their peak in the first quarter of 2006, and total homeowners’ equity in the United 

States has shrunk by more than one-half--a loss of more than $7 trillion.  This is a 

shocking and enormous decline. 

The drop in house prices has had far-reaching effects on families and the 

economy, in part because so many American families--nearly 70 percent--own their 

homes.

  In contrast, only about one-half of American families hold any stocks, either 

directly or through accounts such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k)s, or mutual 

funds.

  The fall in house prices has caused families to cut back on their spending and has 

prevented families from using their home equity to fund education expenses or start small
