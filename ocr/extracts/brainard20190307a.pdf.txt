While our economy continues to add jobs at a solid pace, demand appears to have 

softened against a backdrop of greater downside risks.  Prudence counsels a period of 

watchful waiting--especially with no signs that inflation is picking up.  With balance 

sheet normalization now well advanced, it will be appropriate to wind down asset 

redemptions later in the year.1 

The Modal Outlook 

Let me start by discussing prospects for the U.S. economy.  Policymakers tend to 

distinguish the most likely path, which I will refer to as the “modal” outlook, from risks 

around that path--events that are not the most likely to happen, but that have some 

probability of happening and that, if they do materialize, would have a one-sided effect.  

Both the modal outlook and the risks around it have important implications for monetary 

policy, but in somewhat different ways. 

Let me first discuss the modal outlook.  While the economy performed very well 

last year, I have revised down my modal outlook for this year, in part reflecting some 

softening in the recent spending and sentiment data. This softening could be a harbinger 

of some slowing in the underlying momentum of domestic demand.  In the initial 

estimate released last week, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a 2.6 percent 

annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2018.  However, the latest report on retail sales 

showed a sharp decline.  Analysts note that there is some reason to be skeptical of that 

report; it is subject to revision, and other data sources suggest a more muted 

movement.  Although the magnitude of the drop may be revised smaller, coming in the

remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or 
the Federal Open Market Committee.

last month of the quarter, that decline suggests that growth in consumer spending may be 

held down in the first quarter of this year.   

Surveys of consumer sentiment, which may provide some additional insight into 

the strength of spending in the first quarter, fell on net between November and January 

and rebounded partially in February.  The lengthy government shutdown likely 

contributed to the January decline.  And although recent readings are below those that 

prevailed for much of 2018, they are still in a range consistent with ongoing spending 

growth.   

Other spending indicators have also shown some slowing.  Residential 

construction data have been soft for some time, reflecting in part earlier increases in 

interest rates, and homebuilders report that supply constraints on available lots, shortages 

of skilled workers, and tariffs on inputs are also contributing to the slowdown.   

Business investment registered strong gains last year, including in the latest 

quarter, but there are some indications of softening there as well.  The latest data on 

capital goods orders, for example, suggest some softening in equipment spending gains.  

Surveys of businesses, such as the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing 

managers index and similar regional indexes, have generally moved lower over the past 

six months, reversing much of the run-up seen in 2017 and late 2016.  The National 

Federation of Independent Business’s Small Business Optimism Index is also lower than 

its mid-2018 peak, although it remains well above the levels of 2015 and much of 2016.  

The weaker foreign outlook also acts as a crosscurrent to the modal outlook.  

While strong foreign growth provided tailwinds early last year, foreign growth 


 - 3 - 

projections have been revised down repeatedly more recently.2  The slowdown of foreign 

growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed, with growth likely 

running below potential for most of last year.   

Economic activity slowed noticeably in the second half of 2018 in China, where 

policymakers have been trying to achieve a balance between restraining very elevated 

levels of domestic debt, on the one hand, and maintaining strong aggregate growth, on 

the other.  The protracted trade conflict with the United States has further complicated 

that challenge.   

Concerns about China’s slowdown are reverberating globally, as was true in 

2015-16, although the incidence is somewhat different.  While Germany had appeared to 

be weighed down primarily by transitory factors late last year, some of the weakness in 

industrial production now appears likely to be more persistent, in part reflecting 

spillovers from China.  The euro area is also seeing slowing in some other large member 

economies.  Global weakness in trade and manufacturing has also weighed on Japan. 

The slowdown in foreign demand spills over into the United States through a 

variety of channels.  Although the dollar has weakened somewhat lately, its earlier 

appreciation and slowing foreign growth contributed to a decline in exports and a fall in 

import prices over the second half of last year.  In contrast, the recent step-down in long-

term rates and easing in the dollar have lessened pressures on yields in emerging markets 

and provided more policy space in some cases.

In the United States, financial markets saw substantial volatility late last year, 

which may still be affecting sentiment.  From September to December of last year, 

financial conditions tightened considerably, with the stock market falling as much as 20 

percent, and corporate bond premiums rising.  This year, much of that tightening has 

reversed:  The S&P 500 has made up more than half of its earlier losses, and corporate 

risk spreads have reversed much of their earlier tightening.  Long-term Treasury yields 

rose from September through November and have since more than retraced, returning to 

the levels of early 2018.  While the dollar has edged down from the peaks reached in the 

fall, it is about 7 percent higher than the lows seen early last year.   

Overall, the softer spending data in the U.S. and the slowdown abroad, along with 

earlier financial volatility, are likely weighing on the modal outlook and might in turn 

warrant a softening in the modal path for policy. 

Risks to the Outlook 

Let me turn now to the second category of crosscurrents facing the U.S. economy:  

the risks around the modal outlook.  Policy uncertainty has been elevated recently and 

has been cited as an important factor in the financial volatility late last year.  Although 

some of the risks have been anticipated for some time, recent events have brought them 

into heightened focus, and the accumulation of these risks could lead to some erosion in 

sentiment that could in turn feed into activity. 

Trade dispute escalation remains a risk.  The tariffs and trade disruptions that 

have occurred so far are estimated to have had relatively modest effects on aggregate 

growth and inflation, although damaging disruptions have been concentrated in some 

sectors, such as soybeans.  While recent reports suggest some progress, the prospect of 


 - 5 - 

additional tariffs in the trade conflict with China or on automobiles have been cited 

frequently as a risk in earnings reports and reports from business contacts. 

The recent longest-ever government shutdown created hardship for many families 

and has increased attention on upcoming fiscal negotiations.  On current estimates, the 

debt ceiling will need to be raised around the fall.  The Bipartisan Budget Act, which is 

estimated to boost GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point, on average, per year in 2018 and 

2019, is scheduled to expire in 2020.  If agreement is not reached, spending levels could 

fall back to the sequester caps, which would amount to a significant headwind. 

There are also important downside risks abroad.  Most immediately, a “no-deal 

Brexit” would have adverse consequences for Britain, and potentially more broadly, 

given London’s role as a financial center.  Within the euro area, countries such as Italy 

and France face domestic challenges.  And a hard landing in China would have spillovers 

through financial and trade channels. 

Employment, Inflation, and Policy 

In contrast to the softening in spending indicators, job gains have remained strong 

so far.  Job gains have averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months--more 

than twice the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  The January 

unemployment rate of 4 percent is near a multidecade low.  The strong labor market has 

drawn many Americans into productive work, and the overall employment-to-population 

ratio for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is now within 1/2 percentage point of its 

pre-crisis peak.  Many of the main measures of wages have been increasing at rates not 

seen on a sustained basis in almost 10 years, although labor’s share of overall income 


 - 6 - 

remains stubbornly depressed.3  Nonetheless, recent data on claims have shown some 

softening, and I will be watching a broad set of labor market indicators carefully, 

including the payrolls data for February, which will be released tomorrow. 

Just as the economy is performing well on the maximum-employment goal set by 

the Congress, it is also close to meeting our price-stability mandate.  Following many 

years of low readings, the core price index for consumer purchases for the 12 months 

through December was up 1.9 percent.4  That reading lines up with the median Summary 

of Economic Projections (SEP) forecast from a year ago.  So inflation is very close to the 

Committee’s 2 percent objective and its earlier expectation.   

Even so, we will need to be vigilant to ensure inflation achieves 2 percent on a 

sustained basis.  As I have observed for some time, underlying trend inflation may be 

running slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Many statistical filtering 

models put underlying inflation modestly below 2 percent, and some survey measures of 

inflation expectations are running somewhat below pre-crisis levels.  Similarly, the 

difference between the yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities is 

lower than it was before the crisis, and that difference may provide some insight into 

market participants’ views of underlying inflation.5   

The fact that estimates of underlying trend inflation remain a bit on the soft side 

reinforces the evidence that the Phillips curve is very flat, a key element of the post-crisis 

                                                 
3 For the share of overall income going to workers, see, for instance, data on the labor share in the nonfarm 
business sector--available from the FRED database on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at 
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173--and Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017). 
4 I focus on the core measure because food and energy prices are volatile, and total inflation has generally 
fluctuated around core inflation.  The alternative Dallas trimmed mean measure tells a similar story. 
5 Brainard (2017) provides more details on these factors.

new normal that I have noted previously.6  The responsiveness of price inflation to 

resource utilization at the national level has been very weak for some time.  This raises 

the possibility that the economy may have room to run.  As the unemployment rate has 

fallen to levels not seen in many decades, we have heard concerns that the steeper 

Phillips curve of the past might reassert itself, perhaps in a nonlinear manner.7  But all 

available evidence suggests inflation expectations remain well anchored to the upside.    

Indeed, the contours of today’s new normal suggest we should be equally 

attentive to a risk of erosion in inflation expectations to the downside.  A range of 

evidence suggests that the long-run “neutral” rate of interest--the rate of interest 

consistent with the economy growing at its potential rate and stable inflation--is very low 

relative to its historical levels.  The low long-run neutral rate limits the amount of space 

available for cutting the federal funds rate to buffer the economy from adverse 

developments and is likely to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy 

rate is pinned at the lower bound.  In turn, more frequent or extended episodes when 

inflation is below target and policy is at the effective lower bound risk pulling down 

private-sector inflation expectations in a self-reinforcing downward spiral, which could 

further compress the monetary policy buffer to cushion downside shocks.8   

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made clear that the 2 percent 

inflation goal is symmetric.9 As the median SEP forecasts have indicated, a number of 

Committee members have previously projected a policy path consistent with inflation 

                                                 
6 See Brainard (2015, 2016) for a discussion of this and other elements of what I referred to as the new 
normal. 
7 See Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi (2019) for a comprehensive discussion of research on the Phillips curve. 
8 This risk is reinforced by the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy over the past five years and the erosion of 
fiscal space.

rising somewhat above 2 percent for a time, which is in line with the symmetry of the 

target.    

There is a separate discussion of policies that would pre-commit to make up for 

past misses on inflation, such as temporary price-level targeting, which may be important 

in circumstances with a low long-run neutral rate and more frequent effective-lower-

bound episodes.10  I expect this will be part of our review of monetary policy strategies, 

tools, and communication practices later this year.11 

Our policy goal now is to preserve the progress we have made on maximum 

employment and target inflation.  Core inflation last year came in around target.   It is 

heartening to see so many American workers coming back into the jobs market with 

rising wages.  Our business contacts note they are currently hiring and investing in 

training workers who may not have been considered just a few years ago.    

With regard to policy, modest downward revisions to the baseline outlook for 

output and employment would call for modest downward revisions to the path for our 

conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, helping to offset some of the weakness 

that would otherwise weigh on the economy.  Moreover, basic principles of risk 

management would suggest that the increase in downside risks warrants a modest 

downward revision to the modal path for policy.  These downside risks, if realized, could 

weigh on economic activity.12  So heightened downside risks to output and employment 

would argue for a softer federal funds rate path even if the modal outlook for the 

economy were unchanged.   

                                                 
10 See, for instance, Bernanke (2017) and Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019).  
11 See Board of Governors (2019b).   
12 The limited amount of conventional policy space reinforces the importance of guarding against the 
materialization of downside risks. 


 - 9 - 

At a time when the modal outlook appears to have softened a bit, and risks appear 

more weighted to the downside than the upside, the best way to safeguard the gains we 

have made on jobs and inflation is to navigate cautiously on rates.  Risk management in 

an environment of a low long-run neutral rate and an attenuated relationship between 

resource utilization and overall inflation supports this approach.  Watchful waiting will 

allow us to gather more information about domestic momentum and foreign growth as 

well as some of the policy risks weighing on sentiment.   

Balance Sheet Normalization 

Let me turn now to the second tool used by the Federal Reserve in recent years--

asset purchases.  Recall that, after reducing the federal funds rate to its effective lower 

bound of zero in the 2008-09 recession, the FOMC sought a mechanism for providing 

additional stimulus in order to achieve maximum employment and target inflation.13  The 

Federal Reserve purchased longer-term Treasury securities in an effort to push down 

longer-term interest rates to support economic activity, an approach sometimes referred 

to as quantitative easing.  It also purchased agency mortgage-backed securities for the 

same reason, as well as to provide support to the housing sector, which was at the heart of 

the crisis.  Although the empirical estimates vary, most conclude that the asset purchase 

programs were successful in supporting the recovery.14   

Once recoveries become well established, the Federal Reserve moves its policy 

settings to more normal levels.  Our current extended recovery is no exception:  The 

Federal Reserve first started moving the federal funds rate to more normal values once 

                                                 
13 Some foreign central banks have reduced their short-term policy rates below zero.  See Ball and others 
(2016) for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of such a policy. 
14 See the evidence cited in Ball and others (2016).

the expansion was well established, and then it started normalizing the balance sheet once 

normalization of the federal funds rate was well under way. 

Of course, the benchmark for normalization has changed since before the 

financial crisis.  Demand has grown for the Fed’s liabilities from a variety of sources.  

The demand for U.S. currency has grown notably relative to nominal GDP, the Treasury 

Department now holds large balances in its account at the Fed as an important part of its 

cash management, and foreign central banks hold larger deposits than in the past.  In 

addition, the demand from commercial banks for deposits at the Fed--that is, “reserves”--

appears to have increased substantially.  Spurred by new liquidity regulations and their 

own internal liquidity management practices, the largest banks hold substantial amounts 

of so-called high-quality liquid assets to protect against the risk of a sudden “run” on 

their uninsured short-run liabilities, as occurred during the financial crisis.     

So it appears that the new normal size of the balance sheet is likely to remain 

greater relative to the size of the economy than it was before the financial crisis.  How 

much larger is still an open question.  For the past decade, the Federal Reserve has 

operated a regime with reserves that are very abundant relative to banks’ demand for 

reserves.  The current framework relies on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate on reserves 

to control the federal funds rate, in the context of the provision of ample reserves.  In 

contrast, the pre-crisis framework featured a scarce supply of reserves, which the Federal 

Reserve would vary on a daily basis to control the federal funds rate by closely matching 

the demand for reserves.   


 - 11 - 

The FOMC recently affirmed that it would continue to operate the current 

framework.15  This approach makes sense for a variety of reasons.  The current 

framework has been effective in providing good control of the policy rate and ensuring 

effective transmission to other money markets and the financial system.  Not only is the 

demand for reserves likely to remain much higher than it was before the crisis, but it is 

also likely that there will be fluctuations in reserves, along with other elements of the 

Fed’s liabilities, such as the deposits the Treasury holds with the Fed.  Accommodating 

those swings with scarce reserves would require much larger daily open market 

operations than was the case before the crisis. 

By remaining in a regime with ample reserves, the Fed is able to control short-

term interest rates without the need to conduct daily open market operations.  Because 

there are ample reserves, the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates are 

determined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.  As a result, the system 

can absorb swings in the demand and supply of reserves with limited need for open 

market operations.  The alternative of pushing reserves close to the transition point 

between the flat and steep parts of the demand curve would likely lead to active 

intervention as an ongoing feature, along with volatility in rates. 

Given that the Committee is now operating with two instruments, it is important 

to note that the Committee clarified that it would seek to use only one tool actively at a 

time, and that the preferred active tool would be the federal funds rate when it is above 

the effective lower bound.  I want to make it clear that we would not want our two tools 

to be working at cross-purposes.  For instance, we would not want the balance sheet to be 

                                                 
15 See Board of Governors (2019c). 


 - 12 - 

shrinking at a time when the FOMC thought it was appropriate to cut the federal funds 

rate.   

After holding the size of the balance sheet roughly flat since mid-2014, once the 

normalization of the federal funds rate was deemed well under way in October 2017, the 

Committee started to allow the size of the balance sheet to shrink in line with the pledge 

to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and 

effectively.”16  We have made substantial progress, as demonstrated by the level of 

reserves.  Reserves are already down by 40 percent since their peak and are likely to be 

down by more than half this summer.  In my view, asset redemptions should come to an 

end later in the year, which would provide a sufficient buffer of reserves to meet demand 

and avoid volatility.  We have gathered information from market contacts and have 

surveyed banks to assess their demand for reserves.17  I would want to see a healthy 

cushion on top of that to avoid unnecessary volatility and ensure that the federal funds 

rate will be largely insulated from daily swings in factors affecting reserves. 

With regard to the composition of the balance sheet, I favor moving eventually to 

a portfolio of only Treasury securities--that is, without any agency mortgage-backed 

securities remaining.  It is important to do so in a way that continues to avoid market 

                                                 
16 As described in Board of Governors (2017), the reduction in reinvestment was implemented through a 
series of gradually rising caps on repayments of principal. 
    Quoted text is from the penultimate bullet point in Board of Governors (2014). 
17 The Senior Financial Officer Survey, which was undertaken in September 2018 and is being undertaken 
again, gathered views systematically from a number of banks concerning their reserve balance management 
strategies and practices.  The survey is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sfos/sfos-release-dates.htm.

disruptions.  That shift will be under way naturally, albeit slowly, as these securities 

mature and are replaced by Treasury securities.18 

For the portion of our portfolio in Treasury securities, the Federal Reserve 

currently holds no Treasury bills, and our portfolio has a much longer weighted-average 

maturity than the current stock of Treasury securities outstanding in the market or than 

our pre-crisis portfolio, which was more heavily weighted toward short-dated securities 

than the holdings of the public.  When the Federal Reserve System begins once again 

purchasing Treasury securities, we will need to decide what maturities to purchase.  

Given how far out of step the System’s current portfolio is from common benchmarks, 

however, it might make sense to weight those purchases more heavily toward Treasury 

bills and other shorter-dated Treasury securities for a time.  Further into the future, there 

may be good reasons to shift toward greater holdings of shorter-term securities to provide 

greater flexibility.  However, I want to emphasize that I do not expect this issue to be 

addressed for some time. 

Conclusion 

The most likely path for the economy appears to have softened against a backdrop 

of greater downside risks.  Our goal now is to safeguard the progress we have made on 

full employment and target inflation.  Prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting.  

And with balance sheet normalization now well advanced, it will soon be time to wind 

down our asset redemptions.    

                                                 
18 The Committee has indicated it may choose to sell agency mortgage-backed securities at some point to 
help accomplish the Treasury-securities-only goal.  In this eventuality, there would be considerable 
advance notice, with an aim to minimizing any market disruptions.
