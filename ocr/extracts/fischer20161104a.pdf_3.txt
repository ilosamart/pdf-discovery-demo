given demographic trends, the neutral rate of payroll gains would be lower.  If we 

assumed a downward trend in participation of about 0.3 percentage point per year, in line 

with estimates of the likely drag from demographics, job gains in the range of 65,000 to 

115,000 would likely be sufficient to maintain full employment.   

Last week we received some encouraging news on output growth.  After a slow 

first half, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased almost 3 percent in the third 

quarter.  However, the details were a little less exciting than the headline number.  

Household spending growth slowed, and residential investment declined.  Business 

investment in equipment fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.  A surge in exports 

supported growth; however, much of the increase was in shipments of soybeans, while 

exports of other goods remained tepid.  Growth was also supported by a buildup in 

inventories, breaking a streak of five quarters in which inventories contributed negatively 

to growth, the longest such run in more than 50 years.  Overall, I expect GDP growth to 

continue at a moderate pace, supported by household spending, renewed business 

investment, and the waning effects of past dollar appreciation on export growth.  

I will now turn to inflation.  Headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) 

inflation has moved up this year, with the 12-month change reaching 1.2 percent in 

September.  As the transitory effects of the earlier fall in oil prices and rise in the dollar 

fade, PCE inflation can be expected to rise further toward our 2 percent target, supported 

by higher core PCE inflation, which ran at a 1.7 percent pace in September.   

As you know, earlier this week, we decided to keep the target range for the 

federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent.  As was noted in the Federal Open Market 

Committeeâ€™s statement, our assessment is that the most recent data have further
