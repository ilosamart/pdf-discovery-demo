enriching experiences.19  Affluent families have significant resources for things that give 

children economic advantages as adults, and the SCF data I have cited indicate that many 

other households have very little to spare for this purpose.  These disparities extend to 

other household characteristics associated with better economic outcomes for offspring, 

such as homeownership rates, educational attainment of parents, and a stable family 

structure.20   

According to the SCF, the gap in wealth between families with children at the 

bottom and the top of the distribution has been growing steadily over the past 24 years, 

but that pace has accelerated recently.  Figure 8 shows that the median wealth for families 

with children in the lower half of the wealth distribution fell from $13,000 in 2007 to 

$8,000 in 2013, after adjusting for inflation, a loss of 40 percent.21  These wealth levels 

look small alongside the much higher wealth of the next 45 percent of households with 

children.  But these families also saw their median wealth fall dramatically--by one-third

Five,” ch. 15 in David Card and Orley Ashenfelter, eds., Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4 (Holland:

20 Homeownership by parents is strongly associated with economic success for children; see Thomas P. 

Boehm and Alan M. Schlottmann (1999), “Does Home Ownership by Parents Have an Economic Impact 

on Their Children?” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 8 (September), pp. 217-32,

Impact_on_Their_Children.  Ninety-seven percent of top-earning families with children own a home, 

compared with fewer than half of the bottom 50 percent of families with children; educational attainment of 

parents is strongly predictive of outcomes for children that determine earnings.  See Ayana Douglas-Hall 

and Michelle Chau (2007), “Parents’ Low Education Leads to Low Income, Despite Full-Time 

Employment” (New York:  National Center for Children in Poverty, Columbia University, November), 

www.nccp.org/publications/pub_786.html.  A considerable body of literature establishes the correlation 

between educational attainment of parents and their children.  Other research has identified that this 

relationship is causal; see, for example, Philip Oreopoulos, Marianne E. Page, and Ann Huff Stevens 

(2006), “The Intergenerational Effects of Compulsory Schooling,” Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 24 

(October), pp. 729-60.  Eighty-six percent of top-earning households in the SCF with children are headed 

by a college graduate, compared with 12 percent in the bottom half of households with children; children 

raised by a single parent earn less as adults.  See Mary Ann Powell and Toby L. Parcel (1997), “Effects of 

Family Structure on the Earnings Attainment Process:  Differences by Gender,” Journal of Marriage and 

Family, vol. 59 (May), pp. 419-33.  Only 4 percent of top-earning households with children are headed by 

unmarried parents, compared with 47 percent for the lower half of households with children. 
21 Distributional statistics for families with children are based on a sorting of only families with children.
