We did so in recognition of the scope of dollar markets and dollar-denominated 

transactions outside of our country, the benefits they provide to U.S. households and 

firms, and the adverse consequences to our financial markets if these centers lose access 

to dollar liquidity.  We have continued to maintain swap facilities with a number of 

central banks.  Although usage is currently very low, these facilities represent an 

important backstop in the event of a resurgence in global financial tensions.   

But I should caution that the responsibility of the Fed is not unbounded.  My 

teacher Charles Kindleberger argued that stability of the international financial system 

could best be supported by the leadership of a financial hegemon or a global central 

bank.23  But I should be clear that the U.S. Federal Reserve System is not that bank.  Our 

mandate, like that of virtually all central banks, focuses on domestic objectives.  As I 

have described, to meet those domestic objectives, we must recognize the effect of our 

actions abroad, and, by meeting those domestic objectives, we best minimize the negative 

spillovers we have to the global economy.  And because the dollar features so 

prominently in international transactions, we must be mindful that our markets extend 

beyond our borders and take precautions, as we have done before, to provide liquidity 

when necessary.   

That said, as will be discussed in many venues this weekend and beyond, the 

world is not without resources to guard against adverse economic and financial 

spillovers.  Most obviously, the IMF has played and will continue to play a critical role in 

providing liquidity and financial support to member countries.  To that end, I hope that 

the 2010 agreement to increase IMF quotas will be fulfilled.
