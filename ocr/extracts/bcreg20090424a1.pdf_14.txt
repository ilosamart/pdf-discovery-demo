Loss and revenue projections submitted by the firms were adjusted to ensure consistency across 

institutions and consistency with the macroeconomic scenarios defined for the exercise. These 

adjustments reflect a combination of the analysis of the supervisory teams, benchmarks developed by 

the teams and by economists and analysts working at the agencies, and supervisory judgment and 

knowledge of the individual firms in the exercise. A synopsis of the assessment process by category is 

described below. 

III. B. Supervisory Review and Benchmark Assessments by Category 

First and Second Lien Mortgages 

Supervisory teams for the residential mortgage portfolios evaluated the firms' submissions, 

which described the portfolios, methods used to project losses, and important assumptions in those 

methods. As part of a special request for this exercise, the participating BHCs provided detailed and 

uniform descriptions of their residential mortgage portfolio risk characteristics. In particular, firms 

provided information on type of product, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, FICO score, geography, level of 

documentation, year of origination, and other features. First mortgages, home equity lines of credit 

(HELOCs), and closed-end second-mortgage products were each evaluated separately. Each firm's 

models, assumptions, and circumstances were evaluated independently and relative to those of peer 

firms to determine adjustments to the firm's submission. Assumptions about prepayments and new 

originations were normalized to be generally consistent across firms. Portfolios were then analyzed 

using firm-specific portfolio attributes and common loss estimation methodologies calibrated to 

industry-wide data. Certain attributes, in particular FICO, LTV bands, vintage, product type, and 

geography, were found to be strongly predictive of default. These attributes were used to further 

evaluate submissions by the firms, and where necessary, loss estimates were adjusted to better reflect 

portfolio characteristics in a consistent way across firms. 

Credit Cards and Other Consumer Loans 

For credit cards, the supervisory teams evaluated methods used to project losses and 

benchmarked each firm's results against historical trends in these portfolios (for example, loss, paydown 

/ runoff, roll rates, utilization) in the context of the two macroeconomic scenarios. Firms submitted 

detailed information on their credit card portfolios. Data included FICO scores, payment rates, 

utilization rates, and geographic concentrations. The teams developed specific portfolio risk profiles in 

order to make cross-firm comparisons to gauge the reasonableness of the loss estimates submitted by 

the firms. Once normalized for assumptions, adjustments to loss rates were made where necessary, but 

in general the supervisory results were relatively close to the BHCs' estimates. 

For other consumer loans, which are composed mainly of auto loans, personal loans, and 

student loans, firms provided information on FICO scores, LTV, term, vehicle age, and geographic 

concentration. This detailed data were evaluated along with the analysis of the underlying components 

of each firm's portfolio, including historical loss experience. Supervisors also examined various 

performance measures to assess the relative riskiness of the portfolios across firms to arrive at 

projected loss rates.
