in the same activities; there should be no “spillover” from monetary policy independence 

to independence in other spheres of activity.  In practice, the Federal Reserve engages 

cooperatively with other agencies of the U.S. government on a wide range of financial 

and supervisory issues without compromising the independence of monetary policy. 

The case for independence also requires clarity about the range of central bank 

activities deemed to fall under the heading of monetary policy.  Conventional monetary 

policy, which involves setting targets for short-term interest rates or the growth rates of 

monetary aggregates, clearly qualifies.  I would also include under the heading of 

monetary policy the central bank’s discount-window and lender-of-last-resort activities.  

These activities involve the provision of short-term, fully collateralized loans to the 

financial system as a means of meeting temporary liquidity needs, reducing market 

dysfunctions, or calming financial panics.  As has been demonstrated during financial 

panics for literally hundreds of years, the ability of central banks to independently 

undertake such lending allows for a more rapid and effective response in a crisis.  On the 

other hand, as fiscal decisions are the province of the executive and the legislature, the 

case for independent lender-of-last-resort authority is strongest when the associated fiscal 

risks are minimal.  Requiring that central bank lending be fully secured, as is the case in 

the United States, helps to limit its fiscal implications.  Looking forward, the Federal 

Reserve supports measures that help further clarify the dividing line between monetary 

and fiscal responsibilities.  Notably, the development of a new statutory framework for 

the resolution of failing, systemically important firms is not only highly desirable as a 

means of reducing systemic risk, but it will also be useful in establishing the appropriate 

roles of the Federal Reserve and other agencies in such resolutions.
