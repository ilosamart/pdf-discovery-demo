top of which any additional requirements for systemically important institutions would be 

built.  The first order of business is to complete the Basel III rulemaking as soon as 

possible.  The required increases in the quality and quantity of minimum capital, and the 

introduction of an international leverage ratio, represent important steps forward for 

banking regulation around the world.  U.S. banks have increased their capital 

substantially since the financial crisis began, and the vast majority already have Tier 1 

common risk-based ratios greater than the Basel III 7 percent requirements 

The new requirements, while big improvements, are not as high as I would have 

liked, and the agreement contains some provisions I would have omitted or simplified.  In 

coming years we may well seek changes.  Indeed, I continue to be a strong advocate of 

establishing simpler, standardized risk-based capital requirements and am encouraged at 

the initial work being done on the topic of simplification in the Basel Committee.  And 

we will certainly simplify the final capital rules here in the United States so as to respond 

to the concerns expressed by smaller banks.  But opposing, or seeking delay in, Basel III 

would simply give an excuse to banks that do not meet Basel III standards to seek delay 

from their own governments.  It would be ironic indeed if those who favor higher or 

simpler capital requirements were unintentionally to lend assistance to banks that want to 

avoid strengthening their capital positions. 

Turning to specific policies to address too-big-to-fail, the first task is to 

implement fully the capital surcharge for systemically important institutions, the LCR, 

resolution plans, and other relevant proposed regulations.  But, completion of this agenda, 

significant as it is, would leave more too-big-to-fail risk than I think is prudent.  What 

more, then, should be done?  As I have said before, proposals to impose across-the-board
