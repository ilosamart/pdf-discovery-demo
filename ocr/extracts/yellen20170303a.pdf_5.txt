to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth--between 75,000 and 

125,000 per month.5  As I will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that 

the underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent.  

But as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum 

employment objective, the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral 

policy stance. 

My colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate 

will rise to its longer-run level over the next few years.  This expectation partly underlies 

our view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the 

months and years ahead:  Those increases would keep the economy from significantly 

overheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability. 

Post-Crisis Period: Same Strategy, New Tactics   

I will now examine the strategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC 

deliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of our mandate 

from the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability. 

The FOMC’s monetary policy strategy is based on three basic principles.  First, 

our monetary policy must be goal driven.  We must take care to ensure that our decisions 

over time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve’s 

congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, and that the 

public understands and has confidence in that commitment.  Second, our monetary policy 

must be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and 

                                                 
5 The estimate of the actual value of the real federal funds rate (around minus 1 percent) is based on the 
difference between the current value of the effective federal funds rate (close to 0.66 percent) and the latest 
reading on inflation as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures excluding energy and food items (1-3/4 percent).
