 
 It is a pleasure to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostonâ€™s annual 

conference, and I am grateful to President Rosengren and the organizers for inviting me.  

This afternoon I would like to discuss the challenges to formulating macroprudential 

policy for the U.S. financial system.1   

The U.S. financial system is extremely complex.  We have one of the largest 

nonbank sectors as a percentage of the overall financial system among advanced market 

economies.  Since the crisis, changes in the regulation and supervision of the financial 

sector, most significantly those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and the Basel III process, have 

addressed many of the weaknesses revealed by the crisis.  Nonetheless, challenges to our 

efforts to preserve financial stability remain.   

The Structure, Vulnerabilities, and Regulation of the U.S. Financial System 

To set the stage, it is useful to start with a brief overview of the structure of the 

U.S. financial system.  A diverse set of institutions provides credit to households and 

businesses, and others provide deposit-like services and facilitate transactions across the 

financial system.2  As can be seen from panel A of figure 1, banks currently supply about 

one-third of the credit in the U.S. system.  In addition to banks, institutions thought of as 

long-term investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds, 

                                                   
 
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal 
Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.  I am grateful to Sirio Aramonte, Rochelle 
Edge, Luca Guerrieri, Michael Kiley, Nellie Liang, and Stacey Tevlin for their help in preparing this 
speech. 
2 In my overview of the financial system, I am sizing the major players by their credit provision.  But 
clearly, this is not the only metric that could and should be applied.  If we consider net income, or other 
proxies for value-added by different subsegments of the financial system, we also capture the role of 
financial service companies and organized exchanges--companies with limited balance sheets, but which 
nonetheless play a vital role in the workings of our financial system.
