the workforce.  But the data suggest that the long-term unemployed look basically the 

same as other unemployed people in terms of their occupations, educational attainment, 

and other characteristics.  And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the 

short-term jobless do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally 

improved for both groups.  That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-

term unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term 

unemployed.  This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term 

unemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.  

A final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior of the 

participation rate--the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are seeking jobs.  

Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to 

find one.  When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age population was part 

of the labor force.  Participation dropped, as it normally does in a recession, but then kept 

dropping in the recovery.  It now stands at 63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a 

much smaller share of women were in the workforce.  Lower participation could mean 

that the 6.7 percent unemployment rate is overstating the progress in the labor market. 

One factor lowering participation is the aging of the population, which means that 

an increasing share of the population is retired.  If demographics were the only or 

overwhelming reason for falling participation, then declining participation would not be a 

sign of labor market slack.  But some “retirements” are not voluntary, and some of these 

workers may rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy.  Participation rates have been 

falling broadly for workers of different ages, including many in the prime of their 

working lives.  Based on the evidence, my own view is that a significant amount of the
