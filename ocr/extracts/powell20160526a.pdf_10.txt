Over time, our understanding of the relationship between recessions and supply-

side factors has evolved.13  There is a growing body of work suggesting that recessions 

can leave behind lasting damage--especially severe recessions associated with a financial 

crisis.  One recent analysis suggests that about one-third of the time, there is no 

permanent supply-side damage; about one-third of the time, there is a reduction in the 

level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and about one-third of the 

time, there is a reduction both in the level of output and in the growth rate.14  

Unfortunately, recent experience suggests that the United States is at risk of falling in the 

last category (figure 7).   

It goes without saying that economic policymakers should use all available tools 

to minimize supply-side damage from the crisis.  We need policies that support labor 

force participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and 

productivity growth--policies that are, for the most part, outside the remit of the Federal 

Reserve.  Monetary policy can contribute by continuing to support the expansion as long 

as inflation remains consistent with our 2 percent objective and inflation expectations 

remain stable.

and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper WP/15/230 (Washington:  International

14 See Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers, “Inflation and Activity,” in note 13.  The authors argue that 
damage from recessions may be caused by hysteresis or by supply shocks such as oil price spikes or 
financial crises.  In some cases, the link between recessions and future growth may reflect “reverse 
causation,” whereby the recession is caused by the realization that future growth will be lower than had 
been expected.
