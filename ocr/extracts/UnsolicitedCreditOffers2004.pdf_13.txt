Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 9 

were the consequence of a prescreened solicitation (table 1). Prescreened telephone 
contacts accounted for about 15 percent of the new accounts. Prescreened solicitations, 
both through the mail and by telephone, accounted for more than two-thirds of all new 
credit card accounts established in 2002.

Use of prescreening by insurance companies is more limited, in large part because so 
much of their acquisition of new accounts is through independent agents who are 
responsible for marketing. A public comment by one national CRA indicated that it had 
used its files for prescreening on behalf of forty-two insurance companies in 2003. This 
is a much smaller number than the number of creditors employing prescreening using 
CRA files. The number of companies in the latter group is not known precisely, but it is 
at least in the hundreds.
