 Taking all of these measures of labor utilization on board, what can we say about 

the state of the labor market relative to our statutory goal of maximum employment?   

While uncertainty around the long run level of these indicators is substantial, many of 

them suggest a labor market that is in the neighborhood of maximum employment.  A 

few other measures continue to suggest some remaining slack.  Assessments of the 

maximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision.  As we 

seek the highest sustainable utilization of labor resources, the Committee will be guided 

by incoming data across all of these measures.    

Inflation 

That brings me to inflation--the other leg of our dual mandate.  The substantial 

improvement in the labor market has been accompanied by low inflation.  Indeed, 

inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 9).  

Consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, 

increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in February.  The core price index, 

which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future 

inflation, rose 1.6 percent over the same period.  In fact, both of these indexes have been 

below 2 percent consistently for the past half-dozen years.  This persistent shortfall in 

inflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between 

inflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the Phillips curve.  Given how low 

the unemployment rate is, why arenâ€™t we seeing higher inflation now?  

As those of you who carefully read the minutes of each FOMC meeting are 

aware--and I know there are some of you out there--we had a thorough discussion of 

inflation dynamics at our January meeting.  Almost all of the participants in that
