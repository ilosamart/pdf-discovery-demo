When the CCyB rule was issued in September 2016, it was calibrated against the 

backdrop of the established levels of required U.S. structural buffers.  Thus, it would be prudent 

to accompany any consideration of material adjustments to the calibration of the structural 

buffers held by the large banking institutions, with compensating adjustments to the 

countercyclical buffer in order to achieve the same overall level of resilience through the cycle. 

Completing the Agenda  

 While we have made important progress in our regulatory framework, we still have not 

implemented a few key elements.  The list of remaining items is short but important and well 

anticipated.   

First, we are close to finalizing the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR.  This significant 

liquidity regulation is important to ensure that large banking firms maintain a stable funding 

profile over a one-year horizon.  It will serve as a natural complement to our existing liquidity 

coverage ratio, which helps ensure firms can withstand liquidity strains over a 30-day time 

horizon.  And by most estimates, our large complex banking institutions are in a position to meet 

the expected requirements with little adjustment. 

Second, we need to finalize Dodd-Frank Act limits on large counterparty exposures.  

These limits will reduce the chances that outsized exposures, particularly between large financial 

institutions, could spread financial distress and undermine financial stability as we witnessed 

during the last financial crisis.  Moreover, these large exposure limits will effectively update the 

traditional bank lending limits that proved useful for well over 100 years for todayâ€™s challenges, 

by recognizing the many ways in which banks and their affiliates take on credit exposure beyond 

directly extending loans.
