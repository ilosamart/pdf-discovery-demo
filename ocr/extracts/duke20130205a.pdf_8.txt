bank profitability.  Moreover, the strength of the relationship increases during and immediately 

after the financial crisis, confirming that management quality is particularly important during 

times of economic stress.    

Factors outside the control of bank management, however, are also importantly related to 

profitability, particularly over the past several years.  For instance, it is not surprising that 

community banks operating in markets experiencing high unemployment rates have been less 

profitable since the financial crisis.  Perhaps less obvious is that in urban markets, community 

bank profitability tends to decrease as the size of the market increases.  One might suspect that 

this relationship derives from a more competitive landscape in larger urban areas; however, no 

relationship between market concentration and profits is evident in urban markets.  In contrast, in 

rural areas, higher market concentration is associated with higher community bank profitability 

throughout most of the study period.  In addition, the study finds that community banks 

operating in rural markets consistently earn higher average rates of return than do community 

banks operating in urban markets. 

In a separate analysis of deposit market competition that may form the basis for a new 

research paper, one researcher has documented the competitive strength of community banks, 

especially in rural markets.  Although the nationwide share of total deposits held by banks with 

assets less than $10 billion has declined over the past decade, in rural markets, their deposit 

market share has increased slightly.  Moreover, banks with assets less than $10 billion retained 

their share of rural market deposits throughout the recent recession and recovery.  At a more 

micro level, banks with assets less than $10 billion gained market share in more than two-thirds 

of rural banking markets and in nearly half of urban markets between 2003 and 2012.
