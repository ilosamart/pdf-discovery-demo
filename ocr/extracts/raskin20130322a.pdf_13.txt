The “broken windows” strategy is every bit as compelling when it comes to 

addressing the disorder that comes from sloppy practices by financial institutions.  If 

banking practices are undermining the ability of the economically marginalized to 

become financially included and to access the credit they need in an affordable way, 

regulators must move in quickly to stop the disorder and repair the broken windows of 

financial intermediation.    

Bank supervisors should be prepared to respond to the earliest signs of trouble by 

requiring operationally challenged banks to address problems quickly and completely.   If 

corrections are made, then the regulators can move on.  If not, then the regulators need to 

escalate enforcement. 

Swift and decisive corrective action is not always how federal bank regulators 

have responded to broken windows in the past.   In my view, for example, regulators’ 

response to the rampant, long-running problems in loan-servicing practices at large 

financial institutions was not swift and was not decisive.  The point is that federal 

regulators must listen carefully to community input and analysis in order to keep track of 

where windows are breaking and how they are being broken.  And they must carefully 

study and take responsibility for analyzing comments provided by organizations such as 

the NCRC when considering the public benefit of an application.  Both the exam process 

and the application process must be strengthened as key venues for federal regulators to 

incorporate the voices of affected communities; I'd like to see us revise and strengthen 

these processes to include the analysis in these voices.
