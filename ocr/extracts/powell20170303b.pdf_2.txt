 New technology and innovative businesses increasingly affect our daily 

financial lives.  Mobile devices, high-speed data communication, and online 

commerce are creating expectations that convenient, secure, real-time payment and 

banking capabilities should be available whenever and wherever they are needed.  

At the same time, disruptive new technologies suggest that traditional financial 

service providers must innovate and adapt or be left behind.     

Against this backdrop of technological change and heightened expectations, 

it is worth remembering our broad public policy objectives, which are driven by 

the fundamental importance of the payments system in our society.  Today, I will 

lay out those objectives as we see them at the Federal Reserve, and focus in 

particular on their application in three specific areas where technological 

innovation is driving change: creating a real-time retail payments system, using 

distributed ledger technology to develop new clearing and settlement services, and 

the issuance of digital currencies by central banks. 

Public Policy Objectives for the Payments System 

 We trust financial intermediaries to hold and transfer funds in a safe and 

secure manner to meet the needs of commerce.  The payments system provides 

financial institutions and their customers a variety of ways to transfer funds, but 

the goal is essentially the same in all cases: to move money from one individual or 

business to another in a reliable, secure, low-cost, and convenient manner.
