services broadly.  For example, their technology may increase speed and efficiency, and the 

ubiquity of their presence in our lives may allow them to offer financial services in a more 

convenient way or at lower cost to consumers.  Further, as they are only dipping their toes into 

the edges of the financial services water, the effects they have on the provision of financial 

services could grow enormously if they were to dive in. 

Looking at the technologies that underlie some of the recent innovative financial

connect financial market participants directly without an intermediary.  The potential areas of 

impact are broad: settling interbank payments; verifying and reconciling trade finance invoices;

and the ability of technology to decentralize financial transactions raise a number of issues, some 

of which may touch on financial stability.  Technological innovation offers the promise of a 

substantially more efficient financial system.  But new systems, processes, and types of 

businesses will bring with them novel fragilities.  We continue to be responsible for ensuring that 

the financial system be sufficiently resilient that businesses and households worldwide need not 

fear the collapse of the system that serves their needs. 

These are open questions that need to be addressed, and because they touch on issues of 

financial stability, the FSB is putting significant resources into understanding these potentially 

important developments.  To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because 

innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits.  As the group charged
