Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the American Economic 

Association (AEA), the National Science Foundation and the other organizations and 

institutions sponsoring this conference, which for nearly 20 years has focused attention 

on the benefits of diversity and the need for continued progress in ensuring that the best 

and the brightest have the opportunity to advance and contribute to the field of 

economics.  I want to especially thank Lisa Cook for giving me the opportunity to be here 

today.1 

I am particularly pleased to be able to speak with students participating in the 

AEA’s Summer and Mentoring Programs.  At the Fed, we share the goal of making sure 

the group of students who go on to practice economics look more like America.  So if 

you are interested in pursuing economics, we want to make sure you have an opportunity 

to contribute to the field. 

Perhaps more than any other profession, it is in the DNA of economists to believe 

that equality of opportunity is important not only as a matter of fairness, but also to our 

country’s vitality.  In addition, economists like to base conclusions on hard numbers.  

The numbers make clear there is a persistent lack of diversity in the economics 

profession, which indicates we are falling short of our ideals.   

The quality of the economics profession and its contributions to society will be 

stronger when a broader range of people are engaged.  We now have substantial 

empirical evidence documenting the benefits of diversity in broadening the range of ideas 

and perspectives that are brought to bear on solving problems, and thereby contributing to
