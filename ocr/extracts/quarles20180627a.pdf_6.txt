I will now discuss the new law, which preserves the most important post-crisis 

reforms for the largest firms while directing the Federal Reserve and other agencies to 

make numerous changes that should reduce the regulatory burden for community and 

regional banks.  On the Volcker rule, the legislation calls for exempting the vast majority 

of banks with $10 billion or less in assets from reporting requirements, which the Federal 

Reserve supported, due to the lack of trading activity that community banks engage in.  

This overtook efforts by the Fed and other regulatory agencies to refine the Volcker rule, 

but the bottom line is that this broad exemption is law and in the process of being 

implemented.  

Another change in the new legislation raises the asset threshold for bank holding 

companies eligible for the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from  

$1 billion to $3 billion.  The law also exempts bank holding companies with $50 billion 

to $100 billion in assets from enhanced prudential standards and exempts banks with less 

than $100 billion in assets from future stress testing.  The lifting of this threshold 

importantly allows the Federal Reserve to tailor its rules for these firms moving forward 

while retaining the ability to protect the safety and soundness of the system. 

I mentioned steps related to Call Report streamlining, and the legislation 

addresses this topic also, allowing reduced Call Report requirements for certain banks 

with less than $5 billion in assets.  For banks that are well managed and well-capitalized, 

the asset threshold was raised for a longer, 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion 

to $3 billion. The legislation would also exempt from an appraisal requirement rural 

properties for loans of less than $400,000, under certain circumstances.
