 Each recent edition of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) has focused on 

some aspect of the comparative economic experience of different racial and ethnic groups. In 

addition, as indicated in the minutes published after each meeting of the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC), Federal Reserve staff regularly report on the differential 

labor experiences of different racial and ethnic groups as background for the FOMC’s 

deliberations on monetary policy.   

 Across the Federal Reserve System, a variety of initiatives are aimed at 

understanding economic disparities and how to foster more-inclusive growth.  The 

Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 

brings together researchers from a variety of fields to analyze barriers to economic 

opportunity and advancement.  The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community 

stakeholders to focus on differences in poverty and economic mobility across 

demographic characteristics.  The Investing in America’s Workforce Initiative is a 

collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and academic research institutions to 

promote investment in workforce skills that better align with employers’ needs.15
