effective containing the impact if you have thought through the necessary responses 

beforehand.  Finally, you need to have plans in place to recover business functions.  This 

may include investments in new tools and approaches to aid in rapid recovery.  I would 

also advise that you participate in industry-led tabletop exercises to help you think 

through how to respond and recover from cybersecurity events. 

4. Education 

 We’ve talked a lot about fostering the security of the payment system, but we 

should also talk about the public’s perceptions.  Even if we have a comprehensive, well-

implemented security plan, one high-profile breach can shake public confidence. 

Research suggests that the way consumers feel about a particular payment mechanism 

affects the way they choose to pay.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s most recent 

report on consumers’ use of mobile financial services notes that security concerns are a 

main impediment to the adoption of mobile financial services.8  Education is a way to 

enhance both payment system security and public confidence. 

My fourth point is that, collectively, we could do more to empower consumers to 

use financial products safely by educating them on the risks they face and the steps they 

can take to protect themselves.  For example, financial institutions can provide and help 

customers understand online banking tools like credit card transaction alerts that can help 

consumers spot or stop fraud.  We also need to be prepared, to the extent possible, to 

respond to a security incident in a transparent and timely manner so that consumers 

understand the implications of the event.  Policymakers can also provide facts and data to 

paint a realistic picture of the threats that exist in the payment system.  One example is
