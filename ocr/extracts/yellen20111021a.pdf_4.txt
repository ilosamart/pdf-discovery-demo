transitory, played a notable role in depressing growth and in boosting inflation during the 

first half of the year.  First, sharp increases in the prices of oil and other commodities 

eroded the purchasing power of households’ incomes, thus restraining their spending.  

Gasoline and food prices surged, and a portion of producers’ higher input costs were 

passed through to the prices of a wide range of consumer goods and services.  Second, 

the production and sale of motor vehicles declined sharply because of disruptions in 

global supply chains in the aftermath of the disastrous earthquake and tsunami that struck 

Japan last March.  These supply disruptions also limited the availability of some popular 

models, placing upward pressure on motor vehicle prices.  

Fortunately, commodity prices have come down from their earlier peaks, which 

should ease pressures on consumer prices and, in turn, lessen strains on household 

budgets.  Automotive supply chain disruptions have also diminished in recent months, 

resulting in a rebound of both the production and sales of new motor vehicles.  Partly for 

these reasons, it looks likely that economic growth in the second half of this year will be 

noticeably stronger, and inflation more moderate, than in the first half.  Unfortunately, 

however, a range of other, more persistent factors also appear to be restraining the 

recovery.  Moreover, financial market conditions have deteriorated, on net, in recent 

months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the economy. 

Persistent Restraints on the Economic Recovery    

The average pace of consumer spending during the past several quarters has been 

weaker than can be explained by the transitory factors that I just mentioned.  High levels 

of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values 

of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending.  Households
