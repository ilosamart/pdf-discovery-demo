The recession that began in the United States in December 2007 ended in June 

2009.  But the Great Recession is a near-worldwide phenomenon, with the consequences 

of which many advanced economies--among them Sweden--continue to struggle.  Its 

depth and breadth appear to have changed the economic environment in many ways and 

to have left the road ahead unclear.   

Today I will discuss three key aspects of the challenges policymakers face as they 

seek to move ahead.  These are:  (1) The impact of the Great Recession and the 

associated Global Financial Crisis on the growth of output, both in the short term and 

over the longer term.  (2) The reform of the financial sector--in other words, how much 

progress have we made in creating a safer and more stable post-crisis financial 

environment?  (3) The impact of the crisis on the conduct of monetary policy--in 

particular, how to balance the goals of achieving stable inflation and full employment 

while also taking into account the need to maintain financial stability.  I will leave it to 

others to address the important challenges facing fiscal policymakers as they determine 

the appropriate roles and paths for fiscal policy at both the macro- and micro-levels.   

To keep the focus sharp, I will deal primarily with the economy of the United 

States.  But policymakers around the world confront related challenges and I will draw 

also on the post-crisis experiences of other economies.  And I should make it clear that 

my comments today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent the views of other 

members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open 

Market Committee.1
