health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, 

encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and 

career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to 

enumerate--these are the folks who reap the largest rewards.  The only way for 

even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered 

fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the 

greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the 

world, and to share their luck with others.  As the Gospel of Luke says (and I 

am sure my rabbi will forgive me for quoting the New Testament in a good 

cause):  “From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be 

required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will 

be demanded” (Luke 12:48, New Revised Standard Version Bible).  Kind of 

grading on the curve, you might say. 


4. Who is worthy of admiration?  Luke’s admonition--which is shared by most 

ethical and philosophical traditions, by the way--helps with this question as 

well.  Those most worthy of admiration are those who have made the best use 

of their advantages or, alternatively, coped most courageously with their 

adversities.  I think most of us would agree that people who have, say, little 

formal schooling but labor honestly and diligently to help feed, clothe, and 

educate their families are deserving of greater respect--and help, if necessary--

than many people who are superficially more successful.  They’re more fun to 

have a beer with, too.  That is all you need to know about sociology.
