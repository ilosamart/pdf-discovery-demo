well as providing them with the financial security to manage the usual changes in income 

over a lifetime.  When we dig into the various liquid savings, assets, and liabilities that 

underlie the overall wealth numbers for middle-income households, the picture suggests 

limited room to absorb volatility in cash flows.  Many middle-income families have 

relatively little in easily accessible, or liquid, savings, carry a significant amount of debt, 

and are concerned about the adequacy of their retirement savings.   

Liquid savings  

By drawing from several household surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve, 

we can gain important insights into how assets and liabilities of middle-income 

households affect their economic security.  Research based on the 2016 SCF shows that 

only about one-fourth of middle-income households have enough liquid savings to cover 

six months of expenses—the amount often recommended by financial advisers—and only 

4 in 10 could cover three months of expenses.9  The majority of middle-income 

households thus do not have sufficient liquid savings to weather a typical material 

financial disruption—for instance, one associated with a temporary job loss or illness.   

Even modest unexpected expenses could be disruptive for many middle-income 

families.  According to the forthcoming results from the 2018 SHED, one-third of 

middle-income adults said that they would borrow money, sell something, or not be able

using the Survey of Consumer Finances,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, November 19), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2275.  In this study, “middle income” 
refers to households with income between the 25th and 75th percentiles.  Income is defined as the “usual 
amount” of income the household earned in the previous year and could differ from the actual amount.  
Overall expenses are estimated using partial data on household expenses, including rent, mortgages 
payments, car loans, and food.
