and bridges.  Improving that system, both by doing necessary maintenance to maintain 

safety and functionality and by reducing congestion could yield substantial benefits.19   

This agenda might sound ambitious.  In fact, spending in these areas is currently 

not a very large proportion of federal outlays.  For example, the entire federal budget for 

nondefense research programs--including expenditures on health research, the National 

Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation--is only 2 

percent of federal spending (or less than 0.4 percent of GDP), well below the share in the 

1960s, when we last made a significant effort to advance our capacities in math and 

science during the era of space exploration.  Moreover, spending in these areas has been 

the target of much of the budget restraint in recent years.  Even in the area of physical 

infrastructure, we have fallen behind past efforts.  After a surge associated with fiscal 

stimulus during the recent recession, public spending on infrastructure has tumbled, 

resulting in the slowest growth (1 percent) in the state and local capital stock since 

WWII.   

I certainly am not intending here to join the broader debate on fiscal policy, either 

short or longer term.  But I do note that fiscal policymakers could promote the longer-

term prospects of the nation by increased spending in areas that are likely to yield 

increases in living standards.  The amount of increased investment spending that could 

reasonably be absorbed would be quite modest in comparison with the very large 

amounts associated with major fiscal issues such as health-care expenses.  And even a
