(GHOS).  The revision expands the range of assets that can count as HQLA and also 

adjusts some of the assumptions that govern the modeling of net outflows in a stress 

scenario.  In addition, the committee agreed in January to a gradual phase-in of the LCR, 

so that it only becomes fully effective on an international basis in January 2019.  On the 

domestic front, the Federal Reserve expects that the U.S. banking agencies will issue a 

proposal later this year to implement the LCR for large U.S. banking firms. 

While this progress is welcome, a number of questions remain.  First, to what 

extent should access to liquidity from a central bank be allowed to count toward 

satisfying the LCR?  In January, the GHOS noted that the interaction between the LCR 

and the provision of central bank facilities is critically important.  And the group 

instructed the Basel Committee to continue working on this issue in 2013. 

Second, what steps should be taken to enhance the usability of the LCR buffer--

that is, to encourage banks to actually draw down their HQLA buffers, as opposed to fire-

selling other less liquid assets?  The GHOS has also made clear its view that, during 

periods of stress, it would be appropriate for banks to use their HQLA, thereby falling 

below the minimum.  However, creating a regime in which banks voluntarily choose to 

do so is not an easy task.  A number of observers have expressed the concern that if a 

bank is held to an LCR standard of 100 percent in normal times, it may be reluctant to 

allow its ratio to drop below 100 percent when facing large outflows, even if regulators 

were to permit this temporary deviation, for fear that a decline in the ratio could be 

interpreted as a sign of weakness. 

My aim here is to sketch a framework for thinking about these and related issues.  

Among them, the interplay between the LCR and central bank liquidity provision is
