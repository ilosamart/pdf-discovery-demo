improving jobs situation, and consumer confidence has been solid.  In addition, the drop 

in oil prices amounts to a sizable boost in household purchasing power.  The annual 

savings in gasoline costs has been estimated at about $700 per household, on average, 

and savings on heating costs--especially here in the Northeast, where it was so cold this 

winter--are also large.6  Given these energy savings on top of the job gains, real 

disposable income has risen almost 4 percent nationally over the past four quarters.  

Households and businesses also are benefiting from favorable financial conditions.  

Borrowing costs are low, supported by the Fed’s accommodative monetary policies.  And 

credit availability to both households and small businesses has improved. 

In recent months, as I noted earlier, there has been some softness in the economic 

data.  Recent indicators of both household spending and business investment have 

slowed, and industrial output has declined.  The Commerce Department’s initial estimate 

was that real gross domestic product was nearly flat in the first quarter of 2015.  If 

confirmed by further estimates, my guess is that this apparent slowdown was largely the 

result of a variety of transitory factors that occurred at the same time, including the 

unusually cold and snowy winter and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast, both 

of which likely disrupted some economic activity.  And some of this apparent weakness 

may just be statistical noise.  I therefore expect the economic data to strengthen.   

All of that said, the headwinds facing our economy have not fully abated, and, as 

such, I expect that continued growth in employment and output will be moderate over the 

remainder of the year and beyond.
