As discussed in the FOMC's statement titled Policy Normalization Principles and 

Plans, which was published following the September 2014 FOMC meeting, we will use 

the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) as our primary tool to control the federal 

funds rate.16  We also plan to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) 

facility, as needed.  In an ON RRP operation, counterparties may invest funds with the 

Fed at a given rate, possibly subject to a cap on the aggregate amount invested.  Because 

ON RRP counterparties include many money market participants that are not eligible to 

receive IOER, the facility can be a powerful tool for controlling money market interest 

rates.  Indeed, testing to date by the New York Fed suggests that ON RRP operations 

have generally established a soft floor for such rates.17  

However, an ON RRP program also has certain risks.  For example, a large and 

persistent program could have unanticipated and adverse effects on the structure of 

money markets.  In addition, in times of stress, demand for the safety and liquidity of ON 

RRPs with the central bank might increase sharply, potentially exacerbating disruptive 

flight-to-quality flows.18  To mitigate these risks, the FOMC has agreed that it will use an 

ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer 

needed.  

In addition, the Fed has been discussing and testing other supplementary tools, 

such as term reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits, and can use these tools as 

needed to help support money market rates.

17 Policymakers have discussed the benefits and costs of an ON RRP facility.  For further discussion on this 
topic, see, for example, the FOMC minutes for June 2014, July 2014, and January 2015; see Board of 
Governors (2014b, 2014c, 2015). 
18 See Frost and others (2015).  As the authors note, an ON RRP facility can also potentially contribute to 
financial stability by crowding out risky short-term borrowing by financial institutions and businesses.
