convenience--is equal to 2 percent, roughly the average historical value of the real federal 

funds rate prior to the financial crisis.  For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in 

core PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation.  And the output 

gap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated 

longer-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate.13  The 

dashed red line in figure 5 shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the 

medium term, based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections 

submitted by FOMC participants in December but assuming--in contrast to the median of 

participants’ December assessments--that R* equals 2 percent.  As figure 5 shows, this 

version of the Taylor rule prescribes a much higher path for the federal funds rate than 

the median of participants’ assessments of appropriate policy. 

One important factor explaining this divergence is the FOMC’s growing 

recognition that the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate has likely 

declined below 2 percent, contrary to what is often assumed in implementations of the 

Taylor rule.  As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC 

participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their 

projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer 

run.  Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that 

lower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed 

permanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel.  In addition, the right-hand 

panel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer-run rate of 

                                                           
13 Historically, percent deviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long-run trend are roughly 
twice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long-run value--a 
relationship known as Okun’s law.
