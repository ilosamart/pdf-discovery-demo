These responsibilities do not represent a new mandate--they were the impetus 

behind the 1913 legislation setting up the Federal Reserve System and, in a somewhat 

subordinate role, behind the legislation setting up both the independent Bank of England 

and the European Central Bank as well as many other central banks whose legal 

framework has changed in the past two decades.22  But these responsibilities have 

received far more emphasis following the financial crisis.  As has long been known, a 

central bank must take into account risks to financial stability if it is to help achieve good 

macroeconomic performance.23   

Could central bank involvement in dealing with potential financial instability 

present a challenge to central bank independence?  In answering this question, we need to 

consider an important difference between the use of traditional monetary policy and the 

use of macroprudential policies.  Macroprudential policies are typically aimed at a 

specific sector.  Often the housing sector is disproportionately involved in financial 

crises.   

In the face of an incipient bubble growing in the housing sector at a time when 

inflation and unemployment are at their target levels, the first instinct of regulators and 

others--the central bank among them--is to turn to macroprudential instruments, such as 

constraints on the loan-to-value ratio or the debt-service-to-income ratio of borrowers.  

However, doing so would affect particular sectors of the population.  This difficulty can, 

to some extent, be dealt with by tailoring the macroprudential measures in ways that 

                                                 
22 Recall that the Federal Reserve was itself created in response to a severe financial panic, the Panic of 
1907.  This panic led to the creation of the National Monetary Commission, whose 1911 report was a major 
factor in the creation of the Federal Reserve Act, signed into law in 1913.
