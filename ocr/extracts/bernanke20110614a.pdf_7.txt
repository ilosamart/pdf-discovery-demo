deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well 

be a protracted period.3 

Some have suggested that payments by the Treasury could be prioritized to meet 

principal and interest payments on debt outstanding, thus avoiding a technical default on 

federal debt.  However, even if that were the case, given the current size of the deficit and 

the uneven time pattern of government receipts and payments, the Treasury would soon 

find it necessary to prioritize among and withhold critical disbursements, such as Social 

Security and Medicare payments and funds for the military.  Moreover, while debt-

related payments might be met in this scenario, the fact that many other government 

payments would be delayed could still create serious concerns about the safety of 

Treasury securities among financial market participants.  The Hippocratic oath holds that, 

first, we should do no harm.  In debating critical fiscal issues, we should avoid 

unnecessary actions or threats that risk shaking the confidence of investors in the ability 

and willingness of the U.S. government to pay its bills. 

In raising this concern, I am by no means recommending delay or inaction in 

addressing the nationâ€™s long-term fiscal challenges--quite the opposite.  I urge the 

Congress and the Administration to work in good faith to quickly develop and implement 

a credible plan to achieve long-term sustainability.  I hope, though, that such a plan can 

be achieved in the near term without resorting to brinksmanship or actions that would 

cast doubt on the creditworthiness of the United States. 

What would such a plan look like?  Clear metrics are important, together with 

triggers or other mechanisms to establish the credibility of the plan.  For example, 

                                                 
3 Some evidence that interest rates can rise in response to even a short, temporary period during which the 
Treasury cannot make payments on a relatively small amount of maturing securities is presented by Zivney 
and Marcus (1989).
