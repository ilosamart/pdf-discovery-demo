incorporated into monetary policy, monetary tightening will surely not be the correct 

response to most instances of increasing leverage or asset prices that raise 

macroprudential concerns.  Well-developed time-varying measures might be effective in 

slowing the increase in systemic risk to give monetary policymakers more time to 

evaluate the need for a monetary policy response. 

There are two obvious places to begin a considered development of time-varying 

tools.  One is in the traditional supervisory oversight of practices at regulated institutions, 

as enhanced by the increasingly horizontal, interdisciplinary features of large bank 

supervision.  Good supervision is always time-varying, in that it should respond to 

potential and growing problems in a directed fashion.

  The coordination engendered by 

the LISCC and parallel efforts facilitates the identification of potentially risky trends in, 

for example, underwriting certain forms of lending.  The greater use of data, both for the 

regulated sector as collected by supervisors and for the economy as a whole as analyzed 

by our Office of Financial Stability, further increases the prospects of timely supervisory 

responses.   

I do not want to overstate the significance of this evolution in supervisory 

practice, however.  For one thing, as was shown by the experience with commercial real 

estate lending guidance issued before the crisis, supervisory guidance is an imperfect 

tool.  In addition to the issues surrounding real-time interventions mentioned earlier, that 

episode revealed the potential for substantial political resistance to supervisory actions 

directed at specific sectors.  Still, with the institutionalization of financial stability 

concerns at the Federal Reserve and the FSOC, and with the ongoing improvements in 

relevant analytic capacities, there is room to develop this tool further.

 One should note that “time-varying” supervision should not mean excessively procyclical supervision.
