Interest Rate Movements and the Performance of Financial Intermediaries  

In light of the uncertain course of interest rates, financial intermediaries face significant 

challenges in managing their interest rate exposures.  Clearly, the impact of changes in market 

rates depends on the maturity and re-pricing mismatches embedded in institutions’ assets, 

liabilities, and off-balance-sheet positions.  In general, those institutions whose assets are 

expected to re-price faster than their liabilities--referred to as “asset-sensitive”--would be 

expected to benefit from a rise in rates, because higher rates, holding everything else constant, 

should increase their net interest margins.  Conversely, the net interest margins of “liability-

sensitive” institutions--those whose asset durations are longer than their liability durations--

would be expected to be negatively affected by a rise in market interest rates.  

Of course, there are more than 15,000 U.S. banks, thrifts, and credit unions, and the 

interest rate risk exposures faced by individual institutions are much more complex than these 

simple characterizations might lead us to believe.  Each institution has its own unique funding 

structure and asset-liability re-pricing mismatches, based not only on the structural 

characteristics of its particular market and product offerings, but also on the impact of the current 

crisis and government countermeasures on its credit and liquidity risk exposures.    

For example, many large banking organizations have publicly disclosed that they have 

asset-sensitive positions, suggesting an ability to benefit from increases in short-term rates.  Such 

characteristics are no doubt influenced by their significant holdings of excess reserves and other 

short-term liquid assets taken on during the crisis.  Monetary policy tightening will entail 

draining excess reserves at some point, and as institutions reconsider their liquidity 

management--subject to new, stronger liquidity requirements from supervisors, to be sure--their 

current asset-sensitivity might be expected to decline.  And the behavior of various types of 

customers and instruments may be difficult to predict as the economy and financial markets
