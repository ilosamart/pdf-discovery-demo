As emerging market economies become increasingly important in the global 

trading and financial systems, the world economy will depend even more on them to 

maintain strong domestic growth and economic and financial stability.  Thus, the 

improvements in emerging market policies and policy frameworks I have discussed today 

have ramifications beyond the emerging market economies themselves.  Emerging 

market nations also have a key role to play in the important efforts to reduce global 

imbalances in trade and capital flows.  Again, the G-20 is in a position to lead.  The fact 

that Korea is chairing the G-20 at this crucial time is a notable vote of confidence in 

Korea and its institutions.  We look forward to continuing our cooperation with Korea as 

we tackle the global economic challenges before us and the ones yet to come.  My best 

wishes for a productive conference and for the continued success of the Bank of Korea.
