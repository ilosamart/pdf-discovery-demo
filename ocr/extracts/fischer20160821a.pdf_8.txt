the solution can be found in the observation that overall macroeconomic policy does not 

have to be confined solely to monetary policy.  In particular, monetary policy is not well 

equipped to address long-term issues like the slowdown in productivity growth.  Rather, 

the key to boosting productivity growth, and the long-run potential of the economy, is 

more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory policies.13  While there is 

disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of 

improved public infrastructure, better education, more encouragement for private 

investment, and more-effective regulation all likely have a role to play in promoting 

faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also in reducing the probability 

that the economy and particularly the central bank will in the future have to contend more 

than is necessary with the zero lower bound. 


                                                 
13 One related hypothesis, identified with Mancur Olson, is that, absent major shakeups of the institutional 
structure of the economy, the gradual accretion of the barnacles produced by the political process slows the 
vitality of the economy until eventually the public is willing to face the difficulties attending the structural 
reforms needed to restore that vitality.
