What’s more, financial institutions need to understand that they are responsible 

for assessing the effects their actions will have on consumers and the country as a whole, 

and factor those considerations into their business decisions.  We should not forget that 

effective enforcement of our laws can animate our efforts as policymakers, regulators, 

business innovators, legal educators, and lawyers in creating the conditions that must 

exist for the emergence of an improved mortgage-servicing model that hinders neither 

economic growth nor homeowners’ legal security.  If a law is worth having, the law is 

worth enforcing. 

Thank you.
