is bringing together the skills of economists, financial market specialists, payment 

systems experts, and others, with those of bank examiners to get the widest possible 

perspective on financial developments.   

The stress assessment also showed how much can be learned by explicit 

comparisons of the practices and risks of different firms, rather than focusing on only one 

firm at a time, as was often the practice in the past.  Thus, the Federal Reserve is 

increasing its use of cross-firm, horizontal examinations.  Moreover, we will be looking 

at all activities within a consolidated organization that can create risk to the firm and the 

financial system, not just those that increase risk for insured depository institutions within 

the larger firm.  

A quantitative surveillance mechanism for large, complex financial organizations 

will be an essential component of our multidisciplinary approach.  We will use 

supervisory information, firm-specific data, and financial market data to identify 

developing strains and imbalances that may affect multiple institutions, as well as 

specific firms.  As in the stress tests, our staff members will conduct forward-looking 

scenario analyses to gauge the potential effects of adverse changes in the operating 

environment on individual firms and on the system as a whole.  This work will allow us 

to more effectively connect the firm-specific information and insights gained from 

traditional examinations and other supervisory activities with analysis of systemwide 

developments and emerging stresses. 

Enhanced data collection is a key component of our supervisory restructuring, 

particularly for our increased emphasis on systemic surveillance.  We have initiated new 

efforts to better measure large institutionsâ€™ counterparty credit risk and
