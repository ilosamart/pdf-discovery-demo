It is a pleasure to be here today at the European Central Bank in my capacity as chair of 

the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to help celebrate the Journal of Money, Credit and 

Banking’s (JMCB) 50th anniversary.  The broad scope of the JMCB, and the diversity of its 

scholarship parallels, in some ways, the FSB itself.  As we dealt with the global financial crisis, 

the heads of state and government of the G20 tasked the FSB with identifying and addressing 

vulnerabilities in the global financial system and developing stronger regulatory and supervisory 

policies to create a more resilient global financial system in the pursuit of financial stability.  Our 

broad mandate has considerable overlap with the fields that the JMCB covers within its pages.  

The FSB includes 24 jurisdictions and 73 representatives, including all the members of the G20.  

Also similar to the JMCB, the FSB is celebrating an anniversary this year, with its creation 

having occurred 10 years ago.  We are a far cry from the JMCB’s 50 years, but I hope that in 

time our continuing work--and not just our response to the late crisis--will prove valuable enough 

that we one day merit a similar celebration. 

I am especially pleased to speak at this conference today because the FSB welcomes and 

encourages the participation of the academic community in tackling issues of global financial 

stability.  I would like to see a greater and more direct contribution of academic subject-matter 

experts to our work.  You may have noticed that the FSB sent out a call for nominations last 

month for academics to advise our work in evaluating post-crisis reforms--in this particular 

instance, the evaluation that will examine the effects of the too-big-to-fail reform package that 

the G20 endorsed in 2010 and that the FSB and other standard setters have implemented since 

then.  In our initiatives to examine the consequences of post-crisis reform, the academic 

community can help advance the field with analytical tools and critical insight.
