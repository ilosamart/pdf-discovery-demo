United States, responding to such problems with these tools would require interagency 

coordination, which could make their use cumbersome at critical moments. 

It is important to acknowledge that there remain cases in which macroprudential 

tools are either not available or have not been sufficiently tested in the United States, or 

they may be in conflict with other objectives such as widespread access to credit.  The 

effective lack of such tools has two important consequences.  First, it requires placing 

greater weight on the ability of financial institutions and the financial system as a whole 

to withstand financial shocks without the authorities having to use macroprudential 

instruments--that is to say, on structural reforms to the financial system.  Second, in such 

instances, one could consider using monetary policy--the short term policy interest rate--

to lean against the wind of financial stability risks.18

The use of monetary policy to address financial stability concerns raises two 

distinct but closely related sets of questions.  The first is whether adjustments in the 

policy rate can indeed enhance financial stability by reducing either the odds of a 

financial crisis or the severity of such a crisis once it is under way--and, if so, through 

which channels.19

Provided that the first question is answered in the affirmative, the second question 

is how leaning against the wind interacts with the traditional objectives of monetary 

policy--namely, the employment and inflation mandates in the United States.  This 

tradeoff could be small or even nonexistent when both traditional macro objectives and

of monetary policy tools to foster financial stability objectives.

financial stability risks.  Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2014) offer some views on effective financial stability 
monitoring.
