important to think about the implications of the rules that have already been finalized.  So 

I would like to share my assessment of some potential implications of the QM rule. 

To provide a little context, the QM rule is part of a larger ability-to-repay 

rulemaking that requires lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that 

the borrower can repay the loan.  Many of the rules’ requirements for verification of 

income, assets, and other payment obligations are probably standard practice for lenders 

today.  But having the rules in place, reinforced with increased legal risk for lenders that 

do not meet the rules’ requirements, helps ensure that these practices continue, even as 

the economy improves and competition heats up.  Borrowers who cannot afford their 

loans can sue the lender for violations of the ability-to-repay rules and claim monetary 

damages.  If the original lender sells or securitizes the loan, the borrower can claim these 

damages at any time in a foreclosure action taken by the lender or any assignee.  If the 

mortgage meets the QM standard, however, the lender receives some degree of protection 

from such potential lawsuits because it is presumed that the borrower had the ability to 

repay the loan. 

Loans outside the QM box may become more costly for lenders and borrowers for 

at least three reasons.  The first reason is the possible increase in foreclosure losses and 

litigation costs.  Although the expected losses from this litigation are likely to be small, 

the full extent of the costs and of lenders’ legal liability will become known only after the 

initial round of ability-to-repay suits are settled by the courts.  The second reason is that 

mortgages that do not meet the QM definition also, by definition, will not meet the future 

QRM standard, and so lenders will be required to retain some of the risk if these loans are 

securitized.  This requirement may increase costs and limit the size of the market.  The
