In a world of global trade and integrated capital markets, it is natural for 

economic and financial shocks and policy actions to be transmitted across borders.  

Spillovers from advanced-economy monetary policies are to be expected.5  In theory, 

when advanced economies ease monetary policy in response to a contractionary shock, 

their interest rates will decline, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios toward 

higher-yielding assets.  Some of this rebalancing will occur domestically, but some 

investment will also move abroad, resulting in capital flows to EMEs.  In response, EME 

currencies should tend to appreciate against those of the advanced economies, and EME 

asset prices should rise.  Conversely, a tightening of advanced economy monetary policy 

in response to a stronger economy should lead these movements to reverse; that is, 

tightening should reduce capital flows to EMEs and diminish upward pressure on EME 

currencies and asset prices.   

Are these basic relationships apparent in the data?  The left side of chart 1 shows 

an index of EME local-currency sovereign bond yields along with a roughly similar 

maturity U.S. Treasury yield.  The line on the right is the differential between the two, 

plotted against net inflows of private capital to a selection of EMEs, shown by the bars.  

If interest rates were the main driver of capital flows, these two series ought to move in a 

similar fashion.  At times, this is indeed the case:  From mid-2009 to early 2011, the 

interest rate differential and EME capital inflows rose together.  But the overall 

relationship is not particularly tight.  In early 2007, capital flows to EMEs were quite 

strong even with a low interest rate differential.  And in mid-2011, capital inflows 

stepped down even as the interest rate differential remained elevated.  As I will discuss in 

                                                 
5 The U.S. economy is affected by spillovers from abroad as well, and these are very much a part of our 
policymaking environment.
