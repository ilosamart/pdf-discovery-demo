Reaping the Full Benefits of Financial Openness 

 So where do we go from here?  What needs to be done for countries to reap the 

full benefits of financial openness?  In my view, all countries must continue working 

toward improving the resilience of their domestic financial systems to better take 

advantage of the potential gains from free international financial flows.  Policymakers 

should strive to mitigate financial distortions by improving the regulation and supervision 

of financial markets and institutions, encouraging market transparency, and setting rules 

to enhance corporate governance.  Effective microprudential policy frameworks should 

promote robust domestic financial institutions that are able to suitably intermediate both 

domestic and foreign capital.  Prudential regulation should also be alert for risks from 

abroad, such as a buildup of liquidity risk, foreign currency exposure, or, more generally, 

inadequate intermediation of foreign credit.  Indeed, some empirical studies find greater 

benefits from financial openness when domestic financial markets are more developed 

and where institutions and markets are well supervised.13 

 Granted, setting up an adequate financial policy framework takes significant time 

and resources.  Moreover, putting such a framework in place before liberalizing capital 

flows is not a guarantee that countries will capture the full gains to financial openness 

without any attendant stresses.  Indeed, the recent crisis highlights that these efforts are 

ongoing for all countries, including the United States.  However, though effective 

regulation and supervision are not a panacea, they doubtless increase the chance that 

economies will benefit from financial innovation and openness.
