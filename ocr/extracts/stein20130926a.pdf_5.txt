investors, thereby inducing these investors to take on more interest rate risk and to push 

down term premiums.  

To provide some evidence that bears on the theory, we look at the maturity of 

securities held by commercial banks.  Banks fit with our conception of yield-oriented 

investors to the extent that they care about their reported earnings--which, given bank 

accounting rules for available-for-sale securities, are based on current income from 

securities holdings and not mark-to-market changes in value.  And, indeed, we find that 

when the yield curve steepens, banks increase the maturity of their securities holdings.  

Moreover, the magnitudes of these portfolio shifts are large in the aggregate, so that if 

they had to be absorbed by other, less yield-oriented investors, the shifts could plausibly 

drive changes in marketwide term premiums.  We also find that primary dealers in the 

Treasury market--who, unlike banks, must mark their securities holdings to market--take 

the other side of the trade, reducing the maturity of their Treasury holdings when the 

yield curve steepens.

Overall, I read this evidence as suggesting--albeit tentatively--that some 

mechanism involving yield-oriented investors may eventually turn out to be central to our 

understanding of how monetary policy works, both in ordinary and extraordinary times.  

When I say “central,” I mean that this mechanism may play a role not only in 

determining how monetary policy influences the pricing of credit risk, but also in how it 

shapes the real and nominal yield curves for credit-risk-free Treasury securities.  Of 

course, much work remains to be done before statements like these can be made with any
