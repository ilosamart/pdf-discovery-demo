 It’s a pleasure to be here this morning.  I appreciate the opportunity to take part in 

this conference and to talk with you about credit conditions--especially conditions in the 

small business lending market.  Credit availability is a necessary component of economic 

recovery, and factoring represents an important source of credit for large and small 

businesses.   

Credit markets normally recover slowly following financial crises, and the most 

recent episode was no exception.  However, after declining throughout 2009 and much of 

2010, recent measures of aggregate credit outstanding have shown some signs of 

improvement.  Nonrevolving consumer credit outstanding, which includes auto and 

student lending, has increased for the past seven months.  Issuance of corporate bonds has 

been robust for several quarters, and new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 

securities picked up in the first quarter of 2011, albeit from very low levels.  Commercial 

and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding have resumed growing modestly on average.   

While credit availability seemed to improve for large companies throughout the 

past year, small businesses still complained of difficulty in gaining access to credit.  

Recent anecdotes lead me to believe that conditions are improving for small businesses, 

but data are scarce for this market.  Today I will pull together information from a variety 

of sources, including surveys of small businesses and surveys of lenders, to paint a 

picture of the credit conditions currently facing small businesses. 

Sources of Financing for New and Existing Small Businesses 

Small businesses are central to creating jobs and to restoring our economic 

prosperity.  The economic importance of small businesses is due in part to the fact that 

about one-half of all Americans are employed by firms with fewer than 500 employees.

In addition, business start-ups are a critical component of the experimentation process 

that contributes to restructuring and growth in the United States on an ongoing basis.  

Indeed, each wave of firm start-ups creates a substantial number of jobs.  Over the past 

two decades, firms less than two years old accounted for about one-fourth of gross job 

creation even though such enterprises employed less than 10 percent of the workforce.1  

But, as a note of caution, these young firms also have high job destruction rates; within 

five years of starting up, about 40 percent of the jobs initially created have been 

eliminated by the firms’ exit from their market.  The “up or out” dynamics of start-ups 

and young firms are consistent with the innovation, learning, and market selection that is 

associated with entrepreneurship.   

Given the key role that start-up and established small businesses play in job 

creation, it is useful to consider how start-ups are typically funded and how the owners of 

more-mature, but still small, businesses tend to support their ongoing operations.  To this 

end, the Federal Reserve’s 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) provides some new 

and very preliminary data regarding the primary sources of money used to start, acquire, 

or expand closely held businesses.2  The survey was conducted largely over the second 

half of 2010. 

In this discussion, I will focus on the responses by owners of businesses with 

fewer than 500 employees that were in operation at the time of our survey.  For these 

small and nascent businesses, more than 70 percent were initiated using personal savings 

or assets, about 6 percent were initiated using a personal loan from a bank or savings

Research, August).

survey have been assessed and analyzed.

institution, about 3 percent were initiated using a personal or business credit card, and 

just 3 percent were initiated using a business loan from a bank or savings institution.  

Even smaller percentages of start-up small businesses appear to have received funding 

from credit unions, other institutions, or investors.  In short, our survey data suggest that 

the personal resources of entrepreneurs are the most important funding source for small 

business formation. 

The importance of personal resources in financing small businesses is supported 

by other recent survey evidence.  In our 2009 panel SCF, we found that families make 

loan guarantees for their businesses using personal assets as collateral, and that loans 

between business owners and their businesses are common in both directions.3  

Moreover, according to the most recently available data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 

Survey of Business Owners, 6 in 10 small business owners use personal savings or assets 

to finance or expand their businesses. 

These responses highlight the role personal wealth plays in business formation.  

Looking back at wealth outcomes in 2009, we found that 43 percent of families saw a 

wealth decline equal to or greater than six months of their usual income, and almost one-

third saw a loss greater than an entire year of the usual income.4  Such wealth declines 

would, of course, reduce the likelihood that such households would start a small business.   

                                                            
3 Unlike the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances, which is a point-in-time cross-sectional survey, the 2009 
survey is based on follow-up interviews with participants in the 2007 SCF that update their information.

Kennickell, Traci Mach, and Kevin Moore (2011), “Surveying the Aftermath of the Storm:  Changes in

Over the same period, however, about one-fifth of families saw a gain in wealth 

that was greater than six months of their usual income.  Moreover, a higher percentage of 

business owners who participated in the survey saw larger wealth gains relative to their 

incomes than was the case for the overall population.  These findings suggest that there 

just might be a pool of potential entrepreneurs who have both the resources and relevant 

experience to start successful businesses.   

Turning to the funding needs of more-mature businesses, in the 2010 SCF, we 

asked small business owners whether and to what extent external sources of money were 

used to finance the ongoing operations of or improvements to their primary businesses in 

the past year.  Focusing again on only businesses with fewer than 500 employees, the 

preliminary survey data suggest that for such purposes, slightly less than one-half of these 

businesses did not use any external funding.  Consistent with the funding information on 

the start-up phase for small businesses, a significant proportion of small business owners-

-about one-third--used their personal savings or assets to fund operations or make 

improvements.  And only small percentages of small business owners obtained credit 

from a bank or savings institution for such purposes:  Among these small business 

owners, about 5 percent used personal or business credit cards, slightly less than 

5 percent used business loans, and about 3 percent used personal loans. 

Taken together, these survey data suggest that many small business owners do not 

tap the credit markets, but instead use their own wherewithal to start and fund their 

businesses.  Indeed, a bit less than 80 percent of small business owner survey respondents 

with fewer than 500 employees indicated that they had not even applied for business 

loans in the past five years.  This is not to say that loans are not important--far from it--


- 5 - 
 

 
 

but that for a broad range of businesses, personal finances may be the determining factor 

in starting a business, and personal finances may also be most important in sustaining the 

health of a business once started. 

 So what happened to the small business owners who did apply for loans?  The 

turndown rate was fairly modest--about 12 percent.  Moreover, for those small business 

owners who received credit, more than 90 percent of those surveyed actually received as 

much credit as they had requested.  These results are perhaps surprising given that two of 

the past five years were ones with very tight credit conditions by historical standards, and 

anecdotal evidence suggests that many lines of credit, for businesses and for households, 

were cut during the recent financial crisis.  

Furthermore, small business lending is an important part of overall bank lending, 

especially at community banks.  According to regulatory data, small loans to businesses, 

a proxy for loans to small businesses, constituted 23 percent of total business loans 

outstanding at commercial banks at the end of 2010.5  Over the past several years, this 

share has fluctuated between 22 and 27 percent of banks’ business lending.  In addition, 

at community banks with less than $1 billion in assets, the share is higher--around 66 

percent--whereas at larger banks with more than $10 billion in assets, the share is lower--

16 percent. 

Small Business Concerns 

The foregoing survey data on turndown rates and credit constraints for small 

business owners are consistent with other survey evidence collected by the National 

Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).  In fact, over the past five years, small 

                                                            
5 The data are from the quarterly Call Reports, which ask banks to report their holdings of C&I loans made 
in original amounts of less than $1 million. 


- 6 - 
 

 
 

business owners identified weak demand, taxes, and government regulations more 

frequently than interest rates and credit conditions as their most important problem.  

During that period, less than 5 percent of small business respondents typically identified 

interest rates and credit conditions as their most important problem.  In contrast, 

25 percent or more of small business owners considered weak demand the most 

important concern during much of the past three-year period (figure 1).  In considering 

responses to this question, however, it is important to remember that the survey allows 

owners to identify only their most important problem, not a set of problems.  It is possible 

that financing was the second-most-important problem, but we would not know it from 

this set of data. 

Even if tight credit is not the most important concern, perceptions of tight credit 

still might significantly influence the decisions made by current and prospective small 

business owners.  Among the small business borrowers surveyed by the NFIB, a fairly 

high net percentage--about 8 percent in March--continues to report that credit is more 

difficult to obtain than it was three months ago (figure 2).  This level of self-reported 

perceptions of tighter credit for small businesses is about the same as was observed in 

2007--a period prior to the recent business cycle peak.  It is also well below the 

16 percent of small business respondents, on net, who perceived that credit had become 

more difficult to obtain in 2009.  

Looking back to 2009, a Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation longitudinal study 

of small businesses that were founded in 2004 and tracked since then found that 

89 percent of the surviving firms that were denied loans in that year felt that banks’ 


- 7 - 
 

 
 

heightened requirements played a role in their denials.6  Among the small businesses that 

were tracked, 21 percent had chosen not to apply for loans for fear of being denied credit, 

and 5 percent also refrained from seeking external equity financing for fear of being 

denied such financing.  So it seems that perceptions of credit tightness may lead some 

small business owners to decide not even to try to obtain additional funding.  

At this time, however, the net percentage of survey respondents telling the NFIB 

that they expect credit conditions to become tighter over the next three months has come 

down considerably from what small business owners reported during 2009.  This 

decrease suggests that, compared with the previous few years, far fewer small business 

owners are expecting that credit conditions will remain tight. 

Overall, what seems to matter most with regard to funding, from the small 

business owner’s viewpoint, is one’s personal savings or assets, the internally generated 

funds derived from operating the business, expected sales, and the fact that credit 

conditions seem to be less tight, so money is available, if and when it is needed. 

Business Conditions for Small Businesses  

 Currently, expectations about future sales seem to be more important than 

expectations about the availability of credit in driving business spending decisions and 

demand for business loans.  Recently, small business owners appear to have become 

more optimistic about their outlook for sales.  For example, in recent NFIB surveys, the 

net percentage of respondents who expected their sales to increase rose to levels not seen 

since mid-2007 (figure 3).

More generally, small business owners surveyed by the NFIB indicate that they 

currently expect business conditions to improve in the near future.  In fact, the net 

percentage of small business respondents who expected business conditions to improve 

six months from now climbed in February to its highest level in several years (figure 4).  

Even with some backtracking in March, this barometer of business conditions remains at 

a level not seen since mid-2007.   

Other survey data collected by the NFIB are also consistent with more-favorable 

conditions for small businesses.  The percentages of small business respondents who 

believe it is a good time to expand, and who plan to make capital expenditures over the 

next three to six months, have recently risen to levels not seen since mid-2007. 

The Bankers’ Perspective on Lending to Small Businesses 

Mirroring small business respondents views with respect to credit conditions are 

bankers’ views on credit standards and their terms of credit.  To consider the bankers’ 

perspective, I will draw on two other Federal Reserve surveys:  the Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) and the Survey of Terms of 

Business Lending (STBL).  With regard to credit standards, we found that about 

5 percent of banks, on net, reported in January that they had eased their bank’s lending 

standards on commercial and industrial loans to small firms in the fourth quarter of last 

year (figure 5).7  A similar net fraction of banks reported having eased standards in the 

previous survey.  This finding is consistent with small business owners’ perceptions that 

credit conditions have eased somewhat.

Bureau of Economic Research.

For those small business owners whose loans or credit lines were approved, the 

terms of credit--the interest rate spread over the bank’s cost of funds, the cost of a credit 

line, the maturity, and the size of a loan--are practical measures that can be used to assess 

credit availability.  The January SLOOS indicates that about one-third of banks, on net, 

reported that they had trimmed the spreads of C&I loan rates over their costs of funds on 

loans to small firms (figure 6).  Somewhat smaller net fractions of these loan officers 

reported that they had lowered the costs of credit lines and lengthened the maximum 

maturities of loans to small firms.  Despite the fact that such terms of credit were eased 

for small firms, the banks reported that the maximum sizes of C&I loans, and limits on 

credit lines and business credit card accounts, remained unchanged over the past two 

surveys.  This result means that such lines were not being cut as they were during the first 

half of 2010.  Easing of credit conditions usually does not occur until banks see 

improvement in the credit metrics of existing portfolios.  In the January SLOOS, 77 

percent of bankers reported having seen an improvement in the quality of existing loans 

to small firms. 

The SLOOS does not distinguish between commercial real estate loans to small 

firms and such loans to others, but we know that real-estate-secured lending is an 

important source of credit for small businesses.  The respondents to the January SLOOS 

indicated that there was little movement, on net, in domestic banks’ lending standards for 

commercial real estate loans over the past two surveys (figure 7).  Such standards remain 

relatively tight even though more than one-half of banks expect an improvement in the 

quality of commercial real estate loans.  And, importantly for small business owners, the 

commercial bank Call Reports indicated that as of the end of last year, the loans secured 


- 10 - 
 

 
 

by owner-occupied property had continued to outperform other commercial real estate 

loans. 

 Information contained in the February STBL also indicated a recent easing of 

terms on bank loans.  More specifically, recent loan rate spreads on C&I loans at 

domestic banks were lower, on average, regardless of the bank’s size, and the average 

number of days to maturity had lengthened.   

The recent easing in banks’ lending policies and banks’ improved expectations 

with respect to credit quality are indications that financing conditions for at least some 

small businesses are likely improving. 

By and large, small business owners’ perceptions about the tightness of credit 

conditions seem to be aligned fairly well with bankers’ perceptions of late.  Such 

perceptions are also consistent with recent turndown statistics.  According to the National 

Small Business Association (NSBA), the percentage of small business owners reporting 

an inability to obtain adequate financing declined to 36 percent at year-end from 41 

percent in July 2010.8  These data, of course, apply to members of the NSBA, whereas 

the SCF data I discussed earlier apply in principle to all small business owners, even 

owners of quite small businesses who might be unlikely to join an association.  This may 

explain the much higher credit use among NSBA members. 

Lending to Small Businesses 

So far, I have discussed measures of business credit.  But, as I noted earlier, small 

businesses also rely on personal accounts and loans, household credit cards, trade credit 

from other nonfinancial firms, and other sources, including factoring.  The effect of these

other sources of funding on businesses’ finances is even more difficult to determine from 

available data.   

Changes in personal wealth during the downturn were not uniform across 

households, and there were some big winners and losers.  While the households that 

disproportionately increased their wealth are more likely to start businesses, those that 

disproportionately lost wealth are less likely to do so.  In particular, the recent housing 

downturn has made it more difficult to use cash-out refinancing or home equity lending 

as a funding vehicle for small business formation.  It has also made it more difficult for 

some small business owners to fund the purchase of equipment or to cover business 

operating expenses. 

Even though our survey data suggest that only 3 to 5 percent of small business 

owners tend to rely on personal or business credit cards, the decline in bank credit card 

outstandings over most of the past two years indicates that this source of credit may still 

be quite limited.   

While balance sheet data for financial institutions are readily available, the 

relative contributions to changes in outstanding balances of new lending, paydowns, and 

write-downs and the levels of line usage are not available.  To focus on the link between 

lending and new business activity, we need measures of loan originations.  Indeed, a loan 

or lease origination is what typically generates an investment in equipment and signals 

business growth.9   

                                                            
9 Thomson Reuters provides some statistical tests showing that changes in the prior month’s Small 
Business Lending Index values can predict the current month’s change in the U.S. Leading Economic 
Indicators Index.  See Andrew Clark and Thomas Ware (2010), “Looking into the Future with the Thomson 
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index (SBLI),” white paper (Thomson Reuters, May).

To explore recent loan and lease originations to small businesses, we can look at 

the PayNet/Thomson Reuters Small Business Lending Index (SBLI).  For inclusion in 

this index, a loan or lease must be originated to a business borrower who has total loan 

outstandings across all qualifying lenders of less than $1 million at both the start and the 

end of the month in question.  While some such loans and leases may be to established 

firms that employ more than 500 workers, small businesses are generally viewed as much 

more likely to borrow in these relatively small loan denominations.  The lenders that 

provide the data used to construct the index are banks and finance companies. 

The year-over-year changes in the SBLI are consistent with a view that loan 

originations are a pro-cyclical indicator (figure 8).  Strikingly, such year-over-year 

changes were mainly positive, but smaller through time, until the recent business cycle 

peak in December 2007.  During the recession, however, the year-over-year changes in 

the SBLI were increasingly negative until the business cycle trough, which occurred in 

June 2009.  Then, shortly after the recent business cycle trough, the year-over-year 

negative changes in the index became smaller until they turned positive in early 2010.  In 

February, the most recent month for which data are available, the SBLI measure of 

business loan and lease originations rose 15 percent from a year earlier.  

The seasonally adjusted index, which is normalized to 100 in January 2005, 

provides a different take on small business originations (figure 9).  This measure of 

lending, which allows comparisons across different months, has not yet rebounded to its 

level in mid-2007 even though many of the measures of small business owners’ and 

bankers’ perspectives have returned to their pre-recession levels.  Despite the magnitude 

of the rebound, there has been an apparent turnaround in loan and lease originations using 


- 13 - 
 

 
 

the seasonally adjusted SBLI measure.  These data add to the evidence that credit 

availability to small businesses is gradually improving.  

While at first glance stronger demand for bank loans by large and medium-sized 

firms may seem irrelevant for analyzing credit to small businesses, that perception would 

ignore the fact that such demand may signal that larger firms are becoming more willing 

to provide trade credit to smaller firms that are their suppliers or customers.  In the most 

recent SLOOS, the net percentage of respondents reporting higher loan demand by large 

and medium-sized firms rose above 20 percent for the first time since 2005 (figure 10).  

That said, banks report that loan demand from smaller firms remains fairly weak.  Only a 

small net percentage of banks reported stronger demand from such firms. 

Conclusion 

To sum up, the financial conditions that would be necessary for small businesses 

to start up and thrive would include positive conditions for personal wealth building and a 

full range of consumer and business credit availability.  In the wake of the financial 

crisis, small business owners and potential small business owners likely experienced a 

substantial reduction in the personal resources necessary to start or sustain a business.  At 

the same time, small business loans became harder to get, and when they were available, 

both price and nonprice credit terms were likely quite restrictive.  Many small business 

owners were so convinced that their requests would be denied that they did not even 

apply for credit.  Despite this restricted credit availability, small business owners, by a 

large margin, still considered their most significant problem to be weak sales.  Although 

no definitive data source exists, the combination of a variety of recent survey results

paints a picture of increasing optimism about future sales and business conditions and a 

corresponding easing of credit availability for small businesses.
