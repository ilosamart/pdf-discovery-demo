that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits 

and hires during the recession and in the recovery.   

One convenient way to summarize the information contained in a large number of 

indicators is through the use of so-called factor models.  Following this methodology, 

Federal Reserve Board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor 

market indicators, including four I just discussed.14  This broadly based metric supports 

the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it 

also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat 

overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions.   

Finally, changes in labor compensation may also help shed light on the degree of 

labor market slack, although here, too, there are significant challenges in distinguishing 

between cyclical and structural influences.  Over the past several years, wage inflation, as 

measured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent, and there has been 

little evidence of any broad-based acceleration in either wages or compensation.  Indeed, 

in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity.  This 

pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more 

quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation.  And, since wage 

movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent 

                                                 
14 Among the indicators in the “labor market conditions index” are the labor force participation rate, 

workers classified as part time for economic reasons, hires, and quits.  The index does not include the 

JOLTS job openings series but instead uses the Board staff’s composite help-wanted index, which has a 

longer history; the two measures generally track each other closely.  See Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick,
