In any community, access to credit is essential for economic growth.  In any community, 

but especially in rural communities, small businesses are key drivers of growth.  Small 

businesses heavily rely on banks for funding, and community banks, those with less than $10 

billion in assets, account for a disproportionate share of bank lending to small businesses. 

But across the country, the number of community banks has fallen by half over the past 

20 years, mostly due to consolidation.  This fall has been slightly larger in the West than the 

East, but the reason I highlight this trend is that I believe it has significant consequences for rural 

communities in the West.  The reason returns me to that map I showed earlier.  The West is vast, 

and many rural communities in the West must deal with the challenges of isolation from larger 

towns and cities that few communities in the East face.  Rural westerners have access to far 

fewer banks overall than rural easterners, but that understates the disparity when some western 

counties are the size of Maryland or Massachusetts and many are more than a hundred miles 

across, so that access to a limited number of banks can be difficult or out of reach. 

To provide some perspective on this challenge, let me share what westerners in one small 

town have to say about their access to banking services.  This account is culled from a series of 

public meetings that the Federal Reserve is convening in communities all around the country, in 

support of our responsibilities overseeing community banks and promoting community 

development. 

Not quite a month ago, we held one such session in my home state of Utah, in the town of 

Green River, population 940, located on the eastern side of the state.  It is just off an isolated 

stretch of interstate, and its economy depends on those passersby and tourism related to outdoor 

recreation.  In 2014, Green River lost its only bank, and around that time, banks closed in several 

nearby communities.  As a result, most residents of Green River who need banking services must
