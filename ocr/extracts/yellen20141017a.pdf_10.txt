and inequality, summarizing opportunity is harder, which is why I intend to focus on 

some important sources of opportunity--the four building blocks I mentioned earlier.   

Two of those are so significant that you might call them “cornerstones” of 

opportunity, and you will not be surprised to hear that both are largely related to 

education.  The first of these cornerstones I would describe more fully as “resources 

available to children in their most formative years.”  The second is higher education that 

students and their families can afford. 

Two additional sources of opportunity are evident in the SCF.  They affect fewer 

families than the two cornerstones I have just identified, but enough families and to a 

sufficient extent that I believe they are also important sources of economic opportunity. 

The third building block of opportunity, as shown by the SCF, is ownership of a 

private business.18  This usually means ownership and sometimes direct management of a 

family business.  The fourth source of opportunity is inherited wealth.  As one would 

expect, inheritances are concentrated among the wealthiest families, but the SCF 

indicates they may also play an important role in the opportunities available to others. 

Resources Available for Children  

For households with children, family resources can pay for things that research 

shows enhance future earnings and other economic outcomes--homes in safer 

neighborhoods with good schools, for example, better nutrition and health care, early 

childhood education, intervention for learning disabilities, travel and other potentially 

                                                 
18 Business assets in the SCF include both actively and “non-actively” managed businesses but do not 

include ownership of publicly traded stock.
