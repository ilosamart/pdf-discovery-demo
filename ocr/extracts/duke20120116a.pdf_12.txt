The seven members of the Board of Governors serve 14-year terms, with one term 

ending in January of each even-numbered year.  The terms run independently of the 

person serving in them, and members are often appointed, as I was, to fill the unexpired 

portion of a term.  As has been the case for most of my time on the Board, there are 

currently two vacancies.  A third vacancy would be created when my term ends this 

month.  However, the law permits me to serve until someone is appointed and confirmed 

for my seat.  I think it is important to have a full Board, in part because of the volume of 

work, but also because it is helpful to have a diversity of backgrounds and expertise to 

address the breadth and complexity of the issues that require Board action.  For example, 

with the Fed at the center of the banking system, it is useful to have someone with 

banking knowledge.  Currently, my community banking background provides practical 

insight, as the Federal Reserve is highly focused on strengthening the financial system 

without strangling the ability of smaller banks to serve small businesses and local 

communities.   

So I am planning to stay on for a while.  But as strongly as I believe in the 

importance of a full Board, I am hesitant to make an open-ended commitment to stay for 

as long as it takes to fill the current vacancies or until someone is nominated and 

confirmed for my seat.  That said, I am still fully engaged every day with important
