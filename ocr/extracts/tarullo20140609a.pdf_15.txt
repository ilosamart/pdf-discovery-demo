the practical ability to provide effective oversight of risk decisions.14  I might note in passing that 

regular discussion between board members and supervisors can also serve the interests of 

shareholders, since supervisors may have an informed perspective on the firm’s operations that 

enables boards better to fulfill their strategic and risk-oversight functions. 

 Supervisors should also expect a well-conceived process for board review of major firm 

decisions, which will nearly always carry some implications for risk management and risk 

appetite.  In practical terms, such a process would connect decisions on strategy, risk-appetite 

setting, and capital planning.  Neither we nor shareholders should be comfortable with a process 

in which strategic decisions are made in one silo, risk-appetite setting in another, and capital 

planning in yet a third, with the convergence of these efforts coming together only when it is too 

late for each to affect the other, or for the board to be able to exercise effective oversight.  These 

major decisions need to be made in an integrated manner. 

 While regulators should have clear expectations for boards, we need to make sure that we 

are creating expectations that lead to boards spending more time overseeing the risk-management 

and control functions I have emphasized this afternoon.  There are many important regulatory 

requirements applicable to large financial firms.  Boards must of course be aware of those 

requirements and must help ensure that good corporate compliance systems are in place.  But it 

has perhaps become a little too reflexive a reaction on the part of regulators to jump from the 

observation that a regulation is important to the conclusion that the board must certify 

compliance through its own processes.  We should probably be somewhat more selective in 

                                                 
14 There have also been proposals that boards of large financial firms have a small staff, independent of 
management, who can help the board sift through the often voluminous materials delivered by management to foster 
informed inquiries of management and decisions on risk appetite.  For example, a proposal for a “dedicated 
secretariat” was offered by a parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom.  See U.K. House of Commons 
Treasury Committee (2009), Banking Crisis: Reforming Corporate Governance and Pay in the City, (London:
