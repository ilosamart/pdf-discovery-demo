conducted with large groups of women, the emotion most often cited as accompanying a 

financial decision is uncertainty or worry about being unwise with money or possibly investing 

in something too risky.  This is born out in study after study:  women are more risk averse than 

men.7 Given that women have higher probabilities of outliving their partners, facing eldercare 

duties, and saving for their own retirement rather than being part of an employer-sponsored plan, 

it isn’t hard to understand this aversion to risk.   

One upside of being risk averse is that women incur fewer transaction fees and costs 

because they tend to invest more conservatively than men and hold onto stocks longer.8 So, 

while women are demonstrably more cautious than men and are often experiencing 

transformational life events and investment decisions simultaneously, I would not conclude that 

they are more emotional than men regarding money.  

Myth 3:  Women are impulsive shoppers and equally impulsive with financial decisions.   

Underlying this myth is the notion that anyone who purchases something on impulse does 

not have the self control to save in an organized, regular way.  Evidence does not necessarily 

support the vision of women as impulsive shoppers.  And impulse purchases, especially small 

ones made within the parameters of an overall budget, do not necessarily indicate a lack of 

discipline about financial matters.   

For example, Internet shopping data indicate that 51 percent of online shoppers are 

mothers, and 92 percent of women shopping online share information about bargains with 

friends and family.9  This picture of women searching out information online, thoughtfully 

comparing bargains, and then sharing the information with their circle of friends does not 

support the image of impulsive shoppers.
