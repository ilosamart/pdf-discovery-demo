I would like to thank the National Association for Business Economics for 

inviting me to speak today and for the vital role the association plays in fostering debate 

on important economic policy questions.   

Today I will discuss uncertainty and monetary policy, particularly as it relates to 

recent inflation developments.  Because changes in interest rates influence economic 

activity and inflation with a substantial lag, the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) sets monetary policy with an eye to its effects on the outlook for the economy.  

But the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty from multiple sources, and dealing 

with these uncertainties is an important feature of policymaking.  Key among current 

uncertainties are the forces driving inflation, which has remained low in recent years 

despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions.  As I will discuss, this low 

inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time.  But as I will also 

discuss, many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation 

could prove to be unexpectedly persistent.  My colleagues and I may have misjudged the 

strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are 

consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation.  

In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light 

of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the 

stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price 

stability.   

Recent Inflation Developments and the Outlook 

Let me begin by reviewing recent inflation developments and the economic 

outlook.  As the solid blue line in figure 1 indicates, inflation as measured by the price
