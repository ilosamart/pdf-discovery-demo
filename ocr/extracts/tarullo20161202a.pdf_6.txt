widely held view that underlay the public debate, it was that the system needed to change to 

avoid a repeat of the taxpayer bailouts of so many large financial institutions.     

It was only toward the end of the legislative exercise that resulted in the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) that the process took a more 

partisan turn.  Indeed, the Dodd-Frank Act contains measures that commanded fairly wide 

consensus, such as the need for higher capital requirements for the largest banks.  Furthermore, 

the origins of some features of the legislation rested as much or more with Republican than 

Democratic legislators, such as the section 165 requirement for resolution plans that will make 

systemically important firms resolvable in bankruptcy without requiring taxpayer support or 

resulting in major disorder in the financial system. 

The Nature and Impact of the New Regulatory Regime 

 Now let us fast forward to the present.  Less than a decade after being the epicenter of a 

global financial crisis, today the United States has the strongest and most diverse financial 

system of any major economy in the world.  Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and other market 

indicators suggest that investors have remained confident in the solvency of large U.S. banks 

through several recent episodes of global financial volatility.7  For example, during the market 

strains at the beginning of this year, the CDS spreads of U.S. banks increased only 25 to 50 basis 

points, and even so only briefly, while large banks in some other parts of the world saw their 

CDS spreads increase substantially more and for a longer period.  The relative strength of, and 

                                                           
7 Some have suggested that market-based measures of bank risk indicate that banks are not safer than before the 
crisis.  For example, CDS spreads are well above their levels in early 2006.  But this as likely suggests that investors 
were too sanguine in 2006 as that they believe there has been no change in bank safety since then.  And, as reflected 
in the changes made by credit ratings agencies in their assessment of implied support for banks from the 
government, markets may rightly perceive that the government is less likely now to bail out a bank that gets in 
trouble.  Moreover, equity prices may be down because some combination of economic conditions and regulation 
make profits likely to be lower than was expected and experienced in the unsustainable period leading up to the 
crisis.
