the financial crisis, when U.S. branches of foreign banks began borrowing large volumes 

of dollars to send to their foreign parents.  Such activity increases the vulnerabilities I 

described earlier.  And it may not only pose the risk of a cutback in lending, but could 

also threaten the safety and soundness of the foreign banks themselves--and of the U.S. 

entities exposed to those banks.  

The regulation of U.S. branches of foreign banks has changed little over the past 

decade, even in the face of these significant changes in the global banking landscape.  

However, last week, the Federal Reserve Board proposed new rules for foreign banking 

organizations that would address some of the concerns that Iâ€™ve discussed and thereby 

mitigate the attendant risks to U.S. financial stability.  These proposed rules apply 

enhanced prudential standards to foreign banking organizations and are designed to 

increase their resiliency.  Importantly, the rules will not disadvantage foreign banks 

relative to domestic U.S. banking firms, but rather the rules seek to maintain a level 

playing field.  To avoid or mitigate potential disruptions in wholesale dollar funding 

markets, the proposed rules require foreign banking organizations to hold sufficient high-

quality liquid assets to meet expected near-term net outflows in a stress scenario.  These 

rules should reduce the pressure on foreign banks that rely heavily on short-term dollar 

funding to either sell illiquid dollar assets or cut back on dollar lending in times of 

financial stress.  By helping to alleviate disruptions in dollar funding markets the rules 

should also reduce the reliance on swap lines in a future stress episode. 

Finally, the central role played by money market funds in the 2011 episode is a 

reminder of the fragility of these funds themselves--and of the risk created by their 

combination of risky asset holdings, stable-value demandable liabilities, and zero-capital
