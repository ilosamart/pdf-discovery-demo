Great Financial Crisis.  The first is its failure to resolve the problem of stigma--that is, the 

stigma of borrowing from the central bank at a time when the financial markets are on 

guard, looking for signs of weakness in individual financial institutions at a time of 

overall financial stress.10  Indeed, some of the Dodd-Frank Act reporting requirements 

may worsen the stigma problem.11   

The second is a concern that arises from the nature of financial and other crises.  

It is essential that we build strong frameworks to deal with potential crisis situations, and 

Dodd-Frank has done that.  But these plans need to ensure that the authorities retain the 

capacity to deal with unanticipated events, for unanticipated events are inevitable.  

Retaining the needed flexibility may conflict with the desire to reduce moral hazard to a 

minimum.  But, in simple language:  Strengthening fire prevention regulations does not 

imply that the fire brigade should be disbanded.12  

Third, this concern is heightened by a related problem:  The new system has not 

undergone its own stress test.  That is, in one sense, fortunate, for the financial system 

will undergo its fundamental stress test only when we have to deal with the next potential 

financial crisis.  That day will likely come later than it would have without Dodd-Frank 

and the excellent work done by regulators in the United States and around the world in 

strengthening financial institutions and the financial system.  But it will come, and when 

it comes, we will need the flexibility required to deal with it. 

                                                 
10 This concern is emphasized in Ben Bernanke’s blog post, “Fed Emergency Lending,” Brookings 
Institution, December 3, 2015, www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/12/03-fed-emergency-
lending. 
11 In particular, as I suggested earlier, the additional reporting requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act 
could increase potential borrowers’ concerns that the public, their creditors, or their counterparties could 
learn about their borrowing and conclude that the bank is in trouble.   
12 I think it would be a serious mistake, as some have suggested, to go beyond the limitations on the Federal 
Reserve’s emergency lending authority that are set out in the Dodd-Frank Act.
