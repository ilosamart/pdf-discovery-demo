reasonable to plan for a period of primary budget surpluses, which would serve 

eventually to bring the ratio of debt to national income back toward pre-recession levels.  

Fiscal sustainability is a long-run concept.  Achieving fiscal sustainability, 

therefore, requires a long-run plan, one that reduces deficits over an extended period and 

that, to the fullest extent possible, is credible, practical, and enforceable.  In current 

circumstances, an advantage of taking a longer-term perspective in forming concrete 

plans for fiscal consolidation is that policymakers can avoid a sudden fiscal contraction 

that might put the still-fragile recovery at risk.  At the same time, acting now to put in 

place a credible plan for reducing future deficits would not only enhance economic 

performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower 

long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. 

While it is crucial to have a federal budget that is sustainable, our fiscal policies 

should also reflect the nation’s priorities by providing the conditions to support ongoing 

gains in living standards and by striving to be fair both to current and future generations.  

In addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, we should reform the government’s tax 

policies and spending priorities so that they not only reduce the deficit, but also enhance 

the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by increasing incentives to 

work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce, by 

stimulating private capital formation, by promoting research and development, and by 

providing necessary public infrastructure.  We cannot reasonably expect to grow our way 

out of our fiscal imbalances, but a more productive economy will ease the tradeoffs that 

we face.
