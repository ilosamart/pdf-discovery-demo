an extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2  Standard economic thinking has long 

offered an explanation for this:  If unemployment were to remain this low for this long, 

employers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising 

labor costs would feed into more-rapid price inflation faced by consumers.    

This dynamic between unemployment and inflation is known as a Phillips curve 

relationship, and at times it can pose a fundamental tension between the two sides of the 

Fed’s mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  Recent low 

inflation and unemployment have some analysts asking, “Is the Phillips curve dead?”3  

Others argue that the Phillips curve still lurks in the background and could reemerge at 

any time to exact revenge for low unemployment in the form of high inflation.   

My comments today have two main objectives.  The first is to explain how 

changes in the Phillips curve help account for the somewhat surprising but broadly shared 

current forecasts of continued very low unemployment with inflation near 2 percent.  At 

the risk of spoiling the surprise, I do not see it as likely that the Phillips curve is dead, or 

that it will soon exact revenge.  What is more likely, in my view, is that many factors, 

including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly 

reduced, but not eliminated, the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation.   

However, no one fully understands the nature of these changes or the role they play in the 

                                                 
2 For example, there have been four periods with quarterly average unemployment below 4 percent since 
1950.  In an early 1950s episode, inflation ranged from below zero to 8 percent.  Toward the end of the 
1950s, unemployment was near 4 percent for a time, dipping to 3.9 percent for one quarter.  During this 
low unemployment period, inflation rose steadily from under 1 percent to over 3 percent.  The remaining 
two episodes with unemployment under 4 percent--one each in the 1960s and 1990s--are discussed later in 
the speech.

many similar titles.  The research on the topic is reviewed more fully later in the speech.
