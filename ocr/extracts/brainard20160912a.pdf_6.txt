3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong 

Third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on 

the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks 

here at home.8  In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very 

low.  Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a 

higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of 

the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro area’s bank-centric 

financial system.  A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal 

sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product 

(GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks.  Against this backdrop, uncertainty 

about Britain’s future relationship with the European Union could damp business 

sentiment and investment in Europe. 

Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation.  Indeed, it is 

striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, 

inflation remains below target levels.  The experiences of these economies highlight the 

risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations 

environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the 

U.S. economy slipping into such a situation.   

                                                 
8 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly marked down its forecast of world economic 

growth in recent years.  From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015 

growth from 3.9 percent to 3.1 percent.  And from April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down 

2016 growth from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent.  See the IMF’s World Economic Outlook at
