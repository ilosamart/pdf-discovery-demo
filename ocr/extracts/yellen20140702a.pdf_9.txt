best balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential tools in promoting financial 

stability. 

For example, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have expressed a 

willingness to use monetary policy to address financial stability concerns in unusual 

circumstances, but they have similarly concluded that macroprudential policies should 

serve as the primary tool to pursue financial stability.  In Canada, with inflation below 

target and output growth quite subdued, the Bank of Canada has kept the policy rate at or 

below 1 percent, but limits on mortgage lending were tightened in each of the years from 

2009 through 2012, including changes in loan-to-value and debt-to-income caps, among 

other measures.7  In contrast, in Norway and Sweden, monetary policy decisions have 

been influenced somewhat by financial stability concerns, but the steps taken have been 

limited.  In Norway, policymakers increased the policy interest rate in mid-2010 when 

they were facing escalating household debt despite inflation below target and output 

below capacity, in part as a way of “guarding against the risk of future imbalances.”8  

Similarly, Sweden’s Riksbank held its policy rate “slightly higher than we would have 

done otherwise” because of financial stability concerns.9  In both cases, macroprudential 

actions were also either taken or under consideration.
