Federal Reserve, which makes capital requirements more forward-looking by estimating the 

impact of an adverse economic scenario on a firm’s capital.   

As has long been recognized, no single capital requirement can capture all credit and 

market risks, much less other risks to which a banking organization may be exposed.  But, when 

implemented fully, the various capital measures should complement one another and, together, 

provide considerable reassurance to investors, counterparties, regulators, and the public that our 

banks are well-capitalized.  The banking agencies have been working simultaneously on all the 

implementing regulations so that we can take into account the interrelationships among the 

various rules and, as we publish proposed and final regulations in the coming months, banks will 

have a complete picture of the capital requirements to which they will be subject.  

 A third reform, also related to capital, is directed specifically at the unusual systemic 

importance of certain institutions.  The Basel Committee has released a framework for 

calibrating capital surcharges for banks of global systemic importance, an initiative consistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s obligation under section 165 of Dodd-Frank to impose more stringent 

capital standards on systemically important firms.  It is important to note that this requirement 

has a motivation different from that of traditional capital standards: The failure of a systemically 

important firm would have substantially greater negative consequences for the entire financial 

system than the failure of other, even quite large, firms.  The surcharges, to be phased in 

beginning in 2016, will be graduated based on criteria weighted toward size and 

interconnectedness with the financial system as a whole.  Thus, the more systemically important 

the institution, the greater the capital surcharge.  

 A fourth reform, intended to ensure that no firm is too big to fail, was the creation by 

Dodd-Frank of orderly liquidation authority.  Under this authority, the FDIC can impose losses
