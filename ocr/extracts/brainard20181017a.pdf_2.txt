Thank you for inviting me to join today’s discussion.  Like many of you, I have 

long been interested in the potential for innovation to improve financial access for 

families and small businesses who are underserved.  The combination of smartphone 

apps, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud technology holds out intriguing 

possibilities in financial services.  But no single app is likely to be a silver bullet for the 

complex challenges faced by underserved households and small businesses.  Achieving 

inclusion will require a holistic understanding of the challenges faced by underserved 

groups in order to develop full stack solutions to address them.1    

Fortunately, an emerging generation of metrics may offer a more complete picture 

of consumers’ financial needs.  In addition, technological infrastructure is developing, 

such as faster payment systems, along with the potential for more transparent and simpler 

product offerings enabled by richer data and lower-cost processing.  These new building 

blocks may make a difference on their own--and, more importantly, may be combined in 

powerful ways to bring end-to-end solutions to financial inclusion.  I will briefly discuss 

each of these developments in turn. 

Lessons from the First Wave 

Let’s start with the basic question of how to measure financial inclusion in order 

to evaluate the impact of financial innovations and inclusion policies.  The World Bank’s 

Global Findex Database starts with a seemingly reasonable proxy for financial inclusion: 

access to financial accounts.  Having access to basic transaction and savings accounts has
