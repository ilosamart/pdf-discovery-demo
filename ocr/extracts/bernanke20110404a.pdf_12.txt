to set enhanced and consistent risk-management standards for systemically important 

financial market utilities, taking into consideration relevant international standards and

attention by clearinghouses to establishment of private-sector liquidity arrangements in 

advance of a crisis).  To minimize moral hazard concerns, the Federal Reserve believes it 

essential that the regulatory regime for these institutions include strong prudential 

requirements for credit and liquidity risk management, robust liquidity buffers, the 

maintenance of adequate amounts of high-quality collateral, and effective member-

published for comment proposed risk-management standards that would apply to
