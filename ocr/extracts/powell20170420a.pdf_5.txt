A few themes can guide us in this next phase.  First, after years of raising capital and 

liquidity standards, and of stress tests and living wills, our financial system is much stronger 

now.  We should protect these core reforms and avoid a return to the highly vulnerable system 

that existed before the crisis.  Second, in too many cases new regulation has been inappropriately 

applied to small and medium-sized institutions.  We need to go back and broadly raise thresholds 

of applicability and look for other ways to reduce burden on smaller firms.  Third, the new rule 

book is excessively complex.  We need to look for ways to simplify the rules so that they support 

our goals but also improve the efficiency of regulation.  For example, we need to allow boards of 

directors and management to spend a smaller portion of their time on technical compliance 

exercises and more time focusing on the activities that support sustainable economic growth.  

Fourth, we need to continue to strive to provide an appropriate level of transparency to 

supervised firms and the public regarding our expectations.       

Some aspects of the new regulatory program are proving unnecessarily burdensome and 

should be better tailored to meet our objectives.  Some provisions may not be needed at all given 

the broad scope of what we have put in place.  I support adjustments designed to enhance the 

efficiency and effectiveness of regulation without sacrificing safety and soundness or 

undermining macroprudential goals.   

One example where some adjustments are warranted is our supervisory relationship with 

the boards of directors of banking firms.  After the crisis, there was a broad increase in 

supervisory expectations for these boards.   But it is important to acknowledge that the boardâ€™s 

role is one of oversight, not management.  We need to ensure that directors are not distracted 

from conducting their key functions by an overly detailed checklist of supervisory process 

requirements.  Rather, boards of directors need to be able to focus on setting the overall strategic
