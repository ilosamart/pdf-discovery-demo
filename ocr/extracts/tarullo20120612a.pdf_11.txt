willingness of large financial institutions to follow through on their implicit commitments.  

Investors were reminded of their potential exposure, leading to wholesale and sometimes 

disorderly flight.  The unwinding of this risk illusion helped transform a dramatic correction in 

real estate valuations—which itself would have had serious consequences for the economy—into 

a crisis that threatened the entire financial system. 

Shaping a Regulatory Response 

  Ideally, a regulatory response to the shadow banking system would be grounded in a full 

understanding of the dynamics that drove its rapid growth, the social utility of its intermediation 

activities, and the risks they create.  Such a response would be comprehensive, meaning that it 

would cover in an effective and efficient manner any activities that create these vulnerabilities, 

without regard to how the activities were denominated, what transaction forms were used, or 

where they were conducted.  Of course, many of the key issues are still being debated, and even 

those who agree on the desirability of a comprehensive response may differ on its basic form.   

We should continue to seek the analytic and policy consensus that must precede the 

creation of a regulatory program that meets these conditions.  More work is needed on 

fundamental issues such as the implications of private money creation and of intermediaries 

behaving like banks but without bank-like regulation.  These implications are potentially quite 

profound for central banking and banking regulation, considering that the shadow banking 

system has caused the volume of money-like instruments created outside the purview of central 

bank and regulatory control to grow markedly.   

But regulators need not wait for the full resolution of contested issues or the development 

of comprehensive alternatives, nor would it be prudent for them to do so.  We should act now to 

address some obvious sources of vulnerability in the financial system.  I believe that the
