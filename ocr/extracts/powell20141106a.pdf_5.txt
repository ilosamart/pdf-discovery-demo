both known and more comprehensible, illustrated in the chart on the right.  The CCP and 

its regulators are then in a position to observe the CCPâ€™s entire network, which can be 

important in the event that one or more clearing members become impaired.  CCPs may 

also be able to coordinate a response to problems in their markets in ways that individual 

clearing members would find very difficult.   

Figure 2 shows that, at the same time, in the real world CCPs bring with them 

their own complexities.  As the figure shows, we do not live in a simple world with only 

one CCP.  We do not even live in a world with one CCP per product class, since some 

products are cleared by multiple, large CCPs.5  Also, significant clearing members are 

often members of multiple CCPs in different jurisdictions.  The disruption of a single 

member can have far-reaching effects.  Accordingly, while CCPs simplify some aspects 

of the financial system, in reality, the overall system supporting the OTC derivatives 

markets remains quite complex. 

To carry out their critical functions, CCPs rely on a wide variety of financial 

services from other financial firms, such as custody, clearing, and settlement.  Many of 

these services are provided by the same global financial institutions that are also the 

largest clearing members of the CCPs.  The failure of a large clearing member that is also 

a key service provider could disrupt the smooth and efficient operation of one or multiple 

CCPs, and vice versa.  In the event of disorderly CCP failures, the netting benefits and 

other efficiencies that CCPs offer would be lost at a point when the financial system is 

already under significant stress.  Ultimately, the system as a whole is only as strong as its 

weakest link.         

                                                 
5 As an example, both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange clear credit 

default swaps.
