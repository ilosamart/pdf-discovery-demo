run” is consistent with this view.  Some estimates put the current value of r* close to 

zero, which leads to the purple dashed-dotted line in figure 8.25 

Figure 9 provides prescriptions from the policy rules shown in figure 7 that vary 

along dimensions other than the neutral real rate.  The first-difference rule shown by the 

purple dashed-dotted line incorporates forecasts by prescribing changes to the federal 

funds rate based on projected inflation relative to its objective and the projected change in 

the output gap.26  The insight behind this rule is that it does not require estimates of the 

neutral real rate or the level of the output gap.27  The green dashed line shows the policy 

prescription from an inertial version of the “balanced approach” rule with an intercept of 

1 percent, which includes a lagged value of the nominal interest rate.28  This rule does 

not go as far as the first-difference rule in eliminating the level of r* from the policy 

prescription, but it does prescribe that policy move only slowly toward its longer-run 

level, which places less weight in the short-run on the estimate of r*.  This rule

26 Orphanides (2003) proposed a rule that sets changes in the nominal interest rate equal to deviations in 
nominal income growth relative to target, ΔR = β [ (π + Δy)  ̶  (π* + Δy*) ], where y is real GDP.  The 
forecast-based version employed here substitutes the change in the unemployment gap for the change in the 
output gap (using an Okun’s law coefficient of 2) and sets β to 0.5, yielding ΔR = 0.5 (π    ̶ π*)  ̶  Δu.  When 
implemented using forecasts, inflation is the 4-quarter inflation rate 3 quarters ahead, and Δu is the 4-
quarter change in the unemployment rate 3 quarters ahead.  See Athanasios Orphanides (2003), “Historical 
Monetary Policy Analysis and the Taylor Rule,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 50 (July), pp. 983-
1022. 
27 While the natural rate of interest may be changing over time and the first-difference rule does not take 
these changes into account, Orphanides and Williams (2007) argue that rules like the first-difference rule 
can deliver good economic performance even when there is uncertainty about those changes.  See 
Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (2007), “Robust Monetary Policy with Imperfect 
Knowledge,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 54 (July), pp. 1406-35. 
28 Chair Yellen has called this rule the “balanced-approach” rule.  See Janet L. Yellen (2012), “Perspectives 
on Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Boston Economic Club Dinner, Boston, June 6, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120606a.htm.  This rule has also been 
considered by others.  For example, see John B. Taylor (1999), “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy 
Rules,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), p. 319-341.
