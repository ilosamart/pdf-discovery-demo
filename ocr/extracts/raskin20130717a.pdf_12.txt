The final class of policies that I’ll discuss involves underwriting restrictions that can 

directly address asset bubbles and their consequences.  

When assets like houses are largely financed with borrowed money, it is possible 

to use tighter underwriting requirements to lean against credit extension and growing 

leverage.  This could be done, for example, through regulatory actions that raise lenders’ 

minimum down payment requirements or reduce borrowers’ maximum permissible debt-

to-income ratios.  Such measures can be taken either on a one-time basis or as part of an 

explicitly countercyclical regime that “switches on” during a building asset bubble. 

  In particular, regulators might impose minimum down payment requirements for 

property loans or their functional equivalent--maximum loan-to-value ratios.  Such 

policies could both build resilience in the financial system and lean against developing 

credit excesses.  They would build resilience in two ways.  First, other things the same, 

higher minimum down payment requirements reduce the probability of default on loans. 

And second, higher requirements also imply a lower loss given default.  Both effects 

imply greater resilience for the bank or other entity that made the loan or has an interest 

in it. Even a structural one-time upward adjustment in minimum down payment 

requirements--to a prudent level, above industry norms in buoyant times--could have a 

countercyclical effect in building resilience.  Such a requirement could also moderate 

lender adjustments in minimum down payment requirements over the credit cycle: 

Minimum requirements would fall less in boom times, implying lower future loan losses 

than otherwise, and so would increase less in reaction during busts.  In addition, by 

leaning against excessive credit expansion, such a policy could lean against developing 

asset bubbles and growing financial vulnerabilities.
