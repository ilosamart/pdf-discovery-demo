 As one would expect of a piece of legislation that has sixteen titles and runs 849 pages in 

the Statutes at Large, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ranges 

widely in addressing problems both directly and indirectly associated with the financial crisis.  

Taken as a whole, though, the primary aim of those 849 pages can fairly be read as a 

reorientation of financial regulation towards safeguarding “financial stability” through the 

containment of “systemic risk,” phrases that both recur dozens of times throughout the statute.  

The law, explicitly in many provisions and implicitly in many others, directs the bank regulatory 

agencies to broaden their focus beyond the soundness of individual banking institutions, and the 

market regulatory agencies to move beyond their traditional focus on transaction-based investor 

protection.   

 This emphasis on financial stability and systemic risk is hardly surprising in light of the 

damage done by the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession, from which we continue to 

recover only slowly.  Indeed, concern about financial stability and systemic risk has at times 

been a crucial impetus for financial reform in the United States.  Much of the New Deal 

legislation that defined the financial regulatory structure for more than 40 years was in direct 

response to what we would today call systemic concerns, including banking panics and excessive 

leverage in equity markets.  Twenty years before the New Deal, the creation of the Federal 

Reserve had been intended at least as much as a financial stability measure as an instrument of 

monetary policy.   

But seen in the light of more recent history, Dodd-Frank represents something of an 

about-face for financial regulation, which had largely neglected systemic concerns in the decades 

preceding the crisis.  Even the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, while far-reaching in many respects, 

was very much a traditional piece of securities legislation insofar as it focused on investor
