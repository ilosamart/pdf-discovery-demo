would be designed to provide liquidity to a market or sector of the financial system and 

not be for the purpose of assisting a specific firm, or group of firms, in avoiding 

bankruptcy.  “Broad based” is defined to mean that there are at least five potential 

participants; further, even if many more than five firms were eligible for the facility, it 

could not be considered “broad based” if its purpose was to assist failing firms avoid 

bankruptcy or resolution, or to lend to insolvent borrowers.  In addition, the interest rates 

on the loans would be at penalty rates above those on similar forms of credit in normal 

times, and the loans would be backed by collateral that was sufficient to protect the 

taxpayer from losses.  All of these criteria are consistent with how the Federal Reserve 

operated its broad-based facilities in the crisis. 

Lending to Individual Nonbank Institutions 

During the crisis, the Federal Reserve also lent to individual nonbank institutions 

whose default would have been extremely damaging for the financial system and the state 

of the economy.6  The Dodd-Frank Act removed the Federal Reserve’s authority to lend 

to an individual troubled institution.7  Instead, the act required large banks and 

systemically important nonbanks to submit plans under which they could be resolved 

under bankruptcy in a rapid and orderly manner if they suffered material financial 

distress.  In addition, it established expanded authority for the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) to resolve a troubled systemic institution in an orderly manner that 

would not disrupt the rest of the financial system.  This expanded power includes the 

                                                 
6 The Federal Reserve used its authority to lend to individual nonbank institutions two times during the 
crisis:  It lent to Bear Stearns and AIG (American International Group, Inc.).  Working with the Treasury 
and the FDIC, it agreed to lend, but did not in fact extend credit, as part of ring-fence arrangements 
established for two additional firms, Bank of America and Citigroup.  See Domanski, Moessner, and 
Nelson, “Central Banks as Lenders of Last Resort,” in note 5. 
7 The Federal Reserve’s authority to lend to depository institutions cannot be used as a backchannel for 
lending to nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
