Wicksell and Inside Money

“Only by completely divorcing the value of money from … its commodity 

function, by abolishing all free minting, and by making the minted coin 

or banknotes proper, or more generally the unit employed in the 

accounts of the credit institutions, both the medium of exchange and 

the measure of value, only in this way can the contradiction be 

overcome and the imperfection be remedied.  It is only in this way that 

a logically coherent credit system, combining both economy of 

monetary media and stability in the standard of value, becomes in any 

way conceivable.”
