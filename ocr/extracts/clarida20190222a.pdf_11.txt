As part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past 

communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.  For 

example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of 

policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability. 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

The review will have several components.20  The Board and the Reserve Banks 

will be conducting town hall-style “Fed Listens” events this year.  We will hear from a 

broad range of interested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders, 

community development professionals, and academics.  The first of these events will take 

place Monday in Dallas.  Another is scheduled at the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Minneapolis in early April, and other Reserve Banks will host events over the course of 

the year. 

In addition, we will sponsor a System research conference on June 4-5, 2019, at 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  

The sessions will include overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the 

review, including the FOMC’s monetary policy since the financial crisis, assessments of 

the maximum sustainable level of employment, alternative policy frameworks and 

strategies to achieve the dual mandate, policy tools, global considerations, financial 

stability considerations, and central bank communications.  Other sessions will feature 

panels of community leaders who will share their perspectives on the labor market and 

the effects of interest rates on their constituencies.
