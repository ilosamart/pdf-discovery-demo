losses at the firm, thereby counteracting the moral hazard associated with taxpayer 

bailouts while avoiding disorderly failures.  To the degree the orderly resolution 

mechanisms established in the United States and elsewhere thus command greater 

credibility, the result should be enhanced market discipline, which in turn could enhance 

financial stability. 

As with the two other policy ideas, the details of a minimum long-term debt 

proposal matter when it comes to assessing costs and benefits.  There will surely be some 

costs associated with such a requirement (though it is notable that, at present, large U.S. 

firms have substantial amounts of long-term debt on their balance sheets).  Like a capital 

surcharge for the largest, most complex institutions, these costs will fall only on the 

largest institutions.  But this is by design, in accordance with the principle--reflected in 

the Dodd-Frank Act--that the largest, most complex institutions should be subject to 

stricter regulation precisely because they are more complex and because their failure 

would have greater negative externalities for the financial system and the economy more 

generally.  Thus, if there is a modest effect on industry structure, it would be an intended 

--rather than unintended or undesirable--consequence of the regulation.  In general, at 

least at the levels of minimum long-term debt that are being discussed in various 

international forums, the proposal would not seem to carry significant hurdles to realizing 

available economies of scope and scale.   

Conclusion 

My very brief review of these three proposals has tried to show how a combined 

IO-finance perspective can contribute to the policymaking process and what priorities for 

research might be.  For the proposal to reenact Glass-Steagall, that perspective suggested
