achieved instrument independence--something the Federal Reserve had already long 

had.4

Under the new law, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), 

rather than the Treasury, set the policy interest rate.  Inflation targeting, which began in 

the United Kingdom in 1992, continued under the new system and was codified in the 

Bank of England Act of 1998.5 The MPC was given an explicit numerical inflation 

target, corresponding to effective price stability, alongside an implied stabilization goal 

for real economic activity.6 Consequently, the Bank of England from 1997 had the 

combination that Debelle and I advocated:  instrument independence but not goal 

independence.

We also judged that the vagueness of the Federal Reserve’s statutory objectives 

meant that the Federal Reserve “has considerable goal independence.”7 Today both the 

FOMC and the MPC have a numerical inflation goal--2 percent.  However, this 

numerical goal is not specified in legislation in either country.  In the United Kingdom, 

the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets the MPC’s inflation target: currently 2 percent per 

4 U.S. monetary policy independence in the post-World War II era dates at least from the Federal 
Reserve/Treasury Accord of 1951.  See Eichengreen and Garber (1991). I discussed Federal Reserve 
independence in detail in Fischer (2015a).
5 See the text of the act in Bank of England (2015a).  (Since 1998, the U.K. Parliament has made a number 
of amendments to the Bank of England Act 1998--among them a change, in 2016, to the frequency of MPC 
meetings, from monthly to eight times a year.  See Bank of England (2017a).)
6 From the start of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom in 1992, it was made clear that the authorities, 
when faced with a situation in which inflation was different from the target rate, would generally not seek 
to restore inflation to target as quickly as possible.  Rather, they typically would opt for a policy that sought 
to bring inflation back to target gradually, without unnecessary destabilization of real output.  See Leigh-
Pemberton (1992) and Bernanke and others (1999, pp. 156-57).  This approach has continued in the MPC 
era, as discussed later.  It is an approach consistent with the MPC’s remit in the Bank of England Act 1998 
to achieve the inflation target through policies consistent with the economic policy of the U.K. government, 
“including its objectives for growth and employment.”
