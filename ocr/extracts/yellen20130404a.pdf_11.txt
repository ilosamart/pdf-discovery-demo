unconventional policy actions and convincingly connect them to the Federal Reserve’s 

employment and inflation objectives.  

The best known of these unconventional policies is large-scale asset purchases, 

commonly known as quantitative easing.  Starting in late 2008 and continuing through 

today, the Federal Reserve has purchased longer-term government agency debt securities, 

agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury securities that 

have added about $2.5 trillion to its assets. These purchases were intended to, and I 

believe have, succeeded in significantly lowering longer-term interest rates and raising 

asset prices to help further the Federal Reserve’s economic objectives.  This is an easing 

of monetary policy, also known as accommodation, beyond what is provided by 

maintaining the federal funds rate close to zero.   

It is important to emphasize that the effects of asset purchases also depend on 

expectations.  If the FOMC buys, say, $10 billion in longer-term securities today but is 

expected to sell them tomorrow or very shortly, there will be little effect on the economy.  

Current research suggests that the effects of asset purchases today depend on expectations 

of the total value of securities the FOMC intends to buy and on expectations of how long 

the FOMC intends to hold those securities.  To make these asset purchases as effective as 

possible in adding accommodation, the FOMC, therefore, needs to communicate the 

intended path of Federal Reserve securities holdings years into the future.  I will return in 

a moment to current and possible future ways in which the FOMC does and might 

communicate this information. 

The other unconventional policy designed to contribute to monetary easing was 

almost purely communication--enhanced forward guidance about how long the
