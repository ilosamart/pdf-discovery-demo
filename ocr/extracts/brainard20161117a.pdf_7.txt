Finally, the EIWA survey provides valuable insights into the use of recent 

technologies in informal work.  The EIWA survey suggests that over the previous six 

months, roughly 11 percent of adults in the United States have engaged in paid services 

using an online platform, such as arranging transportation activities with companies such 

as Uber, arranging work opportunities on sites like Care.com, Amazon Mechanical Turk, 

or TaskRabbit, generating projects through companies such as Fiverr, selling goods and 

crafts on sites such as eBay and Etsy, and renting rooms or homes through services like 

Airbnb, among others.10  This figure is much larger than the Katz and Krueger finding of 

0.5 percent, partly because the EIWA survey was fielded to all adults regardless of their 

formal employment status, asked about all online paid services, and used a six-month 

look-back period, rather than the past week. 

Who Is Engaging in Contingent Work and Why? 

Together, these recent surveys of informal work paint a varied picture of the 

universe of informal work arrangements, along with participants’ motivations for 

engaging in them.  Nineteen percent of informal workers in the EIWA survey, for 

example, were engaged in three or more online and/or offline informal paid work 

activities in the prior six months, and 25 percent indicated that informal and contingent 

work activities have been “very much” or “somewhat” a regular and consistent source of 

their monthly income.  

Results regarding the ages of workers attracted to nontraditional work vary:  Katz 

and Krueger find that the share of contingent work arrangements increases with age,

States and the European Union participate in online informal work activities.  See Manyika and 

others (2016).
