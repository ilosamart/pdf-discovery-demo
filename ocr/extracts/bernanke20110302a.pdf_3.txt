somewhat better economic conditions, state tax revenues for the first nine months of 2010 

were 3 percent higher than during the comparable period a year earlier--a relatively 

modest improvement in comparison to the earlier decline.  Meanwhile, on the spending 

side of the ledger, demand for publicly financed medical care and other public services 

soared as the economy weakened.  Most notably, Medicaid caseloads rose from less than 

43 million at the start of the recession in December 2007 to more than 50 million in June 

2010--an increase of nearly 18 percent.  The experience of New York state has not 

differed greatly from that of other states:  Tax revenues here decreased about 13 percent 

in 2009 and then rose about 7 percent during the first nine months of 2010.  Meanwhile, 

the state’s Medicaid enrollments increased from about 4 million at the end of 2007 to 

4-3/4 million in mid-2010--about in line with the national trend. 

  In contrast to the sharp drop in state tax revenues, local tax revenues across the 

country have held up relatively well over the past couple of years.  In part, this difference 

reflects localities’ greater reliance on property taxes.  Changes in real estate values 

typically feed through to tax assessments and property tax bills with a considerable lag; 

some jurisdictions have also raised their property tax rates to offset weakness in assessed 

values.  The continued softness in real estate prices, however, does not bode well for 

local government revenues.  Moreover, many localities have been hard hit by reductions 

in state aid, which in 2008 accounted for about 30 percent of local revenues.  Indeed, the 

fiscal 2011 budgets of more than 20 states contained either outright reductions in local 

aid, changes to revenue-sharing agreements, or cuts in funding for specific programs that
