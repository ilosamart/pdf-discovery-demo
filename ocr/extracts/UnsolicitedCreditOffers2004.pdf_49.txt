to sell more products, and, as with any advertising campaign, there is the chance that it 
will be successful. A number of pieces of evidence suggest that prescreened solicitations 
for credit cards or other forms of credit have not caused excessive indebtedness among 
large segments of the public (although there likely are individuals who have been so 
affected by prescreened solicitations). 

One piece of evidence is that a large element of competition in the credit area in recent 
years has consisted of attempts by lenders to take borrowers from other lenders rather 
than to add to debt levels. An example of these attempts is the widespread and important 
marketing approach of offering balance transfers at low annual percentage rates on credit 
cards. A switch in credit source brought about by a balance transfer does not, by itself, 
produce an increase in total indebtedness. 

Second, most prescreened solicitations are unproductive, as evidenced by recent response 
rates of about 0.5 percent for a given campaign (figure 1). Consumer survey results 
indicate that only about 6 percent of consumers had responded to a solicitation for a new 
or replacement card in the previous six months, and probably only a fraction of those 
were in any debt difficulty sufficient to cause payment problems, because in that case 
such consumers would not likely have received prescreened solicitations. As mentioned 
previously, low solicitation acceptance rates do not mean that the wide circulation of 
pricing and product information due to these programs is not useful in promoting 
competition; but it does cast some doubt on the hypothesis that the solicitations, by 
themselves, result in widespread overindebtedness. Although some cases of consumer 
overindebtedness arising from solicitations for new credit accounts undoubtedly occur, it 
is not clear that the elimination of prescreened solicitations would meaningfully reduce 
the current incidence of overindebtedness. 

Furthermore, the relationship of required debt service and financial obligations to income 
does not suggest that the burden in these areas has increased in recent years as much as is 
sometimes believed. The Federal Reserve Board regularly estimates the aggregate 
consumer debt service ratio and the broader financial obligations ratio. These ratios 
represent aggregates and do not necessarily indicate the experience of the typical 
household. Although the trend in the ratios in recent years has been upward, they have 
fluctuated within only a few percentage points over the past fifteen years and, as of mid-
2004 were not at their highest levels.41 However, a rise in the proportion of households 
filing for bankruptcy over the same period indicates increasing difficulties among some 
consumers in managing their debts in the face of changing personal circumstances such 
as loss of employment. 

Finally, results of the present study’s survey of consumers reveal that some of the anxiety 
about overindebtedness appears to arise from consumers’ concerns about the
