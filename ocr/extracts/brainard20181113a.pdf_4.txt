So it is no surprise that many financial services firms are devoting so much money, 

attention, and time to developing and using AI approaches.  Broadly, there is particular interest 

in at least five capabilities.8  First, firms view AI approaches as potentially having superior 

ability for pattern recognition, such as identifying relationships among variables that are not 

intuitive or not revealed by more traditional modeling.  Second, firms see potential cost 

efficiencies where AI approaches may be able to arrive at outcomes more cheaply with no 

reduction in performance.  Third, AI approaches might have greater accuracy in processing 

because of their greater automation compared to approaches that have more human input and 

higher “operator error.”  Fourth, firms may see better predictive power with AI compared to 

more traditional approaches--for instance, in improving investment performance or expanding 

credit access.  Finally, AI approaches are better than conventional approaches at accommodating 

very large and less-structured data sets and processing those data more efficiently and 

effectively.  Some machine learning approaches can be “let loose” on data sets to identify 

patterns or develop predictions without the need to specify a functional form ex ante.         

What do those capabilities mean in terms of how we bank?  The Financial Stability Board 

highlighted four areas where AI could impact banking.9  First, customer-facing uses could 

combine expanded consumer data sets with new algorithms to assess credit quality or price 

insurance policies.  And chatbots could provide help and even financial advice to consumers, 

                                                 
8 AI tools are also likely to be useful for central banks and regulators in their responsibilities for supervision, 
financial stability, and monetary policy, although this is not addressed here. The 2017 Financial Stability Board 
report highlighted the potential use of AI tools by central banks and prudential authorities for applications ranging 
from systemic risk identification to detecting fraud and money laundering (Financial Stability Board, Artificial 
Intelligence and Machine Learning).
