fallen considerably since the crisis and the haircuts and other conditions associated with current 

securities financing transactions are considerably more conservative than during the pre-crisis 

period, there is every reason to believe that the amount of this activity could increase, and the 

conservatism of the terms of the lending could be eroded, as economic conditions improve. 

 Let me turn now to some of the specific vulnerabilities, steps that have been taken thus 

far to address these vulnerabilities, and the work that remains. 

Regulated Institutions and Shadow Banking 

While the term “shadow banking” implies activity outside the purview of regulatory 

oversight, regulated institutions are in fact heavily involved in these activities, both in funding 

their own operations and in extending credit and liquidity support to shadow banks beyond the 

regulatory perimeter.    

Support provided for shadow banking activities may be either explicit or implicit.  In 

some cases, there are explicit contractual provisions for credit enhancements and liquidity 

support.  In other cases, the support is implicit, based on a bank’s historical pattern of providing 

support or a belief among investors that a bank will provide support to maintain the value of its 

franchise.  In the lead-up to the crisis, explicit and implicit commitments by regulated banking 

firms to shadow banks often combined to create the assumption that the liabilities of such entities 

were risk-free.  This perception led to an underpricing of the risks embedded in these money-like 

instruments, making them an artificially cheap source of funding and creating an oversupply of 

these instruments that contributed to systemic risk.  

Contractually committed credit and liquidity support lends itself more readily to 

regulation than does implicit support.  Basel III reforms have strengthened the regulatory 

requirements for situations in which there is contractual support for shadow banking activities.
