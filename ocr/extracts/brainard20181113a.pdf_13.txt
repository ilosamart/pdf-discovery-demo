Looking Ahead 

Perhaps one of the most important early lessons is that not all potential consequences are 

knowable now--firms should be continually vigilant for new issues in the rapidly evolving area 

of AI.  Throughout the history of banking, new products and processes have been an area where 

problems can arise.  Further, firms should not assume that AI approaches are less susceptible to 

problems because they are purported to be able to “learn” or less prone to human error.  There 

are plenty of examples of AI approaches not functioning as expected--a reminder that things can 

go wrong.  It is important for firms to recognize the possible pitfalls and employ sound controls 

now to prevent and mitigate possible future problems.    

For our part, we are still learning how AI tools can be used in the banking sector.  We 

welcome discussion about what use cases banks and other financial services firms are exploring 

with AI approaches and other innovations, and how our existing laws, regulations, guidance, and 

policy interests may intersect with these new approaches. 27  When considering financial 

innovation of any type, our task is to facilitate an environment in which socially beneficial, 

responsible innovation can progress with appropriate mitigation of risk and consistent with 

applicable statutes and regulations. 

As with other technological advances, AI presents regulators with a responsibility to act 

with thoughtfulness and perspective in carrying out their mandates, learning from the experience 

in other areas.  As we move ahead in exploring the policy and regulatory issues related to 

artificial intelligence, we look forward to collaborating with a broad array of stakeholders.
