 In addition, contingent workers may receive lower wages, less training, and fewer 

benefits than their counterparts with traditional jobs.  Typically, the wages of low-skilled 

employees within a company are boosted by social norms regarding pay equity, and 

nonpecuniary benefits are often equalized across a company’s employees, in certain cases 

as mandated by law.15  However, the wages that contractors receive are unlikely to reflect 

the same equity considerations.  Moreover, contingent work generally does not offer 

employer-based benefits and workplace protections that come with traditional 

employment opportunities, like overtime compensation, minimum wage protections, 

health insurance, family leave, employer-sponsored retirement plans, workers’ 

compensation, and paid sick leave. 

As a result, for some, contingent work may entail greater risks than in traditional 

full-time employment, with more variable and less predictable hours and earnings.  The 

Upwork study notes that one of freelancers’ biggest concerns is managing income 

variability and benefits.  For lower-income workers, unpredictable fluctuations in income 

can lead to severe hardship.  The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household 

Economics and Decisionmaking, for example, finds that 46 percent of households report 

that they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an unexpected 

expense of $400.16 

These findings suggest that employers, policymakers, and workers should seek 

ways to help individuals better manage the risks inherent in most forms of contingent 

work.  For example, we may need to enhance social safety net programs, such as 

                                                 
15 Regulations stipulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Affordable Care Act 

generally mandate equal benefits provision of pension and health insurance plans across employees.
