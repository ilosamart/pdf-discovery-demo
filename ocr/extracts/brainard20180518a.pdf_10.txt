banks to pursue the less obvious, but potentially more impactful, projects that low- and 

moderate-income neighborhoods need the most to become areas of opportunity.  

We will want to update the CRA in ways that reduce the distortions that lead to some 

areas becoming credit “hot spots” and others credit deserts.  Where there is a high density of 

banks relative to investment opportunities, the result of too many banks competing for too few 

CRA-qualified investments can be declining returns.  Meanwhile, other areas have a difficult 

time attracting capital not because the social return on investment is low, but rather because they 

are not in a bank’s major market, if they are served by a bank at all.  However we define a bank’s 

assessment areas in the future, the regulations need to be designed and implemented in a way 

that encourages banks to direct their community investment activities productively.   

Tailoring 

The third guiding principle is that the CRA regulations should be tailored to banks of 

different sizes and business models.  We should set standards that are flexible enough to evaluate 

the CRA performance of a $100 million bank no less effectively than a $2 trillion bank.  Banks 

seek clearer, simpler rules that result in more CRA activity with less burden.  We believe this can 

be done while retaining the flexibility to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance in light of its size, 

business model, capacity, and constraints as well as its community’s demographics, economic 

conditions, and credit needs and opportunities.  Regulatory revisions that do not contemplate 

evaluating CRA performance in context could arguably undermine the CRA’s greatest attribute--

its recognition that banks are uniquely situated to be responsive to the most important 

community and economic development needs in their communities.    

The typical small community bank focuses on serving its community through deposit and 

credit products and may not have the capacity to finance a major community development
