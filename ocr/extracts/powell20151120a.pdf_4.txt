speed.  In the current structure, customer trades occur mainly off of public markets, 

except at times of market stress when dealers may be unable or unwilling to 

internalize them.  That approach does not seem likely to provide good, stable 

liquidity in changing market conditions.  One presenter at the conference outlined 

his idea that high frequency “batch auctions” -- auctions held every millisecond or 

so rather than trading continuously -- would increase market liquidity and limit the 

race for speed.  There are several related ideas that have been proposed.  In fact, 

trading platforms have already tried various innovations.  For example, EBS has 

instituted latency floors and random batching lengths for messaging in its FX 

trading platform.  I hope we will hear more about that today.     

There may be other adaptations to the current market structure that could 

provide greater or more stable liquidity.  A good way to find out if there are better
