developing a framework of margin rules designed to be applied uniformly across nations 

for securities financing transactions involving nongovernmental securities.  These 

minimum standards should increase the resiliency of those markets and mitigate the 

pressures on terms that inevitably emerge during benign periods.  We expect to propose 

regulations implementing these rules in the United States in due course.

businesses and governments engage in borrowing to fund their purchases and operations.  

These markets figured importantly in the crisis, most notoriously through securities

Many of our largest financial institutions packaged the loans into marginally capitalized 

securitization structures that were rated highly by the credit rating agencies and thus
