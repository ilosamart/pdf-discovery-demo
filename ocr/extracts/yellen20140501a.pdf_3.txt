Because of their important role, I am pleased that the condition of many community 

banks has been improving.  Although there is still considerable revenue pressure from low 

margins, earnings for most community banks have rebounded since the financial crisis.  Asset 

quality and capital ratios continue to improve, and the number of problem banks continues to 

decline.  Notably, after several years of reduced lending following the recession, we are starting 

to see slow but steady loan growth at community banks.  While this expansion in lending must 

be prudent, on balance I consider this growth an encouraging sign of an improving economy.   

Addressing Too Big to Fail 

Let me begin by discussing an issue that I know has been on the minds of many 

community bankers:  how policymakers are addressing the problem of banks that are perceived 

to be too big to fail.1  Community banks share the interest we all have in reducing the systemic 

risk posed by firms that are large, complex, and interconnected, and also in reducing any 

potential competitive advantages that such firms may enjoy as a result of too-big-to-fail.  

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) 

addresses the too-big-to-fail issue through steps intended to limit both the likelihood that 

systemically important firms would fail and the potential damage from any that do.  The Federal 

Reserve and the other financial regulatory agencies have issued a number of regulations to 

implement the requirements set forth in the legislation and to enhance the supervision of the 

largest financial firms.
