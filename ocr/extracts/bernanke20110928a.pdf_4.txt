Developing countries also have the advantage of being able to import and adapt 

production technologies already in use in advanced economies.  And, indeed, empirical 

studies have found some tendency for countries that start from further behind to grow 

faster than those that begin with higher incomes.3  

However, much of the national and regional variation in growth rates is not 

explained by initial economic conditions.  Notably, emerging Asian economies have 

tended to outperform, relative to what would be predicted based solely on their levels of 

income per person, say, 30 years ago.  And some of the poorest countries, including a 

number in Africa, have continued to grow relatively slowly.  So what factors--and what 

economic policies--differentiate the more successful performers from the less successful? 

A classic attempt to generalize about the policies that best promote economic 

growth and development, and a useful starting point for discussion, is the so-called 

Washington Consensus, articulated by the economist John Williamson in 1990.4  Writing 

about Latin America, Williamson outlined a list of 10 broad policies to promote 

economic development that he judged as commanding, at the time he wrote, substantial 

support between both economists and policymakers.  Because these views were 

influential at major institutions like the World Bank located in Washington, this set of 

policies was dubbed the Washington Consensus. 
                                                            
3 The idea that levels of output per capita tend to converge across countries, which in turn implies that the 
countries that are initially the poorest tend to grow the fastest, is known in the research literature as 
“absolute convergence.”  A more sophisticated variant of this idea is “conditional convergence,” which 
holds that convergence across countries holds only after we control appropriately for factors that affect the 
long-run level of output in each country, such as the domestic saving rate and the rate of population growth.  
Empirical analyses generally find somewhat mixed evidence for absolute convergence but fairly robust 
support for conditional convergence.  See, for example, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) and Durlauf, 
Johnson, and Temple (2005).  Rodrik (2011) and some others have argued recently that absolute 
convergence holds at a more disaggregated level in the manufacturing sector.     
4 Williamson initially articulated the Washington Consensus in a speech in 1989, but the first written 
version appears in Williamson (1990).  See also Williamson (2004) for his views on the various 
interpretations given to his recommendations.
