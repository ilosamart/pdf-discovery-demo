inflation-protected securities (TIPS) suggest that expected inflation over the next five 

years currently is around 1-3/4 percent.  The substantial amount of resource slack that is 

projected to remain in U.S. labor and product markets over the next several years,

disinflationary pressures could intensify if the recovery faltered.  Indeed, based on 

imputations from TIPS prices, market participantsâ€™ assessments of the odds of outright 

deflation have risen significantly in recent months.

funds rate has been maintained in that range since December 2008.  Since that time, the 

FOMC has provided forward guidance about the anticipated future path of the federal 

funds rate.  For example, in each meeting statement from March 2009 through June 2011,
