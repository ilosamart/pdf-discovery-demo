  For all these reasons, I believe we should consider discarding the IRB approach to risk-

weighted capital requirements.  With the Collins Amendment

 providing a standardized, 

statutory floor for risk-based capital; the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio providing a 

stronger back-up capital measure; and the stress tests providing a better risk-sensitive measure 

that incorporates a macroprudential dimension, the IRB approach has little useful role to play.  

We would continue to expect that firms practice sound quantitative risk management using 

internal models and other techniques.  Indeed, the qualitative assessment included in our annual 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise is designed to ensure that the 

firms have this capacity.  But, in light of all that has happened in the last decade, I see little 

reason to maintain the requirements of the IRB approach for our largest banks. 

Of course, the IRB approach was agreed internationally as part of the Basel II framework 

concluded in 2004.  It would be best if all the Basel Committee countries moved together to 

adopt standardized risk-weighted and supervisory stress testing requirements for all 

internationally active banks.  This would be a somewhat complicated shift for a number of 

reasons, including the likely appropriateness of applying different adverse scenarios for different 

parts of the world and the challenges in conducting a peer review at the Basel Committee of 

supervisory stress tests by member countries.  Yet, as documented by the Basel Committee’s 

work on divergence in risk weightings by banks applying IRB methods, Basel II created its own 

problems of consistency and transparency.  There is no reason to believe that the task of creating 

an oversight and review framework for supervisory stress testing would be any more difficult.

 Section 171 of Dodd-Frank, popularly known as the Collins Amendment, requires that the federal banking 

agencies establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all banking organizations that are not less than 

“generally applicable” risk-based capital requirements.
