 Having been given the privilege of opening this conference, let me start at the very 

beginning with the term “shadow banking.”  The very phrase evokes the sense of something 

hidden, furtive even--a sort of film noir backdrop for extending credit, in contrast to the well-lit 

setting of the local insured depository institution.  In the pre-crisis years, there did indeed 

develop modes of financial intermediation in which certain features of a counterparty 

relationship were, if not quite obscured, then at least ambiguous, and thus “shadowy.”  Most 

notable were arrangements in which guarantees of capital preservation or liquidity provision 

were understood to exist and to have been previously honored, even in the absence of contractual 

obligations for those guarantees.  But as asset values were falling to points unknown, the 

withdrawal of many of these implicit guarantees by financial entities that were themselves under 

stress amplified the growing liquidity crunch. 

 Damaging as these arrangements were, however, they do not define the range of issues 

associated with the term shadow banking.  A broader definition would embrace all forms of 

lending outside of prudentially regulated institutions.  While such a definition might be a useful 

starting point for purposes of consumer protection, for example, it seems both over- and under-

inclusive for purposes of regulation to protect financial stability and the resilience of the 

economy as a whole.  There are certainly forms of nonbank lending that do not raise prudential 

concerns.  On the other hand, financial stability concerns can arise where credit extension is only 

indirectly involved, as might be the case with certain bond funds, or where credit is not involved 

at all, as might be the case with firms writing large amounts of variable annuities with minimum 

return guarantees.   

 Rather than dwell on definitions, much less attempt to develop a taxonomy of shadow 

banking, I think it more productive to focus on the characteristics of shadow banking-related
