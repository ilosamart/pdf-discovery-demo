prominent groups provide useful starting points for a much-needed national conversation.  

Although these proposals differ on many details, they demonstrate that realistic solutions 

to our fiscal problems are available.   

Of course, economic growth is affected not only by the levels of taxes and 

spending, but also by their composition and structure.  I hope that, in addressing our long-

term fiscal challenges, the Congress and the Administration will seek reforms to the 

governmentâ€™s tax policies and spending priorities that serve not only to reduce the deficit, 

but also to enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by 

reducing disincentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our 

workforce as well as in new machinery and equipment, by promoting research and 

development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure.  Our nation cannot 

reasonably expect to grow its way out of our fiscal imbalances, but a more productive 

economy will ease the tradeoffs that we face. 

Thank you.  I would be pleased to take your questions.
