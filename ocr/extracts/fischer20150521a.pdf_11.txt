And it means the continuation of a courageous and effective monetary policy, and 

courageous and effective regulation and supervision of the financial system – albeit a 

monetary policy that could do even better if accompanied by an expansionary fiscal 

policy.   

All that has been done so far makes it very likely that EMU--the Economic and 

Monetary Union--will survive this crisis.  But in the longer run, EMU will not survive 

unless it also brings prosperity to its members.  That means that the most important 

challenge of the future will require an increase in productivity growth in Europe--and that 

is a challenge that faces the entire developed world. 

Let me conclude by congratulating you, the management and staff of the ECB, on 

what you have achieved in your short history, and especially in the last few years.  And 

best wishes for future success in continuing to do your share in contributing to the 

building of Europe--preferably without having to face too many future crises, useful as 

Monnet’s approach suggests such crises could be.   

Thank you--and good luck.
