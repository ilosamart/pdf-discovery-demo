measures of inflation compensation remain stable at levels above the lows seen in 2016. 

With various measures of underlying trend inflation having come in below our 2 percent 

objective over a sustained period, it is important to sustainably achieve inflation around 

2 percent to prevent an erosion of underlying trend inflation the next time the economy 

faces a downturn and the federal funds rate hits its lower limit.14   

The past few times unemployment fell to levels as low as those projected over the 

next year, signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in 

accelerating inflation.  The Federal Reserve’s assessment suggests that financial 

vulnerabilities are building, which might be expected after a long period of economic 

expansion and very low interest rates.  Rising risks are notable in the corporate sector, 

where low spreads and loosening credit terms are mirrored by rising indebtedness among 

corporations that could be vulnerable to downgrades in the event of unexpected adverse 

developments.  Leveraged lending is again on the rise; spreads on leveraged loans and the 

securitized products backed by those loans are low, and the Board’s Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggests that underwriting standards for 

leveraged loans may be declining to levels not seen since 2005. 

While tightening resource utilization and loose financial conditions present upside 

risks, recent foreign developments present downside risks.  Trade policy has introduced 

uncertainty.  Growth in Europe and Japan has moderated from its strong pace of last year, 

and political risks have reemerged in countries such as Italy.  China is contending with 

deleveraging and deceleration as well as a challenging trade environment.  As U.S. 

growth has pulled away from foreign growth, in part reflecting fiscal policy divergence,
