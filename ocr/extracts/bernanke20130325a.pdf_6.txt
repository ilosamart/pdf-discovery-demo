employment at home.  Moreover, and critically, countries also benefited from stronger 

growth in trading partners that purchased their exports.  In sharp contrast to the tariff 

wars, monetary reflation in the 1930s was a positive-sum exercise, whose benefits came 

mainly from higher domestic demand in all countries, not from trade diversion arising 

from changes in exchange rates. 

The lessons for the present are clear.  Today most advanced industrial economies 

remain, to varying extents, in the grip of slow recoveries from the Great Recession.  With 

inflation generally contained, central banks in these countries are providing 

accommodative monetary policies to support growth.  Do these policies constitute 

competitive devaluations?  To the contrary, because monetary policy is accommodative 

in the great majority of advanced industrial economies, one would not expect large and 

persistent changes in the configuration of exchange rates among these countries.  The 

benefits of monetary accommodation in the advanced economies are not created in any 

significant way by changes in exchange rates; they come instead from the support for 

domestic aggregate demand in each country or region.  Moreover, because stronger 

growth in each economy confers beneficial spillovers to trading partners, these policies 

are not “beggar-thy-neighbor” but rather are positive-sum, “enrich-thy-neighbor” actions. 

Again, the distinction between monetary policies aimed at domestic objectives 

and trade-diverting exchange rate devaluations or other protectionist measures is critical.  

The former can be mutually beneficial, the latter are not.  Indeed, it was this view that 

prompted the Group of Seven central bankers and finance ministers to issue a statement 

in February agreeing to refrain from actions focused on achieving competitive advantage
