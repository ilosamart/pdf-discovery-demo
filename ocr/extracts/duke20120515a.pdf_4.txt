There are some promising signs in the trend of house prices as well.  Although 

house prices have continued to fall year-over-year, the pace of decline has slowed notably 

and the month-over-month readings have shown increases for three months now.  

National house prices fell less than 1 percent for the year ending in March.  With the 

exception of the period around the 2010 first-time homebuyer tax credit, this year-over-

year decline was the smallest since early 2007.  Moreover, according to CoreLogic data, 

home prices have risen in more cities lately than they have fallen.  Indeed, over 45 

percent of cities saw their home prices rise more than 1 percent in the past three months, 

the most since early 2006. 

These modest improvements in house prices can only be sustained if the demand 

for homes strengthens or the supply of homes for sale falls to meet weak demand.  My 

Realtor friends have taught me that when inventories of houses for sale reach a level 

equal to six months of sales, then markets are usually in rough balance, meaning that 

levels below six months tend to favor sellers and those above six months favor buyers.  

My economist colleagues talk about much the same concept--using, as they so often do, a 

vocabulary that may not be familiar to others.  In particular, they think about the idea of 

equilibrium prevailing in a market, so that prices are roughly stable.  And, indeed, just as 

the inventory of existing homes for sale nationally has approached six months of sales, 

we have seen a leveling of prices suggesting that some equilibrium is being achieved, 

albeit at low levels.  Of course, as Realtors know very well, these national data mask 

some significant differences in individual markets.  Inventory in some markets is 

reportedly quite tight, including some markets such as Miami and Phoenix where the 

level of past due loans and loans in the process of foreclosure is still quite high.  For me,
