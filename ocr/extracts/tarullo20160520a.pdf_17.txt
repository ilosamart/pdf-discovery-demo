financial stability that might be posed by the activities, material financial distress, or failure of 

the company.  Just as we have done with other non-bank financial intermediaries for which we 

have been given regulatory responsibilities, we will fashion a regime that takes account of the 

particular characteristics and risks of those intermediaries.  We have taken a good bit of time in 

arriving at some potential insurance regulatory capital frameworks precisely because we wanted 

to consider these issues thoroughly.  Our tentative conclusion is that a bifurcated approach to a 

capital regime for insurance companies makes sense in light of these considerations.  But we 

anticipate using the vehicle of an ANPR in order to give all interested parties an opportunity to 

comment on this approach before we turn to developing and proposing its details.  In this 

process, we of course especially welcome the views of those of you on the front lines of 

insurance supervision. 

Thank you very much.
