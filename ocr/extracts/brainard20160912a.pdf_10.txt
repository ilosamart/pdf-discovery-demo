Several econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the 

current real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and 

slow.13  These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in 

the policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated.   

5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric  

 The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we 

will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time:  the ability of monetary 

policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric.  With policy rates near the zero lower bound 

and likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks 

similar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral 

rate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse 

developments.  Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best 

understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate 

demand as it can to upside shocks.  While there are, of course, other policy options, these 

alternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional 

policy.14  From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the 

conventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor 

of guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against 

upside risks.
