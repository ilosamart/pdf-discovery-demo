It is good to be here at the Federal Reserve System’s Community Development 

Research Conference.  This year, our conference is focusing on renewing the promise of 

the middle class, a topic that goes to the heart of the American dream and underpins the 

vibrancy of our democracy and society.1  

What Does It Mean to Be Part of the Middle Class? 

Before I dig into the data, I want to touch on what it means to be a part of the 

middle class, recognizing aspirations differ from person to person.  From a purely 

economic perspective, being middle class commonly means having financial security and 

the ability to invest for our futures and for our children.  In turn, having a strong middle 

class implies that families with average incomes have the purchasing power to consume 

and the savings to invest.  So a strong middle class is often seen as a cornerstone of a 

vibrant economy and, beyond that, a resilient democracy.2 

In recent years, households at the middle of the income distribution have faced a 

number of challenges.  That raises the question of whether middle-class living standards 

are within reach for middle-income Americans in today’s economy.

citizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be well-administered in which the middle 
class is large, and stronger if possible than both the other classes.”  See Constitutional Rights Foundation
