having access to those funds more or less immediately.  Some depositors in 1932 needed their 

money in order to meet the requirements of daily life, while many repo counterparties in 2008 

needed their money to meet other short-term obligations.  Thus the issue was not just a matter of 

solvency--whether the firm would ultimately be able to pay all the claims even after the run--but 

also a matter of the short-term liquidity of the bank or broker.   

 The dynamic unleashed by short-term wholesale funding runs in 2007 and 2008 directly 

exacerbated financial stress.  Many assets funded through the shadow banking system were 

traded assets, which could be liquidated rapidly, though often at distressed prices, to reduce the 

funding needs of the borrowing firms.  The resulting fire sales recalled the asset liquidations by 

some trust companies during the Panic of 1907 and by some securities firms in the 1930s.  In 

2008, these fire sales created adverse feedback loops of mark-to-market losses, margin calls, and 

further liquidations.  The unwinding of the risk illusion--that is, the assumption that lending to 

shadow banks was essentially risk-free--helped transform a dramatic correction in real estate 

valuations into a crisis that engulfed the entire economy. 

  But for a few idiosyncratic instances since the introduction of deposit insurance in 1933, 

bank runs have been rendered a thing of the past.  Deposits below the amount of the federal 

insurance cap are fully and explicitly guaranteed.  Access to the Federal Reserveâ€™s discount 

window for depository institutions complements the deposit insurance system by helping to 

relieve liquidity pressures in solvent banks.  In practice, failing banks usually merge into 

healthier ones, so that depositors do not lose access to their funds and deposits exceeding the 

amount of the federal insurance cap are effectively protected.  In the relatively few instances of 

depositor payouts, the FDIC has reimbursed depositors expeditiously.  Of course, the explicit and
