Many of the Basel Committee’s early activities were focused on the challenges created by gaps 

in the supervision of internationally active banks, as evidenced by the fact that Basel 

“Concordats” on supervision preceded Basel “Accords” and “Frameworks” on capital and other 

subjects.  This task has, of necessity, been ongoing, as experience revealed gaps in supervisory 

coverage and as the scale and scope of internationally active banks grew.  The principle of 

consolidated supervision emerged in the early 1980s to ensure that some specific banking 

authority--generally the home-country regulator--had a complete view of the assets and liabilities 

of the bank.

  This principle was reinforced and elaborated following the Bank of Credit and 

Commerce International episode in the early 1990s.

It is important to note that each Basel Committee declaration on the importance of home-

country consolidated oversight has also included a statement of the obligations and prerogatives 

of host states in which significant foreign bank operations are located.  This feature of the Basel 

Committee’s approach makes sense as a reflection both of the host authority’s responsibility for 

stability of its financial system and of the practical point that a host authority will be more 

familiar with the characteristics and risks in its market.  In accordance with this history, the 

current version of the “Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision” sets out as one of its 

“essential criteria” for home-host relationships that “[t]he host supervisor’s national laws or 

regulations require that the cross-border operations of foreign banks are subject to prudential, 

inspection and regulatory reporting requirements similar to those for domestic banks.”
