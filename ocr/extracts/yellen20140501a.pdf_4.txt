But even before Dodd-Frank became law, the Federal Reserve began to strengthen its 

oversight of the largest, most complex banking firms and require these firms to materially 

improve their capital adequacy.  For example, in 2009, we conducted the first stress tests of the 

largest 19 U.S. bank holding companies.  That test has subsequently evolved into our annual 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, known as CCAR, which requires all bank holding 

companies with total assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review by 

the Federal Reserve.  CCAR helps ensure that the largest banking organizations will have 

enough capital to continue operating through times of economic and financial stress.2  To be 

clear, as the federal banking agencies have stated previously, these stress testing and capital 

planning requirements do not, and should not, apply to community banks.3  

In addition to strengthening requirements for stress testing and capital planning, the 

agencies have also strengthened capital requirements for the largest firms by approving more 

robust risk-based and leverage capital requirements.  Because the financial crisis demonstrated 

the importance of having adequate levels of high-quality capital at banks of all sizes, many 

elements of the revised capital framework apply to all banking organizations.  In designing the 

revised capital rules, however, the agencies considered financial stability risks and adjusted the 

                                                 
2 The results of the 2014 CCAR exercise are available on the Federal Reserve’s website.  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Releases Results of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(CCAR),” press release, March 26, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140326a.htm.  

     Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies require banking 
organizations with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to conduct annual company-run 
stress tests.  The agencies recently published guidance to clarify supervisory expectations for these firms.  See Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 
and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (2014), “Agencies Issue Final Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test 
Guidance for Medium-Sized Firms,” press release, March 5,
