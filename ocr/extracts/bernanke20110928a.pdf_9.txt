Similarly, dismantling controls on the domestic financial industry has proven 

counterproductive when important complementary factors--such as effective bank 

supervision, the availability of bank managers trained in market-based lending, or 

consumer familiarity with financial products such as credit cards--were absent.  For 

example, Korea experienced a mini financial crisis in early 2003, resulting from a 

massive run-up in household debt.  In the wake of policy changes to liberalize and 

increase competition in domestic financial markets, credit card debt in Korea as a share 

of its gross domestic product more than tripled between 1999 and 2002, as the average 

number of credit cards for every adult in the country rose from 1 to 3.  Korea’s 

consumers, lenders, and regulators had little experience with credit cards, and 

institutional arrangements for sharing data on consumer credit, including credit reports, 

were inadequate.  Not surprisingly, at least in retrospect, delinquency rates soared, 

putting the solvency of a number of the country’s major financial institutions at risk.  The 

broader lesson is that institutional arrangements, ranging from accounting rules to 

regulatory frameworks to tax-compliance tools, must be sufficiently developed to ensure 

that reforms are successful.  Fortunately, even in the absence of a clear consensus on how 

best to sequence and implement reforms, many countries have successfully promoted 

growth through a slow and pragmatic but continuing process of liberalization.  

A second important lesson of the past two decades involves the pivotal role of 

technology in economic development.  For emerging market economies, which tend to 

lag behind in technological sophistication, rapid gains in productivity can be achieved by 

adapting state-of-the-art technologies already developed by the advanced economies 

rather than by having to develop these technologies from scratch.  But successful
