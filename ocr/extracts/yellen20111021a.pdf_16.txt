and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international 

creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.   

At the same time, it is important to recognize that too much fiscal tightening in 

the near term could harm the economic recovery.  Significant near-term reductions in 

federal spending or large increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the 

economy at a time when aggregate demand is already weak.  We need, and I believe we 

have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible 

plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while 

also addressing the economyâ€™s short-term needs.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of 

crafting a strategy for our fiscal policy that appropriately balances short-run needs with 

long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the U.S. 

economy. 

Conclusion 

In summary, the Federal Reserve has taken forceful actions to promote its 

objectives of maximum employment and stable prices, and we strive to communicate as

half of this year, I expect that the pace of recovery will pick up over coming quarters and 

that unemployment will resume a gradual decline toward its longer-run sustainable rate; 

moreover, I anticipate that the medium-term outlook for inflation will remain subdued.  

Nonetheless, there are significant downside risks.  Therefore, the FOMC will continue to 

assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information, and we are prepared to
