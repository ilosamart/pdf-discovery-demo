In short, this is not like using a model to develop a regulation that, for example, limits 

emissions of polluting substances.  In such a case, adherence to the precise model output would 

itself achieve the regulatory purpose.  Here, by contrast, the very purpose of the regulatory 

regime would be undermined.  Remember, this is a stress test.  The shifts in activities of banks 

and in the economy create a dynamic set of risks.  Effective prudential regulation must be 

equally dynamic and should try to avoid pushing major financial firms toward measuring all of 

their risk positions in exactly the same way. 

 There is, however, one additional consideration.  Because the stress tests would be 

undermined by giving the models to the banks, there are of course limited opportunities for 

external parties to assess the models.  To promote the integrity of the models in these 

circumstances, we established a Model Validation Group, which is composed of modelling 

experts who are not involved in the design and application of the stress test models.  They make 

regular assessments and offer suggestions for improvement.  We expect to be providing the 

public greater information on our internal validation processes. 

Eliminating the qualitative CCAR exercise for smaller firms 

 As you can already tell, our responses to the need for better alignment of the stress test 

with our capital rules and to the desirability of more macroprudential emphasis each required a 

good bit of explanation.  In contrast, our response to the issue of the unnecessary burden on 

smaller, less complex CCAR firms is both simply stated and simply achieved. 

 In a notice of proposed rulemaking that the Board is releasing today we are proposing 

that banks with less than $250 billion in assets that do not have significant international or 

nonbank activity would no longer be included in the annual CCAR qualitative review.  As noted 

earlier, many of these firms have already met supervisory expectations.  We do not intend for
