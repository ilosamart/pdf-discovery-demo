macroprudential regulators might let down their guard.  In such situations, if emerging 

threats to financial stability become evident, monetary policy could be faced with 

difficult tradeoffs.  My hope is that such situations will remain largely theoretical and, in 

practice, be exceedingly rare.  

Overall, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in developing the new 

regulatory framework.  Still, macroprudential supervision is a work in progress, and we 

must humbly recognize that we have a lot to learn. 

Challenges 

It’s important to be realistic about the challenges that lie ahead.  By its nature, 

policy designed to manage systemic risk fights dangers that may never lead to crises.  We 

may sometimes be like the boy who cried, “Wolf!”--and the villagers may not be pleased 

about being rousted from their beds.  Right now, we are still suffering from the shock of 

an epic financial disaster.  The climate for macroprudential policymaking is relatively 

favorable.  But memories will fade, as they always have before, and future policymakers 

may face harsh criticism.  They will need to make difficult and potentially costly 

judgment calls, relying on imperfect real-time information.  In this regard, it’s worth 

recalling Paul Samuelson’s quip that the stock market has predicted nine of the past 

five recessions.  Will future regulators and monetary policymakers be accused of bursting

These dangers are real.  But the events we’ve recently lived through make it clear 

that we have no choice but to embark on this road.  We’ve all been asked, “Didn’t you 

see this mortgage disaster coming?  Why didn’t you do anything about it?”  Our task now 

is to implement intelligent policies to contain future bubbles and credit binges, and to
