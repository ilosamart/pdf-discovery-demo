The first tailwind I’ll mention is fiscal policy.  History shows that fiscal policy 

often helps to support an economic recovery.  Some of this fiscal stimulus is automatic, 

and intended to be.  The income loss that individuals and businesses suffer in a recession 

is partly offset when their tax bills fall as well.  Government spending on unemployment 

benefits and other safety-net programs rises in recessions, helping individuals hurt by the 

downturn and also supporting consumer spending and the broader economy by replacing 

lost income.  These automatic declines in tax collections and increases in government 

spending are often supplemented with discretionary fiscal action--tax rate cuts, spending 

on infrastructure and other goods and services, and extended unemployment benefits.  

These discretionary fiscal policy actions are typically a plus for growth in the years just 

after a recession.  For example, following the severe 1981-82 recession, discretionary 

fiscal policy contributed an average of about 1 percentage point per year to real GDP 

growth over the subsequent three years.5  

However, discretionary fiscal policy hasn’t been much of a tailwind during this 

recovery.  In the year following the end of the recession, discretionary fiscal policy at the 

federal, state, and local levels boosted growth at roughly the same pace as in past 

recoveries, as exhibit 3 indicates.  But instead of contributing to growth thereafter, 

discretionary fiscal policy this time has actually acted to restrain the recovery.  State and 

local governments were cutting spending and, in some cases, raising taxes for much of 

this period to deal with revenue shortfalls.  At the federal level, policymakers have 

                                                       
5 These calculations are based on Federal Reserve Board estimates of fiscal impetus, which measures the 
boost to aggregate demand from increased government purchases as well as the effects of changes in tax 
and entitlement policies on consumer and business spending.  See Glenn Follette and Byron Lutz (2010),
