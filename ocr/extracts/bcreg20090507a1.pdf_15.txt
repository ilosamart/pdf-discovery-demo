[Footnote *. Resources to absorb losses include pre-provision net revenue less changes in ALLL. End footnote *.]

percent to about 11.4 percent, and the median was about 4.9 percent. End of graphic.] 

III. The SCAP Capital Buffer 
Minimum capital standards for a BHC are intended to serve only as a guide for supervisors in 
determining the adequacy of the BHCs capital relative to its risk profile. In practice, supervisors expect 
all BHCs to have a level and composition of Tier 1 capital well in excess of the 4 percent regulatory 
minimum, and also to have "voting common stockholders' equity" as the dominant element of Tier 1 
capital. In this regard, the use of Tier 1 Common capital in the SCAP is consistent with the Board's long-
held belief that common equity should be the dominant form of Tier 1 Capital.8 [Footnote 8. Tier 1 Common 
capital is calculated as Tier 1 capital less non-common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, 
qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries, and qualifying trust preferred securities. End footnote 8.] 
Under the SCAP, 
supervisors evaluated the extent to which each of the 19 BHCs would need to alter either the amount or 
the composition (or both) of its Tier 1 capital today to be able to exceed minimum regulatory 
requirements in Q4 2010, even under an unexpectedly adverse economic outcome. 
Specifically, the SCAP capital buffer for each BHC is sized to achieve a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at 
least 6 percent and a Tier 1 Common capital ratio of at least 4 percent at the end of 2010 under the 
more adverse macroeconomic scenario. By focusing on Tier 1 Common capital as well as Tier 1 capital, 
the SCAP emphasized both the amount of a BHCs capital and the composition of its capital structure. 
Once the SCAP upfront buffer is established, the normal supervisory process will continue to be used to 
determine whether a firm's current capital ratios are consistent with regulatory guidance. 
By its design, the SCAP is more stringent than a solvency test. Each BHCs capital was rigorously 
evaluated against a two-year-ahead adverse scenario that is not a prediction or an expected outcome 
for the economy, but is instead a "what if" scenario. Thus, any need for additional capital and/or a 
change in composition of capital to meet the SCAP buffer builds in extra capital against the unlikely
