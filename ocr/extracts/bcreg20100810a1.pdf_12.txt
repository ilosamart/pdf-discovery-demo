risk weight of the sovereign.23  The current market risk rule and the Basel modified 
market risk framework also make use of credit ratings for PSE exposures.     

One approach would be to continue to use the general risk-based capital rules’ 
treatment of differentiating the risk of PSEs based on the type of exposure, the sovereign 
of incorporation, and by how revenues are collected for the PSE exposure.     

Alternatively, the agencies could provide some incremental risk sensitivity by 
differentiating revenue bond issuers by type of service or business.  As with sovereign 
exposures, risk weighting could be based on several financial and economic measures.  
For example, the agencies could assign risk weights based on one or more ratios, such as 
a relevant debt service obligation to cash flow ratio (for example, debt to revenue), and/or 
debt to market value of certain assets (for example, real estate).  The agencies also could 
incorporate credit spreads to help differentiate credit risk among PSE exposures.  Other 
options include permitting banking organizations to assign risk weights to PSE exposures 
based on the applicable risk weight of the sovereign of incorporation, or using data 
obtained from qualified third parties to inform credit-worthiness assessments based upon 
a set of objective criteria established by the agencies. 

Question 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods for calculating risk-based capital requirements for PSE exposures?  How can the 
agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  Which services and 
businesses, or financial and economic measures, should the agencies consider?  What are 
the implications or potential for unintended consequences?  Are there other methods for 
assessing risk-based capital for PSE exposures in a relatively risk sensitive manner that 
would meet the principles described in section III?  Commenters are asked to provide 
quantitative as well as qualitative support and/or analysis for proposed alternative 
methods.   

iii. Bank exposures 

The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules generally assign a 20 percent risk 
weight to exposures to U.S. depository institutions and foreign banks.24  Long-term 
exposures to banks not incorporated in OECD countries are assigned a 100 percent risk 
weight.  Under the Basel standardized approach, bank exposures would be risk weighted 
based either on the risk weight of the sovereign or the credit rating of the exposure.25  The 
market risk rule and the Basel modified market risk framework also use ratings for bank 
exposures.   

One option for risk weighting bank exposures is to continue to use the general 
risk-based capital treatment, which bases the risk weight for bank exposures on whether 
the sovereign where the bank is incorporated is a member of the OECD.  Another method 
for risk weighting bank exposures could be based on several financial measures and
