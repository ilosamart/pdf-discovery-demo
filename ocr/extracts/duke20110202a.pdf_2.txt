It is great to be back at the University of North Carolina.  And I am most honored 

to take part in the Kenan-Flagler Business School’s Dean’s Speaker Series.  I am a proud 

graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill.  However, my area of study was not what most would 

consider a logical first step for someone who would one day become a central banker.  I 

was an aspiring actress, and spent most of my time across campus at Playmaker Theater 

earning a degree in dramatic art.  Tonight I have been asked to share with you some of

I’ll talk a bit about banking and the important role lending plays in the economy.  

I’ll describe how my banking career led me to a seat on the Federal Reserve Board and 

how that unique perspective helped me add value after I arrived there.  I will then explain 

some of the actions taken by the central bank at a time of extraordinary financial 

uncertainty, and I’ll describe some of the attributes that make the Federal Reserve an 

institution like no other.  I’ll end with a few thoughts that might resonate with the 

students in the audience as they conclude their studies and prepare to join the workforce.

anywhere and with hours that would leave plenty of time to pursue my dream.  I found a 

job as a part-time drive-through teller.  Later when I needed a full-time job, I went to 

work in a start-up bank.  And even though I didn’t start out to be a banker, I found a
