that CCPs that adhere to the PFMIs present lower risks to their members.  Exposures to 

such qualifying CCPs require less capital.10  The capital rules also recognize that a CCP 

requiring more initial margin from its members exposes those members to less default 

risk, and therefore require less capital.  On the liquidity front, the recently proposed 

liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) recognizes the liquidity-intensive nature of derivatives 

transactions.  Under the LCR, a bank is required to maintain high-quality liquid assets 

that are sufficient to withstand an extreme yet plausible margin call from its derivatives 

counterparties.11  Importantly, the liquidity requirement depends on the member’s net 

derivatives position with the CCP--if the position is hedged, the liquidity requirement 

will be appropriately attenuated.   

Ensuring the Stability of OTC Derivatives Markets That Are Not Centrally 

Cleared:  Margin Requirements for Noncleared Derivatives 

While central clearing is important and is expected to increase substantially over 

time, a significant portion of nonstandardized, bespoke derivatives will never be suitable 

for central clearing.  This bilaterally cleared part of the market was a principal source of 

systemic risk during the crisis.  For noncentrally cleared derivatives, margin requirements 

will serve as the main tool to mitigate systemic risks.  The Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision (Basel Committee) and the International Organization of Securities 

Commissions (IOSCO) have recently finalized a framework for margin requirements on 

noncentrally cleared derivatives that provides for harmonized rules and a level playing
