The progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer 

necessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to 

add to the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.  Accordingly, the 

Committee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year, 

ending its purchases in October.  That step, however, did not mark an immediate shift 

toward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to 

raise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases.  

Moreover, as the Committee explained in a set of “normalization principles” issued that 

September, the intention was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for 

the federal funds rate.9  We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of 

monetary policy remained appropriate because, while the U.S. economy was stronger and 

closer to meeting our statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement.  In 

particular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run 

normal level--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy 

is operating at maximum employment--and inflation remained below the 2 percent 

objective. 

Because my colleagues and I expected that labor market conditions would 

continue to improve and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium

    Several studies support the notion that maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at an 
elevated level is consistent with keeping a highly accommodative policy stance, particularly when short-
term interest rates are close to zero, as it was the case in 2014--see, for instance, D’Amico and others 
(2012) and many of the references in Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).  Large Federal Reserve 
holdings of longer-term securities reduce the total amount of such securities available for purchase by the 
public, exerting upward pressure on their prices and, thus, depressing their yields and contributing to lower 
borrowing costs for American families and businesses.
