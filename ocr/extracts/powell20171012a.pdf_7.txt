this improvement is through an index of aggregate EME vulnerability (the black line in 

slide 6), which is based economic data on a variety of variables from 13 major 

economies.7  According to this index, EME vulnerabilities today stand well below those 

in the 1990s--a period during which financial crises in EMEs were much more prevalent.   

That said, the vulnerability index has been trending up since 2008.  Part of this 

increase in the vulnerability index can be attributed to a run-up in bank credit to the 

private sector, which brings me to a key risk for EME prospects:  the position of EME 

corporates.  Observers have been expressing concerns about the mounting levels of 

corporate debt and the risk that a normalization of global conditions could exacerbate 

debt service burdens of EME corporations--particularly those with elevated levels of 

dollar-denominated debt--by raising global interest rates, boosting the value of the dollar, 

and perhaps damping economic activity.  Given the prominence of this risk, I will discuss 

EME corporates in a bit more detail.   

Since 2008, the debt of EME nonfinancial corporations has tripled in dollar value, 

reaching roughly $27 trillion in the first quarter of 2017.  As a share of GDP, as shown by 

the black line in slide 7, it has nearly doubled, to over 100 percent of GDP.  Chinaâ€™s 

situation is distinct from many other EMEs.  On the one hand, as can be seen by the red 

line, its corporate debt, at 170 percent of GDP now, is much higher than most other 

EMEs and substantially above the level we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis.  On 

the other hand, Chinese corporates are much less exposed to changes in exchange rates 

and global interest rates.   

                                                 
7 Variables used in creating the index include external debt, the current account position, foreign reserves, 
public debt, control of inflation, and bank credit to the private sector.
