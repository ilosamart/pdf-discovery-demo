and other policymakers are making to put an end to the too-big-to-fail problem and thus 

help foster effective competition in financial services.  I also want to speak today about 

the links between your institutions and mine.  The Federal Reserve has always had a 

special relationship with community banks.  As we turn from crisis management to 

supporting the economic recovery, that relationship will become more important than 

ever. 

Toward a More Competitive, Efficient, and Innovative Financial System 

The United States has a financial system that is remarkably multifaceted and 

diverse.  Some countries rely heavily on a few large banks to provide credit and financial 

services; our system, in contrast, includes financial institutions of all sizes, with a wide 

range of charters and missions.  We also rely more than any other country on an array of 

specialized financial markets to allocate credit and help diversify risks.  Our system is 

complex, but I think that for the most part its variety is an important strength.  We have 

many, many ways to connect borrowers and savers in the United States, and directing 

saving to the most productive channels is an essential prerequisite to a successful 

economy. 

 That said, for the financial system to do its job well, it must be an impartial and 

efficient arbiter of credit flows.  In a market economy, that result is best achieved through 

open competition on a level playing field, a framework that provides choices to 

consumers and borrowers and gives the most innovative and efficient firms the chance to 

succeed and grow.  Unfortunately, our financial system today falls substantially short of 

that competitive ideal.
