financial contracts--including derivatives and repo agreements--to guard against the mass 

unwinding of those contracts during the resolution of a GSIB.6  The proposed restrictions 

are a key step toward GSIB resolvability because the rapid unwinding of a GSIB’s 

qualified financial contracts could destabilize the financial system by causing asset fire 

sales and toppling other firms. 

Acting in conjunction with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board has also sought 

to increase GSIB resolvability through its review of the firms’ living wills.  In April this 

year, the Board and the FDIC announced the results of their review of the eight U.S. 

GSIBs’ 2015 resolution plans, which evaluated the plans based on the firms’ capital, 

liquidity, governance mechanisms, operational capabilities, legal entity rationalization, 

derivatives and trading activities, and responsiveness to prior agency feedback.7 

The agencies found that five of the GSIBs’ plans fell short of the Dodd-Frank 

Act’s standard and required those firms to fix the deficiencies in their plans by October of 

this year or potentially face more stringent prudential requirements.  The agencies also 

identified less-severe shortcomings in the plans of all eight GSIBs, which the GSIBs are 

expected to address in their next round of resolution plan submissions, due in July 2017.  

The deficiencies and shortcomings identified by the agencies touched on most of the 

categories I have just listed, especially liquidity, governance mechanisms, operational 

capabilities, and legal entity rationalization.
