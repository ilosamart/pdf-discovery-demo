round of stress testing of the largest bank holding companies, to be completed early this 

month, examines whether the largest banking firms have sufficient capital to come 

through a seriously adverse economic downturn and still have the capacity to perform 

their roles as providers of credit.  In a related exercise, we are also asking banks to stress-

test the adequacy of their capital in the face of a hypothetical sharp upward shift in the 

term structure of interest rates. 

Third, our approach to communicating and implementing monetary policy 

provides the Federal Reserve with new tools that could potentially be used to mitigate the 

risk of sharp increases in interest rates.  In 1994--the period discussed earlier in which 

sharp increases in interest rates strained financial markets--the FOMC’s communication 

tools were very limited; indeed, it had just begun issuing public statements following 

policy moves.  By contrast, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has provided a great deal 

of additional information about its expectations for the path of the economy and the 

stance of monetary policy.  Most recently, as I mentioned, the FOMC announced 

unemployment and inflation thresholds characterizing conditions that will guide the 

timing of the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate.  Further, the FOMC 

stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is likely to remain 

appropriate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends.  By 

providing greater clarity concerning the likely course of the federal funds rate, FOMC 

communication should both make policy more effective and reduce the risk that market 

misperceptions of the Committee’s intentions would lead to unnecessary interest rate 

volatility.
