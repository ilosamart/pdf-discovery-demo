literature by academics such as Markus Brunnermeier, Gary Gorton, Perry Mehrling, Andrew 

Metrick, Hyun Song Shin, Andrei Shleifer, and Jean Tirole,24 although differing in some 

important specifics, all paint a picture of a financial system prone to instability for reasons in 

addition to, and quite independent of, classic too-big-to-fail concerns.  Their various analyses 

suggest the possibility of destabilization even in a financial world with no dominant firms, but 

many medium-sized entities. 

 This perspective focuses on one of the most important effects of the progressive 

integration of capital markets and conventional lending activities, something now popularly 

known as “shadow banking” – that is, credit intermediation involving maturity transformation, 

and often significant leverage, that is wholly or partly outside the traditional banking system.  

This intermediation depends critically on the creation of instruments that are thought to be safe 

and liquid, and as such, “cash equivalents” similar in function to insured deposits in the 

commercial banking system.  These instruments, much desired by certain kinds of investors, are 

short-term liabilities of the shadow banking intermediary, which backs them with a portfolio of 

longer-term assets that, because of some combination of high diversification and low-default 

risk, are expected to perform very well under nearly all circumstances, but carry significant tail 

risks that are not fully appreciated ex ante.     

 A now notorious example of a shadow banking intermediary was a special investment 

vehicle (SIV) sponsored by a financial firm.  A SIV bought tranches of securitized mortgages 

with AAA credit ratings, which it financed through the issuance of short-term instruments that 

were regarded by investors as essentially a cash equivalent.  But during the crisis, when tail risk 

materialized, investors came to understand that even the upper tranches of subprime and other 

mortgage securitizations might not be spared significant losses because of the dramatic fall in
