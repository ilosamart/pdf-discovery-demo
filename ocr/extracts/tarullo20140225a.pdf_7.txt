rates, may be incentivizing financial market actors to take on additional risks to boost 

margins, thereby contributing to unsustainable increases in asset prices and a consequent 

buildup of systemic vulnerabilities.  Indeed, in the years preceding the crisis, a few 

prescient observers swam against the tide of conventional wisdom to argue that a 

sustained period of low rates was inducing investors to “reach for yield” and thereby 

endangering the financial system.3 

The incentive to reach for yield can be a real and significant concern in some 

circumstances.  A low rate environment tends to squeeze the profitability of financial 

intermediaries of many types as they reinvest in assets with lower yields.4  Because these 

institutions can be driven by a variety of agency and accounting concerns to target high 

returns or place undue weight on the short-term performance of their portfolios, the 

pressure to maintain current yield can create incentives for these firms to take on 

excessive risk.5  This risk can manifest itself as excessive leverage, or greater credit or 

duration risk in portfolio choices, with the potential for large losses under adverse 

conditions.  In addition, to the extent that investors crowd into similar asset classes, low 

rates can potentially inflate a speculative bubble, the ultimate unwinding of which could 

have negative consequences for economic activity. 

                                                 
3 One of the most notable such expositions was provided in 2005 at the Jackson Hole symposium by 
Raghuram Rajan, a distinguished academic economist who has since become Governor of the Reserve 
Bank of India (see Raghuram G. Rajan (2005), “Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?” 
paper presented at “The Greenspan Era:  Lessons for the Future,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 25-27,

4 Low interest rates depress net interest margins for banks as the value of their deposit franchise falls, and 
they boost the present value of liabilities for insurers and pension funds while reducing their prospective 
returns from fixed-income investments. 
5 For instance, inflows into mutual funds, a key determinant of an investment manager’s compensation, are 
strongly positively correlated with recent fund performance.  For example, see Judith Chevalier and Glenn 
Ellison (1997), “Risk Taking by Mutual Funds as a Response to Incentives,” Journal of Political Economy, 
vol. 105 (6), pp. 1167-200.
