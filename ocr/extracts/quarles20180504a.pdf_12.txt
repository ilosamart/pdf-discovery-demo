that generally reflects the pace of expansion of economic activity in nominal terms.  

Other nonreserve liabilities have also grown since the crisis, including the Treasury 

Department’s account at the Fed, known as the Treasury’s General Account.  Recent 

growth in such items means that the longer-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet will be 

noticeably larger than before the crisis regardless of the volume of reserve balances that 

might ultimately prevail.   

Putting the various pieces together, figure 3 illustrates how the overall size of the 

Fed’s balance sheet may evolve.  Given the uncertainties I have described, I have chosen 

to show three different scenarios, drawn from the most recent annual report released by 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was published last month.13  These 

scenarios highlight the degree to which the longer-run size of the Fed’s domestic 

securities portfolio--also known as the System Open Market Account, or SOMA, which 

accounts for the vast majority of the Fed’s assets--will be affected by choices about the 

future level of reserve balances and the evolution of nonreserve liabilities.  The 

assumptions underlying the scenarios are based on the distribution of responses from the 

surveys I described earlier, as those surveys also asked respondents to forecast the likely 

longer-run levels of several liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet other than reserves.  

The “median” scenario, represented by the red (middle) line in the figure, is based on the 

50th percentile of survey responses, while the “larger” and the “smaller” scenarios, 

denoted by the gold dashed (top) and blue dotted (bottom) lines, are based on the 

75th and 25th percentiles, respectively.
