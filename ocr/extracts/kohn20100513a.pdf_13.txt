balances to the banking system--a huge increase from the normal level of about $15 billion over 

the few years just prior to the crisis. 

   How effective have these various steps been in reducing the cost of borrowing for 

households and businesses while maintaining price stability?  Central banks have lots of 

experience guiding the economy by adjusting short-term policy rates and influencing 

expectations about future policy rates, and the underlying theory and practice behind those 

actions are well understood.  The reduction of the policy interest rate to close to zero led to a 

sharp decline in the cost of funds in money markets--especially when combined with the creation 

of emergency liquidity facilities and the establishment of liquidity swaps with foreign central 

banks that greatly narrowed spreads in short-term funding markets.  Event studies at the time of 

the release of the March 2009 FOMC statement (when the “extended period” language was first 

introduced) indicate that the expected path of policy rates moved down substantially.  Market 

participants reportedly interpreted the characterization of the federal funds rate as likely to 

remain low for “an extended period” as stronger than the “for some time” language included in 

the previous statement.5

By contrast, the economic effects of purchasing large volumes of longer-term assets, and 

the accompanying expansion of the reserve base in the banking system, are much less well 

understood.  One question involves the direct effects of the large-scale asset purchases 

  Nonetheless, the extended period language has not prevented interest 

rates and market participants’ expectations about the timing of exit from the zero interest rate 

policy from reacting to incoming economic information, though each repetition of the extended 

period language has appeared to affect those expectations a little.   

                                                           
5 A clear-cut assessment of the effects of the introduction of the “extended period” language, however, is 
complicated by the fact that the FOMC also decided at the March 2009 meeting to increase the size of the Federal 
Reserve balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency MBS, bringing its total 
purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion, and to increase its purchases of agency debt by up to $100 billion 
to a total of up to $200 billion.
