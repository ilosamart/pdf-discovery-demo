More fundamentally, however, a central counterpartyâ€™s ability to manage risk is 

determined by its ability to accurately value the contracts it clears on a frequent and 

possibly real-time basis and to rapidly replace open positions at or near current prices in 

the event that a clearing member defaults.  Requiring less-liquid and highly customized 

derivatives to be cleared would likely increase systemic risks, as clearinghouses would 

not be well positioned to manage the complex risks of such derivatives.  The G-20 

mandate explicitly recognizes this important limitation on the benefits of central clearing, 

and it requires only that standardized OTC derivatives be centrally cleared.  Accordingly, 

the G-20 commitment has effectively managed the costs and benefits of central clearing 

in establishing a global clearing mandate.  

However, limiting central clearing to standardized derivatives means that a 

significant proportion of less standardized OTC contracts will continue to be written on a 

bilateral basis without the benefit of a central counterparty.  The International Monetary 

Fund estimates that one-third of interest rate and credit derivatives and two-thirds of 

equity, commodity, and foreign exchange derivatives will not be suited to standardization 

and will remain non-centrally cleared.

  As more-standardized derivatives migrate to 

central clearing, it will be important to remain vigilant in managing the risks from non-

centrally-cleared derivatives exposures.

  One important tool for managing the systemic 

risks of non-centrally-cleared derivatives is margin requirements.

  Globally, regulators 

have been working on standards for margin requirements on non-centrally-cleared

 For example, participants and their supervisors will need to closely monitor the risk positions flowing 

from non-centrally-cleared derivatives to ensure that removing centrally cleared derivatives from existing 

bilateral netting arrangements will not inadvertently lead to significant growth in risk concentrations from 

non-centrally-cleared derivatives.

 In addition to margin standards, enhanced capital standards prescribed by Basel 2.5 will serve as an 

important tool for managing systemic risk.  See Bank for International Settlements (2009).
