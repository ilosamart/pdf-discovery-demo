It is a pleasure to address the Manhattan Institute’s Shadow Open Market 

Committee (SOMC) today.1  The SOMC has long served as an important forum for 

debate regarding the appropriate stance of monetary policy--debates that have often 

brought alternative perspectives to the challenges facing the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) in the pursuit of its dual mandate of maximum employment and 

stable prices.  As Allan Meltzer wrote about his and Karl Brunner’s founding of the 

SOMC, “Our objective at the time and after was not just to complain about the results of 

policy actions. . . .  We hoped also to improve policy discussion.”2 

This afternoon, I will briefly remark on the economic outlook and the current 

stance of monetary policy, and I would then like to devote some time to a discussion of 

the approach the Federal Reserve has taken on the setting of the countercyclical capital 

buffer (CCyB) and why I see a setting of 0 percent, as recently affirmed by the Board, as 

the current appropriate setting for the CCyB.  Also, I will review some of the 

international experience with the CCyB.  Given that the CCyB is a relatively new 

element of our regulatory toolkit, the international experience has the potential to provide 

useful information on how the CCyB can be made most effective.   

The Economic Outlook 

But first, let me turn to the economic outlook.  At last week’s meeting, the FOMC 

left the policy rate unchanged and reiterated its patient approach toward future policy 

adjustments.3  I supported this decision.  It is prudent at this point to watch the evolution
