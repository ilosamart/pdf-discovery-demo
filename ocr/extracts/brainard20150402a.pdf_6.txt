option for students--saw some of the steepest rises in tuition as a result of state and local 

budget pressures due to the recession (and possibly reductions in quality in many cases).9  

Thirty-seven states have cut per-student funding for higher education more than 

20 percent since the 2007-08 academic year, when the recession began.  Since the outset 

of the recession, the annual published tuition at four-year public colleges increased 

24 percent, after adjusting for inflation, during a period when real median incomes 

declined 8 percent.10   

This confluence of higher enrollments, higher tuitions, reduced family resources, 

and uneven job prospects has caused outstanding student loan balances to more than 

double since the start of the Great Recession.11  Moreover, this sharp rise in debt burdens 

is unevenly distributed across the population, with students from socioeconomically 

disadvantaged backgrounds disproportionately likely to use debt to finance education.  In 

2012, 79 percent of bachelorâ€™s degree recipients whose parents made under $30,000 

incurred educational debt, compared with 55 percent of those whose parents had income

10  The change in public tuition is for tuition and fees, excluding room and board, and is from the National 
Center for Education Statistics website at 
http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp?current=yes.  Published tuition rates do not 
reflect what students actually pay after financial aid and other assistance.  The trend in real median income 
comes from Carmen DeNavas-Walt and Bernadette D. Proctor (2014), Income and Poverty in the United 
States:  2013 (Washington:  United States Census Bureau),

11 The total amount of outstanding student debt, $1.2 trillion in 2014, is a reflection of both the high cost 
and the substantial rise in the number of students borrowing to go to school--some 41.5 million, compared 
with 22 million in 2004.
