1951, which ensured the separation of monetary and fiscal policy.2 These changes made our 

economy and our country stronger, because they improved the Federal Reserve’s ability to 

accomplish the mission Congress assigned it.  

Throughout this evolution, a key principle has been that accountability allows the Federal 

Reserve to be independent--that we are subject to challenge, to counterargument, and to the 

emergence of new evidence and ideas. For our work to remain legitimate, the public must be able 

to see, understand, and engage with our efforts; to reaffirm their support when we have earned it; 

and to offer informed guidance on when to change course. 

 Accountability is only one reason the Federal Reserve relies on public outreach and 

participation. We also rely on participation for our effectiveness, because the best ideas in 

finance and economics can, and often do, come from a wide variety of sources. Agencies like the 

Federal Reserve are a collection of expertise--informed by experience and positioned to turn a 

broad range of information into policy. But we are not, and cannot be, a monopoly on insight or 

wisdom.  

 The Federal Reserve recognizes these limits, and the need to invite new ideas, through a 

variety of initiatives. We seek out a qualified, diverse workforce, and foster an inclusive 

workplace.3 We meet frequently with a range of advisory councils, drawing on expertise in 

banking, modeling, and consumer and community finance.4 We have increased transparency 

around our policy process and issued new reports on financial stability and banking supervision
