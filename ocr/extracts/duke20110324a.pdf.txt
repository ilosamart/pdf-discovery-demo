It is an honor to be invited to deliver the annual Sandridge lecture to the Virginia 

Association of Economists.  This series has a long history of important discussions, including the 

now-famous global savings glut speech by then-Governor Ben Bernanke in 2005.  I confess to 

being quite intimidated by this illustrious history, but I hope to heighten interest in my own 

contribution by offering you something prized by economists everywhere--fresh data.  I am 

going to draw on preliminary data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances 

(SCF) to talk about the impact of the financial crisis on the wealth of consumers and small 

business owners.   

As the recent financial crisis unfolded, I kept coming back to two questions that seemed 

central to understanding the way consumers and small businesses might respond to changes in 

their own circumstances during the crisis and, importantly, how their attitudes toward spending 

and investing might change going forward.   

The first question had to do with the relationship between household wealth and the 

saving rate.  And as a baby boomer myself, I wondered whether the relationship between wealth 

and savings might be especially important as the baby boomers faced a change in wealth just as 

most were planning to retire.  So I am going to talk first about how changes in wealth impacted 

the spending plans and risk tolerance of consumers closest to retirement.   

The other question that continually arises is whether the sharp reduction in small business 

credit was due to changes in the supply of credit, demand for credit, or creditworthiness of 

potential borrowers.  While the SCF data do not offer any definitive answers, they do give some 

previously unavailable insight into the role of creditworthiness, if we use changes in wealth as 

proxies for changes in creditworthiness.

I want to apologize in advance.  I found that the rich data set offered some occasionally 

surprising insights into both of these questions, and I was unable to choose between the two 

topics.  The result is a somewhat overpacked discussion.  Despite that, I warn you: These results 

are the tip of a very large iceberg and may spur more questions than answers in your minds.   

The Survey of Consumer Finances 

As some of you may know, the SCF is the premier source of microlevel information on 

the finances of American families.  The survey is normally conducted every three years by 

selecting a new sample of consumers willing to provide detailed responses to questions about 

their personal finances.  Because aggregate data consistently indicated that the crisis was having 

severe negative effects on households, the Federal Reserve thought a follow-up survey of 2007 

survey participants would offer a unique opportunity to understand the impact of the financial 

crisis on individual families and the resulting changes in the financial decisions and outlooks of 

those families.  Although we are only beginning to mine the data, I believe the richer 

understanding of individual circumstances provided by the data set will prove invaluable in its 

ability to help us understand how consumers are approaching a number of important decisions, 

such as spending, saving, and wealth accumulation. 

In 2009, we launched a program to conduct follow-up interviews with participants in our 

2007 SCF to update their information.  As always, consumers’ willingness to share their personal 

data in the interest of better public policy is a critical requirement for these surveys, and 

participants’ privacy is strictly guarded.  We are extremely grateful for the public-spirited people 

who dredge through their financial statements, pension accounts, credit card bills, and tax returns 

to give us the most accurate information possible.  And we are particularly grateful to the nearly 

90 percent of the participants in the 2007 survey who did so a second time in 2009.

The panel interviews were concluded in early 2010, and Board staff spent most of the rest 

of the year preparing this complex set of data for analysis.  Earlier today, the Federal Reserve 

published a research paper providing an overview of the data, and further results are expected to 

follow.1   

Changes in Household Wealth 

The shocks to household wealth associated with the most recent recession were 

extraordinary by any measure.  According to the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds accounts, 

household net worth peaked in the second quarter of 2007 and then fell approximately 28 percent 

during the next two years (figure 1).   

  The initial shocks to housing and to financial assets wiped out most of the wealth gains 

realized since the aftermath of the tech crash in 2001.  There has been some recovery in wealth 

since the trough, but since early 2010 it has remained fairly flat.   

The personal saving rate, which had been trending downward before the recession, 

jumped during the crisis as spending retreated (figure 2).  Traditional macroeconomic analysis 

would attribute at least some of the increase in the saving rate and corresponding drag in the 

recovery of consumer spending to diminished household wealth.  That direct effect might be 

compounded if the wealth decline also affected consumers’ confidence and expectations, which 

could affect families’ future decisions.  For example, workers on the cusp of retirement might 

need to work longer than they had planned and business owners might be unable or unwilling to 

leverage their personal assets to fund or expand their businesses.  In addition, if attitudes toward

risk have shifted, households might make different decisions about spending, or about saving, 

than they have in the past. 

Diversity of Wealth Outcomes in 2009 

The overall pattern of wealth decline, however, masks the stark differences in outcomes 

for individual families.  To put these wealth changes in perspective, it is useful to look at them 

relative to a measure of the scale of families’ circumstances and, thus, to a possible link with 

spending.  Income is one such possible measure, but it can be quite “noisy” because income may 

be affected by a variety of transitory factors.   

In the SCF, we include a measure of the level of income that families consider their usual 

income.2  Taking this measure as a scaling device for wealth changes, we see that 43 percent of 

families saw a wealth decline equal to or more than six months of their usual income (figure 3).  

Almost a third saw a loss greater than an entire year of their usual income (not shown).  

However, more than a fifth of families saw a gain in wealth that was greater than six months of 

their usual income.   

To put these changes in wealth in perspective, it is useful to consider the level of 

household wealth relative to normal income before the crisis.  In 2007, more than one-quarter of 

families had total wealth equal to or less than six months of their usual income, so a change of 

this magnitude would be quite significant for those families (figure 4).  In contrast, for nearly 

one-third of households, their wealth was more than five times their usual income.    

At the level of individual families, changes in wealth appear to have been driven 

primarily by changes in asset valuation, not by changes in ownership (that is, by changes in 

portfolio composition).  Comparisons of patterns of ownership in 2007 and 2009 do show some 

                                                 
2 For all families, median 2007 normal income was $53,000 (mean of $84,000).  Taken over all households, the 
differences in usual and current income average out to a small amount.

differences, but the dominant pattern across families is no change in portfolio holdings.  

Moreover, responses to a question we asked about changes in portfolio composition over the 

crisis indicate that 54 percent of all families made no change at all in their portfolios over the 

period covered by the panel SCF.  This is perhaps surprising, given the large change in asset 

values that occurred during the crisis. 

Preretirement Age Group 

In this dataset, the preretirement group includes families whose household head was 

between 50 and 61 years old in 2007.  This age group traditionally has a particularly strong effect 

on the overall economy because the preretirement years are typically characterized by peak 

earnings, peak saving, and peak spending.  The baby-boom generation, by virtue of its sheer size, 

has had an outsized influence on the economy as it has entered every stage in the life cycle, and 

its magnification of the preretirement effect is no exception.  In addition, in 2007, this group held 

more than one-third of all household net worth.  Because wealth is a key driver of household 

decisions about spending, saving, and investment, we might expect behavioral shifts in response 

to wealth changes to have significant effects on the performance of the U.S. economy.  We will 

look at changes from 2007 to 2009 in the attitudes of this group and how those changes might 

vary depending on whether they experienced gains or losses in wealth during the crisis.   

I chose the preretirement group to examine because of its significant size and wealth, but 

also because this seemed like the group most likely to be affected by changes in wealth and to 

feel the need to change behavior as a result of any such changes.  The preretirement group must 

accumulate assets to sustain itself through retirement, continue working, or rely on their children 

or the government for support.  Given their vast numbers, the adjustments they make can affect 


- 6 - 
 

the course of the economy.  So it is informative to look at how the finances of this group were 

impacted by the crisis and how they have changed their outlook as a result. 

As was the case for families overall, experiences varied widely.  The share of families in 

the 50-to-61 age group that saw a substantial increase in their net worth--more than six months of 

their usual income--was nearly the same as for families overall (figure 5).  But 49 percent of the 

age group saw a decline of more than six months of their usual income, compared with 42 

percent of families overall. 

Implications for Behavior 

It would be reasonable to expect households’ plans and attitudes to vary based on the 

individual wealth outcomes they experienced.  But in comparing responses from boomer families 

that lost wealth to those that gained wealth, we found remarkably similar answers.   

In 2009, more than two-thirds of the preretirement group reported that their expected 

retirement age was at least a year later than what they reported in 2007.  The share of families 

expecting to extend their working life was very similar regardless of their change in wealth.  This 

likely suggests increased uncertainty about the future, no matter what their experience during the 

financial crisis, as also suggested by other results in the survey.  

In terms of asset management, more than half of the preretirement families reported that 

they plan to make no changes at all in the next few years; this result holds across all wealth-

change groups.  But among those who do expect to make changes, increased savings was the 

most commonly reported goal. 

Boomer families’ reported willingness to take on financial risk also changed over the 

panel period.  Regardless of the change in their wealth, these families were more likely to report 

being more unwilling to take financial risk in 2009 than in 2007 (figure 6).  


- 7 - 
 

This sense of increased caution is reinforced by the answers to questions the survey posed 

to families about the amount of money they think they need to cope with emergencies and other 

unexpected events.  The median value of this measure of desired precautionary savings increased 

substantially from 2007 to 2009 for the preretirement groups that experienced large changes in 

wealth, regardless of whether the change was a gain or a loss, and was virtually unchanged for 

others (figure 7).  Furthermore, the largest percentage increase was for families that experienced 

wealth gains. 

The large changes in asset prices over the period may have had an effect on the 

willingness of the families in this age group to consume out of gains to assets or to reduce 

spending in response to asset losses.3  The survey responses suggest that the large drop in asset 

prices over the period may have increased boomer families’ sensitivity to future losses more than 

it affected their sensitivity to future gains.  In other words, it made them more cautious. 

In the boom years leading up to the crisis, many economists believed that increases in 

wealth, especially increases in home equity, helped fuel consumer spending.  However, fewer 

than 30 percent of boomer families reported in 2007 that they would be willing to spend out of 

any increase in asset values.  In 2009, that willingness declined for boomer families that 

experienced losses as well as for boomer families that experienced only small gains.   

Somewhat counterintuitively, boomer families that experienced significant gains in their net 

worth from 2007 to 2009--gains greater than the equivalent of six months of income--also 

remained largely unwilling to spend out of increases in asset values.  In fact, they were among 

the least willing in 2007 and they remained among the least willing two years later.  Thus, 

                                                 
3 The SCF asks whether families agree or disagree (on a five-point scale) with the following statements: “When the 
things that I own increase (decrease) in value, I am more (less) likely to spend money.”  Note that the “spend less” 
version of the question was only asked in 2009. 


- 8 - 
 

boomer families remained cautious, or grew more cautious, about spending out of their asset 

gains--regardless of whether they experienced significant losses during the crisis (figure 8).  

However, the response of spending plans to the prospect of asset losses appears to be 

stronger than the response to the prospect of asset gains.  Every wealth-change group reported 

being more than twice as likely to decrease spending if asset values declined than they were to 

increase spending if asset values rose (figure 9).  All of this evidence may help explain the sharp 

drop in consumer spending as household wealth declined and the continued sluggishness of 

consumer spending even as asset values have recovered.  This asymmetry in responses holds 

over all age groups as well. 

The varied change in wealth for preretirement families, taken together with the changes 

in retirement plans, risk attitudes, and willingness to spend in response to changes in wealth, 

imply that some of the effects of recent economic turmoil may result in a longer period of 

economic adjustment than has been the case in past recessions, as fundamental attitudes appear 

to have shifted.   

I think the higher level of caution displayed by all households in the group, regardless of 

whether the change in their individual circumstances was positive or negative, is especially 

interesting.  This indicates that changes in risk appetite result from observations of changes to the 

circumstances of others as much as to changes in one’s own circumstances.  Responses regarding 

attitudes toward modifying spending as asset values rise and fall suggest that the relationship 

between the saving rate and household wealth might be even more persistent than in the past.  

Such an impact would be further magnified if changes in wealth also impacted borrowing 

patterns and credit approval.   


- 9 - 
 

To look at credit indicators, I decided to focus on business owners in order to examine 

the impact of changes in wealth on access to business as well as consumer credit. 

Business Owners 

The preretirement and business owner groups I have chosen are not mutually exclusive.  

Indeed, there is quite a bit of overlap.  More than 30 percent of small business owners in 2007 

were part of the preretirement group, and they tended to be among the wealthier members of that 

group.  In fact, the business owner group held nearly half of all household wealth in 2007.   

Small businesses employ roughly half of private-sector workers, they fill critical niches 

throughout the economy, and they are often seen as sources of innovation.  For many, the ability 

to leverage personal assets is a critical factor in developing their businesses.   

Concern over credit availability for small businesses has appropriately been a recurring 

worry throughout the crisis, but information about the intersection between business 

performance, personal finances, and credit has been hard to find.  While the data are still not 

definitive, the panel survey allows us to look at supply, demand, and assessment of 

creditworthiness from the borrowers’ point of view. 

Although the SCF is focused on families, not businesses, it does collect substantial 

information on the closely held businesses families own.  The survey clearly shows a high degree 

of interdependence of personal and business finances for many families with businesses.  For 

example, families make loan guarantees for their businesses using personal assets as collateral, 

and loans between business owners and their businesses are common in both directions.  

According to the most recently available data from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Business 

Owners, 6 in 10 small business owners use personal savings or assets to finance or expand their 

businesses.   


- 10 - 
 

The spread of gains and losses from 2007 to 2009 was sharper for business owners than 

for the population overall (figure 10).  Fifty-seven percent of business owners saw substantial 

losses in their net worth relative to their usual income, compared with 43 percent of the overall 

population; but the percentage of business owners who saw large wealth gains relative to their 

income was also larger than for the overall population.   

The industry in which the business operated had a significant impact on whether the 

business owner gained or lost wealth.  Families with businesses primarily engaged in mining or 

construction--among small businesses in the survey, this was overwhelmingly construction-

related businesses--were the most likely to see a substantial decline in net worth (figure 11).  In 

contrast, families with a wholesale or retail business were more likely to see a substantial gain.  

Those involved in utilities, transportation, and services--in the survey, this was predominantly 

services--saw the largest gains and the largest losses, but losses exceeded gains for the group.  

Only 82 percent of the consumers who reported owning a business in 2007 also reported 

owning a business in 2009.  And some of those who remained business owners may have scaled 

back their operations while awaiting recovery.  We do not have the detail necessary to assess the 

importance of reduced operations directly, but we have some suggestive evidence.  For 

businesses that were in operation in both 2007 and 2009, we see decreased median and mean 

business incomes for owners who saw their wealth fall and the reverse for owners whose wealth 

rose.  

Some of the decrease in activity may be driven by a decline in demand for services, but 

some may come from credit constraints.  For a variety of reasons, we cannot look directly at 

changes in credit availability for business owners and their businesses, but we can look at two 

indicators for the owners who had a continuing business in 2009. 


- 11 - 
 

Some business owners use proceeds from personal loans for business purposes or use 

personal assets to secure business loans.  In other cases, the business itself may apply on its own.  

If the business is a sole proprietorship, there is no legal distinction between business and 

personal borrowing, but business owners still may view their personal and business debt 

separately.   

The 2009 SCF panel interview asked participants to report separately whether they had 

applied for personal and business loans during the two-year period.  If they had, it asked whether 

they had been turned down for a loan.  The survey also asked whether they had wanted to borrow 

for personal or business purposes but had been so convinced they would be turned down that 

they did not apply. 

The data show a substantial level of personal and business applications both for owners 

whose wealth rose and for those whose wealth fell over the period of the SCF panel.  The level 

of personal applications was slightly higher for those whose wealth increased over the period, 

and their applications were more likely to have been approved (or they were less likely to have 

believed they would have been denied) (figure 12).   

The pattern of personal loan denial rates is consistent with changes in individual 

circumstances.  The denials could also indicate that business difficulties have a significant 

influence on the ability of business owners to borrow for personal reasons.  Indeed, business 

owners have much more difficulty documenting their income than do wage-earners.  The 

combination of weaker earnings, lower net worth, and renewed focus on income verification 

could have made it particularly difficult for business owners who lost wealth to refinance 

mortgages or purchase homes. 


- 12 - 
 

Business owners whose wealth rose were also more likely to have applied for business 

credit, but the rate of denial and for those who feared denial was nearly the same for business 

owners who gained wealth as for those who lost wealth (figure 13).  In this case, the pattern of 

denial does not match the variations in individual circumstances.  Unfortunately, we don’t have 

any history for this series so it is impossible to tell how it has changed over time.  But the 

striking similarity in credit approval rates for business loan requests by business owners who 

gained and those who lost wealth would seem to support anecdotal reports at the time--that 

business credit was hard to obtain even for good borrowers.  

Conclusion 

The results I have discussed today are among the first details to emerge from our panel 

study of changes in family finances over the financial crisis.  The data show significant 

heterogeneity in the wealth changes that families experienced during the period of the financial 

crisis between 2007 and 2009.  Any consequent macroeconomic wealth effect depends on the 

distribution of gains and losses and the propensities of the families that experienced those 

changes.   

Research remains to be done on how all those factors come together, but the data offer at 

least a suggestion of what may emerge.  Among the preretirement age group, those who gained 

and those who lost wealth during the financial crisis generally appear to act as if they had lost 

wealth--in that there are signs of delayed retirement and greater desire to save and to avoid risk.  

In addition, there appears to be an asymmetric reaction to wealth shocks that could be a factor in 

the slow recovery of spending.   

Business owners had much wider changes in wealth than those reported for the general 

population and the changes were related to the conditions of the industries in which the 


- 13 - 
 

businesses operated.  Business owners who had increases in wealth were more likely to apply for 

personal and business credit.  Although business owners who experienced decreases in wealth 

were more likely to have been denied or to fear denial of personal credit, actual denial rates for 

business credit were about the same regardless of wealth outcomes.  Moreover, the difference in 

credit approval rates between personal and business applications suggests that differences other 

than the financial circumstances of the applicant were at work in business credit markets.   

It is still too early to determine how consumer spending patterns will ultimately be altered 

as a result of changes in circumstances wrought by the financial crisis.  But as events unfold, the 

SCF data will be an invaluable resource as we try to understand these new patterns.
