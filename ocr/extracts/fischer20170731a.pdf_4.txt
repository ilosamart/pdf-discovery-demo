r*.  Knut Wicksell, in his 1898 treatise Interest and Prices, wrote, “There is a certain 

level of the average rate of interest which is such that the general level of prices has no 

tendency to move either upwards or downwards.”2  In recent years, the coincidence of 

low inflation and low interest rates suggests that the natural rate of interest is likely very 

low today. 

Wicksell was clearly referring to the natural rate as the real interest rate when the 

economy is at full employment.  The widely cited methodology of my Federal Reserve 

colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams, attempts to gauge the natural rate in the 

longer run after various shorter-term influences, including the business cycle, have 

played out.  In a recent update of their analysis, they find that the natural rate of interest 

has declined about 150 basis points in the United States since the financial crisis and is 

currently about 50 basis points.  We must remember, however, that r* is a function and 

not a constant, and its estimation is subject to a number of assumptions, the modification 

of which can lead to a wide range of estimates.3 

In an extension of this analysis, shown in figure 3, Laubach, Williams, and 

Kathryn Holston, also a Federal Reserve colleague, show that the decline in the natural 

rate of interest is a common feature across a number of foreign economies.4  The fall in

and Mertens (2016).  It is important to point out that r* is not an observable variable and that estimates 
generally reflect assumptions about how the economy works and should be modeled.  As such, different 
methodologies or underlying economic models can come up with a wide range of estimates of r*.  Lewis 
and Vazquez-Grande (2017) examine parameter uncertainty and alternative specifications in the estimation 
of the natural rate of interest.  Under some specifications, they find an estimated r* at the end of 2016 of 
close to 2 percent, far higher than the about 0.5 percent reported by the methodology of Holston, Laubach, 
and Williams (forthcoming).
