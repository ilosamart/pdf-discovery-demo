Measure Target Results

Identify and resolve supervisory
and �nancial problems in a timely
manner, working alone or in coop-
eration with other authorities, to
minimize disruptions to the �nan-
cial and payment systems and the
economy more generally

No speci�c target The Federal Reserve is actively reviewing current
prudential standards and supervisory approaches
to incorporate the lessons learned from the recent
�nancial crisis. On the supervisory front, the Fed-
eral Reserve is taking steps to strengthen oversight
and enforcement, including augmenting tradi-
tional microprudential methods of oversight with
a more macroprudential approach that should bet-
ter anticipate and mitigate broader threats to
�nancial stability.
