I am pleased to speak once again at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 

Financial Markets Conference.  This year’s conference covers an interesting mix of 

topics bearing on the vital ongoing global debate on how best to prevent and respond to 

financial crises.

of our financial market infrastructure--namely, clearinghouses for payments, securities, 

and derivatives transactions.  This audience, I know, recognizes the importance of what is 

often called the “plumbing” of the financial system--a set of institutions that very safely

transactions each day.  Because clearinghouses and other parts of the financial 

infrastructure fared relatively well during the crisis--despite moments of significant

put our financial system and economy in dire jeopardy.  Nevertheless, the smooth 

operation and financial soundness of clearinghouses and related institutions are essential 

for financial stability, and we must not take them for granted.

also challenges U.S. regulatory authorities to improve and better coordinate their 

oversight of these institutions.  Moreover, to put into effect the macroprudential or 

systemic approach to regulation and oversight encouraged by the Dodd-Frank Act,
