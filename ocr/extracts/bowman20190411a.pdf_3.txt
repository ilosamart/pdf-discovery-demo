Competition or collaboration?  

Not too long ago commentators were looking at the impact of fintech on community 

banking as a zero-sum game. In fact, many wondered whether fintech firms would put 

community banks out of business.4 Recent surveys show how much the discussion has evolved. 

Rather than fear fintech, more and more community bankers are trying to determine how to 

adjust their businesses to make the best use of new technologies. For example, in the 2018 

Survey of Community Banks by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), small banks 

almost universally agreed that fintech firms are not currently their primary competitor.5 These 

findings are consistent with data from the 2018 Small Business Lending Survey by the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).6 In contrast, almost half of large banks identified fintech 

firms as frequent competitors. The FDIC opined that this was likely because large banks, like 

fintech firms, rely heavily on data and automated technology when making loans. A much lower 

percentage of small banks—only about 10 percent—saw fintech firms as current competitors. As 

I’ll discuss later, it’s likely that the relationship-driven nature of community bank business 

models helps insulate these banks from fintech competitors.

financial industry,” CNBC, February 15, 2019, https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/small-banks-youve-never-heard-
of-quietly-power-the-booming-fintech-industry--.html.  
5 The primary exception was survey responses regarding mortgage lending, where just under 5 percent of 
respondents identified fintech firms as a primary source of competition. See CSBS Community Bank Survey,

Policy Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 3-4, 2018),

potentially due to changes in lending technologies and deregulation of the banking industry).
