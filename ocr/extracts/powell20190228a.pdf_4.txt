meet.2  In addition, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and 

conflicting signals about the near-term outlook.  For instance, growth has slowed in some 

major economies, particularly China and Europe.  Uncertainty is elevated around some 

unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations.  

And financial conditions have tightened since last fall.  While most of the incoming 

domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer 

sentiment have moved lower.  Unexpectedly weak retail sales data for December also 

give reason for caution.  

Given the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the 

crosscurrents I just mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be 

patient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds 

rate may be appropriate to support our dual-mandate objectives.  This common-sense 

risk-management approach has served the Committee well in the past.   

I will turn now from the near-term outlook to the question of how the economy 

will perform over the long haul.   

Longer-Term Challenges and Opportunities 

From 1991 through 2007, the economy expanded annually at about 3 percent, 

similar to the pace for much of second half of the 20th century.  Since 2007, however, 

growth has averaged just 1.6 percent.  If the earlier 3 percent growth had persisted over 

the past 12 years, incomes today would be almost 20 percent higher than they now are.

many as 40 percent of households were unprepared for an emergency expense of as little as $400.  Board of
