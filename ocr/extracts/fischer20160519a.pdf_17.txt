That is not a simple thought, but it is logical--and that insight enables Michael 

to derive a utility or loss function with inflation in it.   

Interestingly, Woodford recognizes that his result is based on several 

approximations (pp. 383-392), but is nonetheless prepared to go ahead.  While 

that choice is to some extent a matter of taste, it is also highly pragmatic--and 

some might say, a reflection of his MIT training, a comment that I would take 

as a compliment.   

5. The importance of the long-term interest rate.  Another key result is that when 

you solve forward the system above, you find, as Woodford notes (p.244), that  

aggregate demand in this model depends upon all expected 

future short real rates, and not simply upon a current ex ante 

short real rate of return; and unless fluctuations in short rates are 

both highly unforecastable and highly transitory, expectations of 

future short rates are more significant than the current short rate  


--and in a footnote he notes that this can also be explained by saying that it is 

the long rate of interest and not the short rate that determines aggregate 

demand in this model. 

6.   What to do at the ZLB, Forward Guidance, The Role of Expectations.  MWIP 

was completed well before the Fed had to contend with the ZLB--zero lower 

bound--which later became the ELB--effective lower bound--even though 

there were discussions in the U.S. economy in 2003 and earlier about what to 

do if the economy were ever to be at the ZLB.15
