been.  The difference is that, with the short-term interest rate nearly at zero, we have 

shifted to tools aimed at reducing longer-term interest rates more directly. 

 Last month, my colleagues and I used both tools--securities purchases and 

communications about our future actions--in a coordinated way to further support the 

recovery and the job market.  Why did we act?  Though the economy has been growing 

since mid-2009 and we expect it to continue to expand, it simply has not been growing 

fast enough recently to make significant progress in bringing down unemployment.  At 

8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of the year 

and is well above normal levels.  While unemployment has been stubbornly high, our 

economy has enjoyed broad price stability for some time, and we expect inflation to 

remain low for the foreseeable future.  So the case seemed clear to most of my colleagues 

that we could do more to assist economic growth and the job market without 

compromising our goal of price stability. 

Specifically, what did we do?  On securities purchases, we announced that we 

would buy mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the government-sponsored 

enterprises at a rate of $40 billion per month.  Those purchases, along with the 

continuation of a previous program involving Treasury securities, mean we are buying 

$85 billion of longer-term securities per month through the end of the year.  We expect 

these purchases to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, including 

mortgage rates.  To underline the Federal Reserveâ€™s commitment to fostering a 

sustainable economic recovery, we said that we would continue securities purchases and 

employ other policy tools until the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a 

context of price stability.
