pose unusually high risks for institutions or, more precisely, for the federal safety net 

provided to insured banks.  

A second approach is to directly regulate more financial products and practices, 

whether or not the firms involved in the transactions are subject to prudential supervision.  

To an extent, this approach is reflected in the House bill and other proposals that would 

require standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be cleared through central 

counterparties or traded on exchanges.  Some proponents favor going beyond this market 

requirement to prohibit or significantly constrain the use of other products or practices. 

A third approach is to attack the bigness problem head-on by limiting the size or 

interconnectedness of financial institutions.  The more muscular forms of this approach 

would break up some existing institutions in a manner somewhat reminiscent of breakups 

of AT&T in 1982 or Standard Oil in 1911 under the antitrust laws.  A somewhat less 

sweeping variant would prevent firms from growing beyond a certain size or in a way 

that would significantly increase their systemic importance, including through 

acquisitions.  The Administration’s recent proposals contain an example of the second 

form, with a cap on the percentage of total financial industry liabilities that could be held 

by any one firm.  The House bill has examples of both forms, as it grants authority to a 

newly created council of financial regulators to dismantle a firm that poses a “grave 

threat” to systemic stability and to individual banking regulators to prevent acquisitions 

that would increase systemic risk. 

Regulatory Reform in Perspective 

Let me now offer a few observations on the overall effort to revamp our financial 

regulatory system.  First, the reform process cannot be judged a success unless it
