A close analysis of the FOMC’s past behavior was a good guide to future policy, 

but it had two shortcomings as a substitute for transparency:  First, it gave an advantage 

to sophisticated players who studied the FOMC’s behavior--something that is arguably 

inappropriate for a government institution.  Second, while a policy rule such as the one 

developed by John Taylor explained the course of the federal funds rate much of the time, 

there were cases when it didn’t and when even the experts failed to correctly anticipate 

the FOMC’s actions.   

The trend toward greater transparency accelerated during the early 2000s.  

Starting in 2000, the FOMC issued information after every meeting about its economic 

outlook.  It also provided an assessment of the balance of risks to the economy and 

whether it was leaning toward increasing or decreasing the federal funds rate in the 

future.  Such information about intentions and expectations for the future, known as 

forward guidance, became crucial in 2003, when the Committee was faced with a 

stubbornly weak recovery from the 2001 recession.  It had cut the federal funds rate to 

the very low level of 1 percent, but unemployment remained elevated, and the FOMC 

sought some further way to stimulate the economy.  In this situation, it told the public 

that it intended to keep the federal funds rate low for longer than might have been 

expected by adding to its statement that “[i]n these circumstances, the Committee 

believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”6  

Let’s pause here and note what this moment represented.  For the first time, the 

Committee was using communication--mere words--as its primary monetary policy tool.  

Until then, it was probably common to think of communication about future policy as
