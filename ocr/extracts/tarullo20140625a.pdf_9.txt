The models are evaluated by a special model validation group made up of experts within the 

Federal Reserve who do not work on the stress tests.  We have also created a Model Validation 

Council made up of outside experts to provide independent views and advice.10 

The third important effect of the supervisory stress tests and CCAR has been to pave the 

way for other horizontal, simultaneous supervisory exercises.  We created the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) in 2010 to implement an approach to supervision 

of systemically important firms that was better coordinated, more data-driven, and more focused 

on the largest institutions as a group.11  While CCAR includes a number of firms that are not in 

the LISCC portfolio, the stress tests and CCAR have been the proving ground for LISCC, and as 

the committee has evolved to administer these programs more efficiently, these exercises have 

shown the way to other horizontal supervisory exercises or assessments.  Some, like the newer 

Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, which focuses on assessing liquidity sufficiency 

and banksâ€™ internal liquidity risk-management practices, are intended to be recurring.  Others are 

ad hoc efforts responsive to more episodic or transitory concerns.   

Fourth, and in some sense an extension of the prior point, CCAR in particular has defined 

an approach toward developing and maintaining better risk management within the banking 

organizations subject to these exercises.  Let me turn now address this topic in somewhat greater 

detail. 

Ensuring Strong Risk Management 

 Here again, the origins of our current program lie in our experience with the SCAP in 

2009, during which we learned a great deal beyond just post-stress loss and capital numbers.  

The horizontal, cross-firm nature of the exercise also allowed us to evaluate and compare the
