The most recent available data show 47 percent of total U.S. exports going to EME 

destinations.  And of course, actions taken by the Federal Reserve influence economic 

conditions abroad.  Because these international effects in turn spill back on the evolution 

of the U.S. economy, we cannot make sensible monetary policy choices without taking 

them into account.  

In this lecture, I would like to emphasize both aspects of our global 

connectedness--spillovers from the United States to foreign economies and the effect of 

foreign economies on the United States.  I will first review the effect of the Fed’s 

monetary policies on the rest of the global economy, particularly the EMEs, which has 

received considerable attention in recent years.  Prior to the spring of 2013, this attention 

was focused on the international spillover of the Fed’s accommodative policies, 

especially our asset purchases.  But beginning last year, the focus has shifted to the 

normalization of our policies, as exemplified by last summer’s “taper tantrum.”3   

Although the effect of the U.S. economy on other countries is of vital importance 

to this audience, I will briefly digress to remind you that developments in other 

economies also can have significant spillovers to the United States, which in turn prompt 

reactions from U.S. policymakers.  For example, in the past few years, the deflationary 

environment in Japan, together with the fallout from the euro-area fiscal crisis, has 

entailed persistent weakness in those economies, which historically have been among our 

most important trading partners, are major recipients of our foreign investments, and 

loom large in the international credit exposures of U.S. banks.  These effects have
