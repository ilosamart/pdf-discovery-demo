participants’ forecasts for the economy under their individual views concerning 

appropriate policy and their longer-run assessments of potential output growth, the 

“normal” unemployment rate, and the most appropriate inflation rate.    

A high priority for the Chairman was to further clarify the FOMC’s interpretation 

of the long-term objectives implied by its dual mandate to promote maximum 

employment and stable prices.  While we had made progress, as I just noted, during the 

years preceding the crisis, the FOMC as a body had never provided an explicit 

description of its policy goals beyond quoting its mandate.  We saw further clarification 

of these objectives as important for the sake of transparency and accountability.  But 

beyond that, an explicit statement of goals had become essential for the Committee to 

achieve its monetary policy objectives in the aftermath of the crisis, including allowing 

heavier reliance than in the past on forward guidance on the future path of policy.   

A particular concern, given that the crisis had ushered in a prolonged period of 

elevated unemployment, was that the weakness in the economy might push inflation well 

below 2 percent, a level that many took to be an implicit target of the FOMC.  There was 

even an ongoing risk that low inflation might turn to deflation and further hamper 

growth.  These challenges led to legitimate questions among forecasters and the public

which it would have specified an objective solely for inflation, without any explicit 

reference to employment.  Such an approach has been adopted by a large number of 

central banks since the 1990s.  While the FOMC had debated adopting an inflation target 

on a number of occasions since the mid-1990s, some Committee members believed that
