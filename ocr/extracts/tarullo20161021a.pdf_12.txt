My third set of questions pertains to the scope and allocation of government authority for 

financial regulation.  With some relatively modest exceptions, authority in the New Deal regime 

was determined based on the distinct regulatory aims established for different kinds of financial 

intermediaries, the oversight of which was assigned to different agencies.  The allocation 

basically followed the Glass-Steagall Act’s separation of commercial and investment banking.  

But, over time, both markets and regulatory change complicated this fairly simple picture:  

markets complicated this as both banks and broker-dealers invented new ways of doing business 

that allowed each to take on risks previously reserved for the other, and regulatory changes saw 

shifts in the relationship of the Federal Reserve’s authority as holding company regulator and 

that of the SEC or Commodity Futures Trading Commission as primary regulator of important 

nonbank holding company subsidiaries. 

The additional regulatory authorities and mandates in the Dodd-Frank Act have created a 

quite different landscape from the pre-crisis regulatory terrain.  Many of these authorities and 

mandates are explicitly tied to financial stability goals--a sharp departure from pre-crisis 

circumstances.  Many must be exercised jointly by two or more agencies--in rulemakings, 

implementation, or both.  And, of course, the Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC--an unusual 

entity in U.S. administrative law. 

Appreciating this new configuration of authorities is important as a positive matter for 

understanding how regulation will be shaped over time and identifying possible remaining gaps 

in regulatory authority.  It is also important as a normative matter in considering whether the 

allocation of authorities proves optimal over time.  Here one would want to look at factors of 

efficacy, expertise, and excessive concentrations of authority, among others.  In this regard, I
