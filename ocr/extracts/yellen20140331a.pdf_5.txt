businesses, who surveys say remain cautious about the strength and durability of the 

recovery.  

The recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans, and it also looks that

higher than it ever got during the 2001 recession.  That is also the case in Chicago and in 

many other cities.  It certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older 

workers who lost long-term jobs, and to African Americans, who are facing a job market 

today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the Great 

Recession.   

In some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession.  The numbers 

of people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a 

year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago.  We

employment.  When employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became
