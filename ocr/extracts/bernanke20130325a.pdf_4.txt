Kingdom in the late 1920s.3  One of Mervyn King’s predecessors as governor of the 

Bank of England, Montagu Norman, who presided over both Britain’s return to the gold 

standard and its subsequent exit, said of the ill-fated choice of parity for the pound:  

“Only God could tell whether it [the value in gold chosen for the pound sterling] was or 

was not the correct figure”; another commentator added, “But of course the Deity may 

not be an Economist.”4  

Another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and 

financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard 

were vulnerable to speculative runs.  Although runs, or in some cases policy decisions, 

effectively took a number of countries off the gold standard in the early 1930s, the 

financial world was shaken to its foundation when the United Kingdom, the unofficial 

center of the global gold standard, was forced by a speculative attack to leave gold in 

September 1931.  Over the next five years, essentially all of the world’s industrial nations 

left the gold standard, either de facto or de jure.  Declines in the value of the departing 

nation’s currency, sometimes very sharp ones, typically followed. 

The uncoordinated abandonment of the gold standard in the early 1930s gave rise 

to the idea of “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies.  According to this analysis, as put forth by 

important contemporary economists like Joan Robinson, exchange rate depreciations 

helped the economy whose currency had weakened by making the country more 

competitive internationally.5  Indeed, the decline in the value of the pound after 1931 was
