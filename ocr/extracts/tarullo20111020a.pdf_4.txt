lower than that of the population as a whole, the rate has doubled since the onset of the 

recession. 

As familiar as the unemployment rate is, both as a measure of economic slack and 

as an indicator of the pain experienced by American households, it does not tell the whole 

story.  About 9 million workers who would like a full-time job can find only part-time 

work.  Millions of others are working at jobs for which they are likely overqualified and 

earning less than in their previous jobs.  Meanwhile, another 6 million people who are not 

officially counted among the unemployed say that they would like a job but have stopped 

looking for one, in many cases because they have become discouraged by the poor state 

of the job market.   

This effect can also be seen in the labor force participation rate, which has 

dropped sharply since 2007.  The proportion of the U.S. population that is employed now 

stands at about 58 percent, the lowest level since 1983.  Finally, more than 6 million 

workers--nearly one-half of all the unemployed--have been jobless for more than six 

months.  The long-term unemployment rate is by far the highest it has been since data on 

the duration of unemployment began to be collected in 1948.  

Even more dispiriting than this snapshot of the employment picture is that there is 

so little momentum toward improvements in labor market conditions.  The level of 

payroll employment fell by nearly 9 million during and just after the recession.  To date, 

only about one-fourth that number of jobs has been restored.  The pace of job growth in 

recent quarters has been barely enough to absorb the increase in the labor force and 

wholly insufficient to produce meaningful declines in unemployment.  The number of
