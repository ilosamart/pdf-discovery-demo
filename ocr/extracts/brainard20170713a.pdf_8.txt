Thus, for a foreign economy that is at the effective lower bound, tightening in the 

home country through balance-sheet policy will be less welcome than through short-term 

rates.  The foreign economy will experience less exchange rate depreciation, and so less 

of a boost to net exports.  In addition, the stimulus to the foreign economy could be 

further diluted to the extent that the balance sheet policy boosted term premiums on its 

long-term bonds and hence tightened financial conditions, although this effect has not 

been built into the simulation model.  By contrast, for a foreign economy that is close to 

potential, adjustment through the balance sheet in the home country will mean less of a 

need for the foreign central bank to respond by tightening policy than under home 

country adjustment through conventional policy. 

So far, we have considered the case of central banks with freely floating exchange 

rates and well-anchored inflation expectations.  What about central banks with managed 

exchange rates or weakly anchored inflation expectations?  To keep the analysis simple, 

let’s assume a foreign central bank aims to completely stabilize its exchange rate vis-à-

vis a core country.  Let’s again consider circumstances in which the core country 

experiences a positive demand shock that calls for policy tightening.  Although the 

pegging economy is likely to experience spillovers under either approach to 

normalization in the core country, the spillovers are likely to be greater when the core 

country tightens through the policy rate.  The tightening in the core country will compel 

the country that is fixing its exchange rate to tighten policy in sync and the core country’s 

currency will rise more against its trading partners with conventional tightening, leading 

to greater effective appreciation of the pegging country’s currency as well.  Although the 

pegging economy will benefit somewhat from the stronger demand of the core country,
