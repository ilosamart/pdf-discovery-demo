work.  It seems clear, based on this experience, that such policies can be effective, and 

that, in their absence, the 2007-09 recession would have been deeper and the current 

recovery would have been slower than has actually occurred. 

As I have discussed today, it is also true that nontraditional policies are relatively 

more difficult to apply, at least given the present state of our knowledge.  Estimates of the 

effects of nontraditional policies on economic activity and inflation are uncertain, and the 

use of nontraditional policies involves costs beyond those generally associated with 

more-standard policies.  Consequently, the bar for the use of nontraditional policies is 

higher than for traditional policies.  In addition, in the present context, nontraditional 

policies share the limitations of monetary policy more generally:  Monetary policy cannot 

achieve by itself what a broader and more balanced set of economic policies might 

achieve; in particular, it cannot neutralize the fiscal and financial risks that the country 

faces.  It certainly cannot fine-tune economic outcomes. 

 As we assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy approaches, though, we 

must not lose sight of the daunting economic challenges that confront our nation.  The 

stagnation of the labor market in particular is a grave concern not only because of the 

enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently 

high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could 

last for many years.   

Over the past five years, the Federal Reserve has acted to support economic 

growth and foster job creation, and it is important to achieve further progress, particularly 

in the labor market.  Taking due account of the uncertainties and limits of its policy tools, 

the Federal Reserve will provide additional policy accommodation as needed to promote
