activities from the viewpoint of the financial system and the economy, may induce a 

financial and economic crisis of the order of magnitude that followed the Lehman 

bankruptcy.    

This is where the moral hazard issue arises.  If the owners of a company are saved by 

official actions in circumstances where the company would otherwise have gone 

bankrupt, it will appear that the government is saving Wall Street at the expense of Main 

Street.  One may argue that saving financial institutions would be good for Main Street.  

The lender of last resort may well be producing a result that is better for everyone in the 

economy when it intervenes in a financial crisis.  But since the counterfactuals are 

difficult to establish, and the moral hazard argument is easy to deploy, the public sector 

may shy away from acting as lender of last resort except in extremis.     

Hence the phenomenon of too big to fail.  If policymakers reach a point at which they 

confront a choice between allowing a large and/or systemically interconnected bank to 

fail without their having reasonable assurance that its essential activities will continue, 

they may well step in to “save” the financial institution.  By “save”, I mean, allow the 

bank to continue to exist and to carry out the functions that are needed to prevent a 

financial crisis.  It is essential to emphasize that this requires a resolution process that 

does not, and should not, preclude actions to ensure that equity and bond holders lose all 

or most of the value of their assets, to an extent that depends on circumstances.  And the 

ability to do this depends on the resolution processes for insolvent financial 

institutions.  In this context, the progress that has been made since 2008 in developing 

effective resolution mechanisms will play a key role in dealing with the too big to fail 

problem by significantly reducing the probability of a bank being too big to fail.
