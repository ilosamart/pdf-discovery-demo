innovative, developing programs that played a significant role in easing financial stress 

and supporting economic activity.  As the global financial system and national economies 

become increasingly complex and interdependent, novel policy challenges will continue

 Third, as was the focus of my remarks two years ago, in addressing financial 

crises, international cooperation can be very helpful; indeed, given the global integration 

of financial markets, such cooperation is essential.  Central bankers worked closely 

together throughout the crisis and continue to do so.  Our frequent contact, whether in 

bilateral discussions or in international meetings, permits us to share our thinking, 

compare analyses, and stay informed of developments around the world.  It also enables 

us to move quickly when shared problems call for swift joint responses, such as the 

coordinated rate cuts and the creation of liquidity swap lines during the crisis.  These 

actions and others weâ€™ve taken over the past few years underscore our resolve to work 

together to address our common economic challenges.
