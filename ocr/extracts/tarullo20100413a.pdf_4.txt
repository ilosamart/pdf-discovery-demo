forms of regulation on already supervised institutions could drive more financial activity into 

unregulated firms and markets. 

Certainly, with multiple instruments comes the need for meshing them into an effective 

system of regulation, in which the shortcomings of each regulatory tool will be offset by other 

tools in what must surely be a dynamic process of adjusting to new financial products and 

practices.  Channeling the information provided by market assessments of financial institutions 

and organizing opportunities for public comment on the regulatory process can play a key role in 

achieving a self-critical, dynamic regulatory system.   

Incorporating Market Discipline into the Regulatory System 

Despite years of interesting academic work on incorporating market discipline into 

financial regulation, it has to this point been consigned to a mostly cosmetic role.  One obvious 

consequence of this neglect was that moral hazard grew unchecked, as expectations of 

government support for the financial system meant that potential losses from risky 

behavior--even where understood by market participants--were not fully internalized by the 

counterparties of, and investors in, large financial institutions.  But the underpricing of risk also 

meant that market judgments on such institutions were not as useful for regulatory purposes as 

they could have been.   

Any market signal about the absolute or relative health of a financial firm will always 

contain considerable noise.  And market signals will be of less use if, as may be the case, some 

forms of risk are almost exclusively systemic, in the sense that the risk will turn into loss only in 

a systemic crisis.  But surely, even with these qualifications, the regulatory system has much to 

gain from increasing market discipline in financial markets.  Two possibilities have been most 

widely discussed.
