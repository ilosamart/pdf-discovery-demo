The expected path of short-term real interest rates is, of course, influenced by 

monetary policy, both the current stance of policy and market participants’ expectations 

of how policy will evolve.  The stance of monetary policy at any given time, in turn, is 

driven largely by the economic outlook, the risks surrounding that outlook, and at times 

other factors, such as whether the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding.  

In the current environment, both policymakers and market participants widely agree that 

supporting the U.S. economic recovery while keeping inflation close to 2 percent will 

likely require real short-term rates, currently negative, to remain low for some time.  As 

shown in chart 2, the expected average of the short-term real rate over the next 10 years 

has gradually declined to near zero over the past few years, in part reflecting downward 

revisions in expectations about the pace of the ongoing recovery and, hence, a pushing 

out of expectations regarding how long nominal short-term rates will remain low.

As the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the Federal 

Reserve’s communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to 

warrant highly accommodative policy for some time:  Most recently, the FOMC 

indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at 

least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between 

one and two years ahead is no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 

percent target, and long-term inflation expectations remain stable.

In discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path 

of real short-term rates, I have cheated a little:  What monetary policy actually controls is

 Real interest rates are not constrained by the zero bound, and the fact that expected average real short-

term interest rates are near zero reflects that the nominal rate is expected, on average, to run close to the 

expected inflation rate, which is near 2 percent.
