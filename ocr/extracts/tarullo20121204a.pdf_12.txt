on the finance, rather than the IO, side of the merged perspective.  But it may be that 

aspects of industry structure, including some of the competition/cooperation issues 

mentioned earlier, affect this analysis.  Also, an IO-finance perspective might identify 

possible alternatives to a nondeposit liability cap that achieve much the same financial 

stability goals at lower potential cost.   

Second is the question of scale and scope economies associated with nondeposit 

funding, the answer to which would help determine the limit at which significant social 

benefits might be lost, to be balanced against the avoidance of social costs arising from 

systemic events.  Even with the flexibility noted earlier, a firm might have to sacrifice 

certain economies of scope or scale to meet a cap.  If analysis finds scale and scope 

economies unlikely to be realized beyond a certain level of activity, then policymakers 

would have a point of reference for setting the cap. 

A third question is how second- and third-tier institutions might respond as the 

largest firms reposition, and perhaps shed, parts of their balance sheets.  These 

institutions may well be purchasers of assets sold by the largest firms.  They may also 

choose to take advantage of the lower demand, and correspondingly lower prices, for 

short-term funding by increasing their own short-term borrowing.  Research might cast 

light on the extent to which various forms of a liability cap would affect market structure, 

the degree to which reduced activities by some firms would be taken up by others, and 

how such changes might affect the stability of the financial system.  

In sum, the IO-finance perspective could contribute significantly to an elaboration 

and evaluation of this policy proposal.  In the process, it could advance what I regard as 

the most important remaining task of financial regulatory reform--determining the most
