These questions point to a more general area in which more research could be useful, 

namely a detailed examination of the compliance costs for community banks that can highlight 

the most beneficial areas for regulatory relief.  The Dodd-Frank Act has spawned a variety of 

new regulatory initiatives that add to the already-substantial regulatory burden faced by 

community banks.  Which regulations--whether new or existing--impose the greatest regulatory 

burden compared to their benefits?  Can regulatory agencies modify or provide exemptions to 

these regulations so as to make life a bit easier and more profitable for community banks, 

without adversely affecting bank safety and soundness or financial stability? 

To give just one example, one area in which new regulations are being developed 

involves incentive compensation.  This area seems to me to be of much more concern when we 

consider a money-center bank with thousands of shareholders, none of whom has a major stake, 

than when we consider a community bank in which management has a large or even majority 

ownership share.  Before imposing more regulatory burden on smaller banks in this area, I would 

like to understand whether there is any evidence that incentive compensation has caused 

excessive risk taking in such institutions.   

We are nearing the end of the rulemaking phase of Dodd-Frank and our changes on 

capital standards, at least those regulations that most directly affect community banks.  While we 

have tried to tailor rules to the size and complexity of institutions, we may not have gotten the 

balance right in every instance.  Thus we will continue to assess the overall effects of the new 

rules on the safety and soundness of community banks and to consider whether modifications to 

rules, or the ways in which we implement them, could achieve our safety and soundness aims 

with a lesser burden on this class of depository institutions.  We, of course, would value any 

observations and suggestions you have along these lines.
