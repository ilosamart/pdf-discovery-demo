Tradeoffs 

 The different approaches to integrating banks into the fintech stack represent different 

risks and tradeoffs.  Connectivity solutions that require intermediaries such as data aggregators 

and rely on screen scraping potentially create repositories of consumer credentials for hackers to 

target.  Banks argue that if such a repository is breached, thousands of banks could be 

impacted.22  Further complicating things, because screen scrapers operate without contractual 

relationships with the banks from which they pull information, banks have little leverage or 

ability to vet the security of the screen scrapers’ systems and methods or their overall risk.  In 

these circumstances, some commentators have noted that if a data aggregator or third-party 

developer is breached, it may not be clear who would bear responsibility for any losses--the 

bank, the data aggregator, the fintech developer, or the consumer.  Some third-party developers 

have included terms and conditions that specifically limit their liability to consumers.23  It is not 

clear the extent to which many consumers understand the risks involved with sharing their 

banking credentials, the more limited liability accepted by many third-party developers relative 

to their bank or credit card issuer, and the fact that the third-party developers may in turn provide 

those credentials to others in some instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

                                                           
22 According to one banking trade organization, “[t]his is a rich reward for a single hack, either of an aggregated 
database of personally identifiable information or of a single consumer’s multiple accounts, makes data aggregators 
an attractive target for criminals.  [Hackers would] obtain the key not to just a single room, but the key ring with 
keys to all the rooms.”  The Clearing House, “Comment Letter to Bureau-2016-0048 Request for Information

23 See, e.g, “Personal Capital Terms of Use” (last updated February 22, 2017), 
www.personalcapital.com/content/terms-of-use/ (last visited April 16, 2017). (“TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIABILITY OF PERSONAL CAPITAL, ITS AFFILIATES, 
LICENSORS AND AGENTS TO YOU SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).”)  
Further, Personal Capital requires that consumers submit to pre-dispute arbitration agreements and waive any rights 
to pursue relief in a class action proceeding as part of its terms of use. This would mean that if a data breach were to 
occur, each affected consumer would have to seek relief on his own, with a maximum possible recovery of $100. In 
addition, Personal Capital’s terms and conditions specify that the arbitrator can require that the consumer pay 
Personal Capital’s legal fees, if Personal Capital is to prevail.
