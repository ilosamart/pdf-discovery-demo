something broadly similar about capital requirements.  But the implicit tax associated 

with the LCR is subtler and less well understood, so I will go into some detail here. 

An analogy may help to explain.  Suppose we have a power plant that produces 

energy and, as a byproduct, some pollution.  Suppose further that regulators want to 

reduce the pollution and have two tools at their disposal:  They can mandate the use of a 

pollution-mitigating technology, like scrubbers, or they can levy a tax on the amount of 

pollution generated by the plant.  In an ideal world, regulation would accomplish two 

objectives.  First, it would lead to an optimal level of mitigation--that is, it would induce 

the plant to install scrubbers up to the point where the cost of an additional scrubber is 

equal to the marginal social benefit, in terms of reduced pollution.  And, second, it would 

also promote conservation:  Given that the scrubbers donâ€™t get rid of pollution entirely, 

one also wants to reduce overall energy consumption by making it more expensive. 

A simple case is one in which the costs of installing scrubbers, as well as the 

social benefits of reduced pollution, are known in advance by the regulator and the 

manager of the power plant.  In this case, the regulator can figure out what the right 

number of scrubbers is and require that the plant install these scrubbers.  The mandate 

can therefore precisely target the optimal amount of mitigation per unit of energy 

produced.  And, to the extent that the scrubbers are costly, the mandate will also lead to 

higher energy prices, which will encourage some conservation, though perhaps not the 

socially optimal level.11  This latter effect is the implicit tax aspect of the mandate. 

                                                 
11 Even in this simple full-information case, one cannot generally attain the social optimum on both the 
mitigation and conservation dimensions using just a mandate to install scrubbers as the only regulatory 
instrument.  By contrast, a tax on pollution, which decentralizes output and mitigation decisions to the firm, 
can, under full information, attain the optimum on both dimensions.
