challenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers.  While traveling around the country 

with our community development staff, I have been struck by the widening gulf between 

the economic fortunes of our large metropolitan areas and those of our small cities, 

towns, and rural areas. 

The statistics bear this out. Over the past 30 years, the convergence in income 

across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.13  Much of the gains in 

employment, income, and wealth since the end of the recession, and more broadly over 

the past few decades, have accrued to workers and families in larger cities.  Since some 

workers and families may find it difficult to move, this concentration of economic 

opportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for the well-being of these 

households and, potentially, the growth capacity of the economy as a whole.   

  Although pockets of opportunity and poverty are found in large metropolitan and 

rural areas alike, a greater share of the new jobs and business establishments created 

during the recovery that followed the Great Recession have been in larger metro areas 

than was the case in previous recoveries.14  In countless rural towns and small cities we 

are seeing how a deep economic setback can leave a profound and long-lasting mark.  

These experiences challenge common assumptions about the ability of local economies to 

recover from a setback.  This could be the legacy of the concentrated presence of an 

industry that experiences decline due to trade or technology, or it could be the byproduct 

of a lack of connectivity--whether by highways or broadband.  Technological change, 

globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to the U.S. economy, but

growing regional differences during the recovery.
