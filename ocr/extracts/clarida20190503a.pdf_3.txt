and unemployment.  And in this paper, Friedman introduced the concept of the “natural 

rate of unemployment,” which today we call u*.3  What is less widely appreciated is that 

Friedman’s article also contains a concise but insightful discussion of Wicksell’s “natural 

rate of interest”—r* in today’s terminology—the real interest rate consistent with price 

stability.  But while u* and r* provide key reference points in Friedman’s framework for 

assessing how far an economy may be from its long-run equilibrium in labor and 

financial markets, they play absolutely no role in the monetary policy rule he advocates:  

his well-known k-percent rule that central banks should aim for and deliver a constant 

rate of growth of a monetary aggregate.  This simple rule, he believed, could deliver 

long-run price stability without requiring the central bank to take a stand on, model, or 

estimate either r* or  u*.  Although he acknowledged that shocks would push u away 

from u* (and, implicitly, r away from r*), Friedman felt the role of monetary policy was 

to operate with a simple quantity rule that did not itself introduce potential instability into 

the process by which an economy on its own would converge to u* and r*.4  In 

Friedman’s policy framework, u* and r* are economic destinations, not policy rule 

inputs. 

Of course, I do not need to elaborate for this audience that the history of k-percent 

rules is that they were rarely tried, and when they were tried in the 1970s and the 1980s, 

they were found to work much better in theory than in practice.5  Velocity relationships 

                                                 
3 See Friedman (1968, pp. 8–11).  At roughly the same time, Phelps (1967) derived similar results using a 
formal economic model. 
4 Another consideration motivating Friedman’s choice of rule was his concern that a more active monetary 
policy strategy might be difficult to formulate because of the “long and variable lags” in the effect of 
monetary policy (a term he had coined in Friedman (1948, p. 254)). 
5 See Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999, Result 10, p. 1687).  Monetary targeting was adopted to a limited 
degree by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in the 1970s and 1980s, but it did not endure.  Even 
during the period from 1979 to 1982, when the Federal Open Market Committee was most focused on 
monetary aggregates, policymakers were still concerned with interest rates in the setting of policy, and
