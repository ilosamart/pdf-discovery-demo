Woodford’s views on forward guidance can be understood from the 

discussion above of the forward solution of the basic model.  Woodford has 

long emphasized the importance of policy commitment, even in the absence of 

a binding ZLB constraint.  At the ZLB, explicit forward guidance can 

potentially offset a lot of the distortion, by, in effect, reducing all interest rates 

across the maturity spectrum at least up to the time that policy changes.  

Indeed, as shown by Eggertson and Woodford (2003), optimal forward 

guidance should commit to maintain lower interest rates during the recovery 

than would otherwise have been warranted by economic conditions. 16  

Importantly, the appropriate commitment can be framed as a history-

dependent policy function responding only to the history of the price level and 

the output gap, in such a way that the impact on policy decisions of economic 

conditions at the lower bound continue, even as the economy recovers.    

A history-dependent policy rule introduces a wedge between what 

the central bank has promised and what contemporary circumstances, taken by 

themselves, would call for.  This wedge may raise difficult questions 

regarding the credibility of the policy.  Woodford believes that credibility can 

be enhanced by spelling out an explicit framework describing the nature of 

any history-dependence.  For example, as Woodford suggests in his 2012 

Kansas City Fed paper,  

A more useful form of forward guidance, I believe, would be one 

that emphasizes the target criterion that will be used to determine 

when it is appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target above
