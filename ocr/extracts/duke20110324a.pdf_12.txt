Some business owners use proceeds from personal loans for business purposes or use 

personal assets to secure business loans.  In other cases, the business itself may apply on its own.  

If the business is a sole proprietorship, there is no legal distinction between business and 

personal borrowing, but business owners still may view their personal and business debt 

separately.   

The 2009 SCF panel interview asked participants to report separately whether they had 

applied for personal and business loans during the two-year period.  If they had, it asked whether 

they had been turned down for a loan.  The survey also asked whether they had wanted to borrow 

for personal or business purposes but had been so convinced they would be turned down that 

they did not apply. 

The data show a substantial level of personal and business applications both for owners 

whose wealth rose and for those whose wealth fell over the period of the SCF panel.  The level 

of personal applications was slightly higher for those whose wealth increased over the period, 

and their applications were more likely to have been approved (or they were less likely to have 

believed they would have been denied) (figure 12).   

The pattern of personal loan denial rates is consistent with changes in individual 

circumstances.  The denials could also indicate that business difficulties have a significant 

influence on the ability of business owners to borrow for personal reasons.  Indeed, business 

owners have much more difficulty documenting their income than do wage-earners.  The 

combination of weaker earnings, lower net worth, and renewed focus on income verification 

could have made it particularly difficult for business owners who lost wealth to refinance 

mortgages or purchase homes.
