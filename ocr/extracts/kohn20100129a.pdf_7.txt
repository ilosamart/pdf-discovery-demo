emerge from this highly unusual period.  Thus, even larger asset-sensitive institutions may need 

to deal with more complex and difficult interest rate risk issues than might be thought.  

On the liability side of the balance sheet, banks and other depositories may be facing 

unusual uncertainties about the future behavior of non-interest-bearing and low-interest deposits.  

As you are well aware, these types of deposits help boost the net interest income of depository 

institutions.  A number of institutions, both large and small, posted increases in such deposits 

over the past two years as a result of a “flight to quality” by consumers and small businesses 

from less-sound intermediaries, money market funds, and other short-term investments.  

Moreover, banks themselves, aided by the expansion of deposit insurance, have competed 

heavily for such deposits as potentially more stable sources of funds in a crisis environment.  

Importantly, such newly acquired low-cost “core” deposits may not be as stable or as interest rate 

insensitive as similar deposits may have been in the past.  Without a doubt, consumers and small 

businesses are eager to raise their returns on short-term deposits, and institutions may have to 

compete even more strongly for such deposits once short-term rates begin to move higher.  

Forecasting the behavior of depositors and the business strategies of other intermediaries has 

always been a challenge for depository institutions and will be even more challenging as we exit 

from the current policy and interest rate environment.          

These challenges would seem even greater for liability-sensitive institutions--and a 

significant number of community banks appear to fall into that category.  As competition for 

low-cost deposits has increased, many community banks have been forced to increase their 

reliance on wholesale funds, including brokered deposits, which are significantly more interest 

rate sensitive and less stable than traditional core deposits.  

At the same time, many community banks--in competition with securitization markets 

and larger institutions for consumer and small business loans--face challenges in acquiring good-
