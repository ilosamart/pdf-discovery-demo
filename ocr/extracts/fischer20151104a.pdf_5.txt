remains of the highest importance, and that it is important that we preserve monetary 

policy independence to help foster desirable macroeconomic outcomes and financial 

stability.   

The Case for Monetary Policy Independence  

By 1994, both theory and evidence suggested that more independent central banks 

deliver better outcomes, particularly lower and more stable inflation.  The theoretical case 

for monetary policy independence focused on countering inflationary biases that were 

likely to exert themselves in the absence of an independent central bank.  Such a bias 

could result from political pressure to boost output in the short run--for example, before 

an election--or to use a central bank’s power to issue money as a means to finance 

government spending.  Even in the absence of political interference, inflationary bias can 

result from the problem of dynamic inconsistency if central banks cannot credibly 

commit to keeping inflation low.4   

On the empirical side, many scholars have studied whether monetary policy 

independence fosters low and stable inflation in practice.  Summarizing roughly 25 years 

of research in his 2008 paper, Alex Cukierman observed that “the evidence is consistent 

with the conclusion that inflation and actual [independence] are negatively related in both 

developed and developing countries.”5  Further, monetary policy independence does not 

appear to be associated with adverse economic consequences.  In particular, to the extent 

that independence of the central bank helps restrain inflation, it does not appear to result 

in significantly more volatile output, as some theoretical models had predicted.6

and Gordon (1983).
