recently, there have been concerns about potential financial and economic dislocations 

associated with the advanced economies’ eventual exit from highly accommodative 

policies.   

In my remarks today, I will discuss the extent to which monetary policy in the 

advanced economies--and in the United States in particular--has contributed to changes in 

emerging market capital flows and asset prices, and I will place this discussion in a 

broader context of economic and financial linkages among economies.  I will also address 

the risks that EMEs may face from the eventual normalization of monetary policy in the 

advanced economies.   

The heightened attention to advanced economies’ monetary policies and the 

potential spillovers to EMEs is understandable in light of the unprecedented policy steps 

taken in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.  The severity of the crisis and the 

challenge of a slow recovery required central banks in the advanced economies and 

elsewhere to take aggressive action in order to fulfill their mandates.  In the United 

States, the Federal Reserve is bound by its dual mandate to pursue price stability and 

maximum employment.  In following that mandate, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to 

its effective lower bound in late 2008 and then turned to two less conventional policy 

tools to provide additional monetary accommodation.  The first is forward guidance on 

the federal funds rate.  By lowering private-sector expectations for the future path of 

short-term rates, forward guidance has reduced longer-term interest rates and raised asset 

prices, thereby leading to more accommodative financial conditions.  The second tool is 

large scale asset purchases, which likewise increase policy accommodation by reducing 

longer-term interest rates and raising asset prices.
