is at its maximum and prices are stable, will be significantly slower than the post-World 

War II average.  Slower economic growth, in turn, implies businesses will see less need 

to invest in expansion.  And it implies families and individuals will feel the need to save 

more and spend less.  Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of 

savings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less 

investment imply a lower neutral interest rate.  Although we can’t directly measure the 

neutral interest rate, it is something that can be estimated in retrospect.  And, as we have 

increasingly realized, it has probably been trending down for a while now.  Our current 3 

percent estimate of the longer-run neutral rate, for instance, is a full percentage point 

lower than our estimate just three years ago. 

You might be thinking, what does this discussion of rather esoteric concepts such 

as the neutral rate mean to me?  If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest 

rates you pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher, 

they probably will not increase dramatically.  Likewise, if you are a saver, the rates you 

earn could inch higher after a while, but probably not by a lot.  For some years, I’ve 

heard from savers who want higher rates, and now I’m beginning to hear from borrowers 

who want lower rates.  I can’t emphasize strongly enough, though, that we are not trying 

to help one of those groups at the expense of the other.  We’re focused very much on that 

dual mandate I keep mentioning.  At the end of the day, we all benefit from plentiful jobs 

and stable prices, whether we are savers or borrowers--and many of us, of course, are 

both. 

Economics and monetary policy are, at best, inexact sciences.  Figuring out what 

the neutral interest rate is and setting the right path toward it is not like setting the
