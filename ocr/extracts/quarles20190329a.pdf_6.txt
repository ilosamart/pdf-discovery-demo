juncture argue for the consideration of a wide range of indicators in assessing the state of 

that economy.  This, in turn, can complicate the communication of data dependence:  

How can we adopt and convey a clear strategic stance on policy while maintaining our 

credibility if evolution of the data requires an evolution of that strategy?     

I prefer a framework where we make it clear that we are focused on broad trends--

elsewhere I have used the aviation analogy that we should not “chase the needles” on the 

instrument panel.  We should be clear that, while we will respond to clear and durable 

evolution in these broad trends, we are not reacting to every piece of volatile data.4   

The Countercyclical Capital Buffer and Financial Stability 

Let me now shift gears and return to the CCyB, beginning with how it fits within 

our broad set of efforts to promote financial stability.  The core of that approach has been 

to establish a set of structural, through-the-cycle regulatory and supervisory standards to 

ensure resilience against a broad range of shocks.  In contrast to the pre-crisis framework, 

banks, especially the largest and most systemic banks, are now required to maintain 

substantially higher and higher-quality loss-absorbing capital and other cushions; stress 

testing examines the resilience of large banks to severely adverse economic conditions; 

liquidity requirements and regulatory incentives to limit reliance on short-term wholesale 

funding have reduced funding risk among large banks and their affiliated broker-dealers; 

and resolution planning requirements reduce the risks that the failure of a large firm 

would spill into the broader economy.  Outside of the banking system, money market 

mutual fund reform has reduced this sector’s susceptibility to destabilizing runs by
