I will address the topic of central bank communications, with a particular 

emphasis on those times when financial markets and the central bank have different 

expectations about what a central bank decision will be.  Such situations lead to surprises 

and often to market volatility. 

Of course, not all surprises are equal.  For one, communications that shift or 

solidify expectations that are diffuse or not strongly held are less likely to be disruptive 

than communications that run counter to strongly held market beliefs.  Further, there are 

worse things than surprises.  The central bank must provide its views regarding the likely 

evolution of monetary policy, even when this view is not shared by market participants.  

A concern for surprising the market should not be a constraint on following or 

communicating the appropriate path of monetary policy.  That said, there are good 

reasons to avoid unintended surprises in the conduct of policy.1                 

Why should central banks avoid surprising financial markets?  In recent decades, 

it has been increasingly acknowledged that monetary policy implementation relies 

importantly on the management of market expectations.2  In theory, clarity about the 

central bank’s reaction function--that is, how the central bank adjusts the stance of 

monetary policy in response to changing economic conditions--allows the market to alter 

financial conditions smoothly.  This typically helps meet the bank’s policy targets, with 

the result that the markets are working in alignment with the policymaker’s goals.  Under

2 Bernanke (2004, 2013a) and Woodford (2005) underscore how central bank efforts to shape market 
expectations can enhance policy effectiveness.  The critical role of market expectations in determining asset 
prices and reactions to policy changes has long been recognized; it is the explicit recognition of this link in 
formal models and the analysis of policy that is the recent major achievement.
