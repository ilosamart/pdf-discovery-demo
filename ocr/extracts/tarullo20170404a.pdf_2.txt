Tomorrow is my last day at the Federal Reserve.  So in this, my final official speech, it 

seems appropriate to offer a broad perspective on how financial regulation changed after the 

crisis.  In a moment, I shall offer a few thoughts along these lines.  Then I am going to address in 

some detail the capital requirements we have put in place, including our stress testing program.  

Eight years at the Federal Reserve has only reinforced my belief that strong capital requirements 

are central to a safe and stable financial system.  It is important for the public to understand why

 The impact of Lehmanâ€™s bankruptcy seemed to confirm fears that failure of the largest 

financial firms risked the complete implosion of the financial system.  This, of course, is the too-

big-to-fail problem:  government officials may feel compelled to save private financial firms 

with public (that is, taxpayer) capital.  Meanwhile, financing markets had nearly frozen up.  

Hence the extraordinary government actions that followed.  Public capital was injected into all of
