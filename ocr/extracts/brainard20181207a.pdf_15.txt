the financial cycle are increasingly intertwined.  If history is any guide, as resource 

utilization continues to tighten, there is some risk that financial imbalances could grow.  

The U.S. financial system is much more resilient than before the crisis, owing 

importantly to strong financial reforms.  Even so, the banking systemâ€™s core capital and 

liquidity buffers have yet to be tested through a full cycle.  At the same time, the appetite 

for risk among financial market participants rose notably over 2017 and much of 2018, 

and corporate borrowing has reached new heights amid rapid growth and deteriorating 

underwriting standards in riskier segments, such as leveraged lending.  The mutual funds 

that have built up exposure to some of this risky debt have liquidity mismatches that 

could contribute to market dislocations in stressed conditions.  This constellation of 

vulnerabilities could amplify adverse shocks that might materialize.  At a time when 

cyclical pressures have been building and bank profitability has been strong, it might be 

prudent to ask large banking organizations to fortify their capital buffers, which could 

subsequently be released if conditions warrant.
