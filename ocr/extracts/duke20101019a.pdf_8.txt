other plausible developments, such as faster or slower recovery or a change in inflation 

expectations, that were not included in the baseline forecast. 

I find it impossible to form a preference for a policy to improve the path of economic 

performance without forming some opinion about what the performance would be absent any 

policy action.  So I suppose you could say that I formulate an implicit economic forecast for 

every meeting.  But four times a year, I submit an explicit forecast to be used along with the 

forecasts of other participants in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that is later 

published with the minutes for that meeting.   

Second Question: Given the Economic Outlook, What is the Appropriate Policy Response?  

Armed with this study of the economy, projections, and often a few specific areas of 

concern, it is time to think about appropriate policy.  On Thursday the staff provides a policy-

focused book designed to help with this question.  It contains a number of estimates of the 

“Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate”—the interest rate that if maintained would return the 

economy over time to its so-called potential, the highest level of output that does not lead to 

undue inflationary pressures.  The book also includes calculations of policy solutions using 

policy rules as well as model-based estimates of optimal policy.  And it contains an analysis of 

each of the policy alternatives that were circulated in draft form on Tuesday.

imagine, in recent years the memos have covered topics such as use of large-scale asset 

purchases, ways the Federal Reserve might exit from nonstandard programs when the time 

comes, or financial stability indicators.  As we contemplate the possible need for additional 

monetary accommodation and the tools we have remaining, staff memos are quite helpful in
