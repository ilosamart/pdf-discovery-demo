book, and argue that this would lead to greater market liquidity.9  Others have argued that current 

market structures may lead to greater volatility, and suggested possible alterations designed to 

improve the situation.10  To be clear, I am not embracing any particular one of these ideas.  Rather, 

I am suggesting that now is a good time for market participants and regulators to collectively 

consider whether current market structures can be improved for the benefit of all.      

Questions about market structure also arise in the funding markets for Treasuries.  As many 

have noted, there is a link between funding liquidity and market liquidity, and for Treasury markets 

the links to funding in the repo market are especially close.11  Post crisis reforms have made the 

repo market safer but also raised the costs of repo transactions.  Greater use of central clearing 

could potentially lower these costs by allowing participants to net more of their transactions.  

Authorities have emphasized a greater use of clearing for a wide range of products, and I believe 

there could be benefits to greater clearing in repo markets as well.  There are several private 

proposals to accomplish that, and any solution will have to satisfy demanding regulatory 

requirements.    

To wrap up, we need more clarity on the implications of structural changes in these critical 

markets for market liquidity and function.  This is a good time to hold another public conference to

provide market makers a flexible channel to fund their inventories and can help to lower the costs of providing market 
liquidity.
