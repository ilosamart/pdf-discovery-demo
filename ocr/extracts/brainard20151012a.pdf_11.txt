downside risks make a strong case for continuing to carefully nurture the U.S. recovery--

and argue against prematurely taking away the support that has been so critical to its 

vitality.   

These risks matter more than usual because the ability to provide additional 

accommodation if downside risks materialize is, in practice, more constrained than the 

ability to remove accommodation more rapidly if upside risks materialize.  The 

asymmetry in risk management stems from the combination of the likely low current 

level of the neutral real interest rate and the effective lower bound.  Let me take each in 

turn. 

First, casual empiricism would suggest that we are experiencing a period of 

unusually low rates not only in the United States but also at the global level.  Ten-year 

sovereign bond yields in G-7 economies excluding Japan currently range from just above
