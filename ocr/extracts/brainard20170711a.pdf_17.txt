Figure 2.  Common Demand Shock, Asymmetric Policy Tightening across Countries 

Figure 2 shows a simulation in which the demand shock is assumed to be 

common across countries ( u = u* ).  The home country is assumed to pursue a policy of 

actively adjusting its policy rate, while the foreign Country is assumed to rely exclusively 

on normalizing through the balance sheet.  In each case, the central banks of the two 

countries tighten policy aggressively enough to keep output at potential (see the 

parameter settings in column 4 of Table 1). 

As policy rates rise in the home country (panel A) and the exchange rate is more 

sensitive to policy rates than to the balance sheet, the home country's exchange rate 

(panel B) appreciates, while its net exports (panel D) decline.  Although GDP remains at 

baseline in each country (panels E and F) given our assumption that monetary policy 

keeps output at potential (which is unchanged), the alternative policy normalization 

choices clearly have important effects--even under a common shock--on both exchange 

rates and the composition of demand in each country.  In particular, because exchange 

rates in the foreign country are less sensitive to balance sheet than to interest rate policy, 

the foreign central bank must enact a relatively larger interest rate tightening in order to 

keep its GDP at potential.
