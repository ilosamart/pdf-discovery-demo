the number of community banks is due in large part to a decline in new bank charters 

rather than an increase in the annual number of exits.3  This fact can be seen in figure 6, 

which shows the number of new charters each year (in blue, with squares to mark yearly 

values), the actual annual change in the number of community banks (in green, with 

triangles), and what the annual change in the number of banks would have been in the 

absence of new entry (in red, with circles), over the past 20 years.  It is clear from this 

figure that in the absence of new entry, the annual decline in the number of community 

banks between 2000 and 2010 would have been quite similar to what it has been since 

2010.  Or, viewed from a different perspective, if entry had remained at more “normal” 

levels during the past 5 years, the rate of decline in the number of community banks 

would not have accelerated.  And, since almost all new entrants have less than $100 

million in assets, the decline in the number of banks in this smallest size category would 

have been much less steep during the past 5 years.   

Research by Adams and Gramlich that was presented at the 2014 community 

banking conference and subsequently published in the Review of Industrial Organization 

considers the underlying causes of the virtual absence of new bank formation since 

2009.4  This research suggests that slow economic growth and low interest rates in the 

post-crisis environment can explain about 75 percent of the decline in new bank charters.  

The authors were not able to isolate the effect of regulatory changes on the rate of new 

bank formation, but note that regulation may also play a role.
