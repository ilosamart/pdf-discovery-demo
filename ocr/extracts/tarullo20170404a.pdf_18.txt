announcements of whether the Federal Reserve objects to each participating bank’s capital plan--

an event that still garners considerable investor and public attention.11  The potential for 

embarrassing, public objections to their plans has been disconcerting to some banks, which 

pointed out that--by design--they were not given the supervisory model for calculating post-

stress minimum capital levels and that they might not be able to predict when supervisory 

concerns with some aspects of their capital planning processes would ripen into a public 

objection. 

It is certainly the case that this feature of our stress testing program was intended to, and 

has, focused the minds of banks’ senior management on their capital positions and capital 

planning processes.  Motivating management with the stress test was appropriate in a time when 

capital needed to be built up and when serious shortcomings of pre-crisis risk management at 

many large U.S. banks needed to be remedied.  To be honest, I was stunned in my first few 

months at the Federal Reserve to find out that many of these banks were unable to aggregate 

their total exposure to particular counterparties across the many parts of the bank in anything like 

a reasonable time.  Some firms did not have ready access to basic information about the location 

and value of collateral that they held.  As recently as a couple of years ago, we were still seeing 

some significant problems with data and modelling reliability in banks’ internal risk-

management processes. 

Still, the question was always how long we would need this highly focused set of annual 

determinations.  Several years ago we took a first step to reduce the potential for a quantitative 

objection by giving any bank whose planned distributions would have brought it below the post-

                                                 
11 An objection can be forthcoming either because the bank’s proposals for capital distributions would leave it with 
less capital than our modeling determines is necessary were the severely adverse scenario to be realized or because 
our supervisors have found substantial flaws in a bank’s capital planning and capital risk-management processes.
