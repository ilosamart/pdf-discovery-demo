We must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low- and moderate-

income students trying to attain higher levels of education--barriers not typically faced by 

their more well-off peers.  First, these students often do not have friends or family who 

have achieved higher educational levels, which matters because students whose parents 

did not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves.14  Even 

so, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can 

assist them in choosing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will 

help them complete their degrees.  And they can benefit from help in picking majors and 

degrees that lead to higher earnings. 15   

Second, lower-income students often pursue their education while working to 

support themselves and family members.  Educational programs that help students 

balance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates.  In 

recognition of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants 

to postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs 

primarily serving the needs of low-income students.16 

I want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of 

lower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term

completed one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no 
education beyond high school.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on
