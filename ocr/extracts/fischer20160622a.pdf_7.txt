Finally, one criticism that has been leveled at our TLAC proposal is that imposing 

long-term debt requirements on GSIBs will lead those firms to increase their leverage and 

thereby raise their probability of failure, and that they should instead be required to hold 

higher levels of equity capital.  I agree that equity capital plays a key role in preventing 

financial firm failures, and we have raised equity capital requirements for banking 

organizations--especially GSIBs--substantially since the crisis.  But to protect financial 

stability, we must reduce not only the probability that a GSIB will fail, but also the 

damage that its failure could do if it were to occur.  At the point of failure, a banking 

firm’s equity capital is likely to be zero or negative, so to improve GSIB resolvability, 

our proposal requires GSIBs to have a thick tranche of gone-concern loss-absorbing 

capacity to ensure that resolution authorities will have the necessary raw material to 

manufacture fresh equity and recapitalize and stabilize the firm.8  That is the role played 

by the proposal’s long-term debt requirements.  And we expect that firms would 

generally come into compliance with the proposed requirements by replacing existing 

ineligible liabilities with eligible long-term debt rather than by increasing their leverage.  

At any rate, even if a firm were to come into compliance in part by increasing the size of 

its balance sheet, it would remain subject to our robust equity capital requirements and 

leverage limits, which are designed to ensure a very low probability of failure.  Finally, 

the existence of a thick tranche of loss-absorbing long-term debt should reduce a GSIB’s 

                                                 
8 See Board of Governors (2015), “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt, and Clean Holding 
Company Requirements,” in note 5.  Under the proposal, a U.S. GSIB would be subject to external long-
term debt requirements of 6 percent of risk-weighted assets plus the amount of the risk-based capital 
surcharge applicable to the GSIB under the Board’s GSIB surcharge rule and 4.5 percent of total leverage 
exposure.
