regulatory capital requirements that are reasonably well tailored to the insurance-related risks for 

each distinct jurisdiction and business line of the group. 

B. Systemically Important Insurance Companies: The Consolidated Approach 

By definition, the insurance companies designated by the FSOC are systemically 

important.  For these firms, application of an aggregated approach like that of the BBA could 

pose significant risks to the Federal Reserve’s statutory aims of safety and soundness and 

financial stability.  The BBA, recall, would simply aggregate capital requirements that may not 

be founded upon financial stability considerations.  A consolidated form of capital requirements 

is key to ensuring that risks to the financial system as a whole (as compared, say, to investor or 

policyholder protection) are accounted for. 

For these firms, then, the ANPR is likely to seek comment on what we have internally 

been calling the consolidated approach (CA).  Let me note at the outset that this is not the 

consolidated capital framework we apply to bank holding companies.  As with our capital 

requirements for bank holding companies, the CA would categorize all of the consolidated 

insurance group’s assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments, apply risk factors to the 

amounts in each segment, and then set a minimum ratio of required capital comparing the 

consolidated capital requirements to the group’s consolidated capital resources.  However, the 

CA would use risk weights or risk factors that are more appropriate for the longer-term nature of 

most insurance liabilities.  

Like the BCR of the IAIS, the CA would take a consolidated approach to capital 

requirements.  However, unlike the BCR, the foundation of the CA would be consolidated 

financial information based on U.S. GAAP, with appropriate adjustments for regulatory 

purposes.  Our current thought is that the CA would initially be relatively simple in design, with
