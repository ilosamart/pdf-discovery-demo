Thursday.  Not long after that, the staff began the current practice of circulating even earlier 

drafts of the statements so that policymakers could let them know if the various alternatives 

covered the plausible set of options for the meeting.  

Initially, the Committee discussed the statement wording only after the policy vote was 

taken.  But by March 2001, the full statement was actually discussed before voting on the policy 

itself.  Then in October 2007, the FOMC formally recognized the value of the post-meeting 

statement by changing procedures to reflect that the policy vote officially encompassed the full 

statement, not just the policy action.  This spelled out what was already understood:  What was 

said about a policy action was almost as important as the action itself because it helped explain 

what the Committee was doing and set up expectations for what it might do down the road. 

I think what you can glean from this little history is that the post-FOMC statement has 

evolved into anything but an afterthought.  Rather, my colleagues and I begin thinking about our 

communication almost at the same time we start thinking about the policy decision itself, and we 

usually debate language as a way to nuance policy.  But in case you’re tempted to think the 

statement is “baked in the cake” by the time the FOMC meets, I’d suggest you take a look at 

some of the meeting transcripts on our website.  The policy go-round has actually become the 

policy/communications go-round, with frequent, lively debates about everything from changing 

entire paragraphs in the statement to changing clauses, individual words, and sometimes even 

punctuation.   

Using new tools to manage policy as we have in the last two years does create particular 

challenges in communicating our actions, intentions, and reasoning to the public.  The statement 

has been an essential element in addressing these challenges.  For example, the announcement of 

a target for the federal funds rate combined with a phrase such as “extended period” gives the
