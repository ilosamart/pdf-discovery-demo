The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation 

expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of 

inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy 

deliberations.  In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual 

tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to 

tighten policy preemptively is less compelling.   

2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated  

Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, 

this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously 

anticipated.  This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be 

open to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market.  Indeed, with 

payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers 

would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving 

sideways, as it has done.  It is true that today’s unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only 

0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participant’s estimate of the longer-run level 

of unemployment.  However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary 

over time.  Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run 

natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to 

6.0 percent in June 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/2 to 

1 percentage point.5  We cannot rule out that estimates of the natural unemployment rate 

may move even lower.
