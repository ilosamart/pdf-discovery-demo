the large increase in earnings of top athletes, musicians, and even chief executive 

officers.  In the popular press, the phenomenon of the very few reaping enormous 

windfalls has become known as the winner-take-all economy.  However, other 

researchers have noted that a large share of the top earners is found in industries such as 

finance and law, suggesting that deregulation, corporate governance, and tax policy may 

have also played a role in the trend toward rising inequality.   

Economic mobility has not increased to mitigate higher inequality 

Despite the fact that rising inequality has compounded the stakes associated with 

one’s position in the income distribution, mobility up and down the economic ladder 

from one generation to the next in the United States has been stagnant.  Work by Raj 

Chetty and his coauthors using income tax data has shown that a child who was born in 

the early 1990s had about the same chance of moving up in the income distribution as a 

child born in the 1970s.13  Combining these results with previous research suggests that 

mobility has not increased in the postwar era.  And, despite the long-held view of the 

United States as the land of opportunity, we actually fall short of other advanced 

economies in terms of intergenerational mobility.  In the United Kingdom, for example, 

about 30 percent of sons with low-income parents end up being low-income themselves, 

while in the United States the comparable figure is over 40 percent.14
