These payments from the Treasury to the consumer had a marked 
effect upon consumer spending in the spring of 1975. In 

fact, their stimulus did not weaken until mid-summer when the majority 
had either used the rebates or placed them into time deposits or in­
vestments. Since that time consumer spending has strengthened on the 
basis of rising employment levels, increased wages and hours worked, 
and a considerably better tone of consumer confidence which has 
emerged especially since the start of 1976.

But the recovery has not been completely balanced or uniform 
for all sectors of the United States economy and has been dampened by 
a number of elements. First, there has been a slow rate of capital 
spending. Businessmen apparently feel that with the rate of utiliza­
tion of capacity in the low eighties, there was no urgency to build 
new capacity or expand new equipment. In fact, a sizable part of the 
recent capital spending seems to have been directed toward meeting 
air and water pollution standards. Only in a very limited number 
of industries, especially natural gas, oil, and other extractive 
industries, was there any major increase in capital for new capacity. 
The slow rate of capital spending is reflected in the most recent 
Department of Commerce survey which showed plans for only a 4-1/2 
percent increase in nominal terms for 1976.
