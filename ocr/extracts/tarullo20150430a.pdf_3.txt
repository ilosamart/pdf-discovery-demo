Prudential Objectives for Community Bank Oversight 

 At the outset, let me note that in speaking of “community banks,” I am generally using 

the term as defined in the Federal Reserve’s supervisory portfolio.  That is, it refers to banks with 

$10 billion or less in total assets.  But it is worth making two observations about this definition.  

First is the fact that the vast majority of community banks have less than $1 billion in assets.  

Second is the fact that, for purposes of establishing regulatory objectives, a bank with $12 billion 

in assets might not be readily distinguishable from one with $8 billion in assets.  Of course, lines 

will always have to be drawn in applying regulations and establishing supervisory practices.  But 

it is useful to keep these facts in mind in thinking about prudential tiering. 

The two most important characteristics of community banks for purposes of establishing 

regulatory objectives and supervisory practices are their size and their business model.  My 

reference to size is obviously a bit tautological, but size is worth emphasizing precisely because 

of what it says about the risks community banks do not pose.  The possible failure of a 

community bank self-evidently poses no risks to the financial system.  And while individual 

community banks in smaller communities provide sources of credit that would be hard to 

replace, their limited size means their failures would not result in credit contraction in significant 

swaths of the country.  

The business model of nearly all community banks is grounded in the most traditional 

form of commercial banking--lending to businesses and households with funds predominantly 

obtained from deposit accounts.  And, as this audience well knows, lending by community banks 

is built substantially on relationship banking.  While community banks over the years have found 

it increasingly difficult to compete with larger banks in the types of lending that can be 

efficiently scaled through larger volumes and standardized credit models, they maintain a
