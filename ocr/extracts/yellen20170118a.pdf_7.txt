longer-term interest rates by purchasing large amounts of longer-term Treasury securities 

and government-guaranteed mortgage securities.  And we communicated our intent to 

keep short-term interest rates low for a long time, thus increasing the downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates, which are influenced by expectations about short-term rates.  

Now, it’s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is 

moving toward our goal.  The unemployment rate is less than 5 percent, roughly back to 

where it was before the recession.  And, over the past seven years, the economy has 

added about 15-1/2 million net new jobs.  Although inflation has been running below our 

2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 

2 percent last year as the job market continued to improve and as the effects of a big drop 

in oil prices faded.  Last month, at our most recent meeting, we took account of the 

considerable progress the economy has made by modestly increasing our short-term 

interest rate target by 1/4 percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent.  It was the 

second such step--the first came a year earlier--and reflects our confidence the economy 

will continue to improve. 

Now, many of you would love to know exactly when the next rate increase is 

coming and how high rates will rise.  The simple truth is, I can’t tell you because it will 

depend on how the economy actually evolves over coming months.  The economy is vast 

and vastly complex, and its path can take surprising twists and turns.  What I can tell you 

is what we expect--along with a very large caveat that our interest rate expectations will 

change as our outlook for the economy changes.  That said, as of last month, I and most 

of my colleagues--the other members of the Fed Board in Washington and the presidents 

of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks--were expecting to increase our federal funds
