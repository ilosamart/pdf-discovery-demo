Second, the Federal Reserve will need to revise its framework to allow for a 

greater differentiation in the supervision and regulation of large firms.  To date, our 

tailoring of regulations has been based largely--but not exclusively--on asset size, which 

reflects an unduly one-dimensional approach.  We have been evaluating additional 

criteria that may provide for greater regulatory differentiation across large banks, and the 

recent legislation is consistent with the goals of that initiative.  Specifically, the 

legislation recognizes that large banks have a variety of business models and risk 

profiles; supervision should be flexible enough to incorporate this heterogeneity.  

Third, I believe we already have a good start on a path forward for tailoring 

regulation.  In my remarks today, I will touch upon some potential factors we have 

identified for tailoring the supervision and regulation of large banks. 

Tailoring: A Primary Component of Post-Crisis Supervision and Regulation 

I think everyone in this room would agree that--while there are important ways it 

can be improved--the body of post-crisis regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and 

its fellow banking agencies has, taken as a whole, clearly made the U.S. financial system 

stronger and more resilient.  In implementing these reforms, the Fed sought to achieve 

two parallel goals: (1) promoting the safety and soundness of individual banking 

organizations and (2) enhancing the stability of the broader U.S. financial system. 

A certain amount of tailoring was reflected from the beginning in how the Fed 

sought to achieve these goals.  As the Board built its post-crisis framework, supervision 

and regulation were designed to increase in stringency in tandem with a firmâ€™s size and 

systemic footprint.  This can be seen in stricter requirements in various elements of the 

regulatory capital framework that apply only to larger or more complex banks, including
