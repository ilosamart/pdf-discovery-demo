technological change continue on their path, making it more likely that workers who were 

laid off during the recession would be unable to find reemployment that is of comparable 

quality to their previous jobs.1  About two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in 

middle-wage occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office 

administration jobs--but these occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of the 

job growth during the recovery.2  By contrast, lower-wage occupations, such as retail 

sales, food service, and other lower-paying service jobs, accounted for only one-fifth of 

job losses during the recession but more than one-half of total job gains during the 

recovery.  As a result of these trends in job creation, which could well have been 

exacerbated by the severe nature of the crisis, the earnings potential for many households 

likely remains below what they had anticipated in the years before the recession.  

Moreover, as you all know, the temporary payroll tax cut has now expired, and many 

households have seen their disposable incomes reduced for this reason as well.     

Spending in the business sector recently has increased only modestly, perhaps due 

in part to the effect of these recent tax changes on consumers.  Real spending on 

equipment and software rose about 4 percent over the past 12 months, according to the 

most recent GDP report, a modest gain for this category of spending.  Indicators for 

capital investment in the months ahead, including new orders for durable capital goods 

and survey measures of business sentiment, suggest that growth in business spending on 

new equipment and software is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters.
