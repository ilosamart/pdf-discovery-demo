Thank you to the New York Association for Business Economics for hosting me.   

We remain in a period of great consequence for the U.S. economy.  The policy judgments 

currently being considered are as significant as those made during the darkest days of the Panic.1  

And here, I am not only referring to the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.2  Fiscal, trade, 

and regulatory policies may turn out to be no less determinative to the path of the U.S. economy.   

On fiscal matters, what size government is desired, and how should it be funded?  Will 

low sovereign funding costs and accommodative financial markets make policymakers lax in 

developing a credible, fiscal exit regime?  And, will the costs of implicit guarantees add to 

sovereign debt burdens?    

On matters of international trade, will policymakers push to extend the post-World War II 

bipartisan consensus favoring free trade?  If the United States declines to talk and act forcefully 

on the merits of open, competitive markets, who will?  Will our quiet be deemed acceptance by 

those pushing the false promise of protectionism?  

And, as I will explore in the balance of my remarks, are the financial regulatory policy 

prescriptions proposed during the past year sufficient for meaningful reform?  Will these policies 

mitigate the risks of future financial crises?  Will they support long-term economic growth?  

Now is not only a time of consequence for regulation and the U.S. economy.  It is also a time for 

choosing.
