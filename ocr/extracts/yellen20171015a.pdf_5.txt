First, given that estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are so uncertain, it 

is possible that there is more slack in U.S. labor markets than is commonly recognized, 

which may be true for some other advanced economies as well.  If so, some further 

tightening in the labor market might be needed to lift inflation back to 2 percent.   

Second, some measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged lower 

over the past few years in several major economies, and it remains an open question 

whether these measures might be reflecting a true decline in expectations that is broad 

enough to be affecting actual inflation outcomes.   

Third, our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified 

in some way.  For example, global developments--perhaps technological in nature, such 

as the tremendous growth of online shopping--could be helping to hold down inflation in 

a persistent way in many countries.  Or there could be sector-specific developments--such 

as the subdued rise in medical prices in the United States in recent years--that are not 

typically included in aggregate inflation equations but which have contributed to lower 

inflation.  Such global and sectoral developments could continue to be important 

restraining influences on inflation.  Of course, there are also risks that could unexpectedly 

boost inflation more rapidly than expected, such as resource utilization having a stronger 

influence when the economy is running closer to full capacity. 

In this economic environment, with ongoing improvements in labor market 

conditions and softness in inflation that is expected to be temporary, the FOMC has 

continued its policy of gradual policy normalization.  As the Committee announced after 

our September meeting, we are initiating our balance sheet normalization program this 

month.  That program, which was described in the June Addendum to the Policy
