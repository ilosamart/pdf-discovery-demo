had progressively migrated outside of traditional banking to so-called shadow banking 

entities, which relied heavily on short-term wholesale funding that proved vulnerable to 

runs.7  Accordingly, to help calm the panic, the Federal Reserve provided liquidity not 

only to commercial banks, but also to other types of financial institutions such as 

investment banks and money market funds, as well as to key financial markets such as 

those for commercial paper and asset-backed securities.8  Because funding markets are 

global in scope and U.S. borrowers depend importantly on foreign lenders, the Federal 

Reserve also approved currency swap agreements with 14 foreign central banks. 

Providing liquidity represented only the first step in stabilizing the financial 

system.  Subsequent efforts focused on rebuilding the public’s confidence, notably 

including public guarantees of bank debt by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

and of money market funds by the Treasury Department, as well as the injection of public 

capital into banking institutions.  The bank stress test that the Federal Reserve led in the 

spring of 2009, which included detailed public disclosure of information regarding the 

solvency of our largest banks, further buttressed confidence in the banking system.  The 

success of the stress-test disclosures, by the way, was yet another example of the benefits 

of transparency. 

                                                 
7 Shadow banking, as usually defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, 
carry out traditional banking functions--but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked to, the traditional 
system of regulated depository institutions.  Examples of important components of the shadow banking 
system include securitization vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, money market funds, 
markets for repurchase agreements, investment banks, and nonbank mortgage companies. 
8 Liquidity tools employed by the Federal Reserve that were closely tied to the central bank’s traditional 
role as lender of last resort involved the provision of short-term liquidity to depository and other financial 
institutions and included the traditional discount window, the Term Auction Facility (TAF), the Primary 
Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF).  A second set of tools 
involved the provision of liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in those credit markets key to 
households and businesses where the expanding crisis threatened to materially impede the availability of 
financing.  The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), 
the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF), 
and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) fall into this category.
