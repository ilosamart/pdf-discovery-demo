dislocations once the run in funding markets began and caused great harm to the broader 

economy.   

As the crisis has receded, supervisors--not to mention market participants, 

commentators, and the general public--have eyed financial markets with a heightened 

sensitivity to anything that resembles the buildup of risks that occurred in the run-up to 

the crisis--a natural and useful exercise in pattern recognition.  In that spirit, the Fed, the 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the FDIC have focused significant 

attention on the origination activities of depository institutions in the syndicated 

leveraged loan market, where some of the troubling patterns that were evident in 

subprime MBS have been observed.   

These conditions prompted policymakers first to ask questions and then to act.  

Fed officials raised concerns publicly as early as 2011.9  The Fed, the OCC, and the 

FDIC issued supervisory guidance emphasizing these concerns in 2013.10  In 2014, the 

agencies clarified the guidance through published FAQs and began to exercise intensive 

supervision at the largest regulated banks emphasizing the need to improve underwriting 

standards and credit risk management on safety and soundness grounds.11

11 Along with the Shared National Credit results, the Fed, along with the OCC and the FDIC, released on 
November 7, 2014, an FAQ document regarding the guidance 
(www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20141107a3.pdf).  Also see Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (2014), “Credit Risk in the Shared National Credit Portfolio Is High; Leveraged Lending 
Remains a Concern,” joint press release, November 7, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141107a.htm. 
     The guidance covers a wide range of risk-management issues and generally aims tighter scrutiny at 
deals with leverage over six times pre-tax cash flow, or with forecast debt paydown of less than 50 percent
