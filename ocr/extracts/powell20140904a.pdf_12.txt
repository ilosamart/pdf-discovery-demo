the need for a backup plan if a reference rate does cease to function.  This issue is 

something that we intend to bring up with market participants and end users as we meet 

with them.  

Conclusion 

My hope is that governments, market participants, and end users can work 

together to build a stronger foundation for the reference interest rates that are so critical 

to our financial system.  Implementation of these measures is clearly in the interest of 

U.S. financial stability.  I also hope and expect that individual financial institutions will 

understand that it is also in their private interests.  Reference rates are one of the 

foundations of the financial system, and it is in the interest of everyone, from the 

residential mortgage holder to the financial institutions that heavily use these rates, that 

those foundations have integrity and be well constructed and resistant to manipulation.  

As I said at the beginning, the problems with LIBOR have undermined the publicâ€™s trust 

in the financial system.  In light of the need to regain that trust, I am certain that our 

reform efforts will meet with the active cooperation of financial institutions in carrying 

forward these reforms.
