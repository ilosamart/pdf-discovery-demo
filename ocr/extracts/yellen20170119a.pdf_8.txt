waiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest 

rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into 

recession.  For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy 

gradually over time--a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will 

achieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and 

inflation running at about 2 percent.    

Evaluating the Appropriate Stance of Monetary Policy 

Achieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy 

manages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years.  To sustain a 

strong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift 

toward a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that 

is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its 

potential.  But what level of the federal funds rate is neutral at the present time?  How 

quickly should the funds rate target move up to this neutral level? And how will the 

neutral rate itself evolve over time?     

To help answer such questions, the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of 

information concerning many factors, including financial markets and credit availability, 

labor market conditions and overall economic activity, wages and prices, and foreign 

economic developments.  The FOMC also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic 

models, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of how different 

monetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks.  Among the 

                                                           
valuations, particularly for commercial real estate, are high.  With regard to the linkages between labor 
utilization and financial stability, my interpretation of the historical evidence is that undesirable increases in 
leverage or the emergence of asset bubbles are not the inevitable consequence of tight labor markets per se.
