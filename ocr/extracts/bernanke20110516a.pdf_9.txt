employment benefits of leadership in a strategic industry.  A cutting-edge scientific or 

technological center can create a variety of spillovers that promote innovation, quality, 

skills acquisition, and productivity in industries located nearby; such spillovers are the 

reason that high-tech firms often locate in clusters or near leading universities.13  To the 

extent that countries gain from leadership in technologically vibrant industries or from 

local spillovers arising from inventive activity, the case for government support of R&D 

within a given country is stronger.14 

How Should Governments Provide Support for Research and Development? 

The economic arguments for government support of innovation generally imply 

that governments should focus particularly on fostering basic, or foundational, research.  

The most applied and commercially relevant research is likely to be done in any case by 

the private sector, as private firms have strong incentives to determine what the market 

demands and to meet those needs.15   

If the government decides to foster R&D, what policy instruments should it use?  

A number of potential tools exist, including direct funding of government research 

facilities, grants to university or private-sector researchers, contracts for specific projects, 

and tax incentives.  Moreover, within each of these categories, many choices must be 

made about how to structure specific programs.  Unfortunately, economists know less 

about how best to channel public support for research and development than we would 

like; it is good news, therefore, that considerable new work is being done on this topic, 

including recent initiatives on science policy by the National Science Foundation.16

14 Another argument for fostering domestic innovation is that it may have national security implications.
