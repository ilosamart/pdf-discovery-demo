interest rates can soar quickly if investors lose confidence in the ability of a government 

to manage its fiscal policy.  Although historical experience and economic theory do not

changes in government programs and tax policies.  Or the needed fiscal adjustments 

could come as a rapid and much more painful response to a looming or actual fiscal crisis 

in an environment of rising interest rates, collapsing confidence and asset values, and a 

slowing economy.  The choice is ours to make.

which the ratio of federal debt to national income is stable or moving down over the 

longer term.  This goal can be attained by bringing spending, excluding interest 

payments, roughly in line with revenues, or in other words, by approximately balancing 

the primary budget.  Given the sharp run-up in debt over the past few years, it would be
