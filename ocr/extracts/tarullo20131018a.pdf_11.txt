plans under Title II.  We expect the second round of submissions to include improvements that 

address the initial set of obstacles to resolvability identified during the first round.  

More broadly, our evaluation of the resolvability of these large firms has been further 

advanced by the resolution planning process.  Let me mention two ways in which the 

organizational structure of systemic financial firms could be shaped so as to facilitate the single-

point-of-entry approach.  One would be to ensure that losses at material operating subsidiaries, 

including in material foreign subsidiaries, could be transferred to the parent holding company in 

resolution.  The other would be to keep the firm’s parent holding company non-operational and 

otherwise “clean” through limits on the issuance of short-term debt and on the conduct of 

material business operations in the parent holding company.  The single-point-of-entry approach 

concentrates losses on the creditors and counterparties of the SIFI parent, as opposed to the 

operating subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the impending failure of a SIFI would create strong 

incentives for creditors and counterparties of the parent holding company to run.7  The single-

point-of-entry strategy will be more credible and effective if the only creditors of the parent 

holding company are holders of capital instruments, and long-term debt holders are fully aware 

they are subject to bail-in as part of any Title II resolution. 

 Another way to enhance the credibility of the FDIC’s approach is to require adequate 

loss-absorbing capacity within large financial firms.  Minimum capital requirements, 

conceptually, are designed to cover losses up to a certain statistical probability.  If an extreme tail 

event occurs and the equity of the firm is wiped out, successful resolution without taxpayer 

assistance would be most effectively accomplished if a firm had sufficient long-term, unsecured 

                                                 
7 Although long-term debtholders of a troubled SIFI parent will be contractually unable to run, a SIFI parent with 
sizeable amounts of short-term debt could face substantial runs in times of stress.  The contagion could spread to 
short-term creditors of other SIFI holding companies.
