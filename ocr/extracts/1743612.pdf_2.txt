together witH a copy of the President’s instructions to Secretary Morgenthau, 
as Chairman of the Delegation, which contained, among other things, the 
following statement*

’'The responsibility which you and the other delegates
of the American Delegation will undertake is the responsi­
bility of demonstrating to the world that international 
postwar cooperation is possible, I am. confident that you 
*111 do your best to accomplish the purposes of the con­
ference.”

In these circumstances, additions were made to the members of the 
Board’s staff who had been assisting the Treasury and they participated in 
the drafting v.ork thc.t was done at Atlantic ^ity in preparation for the con­
ference, together »ith several officers of the Federal Reserve Banks, and a 
substantial number of the »embers of the Board’s staff and officers of the 
Federal Reserve Banks participated as technicians in the work of the confer­
ence at Bretton ftoods. Governor SzymczaK accompanied me to the conference 
and I participated in the deliberations of the American Delegation which, 
together *ith the delegations representing all the other nations at the 
conference, unanimously approved the plans as finally evolved for the Inter­
national Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development.

At the conclusion of the conference the President of the United 
States sent a message to the representatives of the 44 nations conveying 
congratulations on the successful completion of their difficult task and 
containing the following statement!

’’They have prepared two further founaation stones for 
the structure of lasting peace and security. They have shown 
that the people of the United Nations can work together to 
plan the peace as well as fight the war.*1

In the light of these circumstances it se erne clear to rae that the 
Bo^rd is committed to the principle involved in these plans and to cooperate 
in helping to carry them out. Moreover, it is evident that if they should 
be put into effect, the Federal Reserve BanKS, as the central banking system 
of the country, would be called upon to play some part. I may add that in 
a letter under date of August 5, 1944, which was received from Secretary 
Morgenthau, the following statement appears:

BV*e still have before us the task of bringing to the 
attention of the people and of Congress the importance of 
the work done at Bratton woods and the necessity of parti­
cipation by the United States in the International Monetary 
Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development.
