I will begin my remarks by posing a question:  Why are long-term interest rates so 

low in the United States and in other major industrial countries?   

At first blush, the answer seems obvious:  Central banks in those countries are 

pursuing accommodative monetary policies to boost growth and reduce slack in their 

economies.  However, while central banks certainly play a key role in determining the 

behavior of long-term interest rates, theirs is only a proximate influence.  A more 

complete explanation of the current low level of rates must take account of the broader 

economic environment in which central banks are currently operating and of the 

constraints that that environment places on their policy choices. 

Let me start with a brief overview of the recent history of long-term interest rates 

in some key economies.  Chart 1 shows the 10-year government bond yields for five 

major industrial countries:  Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the 

United States.  Note that the movements in these yields are quite correlated despite some 

differences in the economic circumstances and central bank mandates in those countries.  

Further, with the notable exception of Japan, the levels of the yields have been very 

similar--indeed, strikingly so, with long-term yields declining over time and currently 

close to 2 percent in each case. The similar behavior of these yields attests to the global 

nature of the economic and financial developments of recent years, as well as to the broad 

similarity in how the monetary policymakers in the advanced economies have responded 

to these developments.  Of course, Japanese yields are clearly a case apart, as Japan has 

endured an extended period of deflation, while inflation in the other four countries has 

been positive and generally close to the stated objectives of the monetary authorities.  But
