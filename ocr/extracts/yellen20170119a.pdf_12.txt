unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s 

productive potential and the output gap.  Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of 

the Taylor rule’s prescriptions by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, holding other 

factors constant.14  Clearly, sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments 

to take such changes into account, as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary 

policy decisions and poor economic outcomes.15 

Figure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessments of 

the longer-run neutral real rate of interest.  As before, the short-dashed red line shows the 

prescriptions of the Taylor rule using the standard 2 percent assumption for R*.  The 

solid red line, however, shows the rule’s prescriptions with R* equal to 1 percent, the 

median of the longer-run projections of the real federal funds rate made by FOMC 

participants last month.  This adjustment appreciably reduces the rule’s policy 

prescriptions.  

Even with this downward adjustment of the longer-run neutral rate, however, the 

Taylor rule’s prescriptions are arguably still too restrictive.  The problem is that the rule 

ignores the likelihood that it will likely take many years before the forces now restraining 

                                                           
14 Additional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the 
unemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor 
utilization.  Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation 
rate was unusually low and involuntary part-time employment unusually high, given the level of the 
unemployment rate.  Moreover, although movements in resource utilization for the economy as a whole are 
generally proportional to changes in labor utilization, the relationship varies somewhat over time. Partly as 
a result, contemporaneous estimates of the output gap can deviate markedly from subsequent estimates for 
the same period calculated using revised data.  For example, in early 2010, the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) estimated that the output gap in 2009:Q2 was negative 7.7 percent, but the CBO has since 
lowered it to negative 6.3 percent--a large revision with important implications for assessments of the 
deviation of actual policy from the prescriptions of simple policy rules.    
15 If monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was 
2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its maximum 
sustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent.  Under such circumstances, inflation 
expectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation.
