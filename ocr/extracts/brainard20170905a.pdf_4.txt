population ratio for prime-age workers has also improved over the past year, although it 

is still 2 percentage points lower than its pre-crisis peak in 2007.   

Earlier this year, many observers saw the prospect of fiscal stimulus as presenting 

the possibility of a substantial boost to domestic demand.  Since then, however, many 

commentators have downgraded their assessments of the extent and timing of fiscal 

stimulus, and I have revised my outlook as well. 

That said, we are seeing synchronized global economic growth for the first time in 

many years.  Foreign economies--including Canada, the euro area, and China--have 

posted robust GDP growth so far this year.  This improvement has been reflected here at 

home in dollar depreciation; higher earnings and stock prices; tighter risk spreads; and an 

increase in net exports, which made a small positive contribution in the first half of this 

year after holding down GDP growth over the past several years.  In addition, there are 

indications that, before too long, central banks in several major economies could begin 

normalizing monetary policy, in many cases through adjustments to their balance sheets 

as well as their policy rates.  Those changes in foreign monetary policies could have 

important implications for term premiums and, in turn, longer-term Treasury rates, 

depending on the timing and approach.2  

Despite this benign picture for the U.S. economy and continued increases in 

resource utilization, core inflation, as measured by changes in the PCE price index for 

items other than food and energy, slowed by almost 1/2 percentage point relative to the 

pace a year ago.  Indeed, both overall and core inflation were only 1.4 percent for the
