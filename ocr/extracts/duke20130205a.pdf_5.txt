rather that smaller banks should think about the negative shocks that could affect their business 

in the future and tailor their risk-management procedures to the risks and complexities of their 

individual business models. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recently released final rules defining 

“qualified mortgages” that include safe harbors for mortgages that meet specific loan term and 

pricing criteria, including certain balloon loans made by community banks in rural or 

underserved areas.

  At the same time, they issued a new proposal that contains additional 

community bank exceptions, as well as a question about the treatment of loans to refinance 

balloon payments on mortgages that community banks may already have on their books.

Noting that smaller institutions have already demonstrated that they generally do a good job of 

servicing the loans they originate and that the investments necessary to meet the requirements 

would be unduly onerous for institutions that service a small number of loans, the CFPB also 

exempted most community banks from many of the provisions of new servicing requirements.

  I 

think such exceptions are especially important because, as I discussed in a recent speech and will 

touch upon later in my remarks, Federal Reserve research has shown that (1) community banks 

are important lenders in the mortgage market, (2) those mortgage loans represent a significant 

portion of community bank lending, and (3) community banks are quite responsible in their 

practices.
