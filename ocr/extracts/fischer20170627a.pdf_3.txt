Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability  

Participants in todayâ€™s workshops have grappled with the question of what is the 

best framework to monitor financial stability.  One approach is to focus on trends in, and 

interactions among, financial vulnerabilities across financial institutions, markets, and 

instruments.  Another approach is to track the resilience of institutions, either broad 

categories or individual systemically important institutions.  Good monitoring 

frameworks combine elements of both.  

Let me start with the vulnerabilities-focused approach, as developed by Tobias 

Adrian, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang.2  That approach defines financial vulnerabilities 

as a collection of factors that may amplify financial shocks and, when elevated, have the 

potential to generate systemic risk.  The focus is on vulnerabilities rather than shocks, 

because the timing of shocks, such as sudden drops in asset prices, are inherently hard to 

predict. Vulnerabilities, in contrast, tend to build up over time, and policies can be 

designed to help contain these vulnerabilities, reducing the likelihood of systemic events.  

Some financial vulnerabilities are cyclical in nature, rising and falling over time, 

while others are structural, stemming from longer-term forces shaping the nature of credit 

intermediation.  Informed by academic research, some of it in-house, we at the Federal 

Reserve focus on four broad cyclical vulnerabilities:  (1) financial-sector leverage, (2) 

nonfinancial-sector borrowing, (3) liquidity and maturity transformation, and (4) asset
