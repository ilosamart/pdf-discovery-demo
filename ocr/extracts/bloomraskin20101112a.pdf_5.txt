approach ensured that lenders knew immediately if a homeowner was having payment 

problems, and could take action to mitigate possible losses.  A fair bit of this kind of 

“portfolio servicing” still takes place, but as the residential real estate market shifted from 

an originate-to-hold model to an originate-to-distribute model, an industry of independent 

third-party entities emerged to service the loans on behalf of the securitization trusts.  

These trusts, as a requirement for their tax-preferred status, were supposed to be passive, 

with the management of individual loans left to the servicer.  These servicing 

arrangements are now commonplace in the industry:  In fact, the system has matured 

rapidly and experienced considerable consolidation over the past twenty years. 

 The benefits to consolidation include significant economies of scale in the 

collection and disbursal of routine payments.  But the kind of time-consuming, involved 

work that is now needed in the loss mitigation area was not contemplated at anything like 

this kind of scale, and the payment structures between the servicers and investors may not 

always be sufficient to support large-scale loan workout activity.  Unfortunately, as we 

are seeing now, there are also dramatically significant drawbacks to this model.  Third-

party servicers earn money through annual servicing fees, a myriad of other fees, and on 

float interest, and they maximize profits by keeping their costs down, streamlining 

processes wherever possible, and by buying servicing rights on pools of loans that they 

hope will require little hands-on work.  Again, for routine payment processing this all 

leads to economies of scale, and the industry has consolidated significantly in recent 

years as a result.   

But the services needed in the current housing crisis are not one-size-fits-all.  

Loan servicers likely never anticipated the drastic need for the kind of time-consuming,
