About a month ago, the Federal Reserve proposed new reporting requirements 

specifically for the systemically important insurance companies.7  These reporting requirements 

are designed, among other things, to keep us informed as to the financial condition and risk 

profile of these firms, as well as the extent to which their activities and operations could pose a 

threat to the financial stability of the United States.  The proposed reporting requirements differ 

substantially from reporting requirements for bank holding companies, and from available U.S. 

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) financial information filed with the 

SEC.  They are highly tailored to the assets, liabilities, and risks of insurance companies.  We 

look forward to receiving public comment on the proposal.

governance and risk-management standards for systemically important insurance companies will 

likely build on the core provisions of our consolidated supervisory framework for large domestic 

and foreign banking organizations, with appropriate adjustments to reflect these firms’ 

predominantly insurance business model.8  The framework will mandate standards for the 

systemically important insurance companies to follow in managing risk and will identify the 

parties responsible for ensuring the integrity of a company’s risk-management practices.  

Enhanced liquidity requirements will likely include internal control requirements, general 

comprehensive cash flow projections, contingency plans to manage liquidity stress events, and 

internal liquidity stress testing requirements.  I expect that these proposed enhanced prudential
