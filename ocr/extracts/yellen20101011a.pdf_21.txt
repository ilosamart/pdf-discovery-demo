policies we are putting in place to control systemic risk will unduly restrict the 

availability of credit, thereby retarding economic recovery.  In this case, as it should, the 

implementation of macroprudential policy is taking account of spillovers that monetary 

policy, at least now, cannot easily offset. 

Some would argue that the conduct of macroprudential and monetary policy 

should be closely coordinated, even integrated, because of the spillovers I described.17  

Indeed, the logic of this argument has led some observers to conclude that both 

macroprudential and monetary policy should be assigned to the central bank.18  As I 

noted, the Dodd-Frank Act assigned the Federal Reserve an important role in the conduct 

of macroprudential supervision, and for good reasons.  We have long experience in 

supervision, broad knowledge of financial markets, and an understanding of the linkages 

between financial markets and the economy.  In addition, the insights derived from our 

supervisory role benefit the conduct of monetary policy.  But the pursuit of 

macroprudential supervision under the new legislation involves other regulatory agencies 

beside the Fed, and the new Financial Stability Oversight Council will play an important 

role.  And, of course, the Fed will keep sole responsibility for the conduct of monetary 

policy, retaining its independence.  There are important reasons for this approach.  One is 

that systemic risk surveillance will benefit from the perspectives of regulators with 

different windows on the financial system, all participating in the oversight council.
