framework, and economists have studied a variety of approaches to enhance the 

independence and credibility of monetary policymakers.6 

To be clear, I am by no means advocating unconditional independence for central 

banks.  First, for its policy independence to be democratically legitimate, the central bank 

must be accountable to the public for its actions.  As I have already mentioned, the goals 

of policy should be set by the government, not by the central bank itself; and the central 

bank must regularly demonstrate that it is appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.  

Demonstrating its fidelity to its mandate in turn requires that the central bank be 

transparent about its economic outlook and policy strategy, as I will discuss further in a 

moment.  Second, the independence afforded central banks for the making of monetary 

policy should not be presumed to extend without qualification to its nonmonetary 

functions.  For example, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have 

significant responsibilities for oversight of the banking system.  To be effective, bank 

regulators and supervisors also require an appropriate degree of independence; in 

particular, the public must be confident that regulators’ decisions about the soundness of 

specific institutions are not unduly influenced by political pressures or lobbying.  But for 

a number of reasons, the nature and scope of the independence granted regulatory 

agencies is likely to be somewhat different than that afforded monetary policy.  In the 

conduct of its regulatory and supervisory activities, the central bank should enjoy a 

degree of independence that is no greater and no less than that of other agencies engaged 

                                                            
6 Rogoff (1985) suggested the appointment of a central banker predisposed toward keeping inflation low 
and stable as a solution to the time-inconsistency problem; additional discussions are presented in Persson 
and Tabellini (1993) and Walsh (2003, chapter 8).  Alesina and Gatti (1995) and Waller and Walsh (1996) 
address how establishing an independent, nonpartisan central bank can help insulate monetary policy from 
political pressures.
