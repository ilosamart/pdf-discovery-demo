greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity, and there is greater certainty 

regarding the “Brexit” vote, seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of 

these developments.  This is especially true since the feedback loop through exchange 

rate and financial market channels appears to be elevated.  In light of this amplified 

feedback loop, when conditions are appropriate for a policy move, it will be important 

that it be understood that any subsequent moves would be conditioned on further 

evidence confirming continued progress toward our objectives and not as inevitable steps 

on a preset course. 

Indeed, several factors suggest that the appropriate path to return monetary policy 

to a neutral stance could turn out to be quite shallow and gradual in the medium term.  In 

particular, it appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate, or the real federal funds 

rate consistent with the economy remaining at full employment and 2 percent inflation, 

may be quite low.  With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and 

disinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the neutral rate may 

be lower and today’s federal funds rate closer to neutral than previously anticipated.  

Although we cannot observe the neutral rate directly, a variety of models suggests that it 

is currently very low relative to historical norms.  Earlier in the recovery it seemed likely 

that the low level of the neutral rate was largely due to temporary factors, such as tight 

credit, weak consumer confidence, and the loss in household wealth following the crisis.  

However, with the recovery well into its seventh full year, credit in many markets is 

widely available, while consumer confidence and household net worth are at high levels.
