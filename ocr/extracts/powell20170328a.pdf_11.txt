Members of the Board of Governors and Presidents of the Reserve Banks arrive at 

their own independent viewpoints about the economy and the appropriate path for 

monetary policy. Congress has assigned the FOMC the task of achieving stable prices 

and maximum employment; however, policymakers may disagree on the best way to 

achieve those goals.19  The System’s structure encourages exploration of a diverse range 

of views and promotes a healthy policy debate.20  In the modern Federal Reserve System, 

each Reserve Bank has an independent research department, with its own external 

publications.  In addition, while the members of the Board tend to focus on developments 

in the nation as a whole, the Reserve Bank Presidents bring specialized information about 

their regional economies to the FOMC discussion.  Before each FOMC meeting, Reserve 

Bank Presidents consult with their staff of economists as well as their boards of directors, 

business contacts in their Districts, and market experts to develop their independent 

views of appropriate monetary policy. 

The FOMC works to achieve a consensus policy by blending inputs from the 

members of the Board of Governors and from the Reserve Bank Presidents under the 

leadership of its Chair.  By tradition, the Chair of the Board has been chosen as the Chair 

of the FOMC and has had a central role in setting the agenda for the FOMC and 

developing consensus among the Committee’s members.  In addition, the Chair is the 

most visible public face of the Federal Reserve System.
