of monetary policy will return both tools to a more neutral setting over time.  That 

process can be said to have begun in 2014, when the FOMC ended its asset purchases and 

began active discussions on lifting the federal funds rate from its lower bound.9  Our first 

rate hike came in December 2015, with another in December 2016, and one additional 

increase so far this year.  The normalization process is projected to have several years left 

to run. 

In the case of the federal funds rate, the endpoint of that process will occur when 

our target reaches the long-run neutral rate of interest.  Estimates of that rate are subject 

to significant uncertainty.  The median estimate of its level by FOMC participants in 

March was 3 percent, more than a full percentage point below pre-crisis estimates.  This 

decline in the long-run neutral rate, and an even larger decline in the short-run neutral 

rate, imply that even the very low rates of recent years may be providing less support to 

the economy than may appear.  At present, the median FOMC participant estimates that 

we will reach a long-run neutral level by year-end 2019 if the economy performs about as 

expected (figure 6).    

The Balance Sheet 

In September 2014, the FOMC outlined its plans for the balance sheet.  That 

initial guidance has been supplemented over time in other FOMC communications, most 

recently in the minutes of the May meeting.  Here is a summary of the key points: 

                                                 
9 Over this period, the size of the balance sheet has been maintained by our reinvestment policy, which I 
will consider later in the remarks.
