monetary policy actions affect advanced and emerging market countries differently?  Do

organizing this conference and fostering research and debate on questions vital to our 

understanding of the economy.  Answering these questions will help the Federal 

Reserveâ€™s efforts to promote a healthy economy, and I am grateful for the opportunity to 

speak to you today and be part of this important discussion.
