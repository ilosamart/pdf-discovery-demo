declined, and the median estimate by FOMC participants stood at 2.9 percent in 

September.  Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even lower than that today and 

will only return to its long-run value over time.9  The low level of the neutral interest rate 

has several important implications.  First, today’s low rates are not as stimulative as they 

seem--consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below 

target and housing construction remains far below pre-crisis levels.  Second, with rates so 

low, central banks are not well positioned to counteract a renewed bout of weakness.  

Third, persistently low interest rates can raise financial stability concerns.  A long period 

of very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking and, over time, to 

unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth.  These are risks that we monitor 

carefully.  Higher growth would increase the neutral rate and help address these issues. 

Turning to the outlook for monetary policy, incoming data show an economy that 

is growing at a healthy pace, with solid payroll job gains and inflation gradually moving 

up to 2 percent.  In my view, the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has clearly 

strengthened since our previous meeting earlier this month.  Of course, the path of rates 

will depend on the path of the economy.  With inflation below target, relatively slow 

growth, and some slack remaining in the economy, the Committee has been patient about 

raising rates.  That patience has paid dividends.  But moving too slowly could eventually 

mean that the Committee would have to tighten policy abruptly to avoid overshooting our 

goals.
