buffers held by the large banking institutions, it would be important to make a 

compensating adjustment to the countercyclical buffer in order to achieve the same 

overall resilience to financial vulnerabilities.

As a rough rule of thumb--and as described in the Boardâ€™s framework for 

implementing the CCyB, which was finalized in September 2016--the criteria for setting 

the CCyB are calibrated so that the CCyB will be above its minimum value about one-

third of the time, assuming that vulnerabilities evolve as they did pre-crisis.  It is worth 

noting that some other jurisdictions have designed their countercyclical buffer 

requirement to be above zero roughly half of the time--spanning a greater range of 

economic conditions than in the United States. This may reflect a difference in the 

relative emphasis on structural buffers relative to cyclically varying buffers.  It is worth 

noting that, although U.S. structural buffers are on the stronger end of the range 

internationally, the U.S. banking system is also among the healthiest and most 

competitive in the world.  Credit growth is robust, and banks are registering strong

profitability relative to their international peers.  

Conclusion

Our financial stability agenda seeks to reduce the likelihood and severity of 

financial crises.  In the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession, we learned 

important lessons about the critical necessity of monitoring emerging financial 

vulnerabilities in a systematic fashion and taking corresponding prudential, 

macroprudential, and countercyclical policies to build resilience.  We undertake 

systematic assessment of financial vulnerabilities as an important input into our 

policymaking processes--helping to calibrate the prudential, macroprudential, and
