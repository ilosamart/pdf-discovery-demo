When the central banks in many advanced economies embarked on 

unconventional monetary policy, it raised concerns that there might be differences in the 

cross-border transmission of unconventional relative to conventional monetary policy.1  

These concerns were sufficient to warrant a special Group of Seven (G-7) statement in 

2013 establishing ground rules to address possible exchange rate effects of the changing 

composition of monetary policy.2  

Today the world confronts similar questions in reverse.  In the United States, in 

my assessment, normalization of the federal funds rate is now well under way, and the 

Federal Reserve is advancing plans to allow the balance sheet to run off at a gradual and 

predictable pace.  And for the first time in many years, the global economy is 

experiencing synchronous growth, and authorities in the euro area and the United 

Kingdom are beginning to discuss the time when the need for monetary accommodation 

will diminish.  

Unlike in previous tightening cycles, many central banks currently have two tools 

for removing accommodation.  They can therefore pursue alternative normalization 

strategies--first seeking to guide policy rates higher before initiating balance sheet runoff, 

as in the United States, or instead starting to shrink the balance sheet before initiating a

remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that 
we will not target exchange rates.”  See Group of Seven (2013), “Statement by G7 Finance Ministers and 
Central Bank Governors,” February 12, paragraph 1, www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm130212.htm.  The 
corresponding Group of Twenty statement included the new commitment:  “We will not target our 
exchange rates for competitive purposes.”  See Group of Twenty (2013), “Communiqué of Meeting of G20 
Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,” February 16, paragraph 5,
