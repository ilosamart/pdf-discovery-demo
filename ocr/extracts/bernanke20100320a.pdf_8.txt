institutions that are the source of the too-big-to-fail problem. 

I don’t want to understate the difficulties of creating an effective resolution 

framework for large, interconnected firms.  Such firms can be extraordinarily complex,

The resolution of large institutions whose operations span many countries poses

each country naturally seek to protect the interests of depositors and creditors in their 

own jurisdictions.  We must also recognize that such resolutions might well take place in 

the context of a broader crisis, in which the government might be forced to address 

problems at multiple firms simultaneously.  Careful planning is therefore essential.  An 

idea worth exploring is to require firms to develop and maintain a so-called living will, 

which will help firms and regulators identify ways to simplify and untangle the firm 

before a crisis occurs.1  

The Federal Reserve and Community Banks

mutual concerns about the too-big-to-fail problem.  Our interest in community banks has

attempts to establish a U.S. central bank, intentionally avoided creating a single,
