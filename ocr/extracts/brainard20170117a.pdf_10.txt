1/4 percentage point from a year earlier.13  In addition, market measures of longer-run 

inflation compensation based on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields have 

improved about 40 basis points relative to the very depressed levels prevailing through 

much of the preceding year, although, even with this increase, inflation compensation 

remains well below historical norms.   

In sum, the economy continues to make gradual progress toward our goals.  How 

quickly remaining slack is utilized and inflation returns to target depends on future 

growth in activity.  Real GDP appears to have increased by about 2 percent last year, the 

same pace as the year before.  Consumer spending has been relatively robust--rising at 

more than a 3 percent annual rate in the three months ending in November--but business 

fixed investment has been sluggish--increasing only 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter--

and has changed little, on net, since the middle of 2014.  However, measures of both 

business and consumer sentiment have moved up noticeably recently, potentially 

signaling a stronger pace of investment and consumer spending in the months ahead. 

Meanwhile, changes in financial conditions have been somewhat offsetting since early 

November, with equity prices rising 7 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields are up 50 

basis points, and the dollar is up 4 percent.  Based on recent spending indicators, we 

might expect progress to continue to be gradual and steady.  However, if fiscal policy 

changes lead to a more rapid elimination of slack, policy adjustment would, all else being 

equal, likely be more rapid than otherwise, with the conditions the FOMC has set for a 

                                                 
13 Oil is an important input in the production and distribution of many consumer goods and services, such 
as transportation services.  As a result, when the price of oil drops, production costs decline, and at least 
some of these cost reductions are typically passed on to consumers over time in the form of lower prices.
