Housing and Government  

Why are governments involved in housing markets?  Housing is a basic human 

need, and politically important--and rightly so.  Using a once-popular term, housing is a 

merit good--it can be produced by the private sector, but its benefit to society is deemed 

by many great enough that governments strive to make it widely available.4  As such, 

over the course of time, governments have supported homebuilding and in most countries 

have also encouraged homeownership.5  

Governments are involved in housing in a myriad of ways.  One way is through 

incentives for homeownership.  In many countries, including the United States, taxpayers 

can deduct interest paid on home mortgages, and various initiatives by state and local 

authorities support lower-income homebuyers.  France and Germany created 

government-subsidized home-purchase savings accounts.  And Canada allows early 

withdrawal from government-provided retirement pension funds for home purchases.6   

And--as we all know--governments are also involved in housing finance.  They 

guarantee credit to consumers through housing agencies such as the U.S. Federal Housing 

Administration or the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.7  The Canadian 

government also guarantees mortgages on banks’ books.  And at various points in time, 

jurisdictions have explicitly or implicitly backstopped various intermediaries critical to 

the mortgage market.   

                                                 
4 The concept of a merit good is defined in Musgrave (1987).  Research suggests that homeownership is 
correlated with higher educational attainment (Aaronson 2000), community involvement (DiPasquale and 
Glaeser, 1999) and lower crime incidence (Rohe and Lindblad, 2013).    
5 An exception to the rule is Germany, where most government policies focus on subsidizing renting, not 
homeownership.  See Campbell (2013).
