revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be 

adjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve and maintain our dual objectives of 

maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Reflecting global economic and financial 

developments since December, however, the pace of rate increases is now expected to be 

somewhat slower.  For example, the median of FOMC participants’ projections for the 

federal funds rate is now only 0.9 percent for the end of 2016 and 1.9 percent for the end 

of 2017, both 1/2 percentage point below the December medians. 

As has been widely discussed, the level of inflation-adjusted or real interest rates 

needed to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in 

recent years.  Although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence 

on balance indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real rate--that is, the level of the real 

federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy 

was operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero.3  However, the current real 

federal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 1-1/4 percentage point, when measured 

using the 12-month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures 

                                                 
although the median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage point, median 
projections for subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were 
almost unrevised for all years.  For additional information on the Summary of Economic Projections to be 
released with the March 2016 FOMC minutes, see

3 The neutral rate is not directly observable.  However, we intuitively know that it must have run well 
below its historical norm in recent years because otherwise the economy would have expanded at a much 
more rapid pace with the nominal federal funds rate near zero.  As discussed in my December 2, 2015, 
speech to the Economic Club of Washington (Yellen, 2015), empirical evidence supports this intuition.  I 
showed that model-based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real short-
term interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices 
to changes in the economy, are currently close to zero in four macroeconomic models used by Federal 
Reserve staff.  Time series estimates of a different concept of the natural rate that is more similar to the 
neutral rate definition used in this speech, such as Laubach and Williams (2016) and Lubik and Matthes 
(2015), are near historical lows.  See also Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for empirical evidence of a 
decline in the longer-run level of the natural rate, along with measures of the uncertainty attached to 
estimates of its current value.
