appreciation, partially reducing their interest rates, and in some countries also using 

capital controls.   

Along with the boost from U.S. monetary policy during this period, many other 

factors contributed to the easing of global financial conditions between 2009 and 2012, 

including macroeconomic policy in a number of other countries and other measures that 

supported stabilization of the global financial system.  EME sovereign yields declined by 

more during that period than can be explained by movements in U.S. Treasury yields 

alone, and there was a worldwide recovery in markets for riskier assets.18   

I would also argue strongly that U.S. monetary policies were not beggar thy 

neighbor policies in that, on balance, they generally did not drain demand from other 

economies.  Federal Reserve staff analysis finds that an easing of monetary policy in the 

United States benefits foreign economies from both stronger U.S. activity and improved 

global financial conditions.  It also has an offsetting contractionary effect on foreign 

economies because their currencies appreciate against the dollar.  But, on average, 

model-based estimates imply that the net effect on foreign economies appears to be both 

modest in magnitude and most likely positive, on net, for most countries.19  Moreover, 

because these models do not fully capture benefits from the role of Federal Reserve 

policies in alleviating the financial market stress and boosting confidence, positive 

spillovers abroad are likely to be somewhat larger than implied by the models, especially 

under conditions of extreme financial market stress.   

18 See Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014).  And, over a longer sample, Ahmed and Zlate (forthcoming) 
show that capital flows to EMEs are affected by factors other than relative interest rates, including relative 
growth prospects and global risk sentiment.  
19 Simulations of the Federal Reserve Board's econometric models of the global economy suggest that the 
effects are roughly offsetting, so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not 
appear, on net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market economies. 
Similar results are obtained model analysis presented in International Monetary Fund (2013).
