the portfolio of private investors or the central bank, for in the end the gains or 

losses of the central bank are transferred to the government, and via the 

government budget constraint, are returned to private individuals.  This is 

Ricardian equivalence in a slightly different context than examined by Robert 

Barro.18   

Whether it applies in practice is an empirical issue, with empirical 

evidence from many papers written in the Fed and elsewhere suggesting a 

significant impact in the expected direction from quantitative easing actions 

undertaken by the Fed and other central banks.19 

8. Money Supply versus Interest Rate.  At present, the Neo-Wicksellian approach 

developed by Woodford and others is dominant, relative to the explicitly 

monetary approach to monetary policy used by Patinkin and others.  I suspect 

this situation will continue.  But I believe that we need to consider both 

approaches to monetary policy, for monetary policy affects the economy not 

only through the Euler equation as in Woodford, but also through direct 

effects on current demands for goods described by Patinkin’s use of the real-

balance effect and by Wicksell’s explanation of price dynamics described 

earlier. 

9. The fundamental impact of Michael Woodford on Fed thinking:20 The most 

direct impact of Woodford on Fed thinking and analysis comes from his neo-

Wicksellian analysis of monetary policy.  Essentially, Woodford has
