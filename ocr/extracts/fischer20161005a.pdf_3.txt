a simple observation that illustrates this point:  The unemployment rate in the United 

States has dropped from a peak of 10 percent in the aftermath of the Great Recession to 

just 4.9 percent today.  Yet, over the same period, yields on nominal and inflation-

indexed 10-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen around 180 basis points and 

140 basis points, respectively.  This observation suggests that perhaps structural factors 

are pulling down what economists often refer to as the longer-run equilibrium or natural 

rate of interest.   

Knut Wicksell, the great Swedish economist, emphasized the concept of an 

equilibrium level of interest rates in his influential work.  In his 1898 book, Interest and 

Prices, he wrote that “there is a certain level of the average rate of interest which is such 

that the general level of prices has no tendency to move either upwards or downwards.”2  

In modern language, this level of the interest rate is usually referred to as the natural rate 

of interest.  Applying Wicksell’s insights to the circumstances we face today, the fact that 

both inflation and interest rates have remained very low over the past several years 

suggests that our current interest rate environment may well reflect, at least in part, a very 

low level of the natural rate of interest.    

If we knew the natural rate precisely, conducting monetary policy would be 

relatively straightforward.  Central bankers could easily assess their policy stance--which 

could be measured, for instance, as the difference between actual and natural interest 

rates--and adjust it as needed.  If only life were that simple!  In reality, given that the 

natural rate of interest cannot be directly observed, Wicksell proposed that the central 

bank follow a simple interest rate rule.  Given that he believed that the sole function of

Fischer (Jena), was first published in English in 1936--see Wicksell (1936).
