However, complexity also poses challenges.  While the financial crisis arguably 

started in the nonbank sector, it quickly spread to the banking sector because of 

interconnections that were hard for regulators to detect and greatly underappreciated by 

investors and risk managers in the private sector.6  For example, when banks provide 

loans directly to households and businesses, the chain of intermediation is short and 

simple; in the nonbank sector, intermediation chains are long and often involve a 

multitude of both banks and other nonbank financial institutions.7   

Regulatory, supervisory, and financial industry reforms since the crisis 

U.S. regulators have undertaken a number of reforms to address weaknesses 

revealed by the crisis.  The most significant set of reforms has focused on the banking 

sector and, in particular, on regulation and supervision of the largest, most interconnected 

firms.  Changes include significantly higher capital requirements, additional capital 

charges for global systemically important banks, macro-based stress testing, and 

requirements that improve the resilience of banksâ€™ liquidity risk profile.   

Changes for the nonbank sector have been more limited, but steps have been 

taken, including the final rule on risk retention in securitization, issued jointly by the 

Federal Reserve and five other agencies in October of last year, and the new MMF rules 

issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July of last year, following

7 For example, in the old days, a bank would originate a mortgage and hold it in its portfolio.  Today, a 
bank might originate the same mortgage, but, instead of holding that loan on its balance sheet, it could 
securitize it--in effect, sell it--and the resulting security might be purchased with the help of short-term 
funding provided by an MMF.  And the process might not end there:  Next, that mortgage-backed security 
might be sold and repackaged into several new securities, and so on.
