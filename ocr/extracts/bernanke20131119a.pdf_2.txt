Nearly eight years ago, when I began my time as Chairman, one of my priorities 

was to make the Federal Reserve more transparent--and, in particular, to make monetary 

policy as transparent and open as reasonably possible.  I believed then, as I do today, that 

transparency in monetary policy enhances public understanding and confidence, 

promotes informed discussion of policy options, increases the accountability of monetary 

policymakers for reaching their mandated objectives, and ultimately makes policy more 

effective by tightening the linkage between monetary policy, financial conditions, and the 

real economy.  Of course, responding to the financial crisis and its aftermath soon 

became the Federal Reserve’s main focus.  As it has turned out, however, following the 

stabilization of the financial system, supporting our economy’s recovery from the deepest 

recession since the Great Depression has required a more prominent role for 

communication and transparency in monetary policy than ever before.   

In my remarks, I will discuss how the Federal Reserve’s communications have 

evolved in recent years and how enhanced transparency is increasing the effectiveness of 

monetary policy.  Despite the challenges inherent in communicating in an unprecedented 

economic and policy environment about a future that can be only imperfectly foreseen, I 

will explain why I believe that policy transparency remains an essential element of the 

Federal Reserve’s strategy for meeting its economic objectives.  

Policy Frameworks and Communication 

To understand the critical role that the Federal Reserve’s communications about 

monetary policy has played in recent years, it is useful to start by discussing the role of 

monetary policy communication more generally, including the relationship between 

policy communication and the broader policy framework.
