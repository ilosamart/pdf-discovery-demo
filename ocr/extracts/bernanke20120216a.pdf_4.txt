financial condition of community banks appear to have strengthened somewhat, 

suggesting that, for the most part, the industry is meeting its challenges.  Profits of 

smaller banks have risen for the past several quarters.  Although the ratios of 

nonperforming assets remain high in many cases, asset quality appears to be stabilizing, 

and bank provisions for loan losses are decreasing.  In addition, capital ratios are steadily 

improving at community banks, in part due to increases in retained earnings and a greater 

ability to raise new capital. 

Let me take this opportunity to mention one concern that is of particular relevance 

to the Federal Reserve:  A common complaint on the part of some community bankers is 

that very low interest rates hurt their profitability by squeezing net interest margins.  

Since the onset of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy has been 

accommodative, as you know.  In particular, the federal funds target rate, which stood at 

5-1/4 percent in mid-2007, was lowered to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the end of 2008 

and has since remained at that level.  Although these policies do not seem to have led to 

much change in aggregate measures of net interest margins, at least thus far, we continue 

to hear that many banks are feeling pressures from this source.  

The effects of the configuration of interest rates on banks and other financial 

institutions are certainly part of the discussion when we strive to determine the 

appropriate monetary policy.  Several points should be made, though.  First, it is true that 

the difference between the yield on safe assets such as Treasury securities and the rate 

paid on deposits is currently relatively low.  However, banks’ net interest margins also 

depend importantly on the difference between the return on the loans the banks make and 

the return on their alternative investments in safe assets.  When loan demand is weak,
