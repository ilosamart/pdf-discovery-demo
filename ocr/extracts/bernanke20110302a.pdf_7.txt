Longer-Run Fiscal Challenges for States and Localities 

Although my focus thus far has been on the near term, state and local 

governments are also confronting some difficult fiscal challenges in the longer term.  

Indeed, with the retirement of public employees who are part of the baby-boom 

generation and the continued rise in health-care costs, meeting obligations for pension 

and retiree health-care expenses will become increasingly difficult for many states and 

localities.  Estimates of state and local governments’ unfunded pension liabilities for the 

nation as a whole span a wide range, with some researchers putting the figure in the 

neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion.2  Some governments are beginning to take 

difficult steps to address this problem, although their ability to change plan provisions is 

limited by the strong legal protection (including, in some states, constitutional protection) 

accorded to accrued pension benefits of public employees in many jurisdictions.3  

State and local governments also will have to address the burgeoning costs of 

retiree health benefits.  Estimates of these costs are subject to substantially greater 

uncertainty than are those for pension liabilities, largely because of the difficulty inherent 

in projecting overall health-care costs decades into the future.  In addition, retiree health 

plans generally do not have the same degree of explicit protection as do pensions and 

thus may be more subject to change.  With these uncertainties in mind, the prospective 

costs of providing retiree health benefits--though certainly consequential--appear to be 

somewhat smaller than unfunded pension liabilities.  For example, one recent estimate

generally seem to be accorded a lower level of protection.
