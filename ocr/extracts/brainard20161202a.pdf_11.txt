designed for niche borrowers became increasingly marketed to low- and moderate-

income borrowers who could not sustain them, ultimately with disastrous results.  In 

addition to the financial consequences for individual consumers, the drive for 

unsustainable profit can contribute to distrust in the financial system, which is 

detrimental to the broader economy.  It is critical that firms providing financial services 

consider the long-term social benefit of the products and services they offer.  Concerns 

regarding long-term sustainability are magnified in situations where banks may bear 

credit or other longer-term operational risks related to products delivered by a fintech 

firm.  One useful question to ask is whether a productâ€™s success depends on consumers 

making ill-informed choices; if so, or if the product otherwise fails to provide sufficient 

value to consumers, it is not going to be seen as responsible and may not prove 

sustainable over time.   

The key challenge for regulatory agencies is to create the right balance. 

Ultimately, regulators should be prepared to appropriately tailor regulatory or supervisory 

expectations, to the extent possible within our respective authorities, to facilitate fintech 

innovations that produce benefits for consumers, businesses, and the financial system.  At 

the same time, any contemplated adjustments must also appropriately manage 

corresponding risks.
