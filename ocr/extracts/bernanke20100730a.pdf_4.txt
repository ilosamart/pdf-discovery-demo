Financial conditions--though much improved since the depth of the financial 

crisis--have become somewhat less supportive of economic growth in recent months.  

Notably, concerns about the ability of Greece and a number of other euro-area countries 

to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt roiled global 

financial markets in the spring, including our own.  In response to these fiscal pressures, 

European leaders put in place a number of strong measures, including an assistance 

package for Greece and backstop financing for euro-area countries.  And, recently, 

European banking supervisors released the results of comprehensive stress tests of their 

banks.1

Like financial conditions generally, the state of the U.S. banking system has also 

improved significantly since the worst of the crisis.  Loss rates on most types of loans 

seem to be peaking, and, in the aggregate, bank capital ratios have risen to new highs.  

However, many banks continue to have a large volume of troubled loans, and bank 

lending standards remain tight.  With credit demand weak and with banks writing down 

problem credits, bank loans outstanding have continued to decline.  Small businesses, 

which depend importantly on bank credit, have been particularly hard hit by restrictive 

lending standards.  At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of 

funds to creditworthy small businesses.  Along with the other banking supervisors, we 

have emphasized to banks and examiners that lenders should do all they can to meet the 

needs of creditworthy borrowers, including small businesses.

  On net, these measures appear to have reduced concerns in financial markets 

about European prospects.
