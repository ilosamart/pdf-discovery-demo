I appreciate your invitation to participate in this afternoon’s panel discussion.  In 

my remarks, I will discuss how U.S. monetary policy actions affect our foreign trading 

partners, with particular focus on how foreign economies have responded to the Federal 

Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) ongoing normalization of policy rates.1   

Spillovers from the Fed’s Unconventional Policies 

Extensive empirical research on spillovers--including by Federal Reserve and 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff members--indicates that spillovers from the 

actions of major central banks occur through several important channels.2  While the 

exchange rate is a key channel of transmission and gets a great deal of attention in the 

public debate about monetary spillovers, it is not the only channel.  U.S. monetary policy 

also affects foreign economies by influencing U.S. domestic demand and by affecting 

global financial conditions.    

My reading of the evidence is that the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary 

policy during the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath probably raised foreign gross 

domestic product (GDP) overall.3  While U.S. monetary easing caused the dollar to 

depreciate, which reduced foreign GDP by shifting demand toward cheaper U.S. goods, 

foreign economies benefited from a stronger expansion in U.S. domestic 

demand.  Moreover, U.S. monetary easing also stimulated foreign GDP by depressing 

foreign bond yields and raising the prices of risky assets.

Market Committee.  I am grateful to Chris Erceg for his assistance. 
2 There is a large empirical literature assessing the spillovers from Federal Reserve policy actions, 
including those from unconventional policies such as large-scale asset purchases--for example, Fratzscher, 
Lo Duca, and Straub (2013); Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014); Neely (2015); and Sahay and others 
(2014).     
3 My November 11, 2016, speech (Fischer, 2016) provides a more detailed discussion of spillovers from 
U.S. monetary policy, including some quantitative estimates that draw on the analysis of Ammer and others 
(2016).
