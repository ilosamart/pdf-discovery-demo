Thanks very much. It’s a pleasure to be part of this panel on the future of financial 

globalization.  I will focus my remarks on one important aspect of this issue--namely, the 

growing use of wholesale dollar funding by global financial institutions.  I’ll begin by 

briefly discussing research I’ve been doing, along with my coauthors Victoria Ivashina 

and David Scharfstein, which examines some of the consequences of this funding model 

during times of market stress.1  I’ll then touch on the policy implications of this and 

related work.  But first, the usual disclaimer:  The views that follow are my own and do 

not necessarily reflect the thinking of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market 

Committee. 

By way of background, the dollar liabilities of foreign banks have grown rapidly 

in the past two decades and now stand at about $8 trillion, roughly on par with those of 

U.S. banks.2  A significant proportion of foreign banks’ dollar liabilities are raised via 

U.S. branches, most of which are legally precluded from raising deposits insured by the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The main source of funding for these branches, 

therefore, comes from uninsured wholesale claims such as large time deposits, making 

the cost and availability of such dollar funding highly sensitive to changing perceptions 

of these banks’ creditworthiness. 

In our work, we asked how shocks to the ability of foreign banks to raise dollar 

funding might lead to changes in their lending.  We began with a simple conceptual 

model:  Imagine a European bank that lends in euros to European firms and in dollars to
