most likely to run in a future stress event, and the volume of such funding is now 

significantly below pre-crisis peaks.   

Taken together, the evidence on these first two vulnerabilities strongly supports 

the view that financial institutions and markets are substantially more resilient than they 

were before the crisis.  Indeed, the American financial system has successfully weathered 

some periods of significant stress over the past several years.9  

The third vulnerability is excessive debt loads at households and businesses.  

Credit booms have often led to credit busts and sometimes to painful economic 

downturns.  When the bust comes, those who have overborrowed tend to sharply reduce 

their spending.  Defaults typically rise faster than had been expected, which may put 

financial institutions into distress.  These effects may combine to bring a serious 

economic downturn. 

This boom-bust pattern was clear in measures of household debt around the crisis 

period, with mortgage debt rising far above its historical trend and then contracting 

sharply (see figure 5).  After the contraction, household debt has grown only moderately.  

The net increase in mortgage debt has been among borrowers with higher credit scores.  

While heavily indebted households always suffer in a downturn, all of this suggests that 

household debt would not present a systemic stability threat if the economy sours.  

Nonfinancial business borrowing presents a subtler story.  With corporate debt, 

the United States has not faced a massive credit boom like that experienced with 

residential mortgages before the recent crisis.  Instead, after controlling for its trend,

large appreciation of the Swiss franc in January 2015, and the market volatility associated with global 
growth concerns in late 2015.
