possibility would be increased if market participants attached undue weight to specific 

capital or loss numbers released by the government. 

 In practical terms, there are several ways we might increase transparency.  One, of 

course, would be to follow the SCAP precedent, with periodic release of detailed 

information about the assumptions, methods, and results of a cross-firm, horizontal, 

forward-looking exercise, including firm-specific outcomes.  This approach would 

probably maximize both the potential benefits and potential risks.  Note, however, that 

the possibility of a destabilizing market reaction may be lower if such information is 

released frequently, as major unpleasant surprises would be less likely with frequent, 

detailed disclosures.  Of course, significant changes in the economic environment might 

still lead to unpleasant surprises when the results are released.5   

 A second option would be to provide details about the assumptions and methods 

supervisors employed in the stress tests but withhold public release of results for 

individual banks.  This practice could be coupled with a requirement for more systematic, 

timely, and consistent disclosure by the largest banks of information on material 

firmwide risk positions and exposures, funding and liquidity profiles, operating 

performance, and other measures.  Like the first approach, this option would have the 

benefit of opening supervisors’ methods to discussion.  By increasing the disclosure of 

banks’ risk exposures, this approach would also enhance market discipline, as market 

participants could make their own forward-looking assessments of banks’ conditions.  

However, some benefit would be lost, since the information from individual banks would 

not have been standardized or verified by regulators.  Concomitantly, while the risk of an 

                                                 
5 In addition, it would be important to assure that the routine release of selected supervisory information did 
not undermine our ability to maintain the confidentiality of other supervisory information.
