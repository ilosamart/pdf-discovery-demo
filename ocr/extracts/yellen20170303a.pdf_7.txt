large-scale securities purchases, so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when 

the FOMC’s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to 

scaling it back.8  

2014: A Turning Point for Monetary Policy 

By late 2013, the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient 

progress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its 

large-scale securities purchases.  But we reiterated that these purchases would continue 

until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially.  The U.S. economy 

made notable progress toward the FOMC’s statutory goals during 2014, with the 

unemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its Great-

Recession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also 

showing improvement:  Payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly; 

and the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the 

labor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels.  We were also seeing progress on 

achieving our price stability goal:  Total inflation as measured by changes in the headline 

personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by 

mid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013.  Inflation seemed to be 

moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, a level that the FOMC judges to be 

consistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure 

prominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions but high enough to serve 

as a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address 

economic weakness.
