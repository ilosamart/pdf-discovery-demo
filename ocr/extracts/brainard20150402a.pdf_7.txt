over $106,000.12  Even adjusting for family income, it appears that, on average, 

minorities make greater use of student loan debt than their white counterparts.13   

In most cases, the investments in education undertaken during the Great 

Recession will turn out to be positive over the longer term, even for individuals with 

loans to pay off.  However, there are several factors that might substantially reduce the 

expected return of some of these educational investments.  The first important 

determinant of whether an investment in education pays off is whether it leads to the 

successful completion of a degree.  Recent data suggest that fewer than 60 percent of 

students who have started a bachelor’s degree program graduate with their degree, and 

only 30 percent of those who have started an associate’s degree or certificate program 

will finish their degree.14  The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Household Economics 

and Decisionmaking (SHED) indicated that students who had not completed a degree 

consider the cost of the education not to have been worth the investment by significantly 

larger margins than those who had.15

bachelor’s degree recipients graduate with student loan debt, compared with 66 percent of Hispanic 
graduates and 64 percent of white graduates.  See Sandy Baum and Patricia Steele (2010), “Who Borrows

Associate’s degree and certificate completion rates are for within 150 percent of normal completion time 
for the 2007 entering cohort.  See table 326.10 and table 326.20 in the “Digest of Education Statistics”
