For similar reasons, we have supported the creation of a Systemic Risk Council 

made up of the financial supervisors.  Such a council would provide a forum for agencies 

with differing responsibilities and perspectives to share information and approaches, and 

would facilitate identification and mitigation of emerging threats to financial stability.  At 

the same time, consistent with the reportâ€™s recommendation that the lines of 

accountability for systemic oversight be clearly drawn, we believe the council should not 

be directly involved in rule-writing and supervision.  Rather, those functions should 

remain with the relevant supervisors, with the council in a coordinating role.  

Even as the legislative process moves forward, at the Federal Reserve we have 

already taken a number of steps to reorient and strengthen our supervision of the largest, 

most complex financial firms that we oversee and to broaden our field of vision to 

incorporate macroprudential concerns.  For example, in my view a critical feature of a 

successful systemic approach to supervision is a multidisciplinary perspective.  Our 

experience a year ago with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or the SCAP 

(popularly known as the bank stress tests), demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of 

employing such a perspective.  We are working to ensure that our supervision of large 

banking organizations and financial market utilities makes use of the wide range of skills 

of Federal Reserve staff, including those of economists, financial market specialists, 

payments systems experts, accountants, and others, as well as bank supervisors.  The 

SCAP also showed how much can be learned by simultaneous evaluations and 

comparisons of the practices and portfolios of different firms, rather than focusing on 

only one firm at a time, as was the supervisory approach often taken in the past.  Thus, 

we are increasing our use of cross-firm, horizontal examinations.  And we are
