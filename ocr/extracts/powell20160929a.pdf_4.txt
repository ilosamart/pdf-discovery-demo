(figure 2), although such banks still make up a small percentage of all community banks. 

I should note that the growth in this “large community bank” category is greater than that 

among banks with more than $10 billion in assets, in terms of both the number of banks 

added to the category and the percentage growth rate.  Banks ranging in size from 

$300 million to $1 billion have also roughly doubled in number over these past 20 years 

(figure 3).  And the number of banks in the size range from $100 million to $300 million 

in assets has declined by only a very modest percentage since 1995 (figure 4). 

However, the picture for banks with less than $100 million in assets is very 

different from the picture for larger banks.  As can be seen in figure 5, the number of 

such banking organizations has declined by more than two-thirds since 1995.  As with the 

pattern for all community banks, the decline in the number of these small community 

banks was steeper in the late 1990s than in later years.  

We can identify four factors that help to account for the decrease in the number of 

banks with under $100 million in assets.  Some of this decline reflects the growth of 

small banks (often de novo banks) out of the smallest size range into larger size 

categories due to either organic growth or acquisition of another bank.  Indeed, 

90 percent of the large drop-off in the number of banks in this size range in 2014 and 

2015 is due to banks moving up into a larger size category.  A number of the smallest 

banking organizations also disappeared as a result of being merged with or acquired by 

other banking organizations.  Some of the decline reflects the failures experienced in the 

Great Recession.  And, finally, there have been few new bank formations in recent years. 

As noted in a 2014 article by McCord and Prescott, a key difference between the 

past few years and the late 1990s is that the recent acceleration in the rate of decrease in
