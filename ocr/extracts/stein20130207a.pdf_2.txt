Thank you very much.  It’s a pleasure to be here.  The question I’d like to address 

today is this:  What factors lead to overheating episodes in credit markets?
1
  In other 

words, why do we periodically observe credit booms, times during which lending 

standards appear to become lax and which tend to be followed by low returns on credit 

instruments relative to other asset classes?

  We have seen how such episodes can 

sometimes have adverse effects on the financial system and the broader economy, and the 

hope would be that a better understanding of the causes can be helpful both in identifying 

emerging problems on a timely basis and in thinking about appropriate policy responses. 

Two Views of the Overheating Mechanism   

I will start by sketching two views that might be invoked to explain variation in 

the pricing of credit risk over time:  a “primitive preferences and beliefs” view and an 

“institutions, agency, and incentives” view.  While the first view is a natural starting 

point, I will argue that it must be augmented with the second view if one wants to fully 

understand the dynamics of overheating episodes in credit markets. 

According to the primitives view, changes in the pricing of credit over time reflect 

fluctuations in the preferences and beliefs of end investors such as households, where 

these beliefs may or may not be entirely rational.  Perhaps credit is cheap when 

household risk tolerance is high--say, because of a recent run-up in wealth.

 The thoughts that follow are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the 

Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  I am grateful to Burcu Duygan-Bump, Matt 

Eichner, Jon Faust, Michael Kiley, Nellie Liang, Fabio Natalucci, and Bill Nelson for numerous helpful 

conversations and suggestions.

 I am using the term “overheating” in an asset-pricing sense, so when I say that the market for a particular 

class of credit instruments is overheated, I mean that forecasted returns on this class of instruments, in 

excess of those on riskless Treasury bills, are abnormally low, or even negative, over some horizon.  This 

usage contrasts with models in the genre pioneered by Bernanke and Gertler (1989), where time-variation 

in collateral values can lead to large changes in the supply of certain types of credit but where expected 

returns on credit are constant over time.

 Habit-formation models have this property.  See, for example, Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
