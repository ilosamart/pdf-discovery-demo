The Role of the Federal Reserve in Ensuring Safe and Reliable Payments 

It is a pleasure to be here in Chicago today to talk about payments.  The confidence that

financial system that extended into the payment system, which was highly fragmented and 

inefficient.  Before the Federal Reserve took on a role in the payment system, a check recipient 

could not count on receiving the full value written on the check and faced long and unpredictable 

delays in getting access to the funds.  As a result of banks’ efforts to avoid excessive clearance
