Figure 4 

A Network in the Credit Default Swap Market 




Note:  The figure shows a credit default swap (CDS) market network.  CDS exposures across different contracts (underliers) are netted against each other so that 

any circle represents the net protection bought or sold by a market participant.  Red circles represent participants that are net sellers of CDS protection; blue circles 

represent participants that are net buyers of CDS protection.  The size of the circle indicates the amount of protection bought or sold.  The sample has been trimmed 

to exclude small market participants for ease of exposition.
