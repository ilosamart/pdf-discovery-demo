upward pressure on short-term interest rates even with very elevated levels of reserves.  In 

addition, we are developing new tools, including reverse repurchase agreements and term 

deposits that will allow us to drain significant quantities of reserves when necessary.  

Finally, let me close with some comments on a “lesson learned” that some observers have 

emphasized--that long periods of low interest rates inevitably lead to financial imbalances, and 

that the Federal Reserve should adjust its policy setting to avoid the buildup of such imbalances.  

As I have indicated at other times, I don’t think we know enough at this point to answer with any 

confidence the question of whether monetary policy should include financial stability along with 

price stability and high employment in its objectives.  Given the bluntness of monetary policy as 

a tool for addressing developments that could lead to financial instability, given the side effects 

of using policy for this purpose (including the likely increase in variability of inflation and 

economic activity over the medium term), and given the need for timely policy action to realize 

greater benefits than costs in leaning against potential speculative excesses, my preference at this 

time is to use prudential regulation and supervision to strengthen the financial system and lean 

against developing financial imbalances.  I don’t minimize the difficulties of executing effective  

macroprudential supervision, nor do I rule out using interest rate policy in circumstances in 

which dangerous imbalances are building and prudential steps seem to be delayed or ineffective; 

but I do think regulation can be better targeted to the developing problem and the balance of 

costs and benefits from using these types of  instruments are far more likely to be favorable than 

from using monetary policy to achieve financial stability.   

Conclusion 

The most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression has caused suffering around 

the world.  It also has been a difficult learning experience for central bankers.  Monetary
