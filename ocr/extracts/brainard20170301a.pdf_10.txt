Although it may be tempting, in theory, to operate with the balance sheet as a 

complementary, additional tool to the federal funds rate, we have virtually no experience 

with how such an approach would work in practice away from the effective lower bound.  

For that reason, one might instead prefer a “subordination” strategy that would prioritize 

the federal funds rate as the sole active tool away from the effective lower bound, 

effectively subordinating the balance sheet.  Once federal funds normalization meets the 

test of being well under way, triggering an end to the current reinvestment policy, the 

balance sheet would be set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until a 

“new normal” has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the 

demand for currency thereafter.6  Under this strategy, the balance sheet might be used as 

an active tool only if adverse shocks push the economy back to the effective lower bound.  

The case for the subordination strategy is straightforward and compelling.  This 

strategy recognizes that the two policy tools are broadly similar in the ways they affect 

the economy by indirectly changing the level of interest rates used to finance purchases 

by households and businesses.  These interest rate changes also have effects on asset 

prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar 

and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7  However, relative to balance sheet 

policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively 

tested:  There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to 

measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real 

                                                 
6 The Committee has indicated that it intends to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in a 
gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held 
in the System Open Market Account; see Federal Open Market Committee, Policy Normalization 
Principles and Plans, in note 2. 
7 There may be differences in the specific ways changes in short-term rates and the balance sheet transmit 
to different asset prices and the exchange rate, although estimates are limited and lack precision.
