because anything that gets said reverberates so loudly in markets.  But the softer it talks, 

the more the market leans in to hear better and, thus, the more the whisper gets amplified.  

So efforts to overly manage the market volatility associated with our communications 

may ultimately be self-defeating.  As we evaluate our own performance in the 

communications department, it is probably better for us to focus on how legitimately 

transparent we have succeeded in being, as opposed to how much or how little our 

various announcements have moved markets.
