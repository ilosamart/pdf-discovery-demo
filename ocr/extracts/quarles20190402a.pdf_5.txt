This broad engagement is essential to understanding new developments that are relevant 

to financial stability.  Take, for example, the “fintech” trends I discussed in remarks last week, to 

which the FSB is dedicating significant attention.  Claims about fintech run the gamut from the 

utopian to the apocalyptic--yet the mantle of fintech covers a wide range of new business 

models, products, and trends.  Their contours and their impact also vary across national 

boundaries, from mobile wallets in Kenya, to online mortgages in the United States, to money 

market funds founded by technology companies in China.  Understanding one of these new uses 

of technology is not the same as understanding all of them.  Identifying the risks and 

opportunities they pose requires context, information, and insight that can only come from a 

variety of stakeholders with experience developing, using, and monitoring them. 

I will continue to seek ways to invite and encourage engagement during my 

chairmanship, and to give the public a clearer and fuller view of FSB’s decisionmaking process.  

Few efforts are closer to the heart of our collective work or to the accountability and trust that the 

FSB helps foster.  

Vigilance 

Trust and accountability are also prerequisites for the FSB to pursue its mission.  The first 

prong of our mandate, now a decade old, is to “assess vulnerabilities affecting the global 

financial system, and identify and review . . . the regulatory, supervisory, and related actions 

needed to address them . . . .”4  The FSB’s primary role, and its principal contribution to 

international financial regulation, is to look forward--to see past the issues and practices of the 

day, and identify new vulnerabilities, long before they lead to widespread economic distress.
