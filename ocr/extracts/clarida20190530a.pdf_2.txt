Thank you for that generous introduction.  I have attended Economic Club of 

New York events many times over the years and have always enjoyed the programs that 

feature engaging speakers sharing important insights on timely topics.  It is a distinct 

honor to appear before you today from this side of the podium, and I do hope my remarks 

will contribute to this proud tradition.1   

In July, the current U.S. economic expansion will become the longest on record—

or at least the record since the 1850s, which is as far back as the National Bureau of 

Economic Research tracks U.S. business cycles.2  In anticipation of that milestone, I 

would like to take stock of where the U.S. economy is today, to assess its future 

trajectory, to review some important structural changes in the economy that have 

occurred over the past decade, and to explore what all of this might mean for U.S. 

monetary policy.   

The Federal Reserve has a specific mandate assigned to it in statute by the 

Congress, which is the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  As I 

speak today, the economy is as close to achieving both legs of this dual mandate as it has 

been in 20 years.  My colleagues and I understand that our responsibility is to conduct a 

monetary policy that not only is supportive of and consistent with achieving maximum 

employment and price stability, but also, once achieved, is appropriate, nimble, and 

consistent with sustaining maximum employment and price stability for as long as

Federal Open Market Committee participants.  I would like to thank Brian Doyle, David Lopez-Salido, and 
Bernd Schlusche for their assistance in preparing this speech.
