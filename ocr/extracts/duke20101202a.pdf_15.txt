Other emerging payment methods, such as mobile payments, also show potential 

for broad adoption in the United States.  Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board 

hosted a forum on consumer protection and education issues associated with mobile 

payment methods.  The Reserve Banks, including the Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 

through the efforts of the Payment Cards Center, have also been active in soliciting 

information from industry participants on the roles that various players are taking on in 

U.S. mobile payments and the forces that are affecting the rate of adoption by card 

issuers, merchants, networks, telecommunication firms, consumers, and others.  As of 

yet, mobile payments do not represent a meaningful percentage of overall consumer 

payments in the United States, but the Federal Reserve remains engaged in monitoring 

the emergence of this product to ensure that adequate consumer protections are put in 

place as the technology is adopted more broadly in the marketplace. 

Conclusion 

In closing, I encourage you to continue to push forward on research and policy 

work in the area of consumer credit and payments.  The landscape is changing rapidly 

and dramatically in response to economic, regulatory, and technological developments.  

You have some very interesting conversations ahead of you during this conference and 

quite challenging work for the foreseeable future as these markets continue to evolve.  I 

wish you great success in your work, and I thank you for inviting me to participate in this 

conference.
