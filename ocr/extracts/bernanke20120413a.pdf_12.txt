runs on banks by retail depositors, had been made largely obsolete by deposit insurance, 

central bank backstop liquidity facilities, and the associated government supervision of 

banks.  But a panic is possible in any situation in which longer-term, illiquid assets are 

financed by short-term, liquid liabilities and in which providers of short-term funding 

either lose confidence in the borrower or become worried that other short-term lenders 

may lose confidence.  The combination of dependence on wholesale, short-term 

financing; excessive leverage; generally poor risk management; and the gaps and 

weaknesses in regulatory oversight created an environment in which a powerful, self-

reinforcing panic could begin.

Indeed, panic-like phenomena arose in multiple contexts and in multiple ways 

during the crisis.  The repo market, a major source of short-term credit for many financial 

institutions, notably including the independent investment banks, was an important 

example.  In repo agreements, loans are collateralized by financial assets, and the 

maximum amount of the loan is the current assessed value of the collateral less a safety 

margin, or haircut.  The secured nature of repo agreements gave firms and regulators 

confidence that runs were unlikely.  But this confidence was misplaced.  Once the crisis 

began, repo lenders became increasingly concerned about the possibility that they would 

be forced to receive collateral instead of cash, collateral that would then have to be 

disposed of in falling and illiquid markets.  In some contexts, lenders responded by

Political Economy, vol. 91 (3), pp. 401-19).  Note that the term “panic” does not necessarily imply 

irrational behavior on the part of depositors or investors; it is perfectly rational to participate in a run if one 

fears that the bank will be forced to close.  However, the collective action of many depositors or investors 

can lead to outcomes that are undesirable from the point of view of the economy as a whole.
