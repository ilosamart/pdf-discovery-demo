a faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook.  Given the modal outlook envisioned in 

FOMC participants’ recent forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the 

equilibrium real rate rising, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent over the next few 

years, the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining 

appreciably.  Consistent with this assessment, almost all FOMC participants now view 

the risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced, although some also see 

inflation risks as weighted to the downside. 

That said, it is sobering to note that many market participants appear to assess the 

risks to the outlook quite differently.  For example, respondents to the Survey of Primary 

Dealers in late January thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the 

funds rate would fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.13  In addition, both the 

remarkably low level of long-term government bond yields in advanced economies and 

the low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market 

participants may hold more pessimistic views than FOMC participants concerning the 

risks to the global outlook.  Since long-term yields reflect the market’s probability-

weighted average of all possible short-term interest rate paths, along with compensating 

term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies 

suggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would 

necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in 

participants’ modal SEP projections.14

14 Of course, low long-term yields in the United States may not reflect investor pessimism about U.S. 
economic prospects but instead an expectation that weak economic performance abroad may result in 
persistent upward pressure on the dollar, thereby putting downward pressure on U.S. net exports, 
employment, inflation, and thus short-term interest rates.  On a closely related issue concerning evidence 
that investors’ perceptions of the likelihood of high inflation versus low inflation have shifted noticeably in
