would issue a floating rate note paying a compound average of Sterling Overnight Index Average 

(SONIA) shows that this can be done.1  In the spirit of encouraging this type of use of SOFR, I 

think it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to consider publishing a compound average of 

SOFR that market participants could then use.  It has been suggested that we could call it SAFR, 

for secured average financing rate, and this is something that we are encouraging our staff to 

explore.  Publishing a compound average rate that encourages broader use of SOFR would help 

make our financial system more resilient. Sandie will talk more about the creation of the 

forward-looking term version of SOFR in her remarks.  SAFR would not be a competitor to this 

forward-looking rate, it would be in alliance with it.  If there were a large volume of products 

referencing the compound average rate, there would likely be related demand for futures 

contracts to hedge those positions, helping to make the forward rate more robust.   

  It is important that we find ways to make it as easy as possible to use SOFR because the 

risks to LIBOR are, at this stage, quite considerable.  Even as the ARRC and similar currency 

groups in other jurisdictions were being formed, the FCA was exerting considerable effort to 

convince banks to continue submitting to LIBOR.  We have to be aware that two banks left the 

U.S. dollar panels despite this encouragement, and that the agreement that the FCA reached with 

the remaining banks to continue submitting voluntarily through the end of 2021 now has just 

three-and-a-half years left.  And as Andrew Bailey noted last week, there is also the prospect that 

LIBOR could be judged to be nonrepresentative under the European Union’s Benchmark 

Regulations, which would severely curtail the liquidity of products referencing LIBOR.
