list maintained by the CRA that supplied the credit records (this list includes requests 
received by the CRA as well as names received from the DMAâ€™s do-not-mail list). 
Combined, the credit record files and the opt-out indicator provide the information 
necessary to measure the extent to which individuals have chosen to opt out and to profile 
the credit and selected individual or neighborhood demographic or locational 
characteristics of such individuals. 

OPTING OUT 

The nationally representative sample indicates that, as of March 2004, about 6 percent of 
all individuals in the country with credit records had chosen to place their names on the 
opt-out list maintained by the national CRAs (table 3). This large number of individuals 
suggests that it is not difficult for individuals to opt out of receiving solicitations.16 

The opt-out percentage includes individuals with a credit record but no credit account. 
Notably, about 12 percent of the individuals in the sample have credit records only 
because of an item reported by a collection agency, such as unpaid bills for medical or 
utility services (table 2). In addition, a very small proportion of individuals have a credit 
record only because of a public-record action, such as a judgment or tax lien, that had 
been reported to the CRAs. If the sample of credit records is limited solely to the 
population of credit-using adults (individuals age 21 and older who have an open credit 
account with a positive balance), the incidence of opting out increases from 6.0 percent to 
9.4 percent (data not shown in table 3). 

WHO CHOOSES TO OPT OUT, AND WHY 

We compared the credit circumstances of individuals who are on the opt-out list 
maintained by the CRAs to those who are not by segmenting the sample in various ways. 
One of the divisions was according to measures of credit (for example, numbers, kinds, 
balances, and utilization of credit accounts).17 A second division was by the summary 
risk measure called a credit score. A third division was by records of serious derogatory 
information, such as collections activity or public-record actions. The remaining 
divisions were by the age of the individual, by state and region of the country where the 

16 In its public comment on the present study, TransUnion, one of the three national CRAs, reported 
that it has 18.7 million consumer names and addresses on its opt-out list, of which about 35 percent arise 
from the DMA do-not-mail list. Some individuals may be double counted because they requested that their 
names be placed on both the DMA and CRA opt-out lists. 

17 Credit card accounts include only those reported to the CRA in the twelve-month period preceding 
the date the survey sample was drawn. The specific sample size differs for each analysis discussed in the 
text because the use of credit varies widely across the population or because information may not have been 
available for some individuals.
