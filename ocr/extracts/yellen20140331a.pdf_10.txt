sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate.  Statistics 

on job turnover also point to considerable slack in the labor market.  Although firms are 

now laying off fewer workers, they have been reluctant to increase the pace of hiring.  

Likewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels 

before the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs 

because they worry that it will be hard to find another.  It is also a sign that firms may not 

be recruiting very aggressively to hire workers away from their competitors. 

A second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not 

helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries.  Workers in a slack market have 

little leverage to demand raises.  Labor compensation has increased an average of only a 

little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical 

standards.5  Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before 

the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, 

and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant.  But labor market slack has also surely 

been a factor in holding down compensation.  The low rate of wage growth is, to me, 

another sign that the Fedâ€™s job is not yet done. 

A third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the 

extraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six months 

or more.  These workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular work, and they 

appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to find a job.  The concern 

is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of 

                                                 
5 From 2010 to 2013, average annual growth in compensation per hour, hourly compensation as measured 
in the Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings for all employees in private industries--all 
independent estimates of wage and compensation growth--increased annually, on average, no more than 2-
1/4 percent.
