The Positive and Normative Economics of Fire Sales 

In a recent survey paper, Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny write that: “…[A] 

fire sale is essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated price. The asset sale is 

forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay creditors without selling assets….Assets 

sold in fire sales can trade at prices far below value in best use, causing severe losses to 

sellers.”3  Shleifer and Vishny go on to discuss the roles of investor specialization and 

limited arbitrage as factors that drive the magnitude of observed price discounts in fire 

sales, and there is, by now, a large body of empirical research that supports the 

importance of these factors.   

 However, by itself, the existence of substantial price discounts in distressed sales 

speaks only to the positive economics of fire sales, not the normative economics, and 

hence is not sufficient to make a case for regulatory intervention.  To see why, consider 

the following example:  An airline buys a 737, and finances the purchase largely with 

collateralized borrowing.  During an industry downturn, the airline finds itself in distress, 

and is forced to sell the 737 to avoid defaulting on its debt.  Other airlines also are not 

faring well at this time, and are not interested in expanding their fleets.  So the only two 

bidders for the 737 are a movie star, who plans to reconfigure it for his personal use, and 

a private-equity firm, which plans to lease out the plane temporarily and wait for the 

market to recover so the firm can resell it at a profit.  In the end, the private-equity firm 

winds up buying the plane at half its original price.  Two years later, it does indeed resell 

it, having earned a 60 percent return.
