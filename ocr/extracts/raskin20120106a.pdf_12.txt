they have extensive trading and capital markets activities, and make significant use of 

over-the-counter derivative instruments and other complex financial products.  They are 

relatively diversified, but also tend to be more highly leveraged than smaller institutions, 

and often rely on more volatile wholesale funding.  These organizations often are tightly 

interconnected, raising the prospect that the failure of one institution could rapidly 

destabilize the wider financial system, giving rise to the “too-big-to-fail” problem.7     

The characteristics of the largest commercial banks stand in contrast with those of 

community banks.  To be clear, community banks are not immune from taking on 

excessive risk.  But there are reasons why risks at community banks are likely to be less 

dangerous to the financial system.  First, community banks generally are less complex 

and more easily understood.  Second, community banks tend to be more traditional in 

approach.  What is often referred to as “financial engineering” is less likely to become the 

norm in community banks because such engineering, by definition, may pose hidden 

risks that could reflect poorly on community bankers’ judgment and negatively affect 

their image in the community if these risks are realized.  Third, community banks are less 

interconnected, so when a community bank fails, the effects are less widespread.   

All of these characteristics have implications for how large and complex banks 

should be supervised, as compared with community banks.  Notably, our supervision of 

large banks reflects the scope and complexity of their activities as well as their 

interactions with other firms and possible effects on financial markets, and incorporates 

                                                 
7 When the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recently issued rules for global banks that are 
systemically important, the methodology for determining system importance was based on five criteria:  
size, interconnectedness, lack of available substitutes, global/cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity.

Methodology and the Additional Loss Absorbency Requirement (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for International
