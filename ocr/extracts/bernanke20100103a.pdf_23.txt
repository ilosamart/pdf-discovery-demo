That said, having experienced the damage that asset price bubbles can cause, we 

must be especially vigilant in ensuring that the recent experiences are not repeated.  All 

efforts should be made to strengthen our regulatory system to prevent a recurrence of the 

crisis, and to cushion the effects if another crisis occurs.  However, if adequate reforms 

are not made, or if they are made but prove insufficient to prevent dangerous buildups of 

financial risks, we must remain open to using monetary policy as a supplementary tool 

for addressing those risks--proceeding cautiously and always keeping in mind the 

inherent difficulties of that approach.  Clearly, we still have much to learn about how best 

to make monetary policy and to meet threats to financial stability in this new era.  

Maintaining flexibility and an open mind will be essential for successful policymaking as 

we feel our way forward.
