The Federal Reserve and payment system stakeholders have an opportunity to upgrade 

Americaâ€™s payment system to meet the needs of households, businesses, and banks in the app 

economy.  Today, we are publishing a Federal Register notice that seeks public comment on 

potential steps the Federal Reserve could take to support the vision of RTGS of faster payments.  

The Reserve Banks could develop a service for RTGS that is available on a 24/7 basis to provide 

payment-by-payment interbank settlement in real time and at any time, on any day, including 

weekends and holidays.  The Reserve Banks currently provide payment services to more than 

11,000 banks across the country.  A 24/7 RTGS service provided by the Reserve Banks could 

significantly improve the prospect that banks of all sizes will have equitable access to a real-time 

interbank settlement infrastructure for faster payments in the long term.  

This common infrastructure would support connections across banks, and faster payment 

service providers acting as their agents, with the potential to weave together the current 

patchwork of systems.  As a result, we would also expect the overall safety of faster payments to 

increase.  The capability to finalize interbank settlement before funds are made available to the 

recipient would avoid an undesirable buildup of risk in the system.  The more banks that have 

access to real-time as opposed to deferred settlement mechanisms, the lower the risk would be 

from deferring settlement to the payment system as a whole.  Although RTGS may be 

operationally demanding, it offers clear benefits from a risk and efficiency perspective over the 

long term.    

 The development of a nationwide real-time interbank settlement infrastructure could also 

support the development of private-sector faster payment services, thereby increasing innovation 

and choice in the market.  Banks and technology providers of all sizes may be able to develop 

new services or enhance existing services by capitalizing on the underlying interbank settlement
