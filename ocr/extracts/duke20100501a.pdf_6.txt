 Myth 1:  Women focus on nonfinancial household roles while men deal with the finances.   

This myth is based on the notion of a division of household responsibilities that assumes  

women have no role in important financial decisions. In truth, women have long had substantial 

responsibility for family finances. Marketing polls and survey data indicate that American 

women have a large role in consumption decisions undertaken by the typical household in

they are physically lost, women are more likely than men to admit they do not know how to 

proceed and to seek out advice regarding the best financial path.  In fact, in studies and surveys
