Structurally, the U.S. capital requirements for FBOs are similar to those that apply to 

foreign banks in the EU.  That is, generally applicable Basel capital requirements are applied to 

the U.S. operations of FBOs that own local banking subsidiaries, investment banks, and broker-

dealers.  In fact, the new U.S. rules are somewhat more favorable to foreign institutions, in that 

they only apply once the non-branch U.S. assets of an FBO exceed $50 billion.  That dollar 

amount, incidentally, is the same as the Dodd-Frank threshold for more stringent prudential 

measures, though note that this statutory threshold applies if the total assets of any U.S. banking 

organization--foreign, as well as domestic--exceed that level.  As in the EU, the capital 

requirements do not apply to U.S. branches of foreign banks, even though the crisis experience 

provides some credible arguments for doing so. 

The leverage ratio requirement has received particular attention.  One complaint is that 

the foreign operations of U.S. banks are not subject to leverage ratios for their local operations.  

It is true that many foreign countries--including the EU member states--do not currently have 

leverage ratio standards for their banks.  As noted earlier, however, one may reasonably expect 

that those countries will be implementing the Basel III leverage ratio in a timely fashion.  Also, I 

would note in passing that the U.S. leverage ratio requirement for foreign firms will be phased in 

more slowly than originally proposed, so as to align it more closely with the effective date of the 

Basel III leverage ratio requirement. 

A second complaint is that there is something unfair about the United States requiring an 

FBO to meet the international leverage ratio in its U.S. operations, because its operations may be 

heavily weighted toward broker-dealer activities, which generally have higher leverage, whereas 

the leverage ratio for U.S. firms is based on their global operations.  Again, one suspects that the 

foreign operations of U.S. firms could be subject to a similar ratio requirement abroad as
