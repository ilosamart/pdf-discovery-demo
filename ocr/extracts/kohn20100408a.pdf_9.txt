As I have been emphasizing, the transition to full employment and the emergence of this 

new configuration of spending and production, and borrowing and saving, will take time.  This 

rebalancing involves repairs to balance sheets, the movement of capital and labor across sectors 

of the economy, and shifts in the global pattern of production and consumption--adjustments that 

are likely to be gradual under any conditions.  Moreover, the re-equilibration may be slower than 

might otherwise be the case because tight credit will limit the ability of some households and 

firms to make the necessary adjustments.   

Government policies will be essential to supporting the smooth transition to more-

sustainable economic growth with greater investment and exports.  We must ensure that changes 

in taxation and regulation do not blunt incentives for business investment.  In addition, although 

fiscal policy has provided important support for the economic recovery, it will need to be put on 

a more sustainable path in the medium term.  Failure to do so risks a market reaction that could 

increase longer-term interest rates; economic growth would be hindered if government 

borrowing boosts the cost of capital and diverts resources away from private investment.   

Reducing the deficit and avoiding a continuing buildup in government debt relative to 

income will be essential for bringing national production and spending into better balance.  That 

balance, in turn, is necessary so that we are no longer so reliant on borrowing from other nations.  

Heavy dependence on foreign borrowing by the United States is not a solid foundation for long-

term economic growth either here or in those countries extending us credit.  The actions of U.S. 

authorities and private parties to bring about a better balance of saving and investment must be 

matched by action overseas in chronic surplus countries.  While we reduce demand relative to 

our productive potential, the surplus countries must increase their domestic demand if the global 

economy is to thrive.
