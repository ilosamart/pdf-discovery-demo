of deposits over the sample period.  Thus, the net profitability of narrow banking is given 

by 0.87 percent plus 0.49 percent minus 1.30 percent, which equals 0.06 percent. 

Overall, our synthesis of these stylized facts is that banks are in the business of 

taking deposits and investing these deposits in fixed-income assets that have certain well-

defined risk and liquidity attributes but which can be either loans or securities.  The 

information-intensive nature of traditional lending--in the delegated monitoring 

sense--while clearly important in many cases, may not be the defining feature of banking.  

Rather, the defining feature may be that, whether banks invest in information-intensive 

loans or relatively transparent securities, they invest in fixed-income assets that have 

some degree of price volatility and illiquidity and so offer a higher return than very liquid 

and safe Treasury securities.  In this sense, small business loans and CMOs are on one 

side of the fence, and Treasury securities are on the other. 

Before proceeding, I should note a natural first reaction to these observations.  

You might say, “Of course banks prefer holding riskier securities to riskless ones, even if 

they create no monitoring value in either case.  They are just taking advantage of the put 

option created by deposit insurance.  In other words, the evidence on the patterns of 

banks’ securities holdings just reflects a moral hazard problem and nothing more.” 

Without intending to dismiss the importance of moral hazard generally, I don’t 

think it can fully account for the data in figure 1.  One way to make this point is to redraw 

the figure, restricting the sample only to those banks with the highest levels of capital at 

any point in time--those above the median of the distribution by the ratio of equity to 

assets--as is done in figure 2.  As can be seen, the basic patterns are very similar to those 

in figure 1.  Given that these highly capitalized banks are less likely to impose losses on
