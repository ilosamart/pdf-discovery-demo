 By facilitating the allocation of the world’s savings to the most productive uses, 

the free flow of capital across national borders confers substantial economic benefits, 

including the promotion of economic growth.  That said, we have seen a number of 

episodes in which international capital flows have brought with them challenges for 

macroeconomic adjustment, financial stability, or both.  Such challenges have tended to 

arise in two situations:  first, when the “rules of the game” of the international monetary 

system--the policy responses that countries are expected to take to help foster a balanced 

global economy over time--are either poorly articulated or not observed by key countries; 

and second, when the financial systems of nations receiving strong capital inflows have 

not been up to the task of investing those inflows productively.  

These issues are hardly new.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the U.S. dollar 

and French franc were undervalued, with the result that both countries experienced 

current account surpluses and strong capital inflows.  Under the unwritten but long-

standing rules of the gold standard, those two countries would have been expected to 

allow the inflows to feed through to domestic money supplies and prices, leading to real 

appreciations of their currencies and, with time, to a narrowing of their external 

surpluses.  Instead, the two nations sterilized the effects of these capital inflows on their 

money supplies, so that their currencies remained persistently undervalued.  Under the 

constraints imposed by the gold standard, these policies in turn increased deflationary 

pressures and banking-sector strains in deficit countries such as Germany, which were 

losing gold and foreign deposits.  Ultimately, the unwillingness of the United States and 

France to conduct their domestic policies by the rules of the game, together with
