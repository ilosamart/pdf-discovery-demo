Figure 1:  Effects on the long-run equilibrium federal funds rate 

Slower growth.  The slower growth of 1-1/4 percentage points in this scenario 

assumes that labor force growth is 1/4 percentage point lower and that labor productivity 

growth is 1 percentage point lower.  According to table A.1, an increase of 1 percentage 

point in labor force growth would raise the equilibrium real federal funds rate by 

1.15 percentage points.  The contribution of the slower labor force growth to the 

equilibrium federal funds rate is therefore negative 0.25 x 1.15, or negative 30 basis 

points.  Similarly, the contribution of slower productivity growth is negative 1.00 x 0.85 

= negative 85 basis points, for a total effect of negative 115 basis points. 

Demographics.  As explained in the text, the effect of demographics on the 

equilibrium federal funds rate is based on the study of Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-

Salido (2016), who emphasize that demographic changes since the 1980s would imply a 

reduction of 125 basis points in the equilibrium federal funds rate.  However, this number 

includes the effects of demographics on the labor force, which have already been 

included in the growth effect.  As suggested by figure 12 of Gagnon, Johannsen, and 

Lopez-Salido (2016), adjusting for the effects of employment would trim about 50 basis 

points from the total effect (the distance between the solid-blue and dashed-green lines as 

of 2015).  Thus, in Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016), the effects excluding 

those via labor force growth are about negative 75 basis points. 

Lower investment.  This experiment corresponds to the cost of capital shock 

discussed in section 2, with the sign reversed.  As can be seen in line 4 of table A.1, the
