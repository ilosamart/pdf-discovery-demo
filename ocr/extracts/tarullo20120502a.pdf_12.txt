distributing a dividend unless the minimum ratio would be maintained.  Prohibition and 

constraint are quite appropriately at the center of a regulatory system.  Yet the policies that 

underlie regulation should embody a more affirmative set of social goals. 

One obvious example is the housing market, which remains depressed today, although 

there are at last some signs of gradual improvement.  As has been widely observed, mortgages 

are not available to many potential homebuyers who appear creditworthy by most reasonable 

measures, despite the fact that home affordability judged by traditional measures is greater than 

at any time in decades.  The flawed mortgage securitization system that provided too much 

financing on too lax terms has been eliminated or constrained.  And important steps have been 

taken to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices seen in the last decade.   

But having addressed the unhealthy and unsustainable mortgage-related practices of 

recent years, we must also recognize that there is not currently in place an effective system for 

funding well-underwritten mortgages.  To return to, and maintain, a healthy housing market, we 

will need a healthy system of mortgage finance.  That end, in turn, could be much advanced by a 

public policy debate focused on the cost, availability, and risks associated with mortgage 

financing that will likely be available under possible combinations of government policies-- 

including all relevant forms of regulation, housing assistance programs, and the critical issue of 

the future of the government-sponsored enterprises.   

Finance and financial intermediation are not ends in themselves, but means for pursuing 

savings, investment, and consumption goals.  Our debate about what we don't want 

intermediaries and financial markets doing must be informed by a better articulated view of what 

we do want them doing.
