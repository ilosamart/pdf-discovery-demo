Can India Recharge Growth in Emerging Asia? 

One source of uncertainty in this outlook, as alluded to earlier, is the prospect for 

India to provide a new growth engine for Asian development.  In principle, India has 

enormous potential to recharge the Asian growth engine.  For one, India is relatively 

unintegrated into global production-sharing networks.  For example, machinery and 

electrical products, which feature heavily in production-sharing and which make up about 

half of exports in other emerging Asian economies, account for only 15 percent of India’s 

exports.  Foreign direct investment into India is about half the size of similar flows into 

China as a percentage of GDP, and GDP per capita, at $1,600 in 2014, remains 

considerably below emerging Asia’s average.   

All told, while the export-led growth model that propelled growth in China and 

other economies in emerging Asia has matured, pushing down growth rates, India 

remains at a relatively early stage of its development trajectory.  Further capital 

deepening and the potential for further productivity gains suggest that India could 

maintain rapid economic growth for a number of years.  As mentioned previously, India 

is also a young country, with a relatively low dependency ratio and a growing workforce.  

By United Nations estimates, India is set to overtake China during the next decade as the 

world’s most populous nation.    

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Indian economy grew at around 3 to 4 percent.  In 

subsequent decades the growth rate averaged close to 6 percent, and in the early years of 

this century it rose further, as can be seen in Table 1.  In 2015, growth in India is 

expected to be 7-1/4 percent, the fastest among large economies, and the IMF expects 

growth to pick up from this already rapid pace through the end of the decade.  Growth
