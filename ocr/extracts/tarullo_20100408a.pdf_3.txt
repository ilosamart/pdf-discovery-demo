made additional stimulus necessary.  In addition to improving conditions in mortgage markets, 

these asset purchases helped lower yields on long-term debt; they also substantially increased the 

level of reserve balances that depository institutions held with Federal Reserve Banks. 

Thus, while reference is often made to a single exit strategy, there are in fact two separate 

objectives:  One is to terminate the special liquidity facilities and otherwise normalize our 

activities as liquidity provider of last resort when the exceptional stresses have eased sufficiently.  

The other is to raise interest rates when warranted by economic conditions.  Historically, the Fed 

has affected the level of short-term interest rates primarily by varying the supply of bank 

reserves.  However, as I just mentioned, the Fed’s asset purchases have had the effect of putting 

an unusually high level of reserves into the banking system.  Thus, in order to tighten monetary 

policy, the Fed cannot simply raise its target for the federal funds rate; it will have to take other 

steps to ensure that interest rates actually increase. 

The first objective has now been substantially achieved.  Diminished use of some of our 

special facilities followed the easing of liquidity stresses in the relevant markets, and led 

naturally to our closing those facilities.  In other cases, we decided that liquidity conditions had 

improved enough that further support was not warranted and that markets should function on 

their own.  Many of our liquidity facilities expired in February, and last month we ended the 

TAF and most of the TALF.  All that now remains of the special liquidity facilities is the part of 

the TALF for loans backed by newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities, which itself 

is scheduled to close on June 30.  We have also restored pre-crisis practice with respect to the 

maximum maturity of discount window loans and have increased the rate on such loans to 50 

basis points over the rate we pay on reserve balances, from the 25 basis point level that was put 

in place during the crisis.  I would emphasize that the winding down of our emergency liquidity
