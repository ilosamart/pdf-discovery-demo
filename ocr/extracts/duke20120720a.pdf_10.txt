in striking contrast to many previous times of stress, when policy rates could not be 

lowered for fear of frightening off international investors.  The fact that these Latin 

American economies were able to respond by lowering policy rates and also by boosting 

fiscal support is a testament to the decisive steps taken to strengthen macroeconomic 

policies and financial systems, including improvements in the monetary frameworks 

under which their central banks operate.   

Many Latin American economies staged quick and strong recoveries from the 

global recession and subsequently started to raise policy rates to try to ward off 

overheating pressures.  Conversely, many advanced economies, with their prolonged soft 

recoveries, needed to continue to follow expansionary monetary policies.  Accordingly, 

as was also the case in emerging Asia, the monetary policy stance of several central 

banks in Latin America, such as Brazil and Chile, diverged from those of advanced 

economies.  The resulting rise in interest rate differentials, on top of the generally 

stronger growth in Latin America, helped to fuel capital inflows, which, at times, have 

proved challenging for the policymakers of these economies to manage.  Of course, more 

recently, with intensification of the crisis in Europe, some Latin American countries, 

most notably Brazil, have again lowered their policy rates in response to concerns about 

slowing growth.    

Even within Latin America, however, the experience of economies has not been 

uniform.  In particular, Mexico, with its stronger ties to the United States, was hit earlier 

and harder than many other economies in the region.  Even though Mexicoâ€™s recovery in 

the second half of 2009 was strong, it had less momentum and considerable economic 

slack remained in the country.  As such, the Bank of Mexico did not consider it necessary
