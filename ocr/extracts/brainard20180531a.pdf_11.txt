within the broader context of financial conditions and the outlook and will be one of 

many considerations informing my assessment of appropriate policy. 

As suggested by the SEP median path, I believe that the forward-guidance 

language in the Committee statement that was introduced a few years ago that “the 

federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to 

prevail in the longer run” is growing stale and may no longer serve its original purpose.  

For purposes of comparison, in March 2016, the median of SEP projections for the 

federal funds rate path had the funds rate rising to 3.0 percent and remaining below the 

longer run value that was projected to be 3.3 percent.  A year later, the median projection 

of the longer-run federal funds rate fell.  In the March 2018 SEP, the median projection 

of the federal funds rate peaks at 3.4 percent in 2020--1/2 percentage point above the 

median projection of its longer-run value of 2.9 percent.  It is worth noting that this 

progression reflects a decrease in the long-run federal funds rate as much as an increase 

in the medium-run federal funds rate. 

Conclusion 

In an environment of tightening resource utilization and above-trend growth, with 

sizable fiscal stimulus likely to provide a boost to demand in the near-to-medium term 

that should fade somewhat further out, it seems likely that the neutral rate could rise in 

the medium term above its longer-run value.  I expect current tailwinds to boost the 

neutral rate gradually over the medium term but leave little imprint on the long-run 

neutral rate.  The short-run level of the neutral rate should rise gradually because the 

forces that are moving the economy from headwinds to tailwinds are likely to play out 

gradually.  Although the tax cuts are already in place, their effects may not be fully felt
