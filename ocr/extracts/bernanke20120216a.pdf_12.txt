  The new Financial Stability Oversight Council also provides a forum for 

agencies to discuss the coordination of policies and initiatives.  It is important that we at 

the Federal Reserve continue to work closely with other agencies on supervisory matters, 

particularly in cases in which a common regulatory approach across agencies and across 

banking organizations with different charters has the potential to reduce compliance costs 

and risks.  

One of the areas where communication between banks and examiners is 

especially important is in the ongoing supervisory process.  We conduct extensive 

training for our examiners, perform internal reviews and studies to ensure that the 

examiners are properly interpreting supervisory guidance, and stress that a main goal of 

supervision is to help bankers sustain sound lending and risk-management practices.  We 

emphasize that open dialogue with bank management is an essential component of 

effective supervision. 

Although we hope that bankers are able to resolve all examination issues through 

discussion with the examiner-in-charge or Reserve Bank management, it is inevitable that 

examiners and bankers will sometimes differ over examination findings despite our best 

efforts.  For those cases, the Federal Reserve has a robust appeals process, as well as an 

independent ombudsman, to provide institutions with a fair and thorough review of 

complaints.
