Should this shift occur in significant ways, the financial system could ultimately 

be exposed again to the very risks against which much post-crisis regulatory reform has 

been directed.  To be sure, it is not a trivial task for unregulated financial-sector 

participants to move into activities in which regulated institutions have traditionally 

operated.  But if the potential gains were high enough, unregulated actors could have 

sufficient incentive to do so.  Indeed, it must be recognized that regular recourse to 

supervisory measures in response to nascent financial stability concerns would likely be 

perceived as increasing the payoff from this form of regulatory arbitrage. 

The limitations of supervision as a tool for managing the risks to financial 

stability that could arise from protracted periods of low interest rates have intensified 

interest in time-varying macroprudential policies -- that is, measures that can be 

calibrated to changing economic or financial conditions.  A frequently cited example is 

increased loan-to-value requirements for certain types of lending such as residential or 

commercial mortgages.  The appeal of such requirements is that they could, at least in 

principle, be adopted reasonably quickly as risks increased, implemented in a 

straightforward way, and applied to all market actors engaged in the covered activities, 

not just prudentially regulated firms.   

Having just recently addressed at some length the promise and limitations of such 

time-varying macroprudential tools, I will not repeat those views at length today.8  I can 

summarize by saying that, in practice, such policies face a number of challenges, 

including questions about the reliability of measures to guide policy actions, which 

officials should make macroprudential decisions, the speed with which policies might
