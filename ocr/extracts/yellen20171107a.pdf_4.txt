Similarly, in 1939, Paul Douglas was one of the first public officials in America 

to publish a full accounting of his personal finances.  In his memoir, Douglas admits that 

this and other ethical rules he imposed on himself were often a nuisance and, in some 

cases, probably went further than needed to demonstrate his honesty.  But he believed 

that the public’s trust was so fundamental to the effectiveness of government that such 

steps were appropriate.  As a senator, he continued to publish his finances and observed 

strict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from 

him as a public official.  He strongly believed that these gift limits also made him more 

effective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the 

widespread requirement of financial disclosure and limits on accepting gifts.  

I share Paul Douglas’s view that behaving ethically is both the right thing to do 

and, in practical terms, helps maintain the trust the public places in those who act on its 

behalf.  The Federal Reserve’s very effectiveness in setting monetary policy depends on 

the public’s assured confidence that we act only in its interest.  We must act ethically, and 

we must demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt.   

I am grateful to share this award with Ben, and I am even more grateful for the 

example Paul Douglas set for ethics in government that has guided countless public 

officials since his day and also shaped the public’s expectation that its leaders will put the 

public’s interests first.
