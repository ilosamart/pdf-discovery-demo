When I was asked to participate on this panel in the middle of last year, the 

prevailing metaphor regarding Federal Reserve balance sheet policy was “as boring as 

watching paint dry.”  Well, times have changed, and I commend the conference 

organizers for their foresight.  Today I would like to discuss some of the recent decisions 

that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made regarding the balance sheet 

and lay out a rough framework for some further issues that are on the horizon.1 

In January, after much discussion, including in previous meetings, the FOMC 

announced its intent to continue operating in a framework of ample reserves.2  In this 

regime, active management of the reserve supply is not needed.  The Federal Reserve 

controls the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates primarily 

through the use of administered rates, including the rate paid on reserve balances and the 

offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements.  This regime is sometimes 

referred to as a floor system, because the administered rates place a floor under the rate at 

which banks and others will lend in the federal funds market.  In adopting this 

framework, the Committee stated its intention to continue operating as it has for the past 

decade.   

The announcement was an important step in our normalization process.  And we 

are now set up to make further decisions on the eventual size and composition of our 

balance sheet.  Before providing more context on those decisions, let me first provide a

little more detail around our decision to remain in the current framework of ample 

reserves. 

The most important factor in the decision was that the current system has worked 

very well. It has supported the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability.  And it has shown itself to be flexible and well suited to 

maintaining interest rate control through various changes in money markets, bank 

regulation, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Since the FOMC began lifting 

interest rates in December 2015, money market rates have generally moved closely with 

the federal funds rate, which in turn has followed changes in administered rates.     

Now that the decision on the operating framework has been made, a natural next 

step is to contemplate the appropriate size of the Fed’s balance sheet and reserves and the 

process for getting there.  In line with the requirements of operating with ample reserves-

-and boosted by the growth in nonreserve liabilities--the Fed will maintain a larger 

balance sheet and reserve supply relative to the pre-crisis period, with the goal of 

remaining on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.  I would note that reserves 

have already declined appreciably from their peak, falling by $1.2 trillion to a current 

level of around $1.6 trillion.  At the same time, we have seen a substantial increase in our 

nonreserve liabilities, such as currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account 

balance.  In our statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, we outlined an 

intention to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy 

efficiently and effectively.3  As the balance sheet continues to shrink, we are now in the 

process of determining that necessary size.

Ultimately, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by a number of 

factors, including demand for nonreserve liabilities, such as currency (which has been 

rising), and, importantly, the quantity of reserves necessary to remain reliably on the flat 

portion of the reserve demand curve.  Survey results suggest that banks have greatly 

increased their demand for reserves in the post-crisis period.  Responses to the September 

2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey report that banks would be comfortable with a level 

of reserves in the system in the neighborhood of $800 billion, taking into consideration 

the level of interest rates at the time.4  In part, this increased demand reflects a response 

to regulatory changes introduced after the crisis.  These changes include, importantly, the 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which has improved banks’ liquidity resilience by 

requiring firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover potential outflows 

during times of stress.  Reserves, along with Treasury securities, are favored under the 

LCR, and, consequently, firms currently meet a sizable fraction of their LCR 

requirements by holding reserves.      

Notwithstanding survey results, the level of reserve demand remains quite 

uncertain.  It is possible that, over time, the preferences of banks will shift, or that 

demand will prove more price elastic than banks are currently expecting.  As I have 

discussed previously, bank holdings of reserves to meet LCR requirements could shift 

toward Treasury securities, as aggregate reserves decline, without much upward pressure

on the federal funds rate.5  That said, even if uncertain, it is probably safe to say that 

reserve demand is much higher than before the crisis.   

As we work to calibrate ample reserves, there are some tradeoffs that are worth 

noting.  For example, we could operate with a level of reserve balances at the lower end 

of what might be considered ample.  In that case, there would likely be occasions when 

unexpected declines in the supply of reserves or increases in the demand for reserves 

would require an open market operation to offset temporary upward pressures on the 

federal funds rate.  Alternatively, we could operate with an average supply of reserves 

large enough to keep the federal funds rate determined along the flat portion of the 

reserve demand curve even with an unexpected shift in the supply of or demand for 

reserves.  This approach would be operationally convenient but would also leave the size 

of the balance sheet and reserves larger than necessary most of the time.  In my view, it 

might be appropriate for us to operate somewhere in between these two extremes, with a 

sizable quantity of reserves large enough to buffer against most shocks to reserve supply.  

On those few days when that buffer is likely to be exhausted, we could conduct open 

market operations to temporarily boost the supply of reserves. 

With so much uncertainty over the level and slope of the reserve demand curve, a 

degree of caution is warranted.  As outlined in the minutes of the January FOMC 

meeting, the Committee has discussed ending the reduction in the Fed’s aggregate asset 

holdings sometime in the latter half of this year, with still-ample reserves in the system.6

At that point, one option discussed, without any decision being made at this point, is to 

hold the level of total assets roughly fixed for a time.  Even as the total size of the balance 

sheet remains fixed, the composition of the liabilities would gradually change, in part as 

demand for currency grows in line with the economy.  Over time, the gradual increase in 

nonreserve liabilities would displace reserves as the overall balance sheet remains fixed.  

This plan would substantially reduce the pace of the decline in reserves, allowing us to 

gradually approach our assessment of the appropriate amount of reserves for the efficient 

and effective implementation of monetary policy.  Of course, in the longer run, once we 

reach our preferred level of reserves, the balance sheet would have to resume growth to 

match a continued increase in demand for nonreserve liabilities. 

I would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of some of the other decision 

points we will encounter as we continue the process of normalizing our balance sheet.  In 

particular, what does the Committee judge to be normal in regard to the type and duration 

of assets that we will hold?  On composition, in line with our previously announced 

normalization principles, I favor a return to a balance sheet with all Treasury securities, 

allowing our mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings to run to zero.  In those 

principles, we also state that while we do not expect sales of MBS as part of the 

normalization process, later we would be open to limited sales to reduce or eliminate 

residual holdings of MBS.  In regard to duration, moving to shorten the duration of our 

holdings could increase the Fed’s ability to affect long-term interest rates if the need 

arose.  However, it might be preferable to have the composition of our Treasury holdings 

roughly match the maturity composition of outstanding Treasury securities, minimizing 

any market distortions that could arise from our holdings.  Over the course of our

upcoming meetings, I look forward to what promises to be an interesting discussion on 

these issues with my colleagues.      

Finally, in assessing our balance sheet policy, it is important to point out that the 

Fed remains entirely focused on meeting its statutory dual-mandate objectives of 

maximum employment and price stability.  The normalization of the balance sheet is not 

a competing goal.  If ever it appears that our plans for the balance sheet are running 

counter to the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, we would quickly reassess 

our approach to the balance sheet.
