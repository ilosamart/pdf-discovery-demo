resilience across a wide range of adverse scenarios.  Regulators and the public need to 

know that if adverse scenarios do occur, there will be robust management and governance 

to respond effectively.   

  Digital ledger technologies will need to be able to address the range of issues 

revolving around the confidentiality and security of firm and client records and data on 

the one hand, as well as law enforcement requirements and issues on the other.  New 

technologies must be robust in practice, not just in theory, to attacks on security, and 

must be able to maintain appropriate confidentiality for records and data.   

In addition, it will be important that digital ledger technologies can meet the 

requirements of law enforcement and other regulators to address money laundering, 

terrorist financing, and other key law enforcement concerns.  Indeed, there is some 

potential that the new technologies could enable improved authorized access to certain 

data records in a much more efficient and comprehensive manner than has previously 

been possible, thereby potentially reducing costs associated with complying with the 

Bank Secrecy Act.      

Overall we should be optimistic that a range of new technologies hold the promise 

of providing more robust security, resilience, and information.  We cannot afford to 

assume that change necessarily equals greater risk.  Of course, much will depend on the 

technology itself, its scalability, its level of maturity, the controls and environment 

surrounding it, the standardization and accessibility of transactions data, the quality of 

management and governance, and the policy environment in which it is deployed.
