The Path to Fiscal Sustainability  

The ultimate goal of the commissionâ€™s efforts should be to put us on a path to 

fiscal sustainability.  One widely accepted criterion for sustainability is that the ratio of 

federal debt held by the public to national income remain at least stable (or perhaps even 

decline) in the longer term.  This goal can be achieved by bringing spending, excluding 

interest payments, roughly into line with revenues.  Unfortunately, most projections 

suggest that we are far from this goal, and that without significant changes to current 

policy, the ratio of federal debt to national income will continue to rise sharply.  Thus, the 

reality is that the Congress, the Administration, and the American people will have to 

choose among making modifications to entitlement programs such as Medicare and 

Social Security, restraining federal spending on everything else, accepting higher taxes, 

or some combination thereof. 

Achieving long-term fiscal sustainability will be difficult, but the costs of failing 

to do so could be very high.  Increasing levels of government debt relative to the size of 

the economy can lead to higher interest rates, which inhibit capital formation and 

productivity growth--and might even put the current economic recovery at risk.  To the 

extent that higher debt increases our reliance on foreign borrowing, an ever-larger share 

of our future income would be devoted to interest payments on federal debt held abroad.  

Moreover, other things being equal, increased federal debt implies higher taxes in the 

future to cover the associated interest costs--higher taxes that may create disincentives to 

work, save, hire, and invest.  High levels of debt also decrease the ability of policymakers 

to respond to future economic and financial shocks; indeed, a loss of investor confidence 

in the ability of a government to achieve fiscal sustainability can itself be a source of
