percentage point decline in labor force participation from 2007 to 2014, while most 

OECD countries saw an increase (figure 6).  The United States now stands at the low end 

of labor force participation for both men and women in this age group--above Italy, but 

well below Germany, France, and Spain.12   

Lower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of 

interest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full employment.  Estimates of the 

long-run “neutral” federal funds rate have declined about 100 basis points since the end 

of the crisis.  The real yield on the 10-year Treasury is currently close to zero, compared 

with around 2 percent in the mid-2000s.  Some of the decline in longer-term rates is 

explained by lower estimates of potential growth, and some by other factors such as very 

low term premiums.  

To sum up so far, estimates of long-run potential growth of the U.S. economy 

have dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the crisis, with much 

of the decline a function of slower productivity growth.  The decline in realized 

productivity growth seems to be driven both by low capital investment that is well 

explained by weak demand and by lower TFP growth.  Expectations of lower 

productivity growth going forward are more a function of slower gains in TFP.  Lower 

potential output growth would mean that interest rates will remain below their pre-crisis 

levels even after the output gap is fully closed and inflation returns to 2 percent.   

                                                 
12 Different countries use slightly different concepts for measuring labor force participation, and therefore 
cross-country comparisons may reflect some measurement issues.  However, to the extent that these 
differences are constant over time, comparisons of the relative performances will be little 
affected.  Accordingly, it is worth highlighting that the labor force participation rate in the 25-54 age group 
has declined somewhat in the U.S. since 2008, while it has been relatively steady or even increased some in 
other major advanced economies.
