importantly shaped by the persistent legacy of the housing bust and ensuing financial crisis), and 

by my assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy.  Of course, as I’ve emphasized, the 

outlook is uncertain and the Committee will need to adjust policy as appropriate as actual 

conditions unfold.  For this reason, the FOMC’s forward guidance is explicitly conditioned on its 

anticipation of “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the 

medium run.”23  If the recovery were to proceed faster than expected or if inflation pressures 

were to pick up materially, the FOMC could adjust policy by bringing forward the expected date 

of tightening.  In contrast, if the Committee judges that the recovery is proceeding at an 

insufficient pace, we could undertake portfolio actions such as additional asset purchases or a 

further maturity extension program.  It is for this reason that the FOMC emphasized, in its 

statement following the April meeting, that it would “regularly review the size and composition 

of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a 

stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.”24
