 It is the start of a new year, the traditional time for making forecasts, so I am 

pleased to be here today to offer my perspective on recent economic developments and 

on the outlook for the U.S. economy.  After a rough patch early in 2011, the economy 

appears to have regained a little momentum near the end of the year, and I expect that 

it will most likely continue on a path of gradual recovery in 2012.  Because conditions 

in the housing market are such a strong drag on recovery, I will also outline some 

initiatives that I believe have the potential to accelerate improvement in that sector.  

Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the views that I will be presenting are my 

own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) or the Board of Governors. 

Recent Economic Developments 

 Following the sharp downturn in 2008 and the first half of 2009, real economic 

activity has now been expanding for more than two years (chart 1).  However, the 

recovery has not been as strong as might have been expected given the steepness of 

the contraction.  Early last year it threatened to stall out altogether.  To be sure, 

economic growth in the first half of last year was depressed by some transitory factors, 

including high energy prices and the effects of the tragic earthquake in Japan on the 

production of motor vehicles.  Still, even as these influences on the economy waned 

over the second half of 2011, economic activity appears to have increased at only a 

moderate pace.   

 Perhaps the most telling measure of the subpar pace of recovery is the painfully 

slow improvement in the labor market.  Employment gains were tepid last year and 

made only a small dent in the large number of people who are still out of work (chart
