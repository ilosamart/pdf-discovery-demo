much as needed to accommodate increased trading volumes without the need to widen 

bid-ask spreads.   

That said, the ability of high-speed market makers to nearly simultaneously adjust 

liquidity provision across multiple closely linked markets can create potential challenges 

for large institutional investors seeking to reliably aggregate posted liquidity among 

otherwise distinct trading venues.14  The dynamic nature of liquidity provision by high-

speed market makers makes static measures of liquidity, such as posted bid-ask spreads 

and market depth, less useful.  For the purposes of improving our assessment of financial 

stability, it is therefore necessary to look for alternative ways of gauging liquidity and 

transaction costs in these markets.  For example, measures such as implementation 

shortfall aim to account directly for the difference between the original decision price and 

the final execution price for a trade split into multiple smaller transactions.15 As IAWG 

staff members continue to refine the TRACE data to assess market resilience more 

accurately in light of changes in structure and speed, it will be important to incorporate 

alternative measures of liquidity and transaction costs.  

Separately, the increased role of managed funds is also having an effect on the 

Treasury market.  TRACE data can help us keep up with that development as well.  As in 

other asset classes, 3 p.m. has become an important liquidity point during the trading day 

for Treasury securities.  There is a regular spike in trading activity around 3 p.m., as can 

be seen in figure 7, which depicts average trading volumes across five-minute intervals.
