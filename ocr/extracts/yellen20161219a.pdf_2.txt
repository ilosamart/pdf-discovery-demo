Thank you, President Schmoke, for this award and for the opportunity to be here 

today to offer my congratulations to the members of the Class of 2016.  I would also like 

to recognize the vital support students have received from family, friends, and others, 

many of whom are here to share this great occasion.   

In a moment, I will explain why I am particularly proud and honored to be 

speaking to the new graduates of this university, but first Iâ€™d like to address students on a 

topic that I expect is on the minds of many of you, which is the job market. 

The short version of what I have to say is that while I expect workers will 

continue to face some challenges in the coming years, I believe, for two reasons, that the 

job prospects and career opportunities for new graduates at this time are very good.  First, 

after years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in 

nearly a decade.  The unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent, is near what it was before the 

recession.  This is a level that has been associated with good job opportunities.  Job 

creation is continuing at a steady pace; the layoff rate is low; and job openings are up 

over the past couple years, which is another sign of a healthy job market.  There are also 

indications that wage growth is picking up, and weekly earnings for younger workers 

have made strong gains over the past couple of years.  That is probably one reason why 

younger workers reported feeling significantly more optimistic about the job market 

compared with 2013, according to a survey published just today by the Federal Reserve.1 

Challenges do remain.  The economy is growing more slowly than in past 

recoveries, and productivity growth, which is a major influence on wages, has been 

disappointing.   

                                                 
1 See Board of Governors (2016).  In a survey conducted in 2015, 61 percent of young adults reported 
feeling optimistic about job opportunities, compared with 45 percent who felt that way in 2013.
