community where a family lives and significant and persistent racial disparities, I have been 

struck while traveling around the country by the widening gulf between the economic fortunes of 

our large metropolitan areas and those of our small cities, towns, and rural areas.   

The statistics bear this out:  the convergence in income across regions of the country has 

slowed dramatically over recent decades.3  Much of the gains in employment, income, and 

wealth since the end of the recession--and more broadly over the past few decades--have accrued 

to workers and families in larger cities.  If some workers and families find it difficult to move, 

this concentration of economic opportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for 

the well-being of these households and, potentially, the economy overall.  

In my visits, I have also been heartened by the efforts of local partners to address these 

disparities and improve their communities, including those aimed at capitalizing on local food-

based assets to advance economic opportunity and address food insecurity. For instance, in El 

Paso, I visited with several vibrant community organizations that were running community 

gardens, local nutrition and farming educational outreach programs, a commercial kitchen, and a 

food pantry to improve nutrition and access to fresh food in an area that lacked full-scale grocery 

stores.  In the Mississippi Delta, I met with people involved in an interesting collaboration 

between a local entrepreneur, a community development financial institution, the engineering 

department of a local community college, local farmers, and local food organizations--the aim of 

which was to produce biofuels from food waste.   

Of course, pockets of both opportunity and persistent poverty are found in large metro 

and rural areas alike.  In fact, a recent report found Boston to have one of the highest rates of 

income inequality among the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, despite the
