the worse by the fact that new entrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor 

force in recent years.  The fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for 

six months or more stands at a very high level.  In addition to those officially 

unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out 

of the labor force entirely.   

The pace of economic growth in the second half of this year has been somewhat 

faster than in the first half, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had 

weighed on growth earlier in the year.  Nonetheless, a range of more-persistent factors 

also appear to be restraining the recovery.  In recognition of these drags, the consensus of 

professional forecasters in the survey released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Philadelphia was that unemployment would decline only slightly in the next few 

years, to an average rate of 8.4 percent in 2013.  Moreover, financial market conditions 

have deteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the 

economy. 

At the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending contracted sharply and the 

personal saving rate began a steep ascent.  Exhibit 1 shows that the saving rate rose from 

around 2-1/2 percent in 2006 to about 5 percent in the first half of this year.  It now

the main engines of growth.  The ratio of household debt-to-income remains 

exceptionally high, even though over the past few years it has declined slightly from the 

post-World War II peak reached prior to the crisis.  Although households appear to have
