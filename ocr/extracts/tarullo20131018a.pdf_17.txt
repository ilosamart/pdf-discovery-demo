with academic and policy commentators together constitute a relatively unnoticed success in the 

world of financial regulatory reform.    

This observation has come with two, probably predictable caveats.  First, considerable 

work remains, so as to continue building and communicating a credible resolution mechanism 

that will allow investors, creditors, and counterparties of large financial firms to form reasonable 

expectations as to how a resolution would be conducted.  Second, while it is important to have 

such a mechanism as part of an overall program to confine too-big-to-fail problems, it would not 

be desirable to have to use it.  The more desirable outcome would be for its very credibility to 

work in concert with capital, liquidity, and other applicable regulations to reduce the chances of 

its actual utilization. 

These two thoughts bring me to a final point.  As I mentioned, serious work is being done 

by various commentators on proposals to adapt the Bankruptcy Code to the salient differences 

between financial and most other industries.  As I have watched the back-and-forth between 

those in the official sector charged with developing orderly resolution mechanisms and those 

working on bankruptcy amendment proposals, I have noted each side taking account of some 

points in favor of the other side’s model, with attendant modifications in everyone’s thinking. 

Differences remain, to be sure, such as the tradeoff between, on the one hand, a 

bankruptcy model’s reliance on the independence of the judiciary and the accumulated precedent 

for dealing with creditors’ claims and, on the other, the advantages in the Title II model of speed, 

pre-existing knowledge of financial firms, and a systemic perspective.  But there has also been 

productive convergence.  I join those who believe that the best outcome may be an amended 

Bankruptcy Code co-existing with Title II, with the former the default route in the case of a large 

financial firm’s insolvency, and the latter available for the unusual moment when systemic risks
