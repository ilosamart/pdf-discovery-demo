risks in the financial system.  In particular, there was insufficient appreciation of the implications 

of the growth in size, leverage, and maturity transformation levels of the shadow banking system 

for the balance sheets of commercial banks and for overall financial stability.  The limitations of 

capital requirements as a regulatory tool, such as the frequent lag between declines in asset 

values and reductions in bank capital, were also confirmed by experience during the crisis. 

But it was also evident that capital requirements had simply been set too low in general, 

and with respect to particular assets.  One of the most obvious examples was the capital 

requirement for asset-backed securities in the trading books of banks.  The requirement was 

based on returns over a 10-day holding period, used a one-year observation period that had been 

characterized by unusually low price volatility, and neglected the credit risks inherent in these 

traded instruments.  It was also apparent that at least some of the instruments that qualified as 

“Tier 1 capital” for regulatory purposes were not reliable buffers against losses, at least not on a 

going concern basis.   

It is instructive that during the height of the crisis, counterparties and other market actors 

looked almost exclusively to the amount of tangible common equity held by financial institutions 

in evaluating the creditworthiness and overall stability of those institutions--they essentially 

ignored the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios in regulatory requirements.  In the fall of 

2008, there was widespread doubt in markets that the common equity of some of our largest 

institutions was sufficient to withstand the losses that those firms appeared to be facing.  This 

doubt made investors and counterparties increasingly reluctant to deal with these firms, 

contributing to the severe liquidity strains that characterized financial markets at the time. 

It is obvious that the post-crisis regulatory system will not be as dependent on capital 

requirements as the pre-crisis regime.  Dodd-Frank itself is testimony to this fact, as are a
