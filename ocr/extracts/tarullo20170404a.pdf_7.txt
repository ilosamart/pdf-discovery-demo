lending and liquidity proved unsustainable.  Moreover, given the healthy increases in lending 

over the last several years and the record levels of commercial bank profits recorded in 2016, it 

would seem a substantial overreach to claim that the new regulatory system is broadly 

hamstringing either the banking industry or the economy. 

But there are areas where I think the case for change has become fairly strong.  The 

Volcker rule is one.  During the debates on what became the Dodd-Frank Act, former Chairman 

Paul Volcker offered a fairly straightforward proposal:  no insured depository institution or 

affiliate thereof should be permitted to engage in proprietary trading.  It seemed then, and seems 

now, like an idea that could contribute to the safety and soundness of large financial firms.  

However, several years of experience have convinced me that there is merit in the contention of 

many firms that, as it has been drafted and implemented, the Volcker rule is too complicated.  

Achieving compliance under the current approach would consume too many supervisory, as well 

as bank, resources relative to the implementation and oversight of other prudential standards.  

And although the evidence is still more anecdotal than systematic, it may be having a deleterious 

effect on market making, particularly for some less liquid issues. 

 There are three problems--two in the statute and one in the regulatory approach--that I 

think are related.  The first statutory problem is that five different agencies are involved.  While 

the statute does not require a single regulation agreed upon by all five, it understandably calls for 

coordination and consistency in rulemaking and implementation.  The joint or parallel 

rulemaking among multiple agencies required in various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act has 

advantages and disadvantages that differ across subject matter.  Here, though, the disadvantages 

seem to dominate.  Because almost any effort to distinguish market making from proprietary 

trading, for example, is impossible to sensibly reduce to a formula or precise rule across all
