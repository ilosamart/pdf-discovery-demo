meetings, we heard a number of comments citing a comparative lack of capitalization, 

weaker collateral values, and lower credit scores for many minority small businesses, 

which leave these firms with less ability to absorb economic shocks.  For example, in Los 

Angeles, we heard that the decline in residential property values has had a significantly 

adverse impact on businesses owned by Asian Pacific Islanders who relied heavily on 

home equity for financing.  We heard about the same issue with respect to many African

efforts such as government procurement programs were instituted to help minority small 

businesses, we heard that the inability to secure credit to fulfill contracts makes these 

programs out of reach for many potential participants.  It is also clear that minority-

owned businesses would benefit from improved access to technical assistance and 

resources such as training in financial management, mentoring, and assistance with loan 

documentation that may not be in a business ownerâ€™s native language.  But there are also 

hopeful examples of successful collaboration to address these issues.  While in 

Minneapolis, I toured the Midtown Global Market, a multicultural marketplace that 

serves as an inspirational reminder of what can be accomplished when public and private 

resources combine to support minority businesses.     

Research and Data Improvements 

Finally, we spent some time today discussing the need for better data and analysis 

to monitor and understand small business credit flows.  As a research institution, the 

Federal Reserve is always looking for opportunities to improve data, and we already have 

taken a number of steps in this direction.  First, while banks do not report loans to small 

businesses separately, they do report information on business loans less than $1 million
