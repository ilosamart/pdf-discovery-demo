special factors, including movements in the relative prices of food, energy, and imports, 

will wane in coming quarters.   

To understand this assessment, it is useful to decompose the forces driving 

movements in inflation since the financial crisis, as estimated using a simple model of 

inflation that I presented in a speech two years ago.2  Figure 3 reports this decomposition 

as the contributions made by various factors to the shortfall of PCE price inflation from 

2 percent, year by year.  As illustrated by the purple dotted portion of the bars, labor 

underutilization, or “slack,” accounts for a shrinking share of the shortfall since 2012 and 

is now having a negligible effect.  By comparison, the influence of changes in relative 

food, energy, and import prices--the solid blue and checkered red portions--has been 

more substantial in the past few years, although their contribution is estimated to have 

greatly diminished this year.3  

Not surprisingly, the simple model does not account for all of the year-to-year 

movements in inflation.  As indicated by the green striped portion of the bars, the residual 

component of the shortfall was modestly positive on average from 2008 through last year.  

This year, however, inflation has been unexpectedly weak from the model’s perspective.  

This unusually large error does not necessarily imply that inflation is more likely to 

                                                 
2 The simple model links the current rate of inflation to several factors, including lagged inflation, long-run 
inflation expectations, labor utilization, and changes in the relative prices of food, energy and imports 
(Yellen, 2015).  Additional details on the model can be found in the appendix.      
3 In the decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a 
result, the contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change 
relative to the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending.  The estimated contribution 
of movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at 
the same rate as core inflation, they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 
2 percent.  In addition, the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to 
movements in resource utilization and other factors.  More details on the decomposition procedure can be 
found in the appendix.
