 On the other side of the ledger are the risks associated with foreign banking that are 

distinct from risks associated with banking more generally.  These risks tend to be related to the 

parent bank’s capacity to support the larger organization.  Reversals in the home market or other 

significant foreign operations may reduce the ability of the parent to support its foreign affiliates 

with needed capital and liquidity.  Even if the foreign affiliate is not itself under great stress, the 

weakened overall condition of the parent because of problems in other parts of the world may 

prompt it to retrench--often rather abruptly--by reducing activity in foreign markets in which it is 

active.  This response may be driven either by bank management itself or at the instance of home 

country officials who want the bank to continue to lend in its home market.  Especially in 

countries where foreign banks account for a significant part of financial intermediation and 

where the underlying problems are not idiosyncratic to a specific bank, the result may be a 

significant diminution in intermediation beyond what would have taken place because of 

macroeconomic developments. 

 Even more serious is the risk that the foreign bank will fail, and that the home country 

will lack the resources or the will to ensure either that it is recapitalized and continues to function 

or that it fails in an orderly fashion.  If the foreign operation has been thinly capitalized and is 

lacking in liquidity, host country officials may face an unpleasant choice between supporting a 

foreign bank (including operations for which they have not had consolidated supervisory 

responsibility) or allowing it to fail in a disorderly fashion, with potentially serious knock-on 

effects in the host country’s financial system.   

 Thus, what might have been economic advantages for host countries from foreign banks 

in reasonably good times can turn into substantial disadvantages in periods of idiosyncratic or 

generalized stress.  As with the benefits of foreign banking, the risks vary considerably among
