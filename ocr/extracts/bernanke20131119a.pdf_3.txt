Making monetary policy is sometimes compared to driving a car, with 

policymakers pressing on the accelerator or the brakes, depending on whether the 

economy needs to be sped up or slowed down at that moment.  That analogy is imperfect, 

however, for at least two reasons.  First, the main effects of monetary policy actions on 

the economy are not felt immediately but instead play out over quarters or even years.  

Hence, unlike the driver of a car, monetary policymakers cannot simply respond to what 

lies immediately in front of them but must try to look well ahead--admittedly, a difficult 

task.  Second, the effects of monetary policy on the economy today depend importantly 

not only on current policy actions, but also on the public’s expectations of how policy 

will evolve.  The automotive analogy clearly breaks down here, for it is as if the current 

speed of the car depended on what the car itself expects the driver to do in the future.  

The public’s expectations about future monetary policy actions matter today 

because those expectations have important effects on current financial conditions, which 

in turn affect output, employment, and inflation over time.  For example, because 

investors can choose freely between holding a longer-term security or rolling over a 

sequence of short-term securities, longer-term interest rates today are closely linked to 

market participants’ expectations of how short-term rates will evolve.  If monetary 

policymakers are expected to keep short-term interest rates low, then current longer-term 

interest rates are likely to be low as well, all else being equal.  In short, for monetary 

policy, expectations matter. 

Indeed, expectations matter so much that a central bank may be able to help make 

policy more effective by working to shape those expectations.  Experience demonstrates 

that a useful approach to managing expectations--one that dovetails well with basic
