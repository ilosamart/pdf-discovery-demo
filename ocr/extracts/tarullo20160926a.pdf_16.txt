would need to continue increasing capital levels for some time but also recognized that at some 

point we would need to revisit it.   

Since the new approach of adding one year’s planned dividends to a firm’s capital buffer 

should act as a disincentive for imprudent or unsustainable levels of dividends, the notion of 

extra scrutiny on planned dividends may no longer be useful.  And we would, in any case, be 

reluctant to substitute a higher payout ratio for the original 30 percent ratio because it may end 

up being an implicit target for banks to try to reach.  However, firms planning higher dividends 

should be aware that the operation of the SCB is such that, if a firm planned to pay out all of its 

earnings in the form of dividends and things did not go as well as expected for the firm, it could 

end up having to cut its dividend. 

Balance sheet and risk-weighted asset assumptions 

Beyond requiring that large banks have the resiliency to weather a period of serious 

financial stress, an important macroprudential aim of stress testing is to ensure that they can 

provide credit to households and businesses that remain creditworthy even in such a period.  If 

banks maintain their capital ratios under stress by reducing their balance sheets through asset 

sales, or reductions in new lending, this crucial intermediation function will be compromised 

across the economy.  The result could be a credit crunch, likely resulting in a more severe or 

longer-lasting recession.  In the first few years of CCAR, we used the banks’ own projections 

where many banks planned on balance sheet declines as part of their strategy for remaining 

sufficiently capitalized.15  In the 2014 CCAR cycle, we replaced banks’ projections with our own 

                                                 
15 The original stress test undertaken during the crisis did not allow this assumption, precisely because of our aim 
that the large banks as a group be well-positioned to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers at that time of great 
stress.
