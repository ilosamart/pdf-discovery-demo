outlooks, risk assessments, and objectives.10  The whole forward interest rate curve 

matters for financial conditions, not just the overnight rate.  Monetary policy was 

therefore thought to be made more effective by communication of the full expected path 

of policy, which could then be incorporated into private-sector expectations and longer-

term interest rates.  But all along, there have been other voices urging caution and asking, 

in effect, “How much transparency is too much?”  As Don Kohn noted in 2005 remarks, 

“more is not necessarily always better” when it comes to Fed communication.11  Critics 

have often argued that too much discussion of the likely path of policy could be taken as 

a commitment to a particular path and timing and could ultimately constrain the 

Committee from pursuing what it views to be the optimal path.  Indeed, to the extent that 

the Committee’s talk about the path of policy is given weight, that talk may leave “too 

little scope for private assessments of economic developments to show through” in 

market prices.12 

Jon notes in his paper that communications about monetary policy generally 

received high marks from 2008 through early 2013, and he focuses his analysis on the 

challenging period since mid-2013.  I am also going to skip over the years 2013-14, 

which included the “taper tantrum” and the relatively uneventful taper itself.  I will focus 

instead on the years 2015-16, which seem to me to be the most relevant to the challenges
