pose a communications challenge, as the frequent complaints about the cacophony of 

messages coming out of the FOMC illustrate.6 

In the remainder of my discussion, I would like to elaborate on some of the 

features of committees that have contributed to their prevalence in monetary 

policymaking.  I will then discuss monetary policy rules and some of the difficulties in 

developing robust rules for policy. 

 
Why Do Almost All Central Banks Make Their Monetary Policy Decisions in a 

Committee? 

Let us turn to central bank decisionmaking.  One of the striking facts about the 

Fed is that it is the third central bank of the United States.  Whereas the long-lived central 

banks of Europe--the Riksbank and the Bank of England--have survived for more than 

three centuries, the Fed has only recently become a centenarian. 

Roger Lowenstein’s book America’s Bank convinces the reader that it was no 

easy matter to establish this third central bank.  It also establishes for those coming to the 

issue for the first time that the major issues related to the Fed’s structure were political.  

That is, underlying the disagreements about the establishment of the Federal Reserve was 

the concern that the central bank not upset the balance of economic power within the U.S. 

economy.  Indeed, it was not until 1935 that the present structure of the FOMC was 

established, in which the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., 

who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, vote along with 5 of 

the 12 Reserve Bank presidents at any given meeting.7

votes rotate annually among the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents.
