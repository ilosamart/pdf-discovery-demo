This paper reviews Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications 

from the time the Committee began issuing regular postmeeting statements in 1999 to the 

present.1  The authors provide an extended and insightful discussion of the theory and 

practice of providing forward guidance about monetary policy.  They offer one central 

lesson:  Data-based forward guidance is mostly good, while time-based forward guidance 

is mostly bad.   

The authors show that data-based guidance has desirable characteristics and can 

make monetary policy more effective.  When clearly articulated and well understood, it 

allows markets to react appropriately to incoming data, doing the heavy lifting for the 

central bank.   

Time-based guidance is found to have certain bad characteristics and should be 

avoided, except at the zero lower bound and when other options are not available or not 

working.  Time-based guidance may reduce the sensitivity of rates to incoming 

macroeconomic data, suppress volatility, encourage risk-taking and increased leverage, 

and threaten financial stability.  It may also put policymakers in a box when changes in 

the economy make it optimal to deviate from previously expressed guidance, but the 

Committee cannot do so without losing credibility.   

The authors blame time-based guidance for several episodes in which the 

Committee zigged when the market looked for it to zag, leaving market participants 

unhappy and, in the authors’ view, the FOMC’s credibility damaged.  They argue that the
