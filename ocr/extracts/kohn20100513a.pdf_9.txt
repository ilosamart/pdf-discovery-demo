The funding markets evidently remain somewhat vulnerable, however.  Just this week, with the 

reemergence of strains in U.S. dollar short-term funding markets in Europe, the Federal Reserve 

reestablished temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap facilities with the Bank of Canada, the Bank 

of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank.4

Lessons for Handling Future Liquidity Disruptions 


 What lessons can be drawn from the Federal Reserve’s experience in the financial crisis 

when designing a toolbox for dealing with future systemic liquidity disruptions?  First, the crisis 

has demonstrated that, in a financial system so dependent on securities markets and not just 

banks for the distribution of credit, our ability to preserve financial stability may be enhanced by 

making sure the Federal Reserve has authority to lend against good collateral to other classes of 

sound, regulated financial institutions that are central to our financial markets--not on a routine 

basis, but when the absence of such lending would threaten market functioning and economic 

stability.  Thus, it would seem that authority similar to that provided by section 13(3) will 

continue to be necessary. 

Second, we recognize that holding open this possibility is not without cost.  With credit 

potentially available from the Federal Reserve, institutions would have insufficient incentives to 

manage their liquidity to protect against unusual market events.  Hence, emergency credit should 

generally be available only to groups of institutions that are tightly regulated and closely 

supervised to limit the moral hazard of permitting access to the discount window, even when 

such access is not routinely granted.  If the Federal Reserve did not directly supervise the
