had knowledge of that year’s stress test results before finalizing their distribution plans 

for the upcoming year.  I am sympathetic to their concerns, and will ask the Board to 

adjust the operation of the rule, so that firms know their SCB before they decide on their 

planned distributions for the coming year.  Of course, we expect firms to continue to 

maintain robust stress testing practices and use those results to inform their capital 

distribution plans, and we will continue to use the supervisory process to reinforce this 

expectation. 

The third is the post-stress leverage requirement.  As the Federal Reserve has long 

maintained, leverage requirements are intended to serve as a backstop to the risk-based 

capital requirements.  By definition, they are not intended to be risk-sensitive.  Thus, I am 

concerned that explicitly assigning a leverage buffer requirement to a firm on the basis of 

risk-sensitive post-stress estimates runs afoul of the intellectual underpinnings of the 

leverage ratio, and I would advocate removing this element of the stress capital buffer 

regime.  Of course, leverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage 

requirements, would remain a critical part of our regulatory capital regime, and we will 

maintain the supervisory expectation that firms have sufficient capital to meet all 

minimum regulatory requirements. 

To give these issues the careful consideration they deserve, I expect we will adopt 

a final rule in the near future, settling the basic SCB framework while re-proposing 

certain elements.  I expect that the first SCB would not go into effect before 2020, and 

that CCAR will remain in place in 2019 for firms with over $250 billion in assets or that 

are otherwise complex.  However, we will consider whether we can move forward with 

any aspects of the SCB proposal for CCAR 2019, such as assumptions related to balance 

sheet growth, and I will ask the Board to exempt firms with less than $250 billion in 

assets from the CCAR quantitative assessment and supervisory stress testing in 2019. 

Transparency 

In the meantime, several initiatives are also underway to provide additional 

transparency into stress testing.  I expect you will soon see the Federal Reserve issue a 

policy statement describing governing principles around the supervisory stress testing 

process—and with it, a commitment to disclosing additional detail about supervisory
