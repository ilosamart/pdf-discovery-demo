problems include critical weaknesses in servicers’ foreclosure governance processes, 

foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party 

law firms and other vendors.  These problems indicate the existence of unsafe and 

unsound banking practices and violations of federal and state laws, as well as 

demonstrated patterns of misconduct and negligence on the part of servicers.  Individual 

consumers have been harmed by this negligence, including the negligence of law firms.  

In addition, the imperative for servicers to fix their systems, review past decisions, and 

put in place the internal systems and controls that they should have had all along has 

impeded the repair of the overall housing market. 

The burden of addressing these issues of repair, review, and implementation of 

systems and controls rests with the mortgage servicers, their parent financial institutions, 

and the law firms that mishandled the foreclosures.  But what do the terms of the PSA, 

which is the standard contract governing this work, require in this context?  The standard 

servicing contract provides disincentives for servicers to act in the best interests of 

investors and borrowers.  This misalignment of incentives has more profound 

consequences when defaults are high. 

Under the standard contract, servicers receive a flat fee per loan that they service, 

usually 1/4 to 1/2 percent of the unpaid loan balance annually, depending on the type of 

loan.  The flat fee is considerably more than is required to service a performing loan and 

considerably less than is required to service a delinquent loan.  The expectation is that, on 

average, the fee will cover the servicer’s expenses.  Servicers are also reimbursed for 

some expenses, such as the cost of a title search when pursuing a foreclosure, but 

generally not for unanticipated overhead or labor costs.
