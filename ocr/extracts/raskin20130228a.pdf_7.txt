event, dubbed “Bank Transfer Day,” and invited her friends to join her in transferring their 

money from large banks to credit unions on that day.  In the five weeks leading up to Bank 

Transfer Day, this Facebook event received extensive press coverage and resulted in billions of 

dollars in deposits reportedly shifting out of large banks.  The bank targeted by the Facebook 

protest ultimately reversed itself and declined to assess the monthly fee. 

How Reputational Risk May Be Relevant   

Financial institutions of all sizes have shared in the fall-out--fairly or unfairly--from a 

general decline in their industry’s reputation among the public.  Moreover, the steady stream of 

litigation against financial institutions since the crisis has further harmed the reputations of 

specific firms among their customers.   

Consider that in today’s financial institution sector, a substantial portion of a bank’s 

enterprise value comes from intangible assets such as brand recognition and customer loyalty 

that may not appear on the balance sheet but are nevertheless critical to the bank’s success.  Also 

consider that at the end of 2012, deposits at commercial banks reached a record $10 trillion.  At 

the same time, the share of each deposit dollar that banks lent out hit a post-financial crisis low 

in the third quarter, which means that banks’ net interest margins have fallen sharply.  Across the 

industry, loan-to-deposit ratios are going down.  In 2007, banks’ aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio 

was 91 percent.  This ratio currently stands at 70 percent.  In such a context, achieving higher 

earnings is a challenge. 

If bank profitability is going to improve in a context of low interest rates and higher 

compliance costs, lending income may remain low.  Profits will need to come from elsewhere.  

One source of profits would be products that are not interest-rate dependent, but fee-dependent.
