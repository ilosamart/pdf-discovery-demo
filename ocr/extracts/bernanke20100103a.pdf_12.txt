proponent of the standard rule would have recommended that the FOMC raise the policy 

rate to a range of 7 to 8 percent through the first three quarters of 2008, just after the 

recession peak and just before the intensification of the financial crisis in September and 

October--a policy decision that probably would not have garnered much support among 

monetary specialists.  In contrast, Slide 4 shows that the version of the Taylor rule based 

on forecast inflation (in green dots) explains both the course of monetary policy earlier in 

the past decade as well as the decision not to respond aggressively to what did in fact turn 

out to be a temporary surge in inflation in 2008.  This comparison suggests that the 

Taylor rule using forecast inflation is a more useful benchmark, both as a description of 

recent FOMC behavior and as a guide to appropriate policy. 

Although monetary policy from 2002 to 2006 appears to have been reasonably 

consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandated goals of maximum sustainable 

employment and price stability, we have not yet addressed the possibility that 

accommodative policies--though perhaps appropriate for achieving medium-term 

inflation and output goals--inadvertently contributed to the housing bubble.  I turn now to 

that question. 

Monetary Policy and the Housing Bubble 

 To set the stage for the discussion, Slide 5 shows the annual increase in nominal 

house prices from 1978 to the present.11  After some years of slow growth, U.S. house

composition of home sales, and include information on homes financed outside of the government-
sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

An important, and perhaps underappreciated, issue is that measurement of house prices has 
improved considerably since the early part of the past decade.  The LoanPerformance index on which Slide 
5 is based corrects for changes in the composition of sales through the use of repeat sales, as noted in the 
text.  During the first half of the past decade, however, the only publicly available house price indexes 
making that important correction were based on data taken from mortgages purchased by the government-
sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  However, because they were based on homes
