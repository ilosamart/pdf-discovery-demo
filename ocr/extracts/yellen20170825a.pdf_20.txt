Nonetheless, there is more work to do.  The balance of research suggests that the 

core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly 

limiting credit availability or economic growth.  But many reforms have been 

implemented only fairly recently, markets continue to adjust, and research remains 

limited.  The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and 

where improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system.   

Moreover, I expect that the evolution of the financial system in response to global 

economic forces, technology, and, yes, regulation will result sooner or later in the all-too-

familiar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reemerging in 

new ways that require policy responses.  We relearned this lesson through the pain 

inflicted by the crisis.  We can never be sure that new crises will not occur, but if we keep 

this lesson fresh in our memories--along with the painful cost that was exacted by the 

recent crisis--and act accordingly, we have reason to hope that the financial system and 

economy will experience fewer crises and recover from any future crisis more quickly, 

sparing households and businesses some of the pain they endured during the crisis that 

struck a decade ago.
