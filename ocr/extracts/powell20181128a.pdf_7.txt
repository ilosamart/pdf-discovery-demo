most systemically important financial institutions also now hold roughly 20 percent of 

their assets in the form of high quality liquid assets--that is, safe assets that could be 

readily sold at short notice (figure 2).  The share of these assets is about four times its 

pre-crisis level. 

Compared with other economies, lending and borrowing in the United States 

depend less on bank loans and more on funds flowing through a wide array of capital 

market channels.  The crisis revealed that this capital market centric system, despite its 

many benefits, also provides more places where systemic risks can emerge.  In response, 

Congress and the regulatory agencies have made many stability-enhancing changes 

outside of the banking system.  For example, many derivatives transactions are now 

required to be centrally cleared, which, through netting, has reduced exposures and 

enabled better management of counterparty risk.  Tri-party repurchase agreement (repo) 

reforms have substantially improved the resilience of that marketplace, in particular by 

limiting intraday loans.  Before the crisis, prime institutional money market funds were 

permitted to report a constant, $1 share price so long as the value of the underlying assets 

remained near $1.  This reporting convention, combined with the implicit support of the 

plansâ€™ sponsors, led investors to treat those funds like bank deposits, even though they 

were not likewise insured.  These funds are now required to report floating net-asset 

values, and after this reform investors chose to migrate to government-only funds, which 

are safer and less susceptible to runs (figure 3).5  These and other measures have reduced 

the risk that key non-bank parts of the system would freeze up in the face of market 

stress.  

                                                 
5 Given that government money fund asset holdings are limited to safe assets, they are allowed to maintain 
a $1 share price.
