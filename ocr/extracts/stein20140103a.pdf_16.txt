appears as a huge outlier, since the contractual maturity of banks’ liabilities is extremely 

short--indeed, shorter than that of broker-dealers--even while they hold highly illiquid 

assets.  This observation underscores a key point:  If one wants to understand the 

divergent asset-side behavior of banks and shadow banks, one has to look not to the 

literal contractual maturity of their liabilities, but rather to the differing incentives that 

their overall financial and institutional arrangements create for short-term claims to be 

stable in the face of bad news.  

Other Implications 

Our framework may also be helpful in understanding a couple of other aspects of 

the business of banking.  The first is banks’ accounting treatment of their “available for 

sale” securities, according to which ongoing mark-to-market gains and losses don’t 

appear in net income.

  This treatment implicitly presumes that these gains and losses are 

temporary and that banks can ride them out by not having to sell the security in question 

before it matures.  While I would not want to go so far as to claim that our model justifies 

this accounting practice, it at least provides a starting point for thinking about it.

  By 

contrast, the practice would be incomprehensible in a world in which changes in asset 

prices reflected changes in expected future cash flows. 

 Second, our approach may help shed some light on the bricks-and-mortar costs 

associated with bank deposit-taking.  As I mentioned earlier, we estimate these costs to 

be quite high, averaging on the order of 1.30 percent of deposits over the period from

 These “temporary impairments” flow through another liability account called “accumulated other 

comprehensive income” and affect earnings under generally accepted accounting principles only if the 

gains or losses are realized by selling a security.

 See Cochrane (2011) for a similar argument.
