stock and bond returns in turn may be related to better anchored inflation expectations 

following a long period of low and stable inflation.       

Looking ahead, it seems likely the term premium will increase somewhat, 

although perhaps not to the levels seen historically.  On the one hand, a continued gradual 

runoff of the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and reduced bond buying by other 

central banks will tend to put upward pressure on the term premium.  On the other hand, 

the FOMC’s demonstrated commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation makes it 

unlikely that expectations of high inflation will reemerge.  Thus, on balance, while term 

premiums may recover somewhat from their recent depressed values, it is unlikely they 

will return to the high levels of earlier decades. 

The Path of Policy 

In the median outlook in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), 

the federal funds rate is projected to reach its longer-run value by 2019 and exceed it in 

2020.  If the 10-year term premium were to stay very low, that path would likely imply a 

yield curve inversion.  But for the reasons I just noted, if the term premium remains low 

by historical standards, there would probably be less adverse signal from any given yield 

curve spread.   

It is important to emphasize that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP 

median is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and 

inflation around target.  So while I will keep a close watch on the yield curve as an 

important signal on how tight financial conditions are becoming, I consider it as just one 

among several important indicators.  Yield curve movements will need to be interpreted
