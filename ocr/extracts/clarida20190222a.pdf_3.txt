communication practices to achieve and maintain these goals as consistently and robustly 

as possible.2  I note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews 

of their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we 

are pursuing. 

As Chairman Powell has indicated, with the U.S. economy operating at or close to 

our maximum-employment and price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time 

to conduct this review.  The unemployment rate is near a multidecade low, and inflation 

is running close to our 2 percent objective.  By conducting this review, we want to ensure 

that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years.  In 

addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy tools and enhanced its communication 

practices in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession, and the 

review will evaluate these changes.  Furthermore, U.S. and foreign economies have 

significantly evolved since the pre-crisis experience that informed much of the research 

that provided the foundation for our current approach. 

Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the 

United States and abroad.3  Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to 

persist for years.  The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, 

including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in 

technology growth.  These factorsâ€™ contributions are highly uncertain, but irrespective of 

their precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important.  All 

                                                 
2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy 
framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes to its framework.

contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);
