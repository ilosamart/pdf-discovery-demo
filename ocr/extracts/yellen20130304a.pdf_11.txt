durables.  Research on the effects of such asset purchases suggests that what matters for 

the reaction of longer-term interest rates to a purchase program is the extent to which the 

program leads market participants to change their expectations concerning the entire path 

of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.

  Other things being equal, 

the greater the effect that a purchase program has on the expected path of the Federal 

Reserve’s securities holdings, the more substantial should be the downward pressure on 

the term premium in longer-term interest rates.

  By linking the pace of purchases and 

how long that pace will be maintained to the outlook for the labor market, the program 

acts as a sort of automatic stabilizer: As market perceptions of the prospects for the 

economy vary, so too should expectations of the pace and duration of asset purchases.  

In stating that asset purchases will continue, subject to caveats pertaining to 

efficacy and costs, until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the 

labor market, the FOMC established a criterion that differs in three important respects 

from the forward guidance for the federal funds rate:  (1) It is qualitative, not 

quantitative; (2) it refers to an improvement in the outlook for the labor market rather 

than an improvement in actual labor market conditions; and (3) it requires the Committee 

not only to consider progress toward its employment goal, but also to evaluate the 

efficacy and costs of asset purchases on an ongoing basis.  The public is, naturally, eager 

to understand how the FOMC will approach such complex judgments.  I cannot, of 

course, speak for the Committee on this issue, but I can spell out some of the key factors 

that will guide my conclusions.

 Typically, investors demand a higher return as a condition for putting their funds into a longer-term 

security instead of investing in a series of short-term securities.  The difference in expected returns on these 

two alternative investments is called a term premium.
