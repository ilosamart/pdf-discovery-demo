percent target--and scope for additional monetary policy accommodation is limited, 

leaving the economy vulnerable to adverse demand shocks.  In the euro area, growth and 

inflation may remain low for some time, which could pose challenges for banks with low 

capital or high amounts of nonperforming loans and for highly-indebted sovereigns.  

Political events in Europe also raise some uncertainty.  Going forward, it will be 

important to continue to monitor these and other foreign developments carefully. 

Here at home, the economy is at a transition.  The past few months have seen 

continued progress in the labor market.  Monthly gains in payroll employment have 

maintained a pace sufficient to continue eroding labor market slack, and wage growth 

appears to be moving higher on balance.  Compensation per hour in the business sector, 

the most comprehensive measure of wages, increased at a 3 percent pace the past two 

years, noticeably above the pace earlier in the recovery. 

We appear to be closing in on full employment.  The unemployment rate--after 

remaining relatively flat from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016--fell 

1/4 percentage point last quarter to 4-3/4 percent.  In addition, the labor force 

participation rate has been about flat, on net, over the past 2-1/2 years, which indicates 

considerable ongoing cyclical improvement, given the declining demographic trend.  

Even so, there may be some room for further improvement.  The prime-age employment-

to-population ratio remains depressed relative to pre-crisis levels; the share of employees 

working part time who would prefer full-time work remains elevated; and some measures 

of wage growth, such as the employment cost index, have increased relatively little in 

recent years.
