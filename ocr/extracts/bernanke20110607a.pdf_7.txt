Besides the prospect of more-stable commodity prices, two other factors suggest 

that inflation is likely to return to more subdued levels in the medium term.  First, the 

still-substantial slack in U.S. labor and product markets should continue to have a 

moderating effect on inflationary pressures.  Notably, because of the weak demand for 

labor, wage increases have not kept pace with productivity gains.  Thus the level of unit 

labor costs in the business sector is lower than it was before the recession.  Given the 

large share of labor costs in the production costs of most firms (typically, a share far 

larger than that of raw materials costs), subdued unit labor costs should remain a 

restraining influence on inflation.  To be clear, I am not arguing that healthy increases in 

real wages are inconsistent with low inflation; the two are perfectly consistent so long as 

productivity growth is reasonably strong.   

The second additional factor restraining inflation is the stability of longer-term 

inflation expectations.  Despite the recent pickup in overall inflation, measures of 

householdsâ€™ longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey, the 10-year 

inflation projections of professional economists, the 5-year-forward measure of inflation 

compensation derived from yields on inflation-protected securities, and other measures of 

longer-term inflation expectations have all remained reasonably stable.2  As long as 

longer-term inflation expectations are stable, increases in global commodity prices are 

unlikely to be built into domestic wage- and price-setting processes, and they should 

therefore have only transitory effects on the rate of inflation.  That said, the stability of 

                                                 
2 In the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the median reading on expected 
inflation over the next 5 to 10 years was 2.9 percent in May after having averaged 2.8 percent in 2010.  In 
the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the 
median projection for PCE inflation over the next 10 years was 2.3 percent in May, up from the 2.1 percent 
average reading last year.  The equivalent SPF projection for CPI inflation was 2.4 percent, versus 
2.3 percent in 2010.  The 5-year forward measure of inflation compensation derived from TIPS stood at 
about 2-3/4 percent in May, down noticeably from the levels observed toward the end of 2010.
