The Outlook for Consumer Prices 

Turning now to the outlook for U.S. consumer prices, I anticipate that the recent 

surge in commodity prices will cause headline inflation to remain elevated over the next 

few months.  However, I expect that consumer inflation will subsequently revert to an 

underlying trend that remains subdued, so long as increases in commodity prices 

moderate and longer run inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored.     

Underlying Inflation Trends 

Focusing on inflation prospects over the medium term is essential to the 

formulation of monetary policy because, due to lags, the medium term is the timeframe 

over which the FOMC’s actions can influence the economy.  For this purpose, 

economists have constructed a variety of measures to separate underlying persistent 

movements in inflation from more transitory fluctuations.  These measures include “core” 

inflation, which excludes changes in the prices of food and energy, and “trimmed mean” 

inflation, which exclude prices exhibiting the largest increases or decreases in any given 

month. 

No single measure of underlying inflation is perfect, but it is notable that these 

measures have exhibited a remarkably consistent pattern since the onset of the recession:  

All show the underlying inflation rate declining markedly to a level somewhat below the 

rate of 2 percent or a bit less that FOMC participants consider to be consistent with the 

Fed’s dual mandate.  For example, core PCE price inflation stood at less than 1 percent 

over the 12 months ending in February, down from 2-1/2 percent over the year prior to 

the recession.  Trimmed-mean measures of inflation have also trended down over the past 

couple of years and are now close to 1 percent.
