and some have questioned its usefulness.  However, markets do not appear to be 

unusually uncertain about FOMC decisions.7

focus on the latter.  Specifically, are communications that illustrate the diversity of views 

about the likely policy path--particularly the dot plot and public commentary by FOMC 

participants other than the Chair--currently serving us well?  And if not, how can we 

make improvements? 

Questions of how much to say about the likely path of policy were extensively
