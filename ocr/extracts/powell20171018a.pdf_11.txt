current and potential market developments and challenges, as well as our long-

established criteria for offering new products and services.  These criteria include the 

need to fully recover costs over the long term; the expectation that the new service will 

yield clear public benefit; and the expectation that other providers alone cannot be 

expected to provide the service with a reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity.9 

The Federal Reserve will also continue to support the ongoing work of the Secure 

Payments Task Force.  This task force has been working to educate stakeholders on 

payment security practices, risks, and actions that could enhance payment security.  

These are challenging topics, because they require stakeholders to be open and 

forthcoming about potential vulnerabilities if there is to be substantial progress.   

The Federal Reserve will also pursue two new efforts focused on security.  Early 

in 2018, we plan to launch a study analyzing payment security vulnerabilities.  This study 

is similar to other research efforts that the Federal Reserve has pursued to build 

foundational and collective understanding of the U.S. payment system.  We also plan to 

build upon the contributions of the Secure Payments Task Force to establish work groups 

focused on approaches for reducing the cost and prevalence of specific payment security 

vulnerabilities.  In a world of ever-escalating threats to the integrity of our payment 

system, this collective action is needed to sustain public confidence. 

These were just a few of our new initiatives.  The package of next steps the 

Federal Reserve outlined in its recent paper confirm that we remain steadfast in our 

commitment to work with industry and other stakeholders to achieve a better payment 

system through both leadership and action.
