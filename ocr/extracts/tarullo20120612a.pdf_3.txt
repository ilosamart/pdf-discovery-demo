to the rapid growth of the shadow banking system, the precise dynamics of the runs in 2007 and 

2008, and the relative social utility of some elements of this system.  Conclusions drawn from 

these debates will be important in eventually framing a broadly directed regulatory plan for the 

shadow banking system.  However, as it is neither necessary nor wise to await such conclusions 

in order to begin implementing a regulatory response, I will follow my discussion of the 

vulnerabilities created by shadow banking with some suggestions for near- and medium-term 

reforms.   

Fragility of the Shadow Banking System 

It is not my purpose here today to discuss the history and complex nature of the shadow 

banking system.  There is a rich and growing academic literature devoted to this task.  However, 

I do want to identify some features of shadow banking that are reasonably well-established and 

particularly salient for reform efforts.   

First, and in many respects foremost, it bears noting that the use of the term ―shadow 

banking‖ refers not simply to the functions of credit intermediation and maturity transformation.  

Shadow banking also refers to the creation of assets that are thought to be safe, short-term, and 

liquid, and as such, ―cash equivalents‖ similar to insured deposits in the commercial banking 

system.  Of course, as many financial market actors learned to their dismay, in periods of stress 

these assets are not the same as insured deposits.   

The years preceding the financial crisis saw a surge in the volume of dollar-denominated, 

seemingly safe, seemingly liquid financial instruments.  The causal interplay of factors leading to 

this surge is still actively debated.  But it seems reasonably clear that both a rise in the demand
