education, and profession with that thought in mind.  Likewise, the economic tool of 

cost-benefit analysis should help students make sounder personal and financial decisions.  

Financial education also provides a context for students to develop important 

skills that can be applied more broadly.  Making good financial decisions requires that 

consumers seek out relevant information from trustworthy sources, and that they use 

critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and decisionmaking skills.  These competencies 

are also some of the fundamental abilities our schools seek to inculcate in our children.
