networks that allow securities dealers to offer clients wider sources of funds for issues of 

debt and equity instruments.  Broad geographic reach allows firms to offer integrated 

global payments, collection, or other services to internationally active clients.  There may 

be scope economies for banks and their customers when a variety of services is provided, 

thereby reducing information and other transactions costs.  A range of relevant 

economies can be illustrated with a simple example. 

A firm engaged in merger and acquisitions advisory work needs to assemble a 

team with many areas of expertise.  A scale economy may be available because the 

average cost of advising on a single transaction will be lower if the firm is involved in 

more transactions, thus fully employing the team and facilitating greater spillovers of 

sector-specific information across transactions.  By providing financing for the 

transaction, the firm may also be able to achieve a scope economy because its financing 

activities can leverage off the information developed by the merger and acquisition 

adviser, thereby reducing due diligence costs.  Moreover, a client’s own transactions 

costs may be lowered when the firm is able to provide most or all of the financing 

because its balance sheet is large enough to fund the acquisition without breaching 

applicable internal or regulatory lending limits.  Similarly, a client may lower its 

transactions costs by using a single firm for both advising and financing.4  

The paucity of empirical work means we can only hypothesize these scale and 

scope economies, though intuition and observation may make some hypotheses stronger 

                                                 
4 The mergers and acquisitions example suggests a somewhat different source of competitive advantage for 
certain firms, arising from the fact that a firm may, over time, acquire sufficient experience that it can 
provide, in essence, a more sophisticated product to its clients, which may also choose such a firm in part 
because they can be assured they have retained the most experienced and knowledgeable advisers.  This 
phenomenon, familiar in IO studies of a range of service industries, can lead to a “natural” concentration in 
certain subsectors, even where scale and scope economies do not suggest that such concentration is driven 
by cost efficiencies.
