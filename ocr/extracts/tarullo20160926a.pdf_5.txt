that began after the original stress test in the winter of 2009.4  While, understandably, many 

focus on the quantitative side and its implications for capital distributions, the importance of the 

qualitative component has been perhaps underappreciated.  We saw during the 2009 stress test 

that many large financial institutions were unable to marshal the data necessary to gauge their 

own exposures accurately or to project the adverse effects they would suffer in a tail event, as 

opposed to a more ordinary cyclical downturn.  CCAR has required the firms to steadily improve 

their risk management and capital planning processes.  Indeed, some of the firms--particularly 

the less complex banks within the CCAR cohort--are now meeting, or are close to meeting, our 

supervisory expectations across a range of risk management and capital planning processes.  

The CCAR Review 

Clearly, then, we regard the stress testing and CCAR programs to have made substantial 

contributions to protecting the safety and soundness of the nationâ€™s largest financial firms and to 

promoting the stability of the financial system as a whole.  But, equally clearly, if a stress testing 

regime is to continue to play this role, it must be dynamic.  The hypothesized scenarios must 

change to take account of new economic and financial risks.  The supervisory model may, in 

some circumstances, need to be changed to take account of evolving economic conditions and 

bank portfolio characteristics.  Additionally, we have been refining the stress testing and CCAR 

processes in what is, of course, still a relatively new regulatory and supervisory tool.  Changes of 

all these kinds have been, and will continue to be, made from year to year.   

                                                 
4 The common equity capital ratio--which compares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets--of the 33 bank 
holding companies in the 2016 CCAR has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.2 
percent in the first quarter of 2016.  This reflects an increase of more than $700 billion in common equity capital to a 
total of $1.2 trillion during the same period.  www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20160629a.htm.
