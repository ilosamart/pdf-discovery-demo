9 For example, data from our Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) show that in 2016, only 
about half of white households had three months of emergency savings, but this was the case for less than two-fifths 
of black and Hispanic households. The 2016 SHED is at www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.
