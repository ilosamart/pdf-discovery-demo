worry about volatility of these flows and how they might exacerbate risks of financial instability, 

particularly as U.S. monetary policy normalizes.  But we should also bear in mind that many 

emerging market economies (EMEs), particularly in Asia, have improved their macroeconomic 

fundamentals over the past two decades; that they have built an adequate war chest of reserves, 

with no pending need to further reserve accumulation for precautionary purposes; and that their 

currencies are much more flexible, which acts as an adjustment mechanism to shocks and also 

lessens the possibility of fluctuations in reserves due to currency intervention.  These factors 

have made the emerging Asian economies much less vulnerable.   

Given all this, dare we imagine a world in which private capital inflows to EMEs could 

prove self-sustaining, are not offset by reverse flows of official capital, and would finance long-

term profitable investment that would help support growth in these economies while also 

supporting global growth?  In essence, these capital inflows would finance the shift from export-

led growth to domestic-led growth required by the slowdown in global trade.  And, with little or 

no official outflows, EMEs would have total capital net inflows as well, consistent with running 

current account deficits instead of current account surpluses.  As pointed out recently by former 

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the availability of profitable capital investments in one part of the 

world can help defeat secular stagnation in another part.18   

Of course, these developments may take time.  The point is that at this current juncture of 

the global economy, it is all the more important for emerging Asian economies—and, indeed, 

emerging market economies more broadly—to enhance domestic demand while pursuing
