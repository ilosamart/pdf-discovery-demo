Federal Reserve’s policy response.  I will then turn briefly to the longer-term prospects of 

our economy and the need for our country’s economic policies to be effective from both a 

shorter-term and longer-term perspective. 

Near-Term Prospects for the Economy and Policy 

In discussing the prospects for the economy and for policy in the near term, it 

bears recalling briefly how we got here.  The financial crisis that gripped global markets 

in 2008 and 2009 was more severe than any since the Great Depression.  Economic 

policymakers around the world saw the mounting risks of a global financial meltdown in 

the fall of 2008 and understood the extraordinarily dire economic consequences that such 

an event could have.  As I have described in previous remarks at this forum, governments 

and central banks worked forcefully and in close coordination to avert the looming 

collapse.  The actions to stabilize the financial system were accompanied, both in the 

United States and abroad, by substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus.  But 

notwithstanding these strong and concerted efforts, severe damage to the global economy 

could not be avoided.  The freezing of credit, the sharp drops in asset prices, dysfunction 

in financial markets, and the resulting blows to confidence sent global production and 

trade into free fall in late 2008 and early 2009. 

We meet here today almost exactly three years since the beginning of the most 

intense phase of the financial crisis and a bit more than two years since the National 

Bureau of Economic Research’s date for the start of the economic recovery.  Where do 

we stand? 

There have been some positive developments over the past few years, particularly 

when considered in the light of economic prospects as viewed at the depth of the crisis.
