The policy measures announced by European authorities a week and a half ago elicited a 

quick, strongly favorable market reaction, holding out hope that further financial disruptions can 

be averted.  However, as reflected in the negative turn of equity markets later in the week, and 

continued tight funding in some European markets, uncertainties are still clouding financial 

markets.  Market participants continue to seek clarification of the terms and scope of the measures 

broadly outlined by the relevant European countries and institutions.   

In Europe, a key near-term priority is to continue work to prevent a drying up of liquidity 

by providing both euro-denominated and, through the dollar liquidity swaps, dollar-denominated 

credit to financial institutions.  But, even if effectively implemented, this support, along with the 

support for sovereign debt markets provided by the other components of the EU package, will not 

solve the sovereign debt problems; it will only provide time to make necessary policy adjustments.  

Lasting beneficial effects will require credible action to bring fiscal deficits under control.  For the 

EU as a whole, it seems clear that the mechanisms of the European Economic and Monetary 

Union need further development if it is to achieve its intended aims.   Last week, the European 

Commission issued a communiqu√© outlining plans to enhance surveillance and develop a crisis 

management framework.  I would anticipate a robust debate over these and related matters in the 

coming months. 

The United States is in a very different position from that of the European countries whose 

debt instruments have been under such pressure.  But their experience is another reminder, if one 

were needed, that every country with sustained budget deficits and rising debt--including the 

United States--needs to act in a timely manner to put in place a credible program for sustainable 

fiscal policies. 

Thank you very much; I would be pleased to answer any questions.
