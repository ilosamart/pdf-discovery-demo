investments in areas served by several banks (such as New York or Salt Lake City)--so-

called credit hot spots--could be mitigated.  This could be to the benefit of credit deserts--

those perennially underserved rural areas or small metropolitan areas that may not have a 

bank branch or, if they do, may not constitute a major market for purposes of banks’ 

CRA evaluations.    

In reflecting on these suggestions, we have been considering a possible approach 

that might rework the assessment area definition so that banks of a certain scale would 

have separate assessment areas for their retail activities and their community 

development activities.  This would retain the law’s focus on the credit needs of a bank’s 

local community by evaluating the retail lending and services it offers in the county or 

other geographic area surrounding its branches, deposit-taking ATMs, and other 

concentrations of lending and deposit-taking.4   

As part of this approach, a bank would get CRA consideration for community 

development activities in a more expansive area.  Under the current rule, there is no ex 

ante certainty that a bank’s community development activities will receive CRA 

consideration if they are in the broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank’s 

assessment area.  This current approach has proven challenging in practice, as banks 

sometimes invest in a community development activity only to find that their examiner 

doesn’t agree that the activity is located within the bank’s assessment area.   

Community development activities, in order to achieve an appropriate scale, often 

operate in larger areas that may not neatly overlap with a bank’s assessment area.  A 

more expansive and ex ante clearer community development assessment area definition 

                                                 
4 The agencies could consider requiring assessment areas around a bank’s other physical locations, such as 
loan production or trust offices, or in areas where the bank has significant deposit or lending activity.
