Consumer Lending: Post-Crisis   

Not only have the regulations that govern consumer products changed, the consumer to 

whom those products are sold is considerably different than the consumer of a few years ago.  

During the crisis, household net worth declined about 25 percent from peak to trough.7  While 

some net worth was restored as stock markets recovered, recent retrenchment in markets 

demonstrates the volatility that still remains.  Roughly 20 percent of mortgage borrowers are 

underwater in their mortgages, leaving them without home equity to tap through sale or 

borrowing and limiting their ability to move to reduce expenses or find employment.  Still 9.7 

percent of the workforce is unemployed and nearly 6 percent is working only part time while still 

seeking full-time employment.  Although low mortgage rates help keep mortgage payments 

relatively low from an historical perspective, households remain quite burdened by debt 

payments.  The household debt service ratio, which represents the share of household after-tax 

income obligated to debt repayment, peaked near 14 percent in 2007 before dropping off to about 

12 ½ percent recently.  Despite its recent decline, this ratio is still above its average over the past 

30 years.  Much of this recent drop reflects the largest annual decline in aggregate consumer 

credit outstanding in the nearly 70-year history of the series. 

 For the moment, the contraction in consumer credit appears to be a story both of 

diminished supply and weakened demand.  While much of the decline in outstanding credit 

reflects elevated charge-offs and tighter lending standards, consumer cautiousness about debt 

appears to also play a role.  A significant net fraction of lenders still report reductions in credit 

card line availability, and the volume of new credit card offerings is only a fraction that of pre-crisis
