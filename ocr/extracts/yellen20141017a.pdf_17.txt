that ownership of private businesses is a significant source of wealth and can be a vital 

source of opportunity for many households to improve their economic circumstances and 

position in the wealth distribution. 

While business wealth is highly concentrated at the top of the distribution, it also 

represents a significant component of wealth for some other households. 36  Figure 11 

shows that slightly more than half of the top 5 percent of households have a share in a 

private business.  The average value of these holdings is nearly $4 million.  Only 

14 percent of families in the next 45 have ownership in a private business, but for those 

that do, this type of wealth constitutes a substantial portion of their assets--the average 

amount of this business equity is nearly $200,000, representing more than one-third of 

their net worth.  Only 3 percent of the bottom half of households hold equity in a private 

business, but it is a big share of wealth for those few.37  The average amount of this 

wealth is close to $20,000, 60 percent of the average net worth for these households.38  

Owning a business is risky, and most new businesses close within a few years. 

But research shows that business ownership is associated with higher levels of economic 

mobility.39  However, it appears that it has become harder to start and build businesses.  

The pace of new business creation has gradually declined over the past couple of 

                                                 
36 The SCF does not ask households whether they started businesses that closed, so reported business 

ownership and wealth is largely related only to those businesses that succeed. 
37 Distributional statistics for business ownership and assets exclude outliers with large negative net worth. 
38 Business wealth took a big hit due to the recession and has only partly recovered for most families.  For 

the bottom half of the distribution, the $20,000 average in business wealth in 2013 was down from $29,000, 

after adjusting for inflation, in 2007. The nearly $200,000 held by the next 45 percent with businesses was 

down from $228,000 in 2007.  The $4 million in business wealth of the top 5 percent in 2013 was down, in 

real terms, from $4.4 million in 2007.
