manipulated.  It is the potential of metrics manipulation that leads me to favor, in certain 

instances, clear restrictions on the scope of particularly unproductive activities. 

Let’s look at the “Volcker Rule” and consider the benefits of a specific activity and the 

costs to regulate this activity.  The Volcker Rule, which was included in the Dodd-Frank Act and 

should have the biggest impact on the largest and most complex financial institutions, prohibits 

proprietary trading by federally insured banks and their affiliates, such as broker-dealers.  

Proprietary trading by such financial institutions is a capital markets activity quite distinct from 

the prototypical banking relationship that exists to allocate financing from depositors to projects 

that produce value.  I view proprietary trading as an activity of low or no real economic value 

that should not be part of any banking model that has an implicit government backstop.   

Nonetheless, the Volcker Rule, as written by Congress, provides limited exemptions to 

this proprietary trading ban, so activities that would otherwise constitute proprietary trading can 

be permitted if those activities constitute hedging or market-making and do not threaten the 

soundness of the bank or the stability of the financial system as a whole.  Stated in terms of the 

analogy I have been using here, federally insured financial institutions and their affiliates can 

operate in narrow circumstances along the lines of a low-road banking model where there are 

sufficient guard rails in place to protect the integrity of the banking system.  These guard rails are 

those limited exemptions based on safety and soundness and financial stability. 

The law mandates that the five regulators craft their implementing regulations to reflect 

the broad prohibition on proprietary trading activities by regulated banks, albeit with exemptions.  

The regulators then need to carefully examine whether exemptions like market-making or 

hedging can be conducted by the financial institution within the guard rails of safety and 

soundness and financial stability and therefore fit within the exemptions as Congress intended.
