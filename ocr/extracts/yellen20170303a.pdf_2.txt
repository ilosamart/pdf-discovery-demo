I am pleased to join you today to discuss the U.S. economy and the Federal 

Reserve’s monetary policy.  I strongly believe that my colleagues and I should explain, as 

clearly as we can, both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental principles that 

underlie our strategy.   

Today I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years 

since the onset of the financial crisis.  Although the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy for 

systematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment 

and price stability has not changed during this period, the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way.  I will 

spend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee 

has made since 2014, a year that I see as a turning point, when the FOMC began to 

transition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it 

back.   

The process of scaling back accommodation has so far proceeded at a slower pace 

than most FOMC participants anticipated in 2014.  Both unexpected economic 

developments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global 

economies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and, 

consequently, the appropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the 

longer run.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to 

warrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate.  However, 

given how close we are to meeting our statutory goals, and in the absence of new 

developments that might materially worsen the economic outlook, the process of scaling 

back accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016.
