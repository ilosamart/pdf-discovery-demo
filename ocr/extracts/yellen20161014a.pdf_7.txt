Recession’s long duration and the subsequent slow recovery.10  More generally, if larger 

firms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones, overall growth in 

investment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across 

different types of businesses.  Modeling any of these issues quantitatively will likely 

require the use of a heterogeneous-agent framework.     

Economists’ understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect 

the economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are 

heterogeneous.  For example, in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission 

mechanism, central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on 

consumption and investment.  Once heterogeneity is taken into account, other important 

channels emerge.  For example, spending by many households and firms appears to be 

quite sensitive to changes in labor income, business sales, or the value of collateral that in 

turn affects their access to credit--conditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly.  

Studying monetary models with heterogeneous agents more closely could help us shed 

new light on these aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism. 

While the economics profession has long been aware that these issues matter, 

their effects had been incorporated into macro models only to a very limited extent prior 

to the financial crisis.11  I am glad to now see a greater emphasis on the possible 

macroeconomic consequences of heterogeneity, including in work by economists at the

and Duygan-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga (2015).  A general-equilibrium model with 
heterogeneity among firms and credit frictions is studied in Khan and Thomas (2013).  For the role of entry 
and exit in macroeconomic dynamics, see Clementi and Palazzo (2016) as well as Gourio, Messer, and 
Siemer (2016).

macroeconomy, see Krusell and Smith (1998).
