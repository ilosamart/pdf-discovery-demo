What We Are Learning About Financial Inclusion 

Account access and credit may be helpful and possibly even necessary 

components of a solution.  But they are unlikely to provide a complete solution on their 

own.  Continued progress on financial inclusion is likely to require solutions that are 

designed with an understanding of the issues that underserved communities face.  

In particular, it appears that many unbanked or underbanked people in the United 

States are intentionally choosing not to maintain a bank account, which may hold clues to 

what underserved families and small businesses actually need.  The data show that nearly 

half of the unbanked households actually had bank accounts in the past, based on a 2015 

FDIC survey.16  A third of these previously banked households explained that they 

currently did not have bank accounts because of high or unpredictable fees, as did 

roughly a fifth of unbanked households that previously did not have accounts.  The single 

most cited reason for not having accounts was not having “enough money.”  More than 

10 percent of the unbanked explained that they simply “don’t trust banks.”  Those 

findings were echoed at an international level by the Findex database, where roughly a 

fifth of adults without a financial account cited a lack of trust in the financial system.17
