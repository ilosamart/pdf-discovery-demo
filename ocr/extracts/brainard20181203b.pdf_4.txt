We are committed to continuing Chair Yellen’s legacy.  In our service to the American 

people, we recognize that our monetary policy, financial stability, and supervisory activities have 

an important influence on the financial health of Americans in communities across the country. 

Promoting community development is one of the key purposes and functions of the Federal 

Reserve, and we have a responsibility to ensure that consumer and community perspectives 

inform Federal Reserve policy, research, and actions, including vulnerable communities.7   

In his inaugural remarks as Chairman, Jay Powell underscored that it is our duty at the 

Federal Reserve to “approach every issue through a rigorous evaluation of the facts, theory, 

empirical analysis, and relevant research.”8  That lens informs our community development 

responsibilities:  we seek to learn from the experience of manufacturing workers, homeowners, 

community bankers, nonprofit executives, community organizers, and small business owners to 

help inform our policymaking.9 

Under Chair Yellen’s leadership, the Board of Governors established a Community 

Advisory Council (CAC) to help provide regular insights into the conditions facing low- and 

moderate-income communities.10  Recently, CAC members provided informative public 

comments to the Board on the Community Reinvestment Act and current market conditions 

within low- and moderate-income communities.11
