Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  I will begin by reviewing 

recent economic developments and then turn to supply-side considerations, such as the 

level of potential output and the potential growth of our economy.  I will conclude with a 

discussion of monetary policy.  As always, the views I express here today are mine alone. 

Recent Developments and the State of the Economy 

The U.S. economy has improved steadily since the recovery began seven years 

ago.  Our economy is now 10 percent larger than at its previous peak in 2007.  

Employment has surpassed its 2008 peak by 5 million workers, and the unemployment 

rate has fallen from 10 percent to 5 percent, close to the level that many observers 

associate with full employment.   

Labor market developments remain healthy, with employers adding roughly 

200,000 jobs per month so far this year--a pace similar to that of the past several years 

(figure 1).  Job growth continues to be substantially faster than the underlying growth of 

the labor force, so the labor market continues to tighten.  Despite the strong job gains, the 

unemployment rate has flattened out at 5 percent over the past six months thanks to a 

welcome increase in the labor force participation rate.  Meanwhile, there are tentative and 

encouraging signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly 

earnings, which are rising faster than inflation and productivity.  All told, labor market 

indicators show an economy on solid footing. 

Recent spending data have been less positive than the labor market data.  Growth 

of personal consumption slowed noticeably in the first quarter.  Business fixed 

investment has fallen for two consecutive quarters, mainly because of a steep decline in 

energy-related capital expenditures.  As a result, gross domestic product (GDP) growth
