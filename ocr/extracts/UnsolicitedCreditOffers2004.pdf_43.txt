Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 39 

These findings suggest that the inconvenience associated with receiving mailings is, 
overall, not especially great for consumers, even though they apparently frequently 
consider the mailings “junk mail.” Although credit card holders are most likely to 
receive prescreened solicitations for additional credit cards, and they are more likely than 
those without cards to say that an opt-out list is a good idea, they largely do not believe 
that government should eliminate the availability of such solicitations. Presumably this 
feeling is associated with the view that information about new products, features, and 
pricing is something that is worthwhile, even if only occasionally used. Although most 
consumers appear to prefer the availability of an opt-out list, they also appear to prefer 
that they decide the opt-out question for themselves rather than have the government ban 
the solicitations altogether. 

THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT 

Second, and potentially much more consequential regarding the costs of prescreened 
solicitations, is the issue of identity theft. Theft of individuals’ identifying information, 
including bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and credit information, and 
use of the information for fraudulent activities has become a major issue for law 
enforcement. Crimes of this sort have become prevalent enough and of sufficient 
concern that identity theft has become the recent focus of legislative activity at both the 
federal and state levels. Indeed, title I of the Fact Act is “Identity Theft Prevention and 
Credit History Restoration,” and fighting identity theft was one of the motivating factors 
for passage of the act. In 2004, less than seven months after passage of the Fact Act, the 
Congress turned again to identity theft with passage of the Identity Theft Penalty 
Enhancement Act. The latter legislation establishes a new federal crime of “aggravated 
identity theft” for certain kinds of identity-related criminal activity and specifies 
penalties. 

Although identity theft has become a major public issue and is costly to consumers and 
the economic system generally, a complete review of its causes, consequences, and 
prevention is beyond the scope of this study, which involves only unsolicited written 
offers of credit and insurance. Nonetheless, because some observers connect prescreened 
offers with the possibility of identity theft, some examination is warranted. 
Consequently, this section looks at congressional testimony on the subject along with a 
review of studies done by others, public comments, and findings on the subject from the 
consumer survey. 

Definition of Identity Theft 

The definition of identity theft has varied among observers of financial institutions and 
others interested in the question. The significance of these variations was evident at a 
February 2004 one-day conference in Philadelphia on the problem of identity theft, which
