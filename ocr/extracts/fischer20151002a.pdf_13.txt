Conclusion 

To sum up:  The need for coordination across different regulators with distinct 

mandates creates challenges to the timely deployment of macroprudential measures in the 

United States.  Further, the toolkit to act countercyclically in the face of building 

financial stability risks is limited, requires more research on its efficacy, and may need to 

be enhanced.  Given these challenges, we need to consider the potential role of monetary 

policy in fostering financial stability while recognizing that there is more research to be 

done in clarifying the potential costs and benefits of doing so when conditions appear so 

to warrant. 

After all of the successful work that has been done to reform the financial system 

since the Global Financial Crisis, this summary may appear daunting and disappointing.  

But it is important to highlight these challenges now.  Currently, the U.S. financial 

system appears resilient, reflecting the impressive progress made since the crisis.  We 

need to address these questions now, before new risks emerge.
