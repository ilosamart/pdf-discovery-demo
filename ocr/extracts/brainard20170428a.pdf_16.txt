institutions do reject access, they are required to provide the relevant authorities detailed 

reasoning for the rejection.  

The directive attempts to mitigate the attendant data-security and consumer-protection 

risks with a number of measures that, by and large, are not readily available policy options in the 

United States.  Importantly, third parties that access bank accounts will be subject to licensing 

and registration requirements, as well as associated capital and insurance requirements. 

Moreover, the directive envisions that electronic payments will be authorized by two-factor 

authentication--for example “something you know” and “something you are.”31  

The United States is likely to address these issues in a different way, at least initially, 

given that regulatory authorities are more broadly distributed, and the relevant statutory language 

predates these technological developments.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 

issued a Request for Information last fall to explore issues surrounding consumers’ granting 

access to account information to third parties.32  Of course, safety and soundness regulation--and 

with it, concerns about data security, cyber security, and vendor risk management--is distributed 

among a number of regulators.  For instance, there may be value to examining the vendor risk 

management guidance so that it facilitates banks connecting more securely and efficiently with 

the fintech apps that consumers prefer.33  Similarly, it could be useful to periodically assess 

whether and how authority under the Bank Service Company Act might pertain to developments
