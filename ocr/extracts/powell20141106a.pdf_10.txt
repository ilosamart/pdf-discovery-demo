about whether to clear with a particular CCP or how to judge their exposures to it.  All 

major stakeholders--clearing members, clients, regulators, and the broader market--

should be aware of the risks involved so that they can take appropriate steps to mitigate 

them. 

Stress testing   

The disclosure of CCP stress-test results to clearing members is important so that 

clearing members can have a full understanding of a CCPâ€™s risk profile.  This disclosure, 

however, would be of little help if the stress tests themselves were insufficiently 

comprehensive and robust.  For example, consider a case in which a bank belongs to two 

CCPs that clear similar products but the disclosed stress tests for the CCPs are based on 

materially different scenarios.  This state of affairs could easily result in more confusion 

than clarity.   

It is time for domestic and international regulators to consider steps to strengthen 

credit and liquidity stress testing conducted by CCPs.  Currently, most major CCPs 

engage in some form of stress testing.  However, both clearing members and regulators 

need a more systematic view of what stress tests are performed, at what frequency, with 

what assumptions, and with what results.  Aside from these issues involving individual 

stress tests, there are also important questions about the comparability of stress scenarios, 

assumptions, and results across similar and different types of CCPs.  A related issue is 

whether regulators should consider some sort of standardized approach to supervisory 

stress testing.  Not all CCPs are alike.  But there may be approaches that could bring 

some of the benefits of standardization while allowing tailoring of some scenarios to the 

activities of particular CCPs or groups of CCPs.  Clearly, a greater degree of uniformity
