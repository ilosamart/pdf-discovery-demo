  This assessment is important because an overleveraged nonfinancial sector 

could serve to amplify shocks, to the detriment of the functioning of the financial sector 

and broader economy.  Our judgment of how the financial sector is affecting economic 

activity reflects both information on lenders--most notably, underwriting standards, risk 

appetite, and balance sheet capacity--and analytical indicators of macroeconomic 

vulnerability to financial risks.  Meanwhile, efforts are under way, both at the Federal 

Reserve and elsewhere, to evaluate and develop new macroprudential tools and to 

develop early warning indicators that could help identify and limit future buildups of 

systemic risk.  

 In the decades prior to the financial crisis, financial stability policy tended to be 

overshadowed by monetary policy, which had come to be viewed as the principal 

function of central banks.  In the aftermath of the crisis, however, financial stability 

policy has taken on greater prominence and is now generally considered to stand on an 

equal footing with monetary policy as a critical responsibility of central banks.  We have 

spent decades building and refining the infrastructure for conducting monetary policy.  

And although we have done much in a short time to improve our understanding of 

systemic risk and to incorporate a macroprudential perspective into supervision, our 

framework for conducting financial stability policy is not yet at the same level.  

Continuing to develop an effective set of macroprudential policy indicators and tools,
