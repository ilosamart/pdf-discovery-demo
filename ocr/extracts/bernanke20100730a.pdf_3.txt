consumer spending seems likely to pick up in coming quarters from its recent modest 

pace, supported by gains in income and improving credit conditions.  In the business 

sector, investment in equipment and software has been increasing rapidly, in part as a 

result of the deferral of capital outlays during the downturn and the need of many 

businesses to replace aging equipment.  At the same time, rising U.S. exports, reflecting 

the expansion of the global economy and the recovery of world trade, have helped foster 

growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.  

To be sure, notable restraints on the recovery persist.  The housing market has 

remained weak, with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home 

prices and new construction.  Similarly, poor economic fundamentals and tight credit are 

holding back investment in nonresidential structures, such as office buildings, hotels, and 

shopping malls. 

Importantly, the slow recovery in the labor market and the attendant uncertainty 

about job prospects are weighing on household confidence and spending.  After two years 

of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during 

the first half of this year, an improvement but still a pace insufficient to reduce the 

unemployment rate materially.  In all likelihood, significant time will be required to 

restore the nearly 8-1/2 million jobs that were lost over 2008 and 2009.  Moreover, nearly 

half of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months.  Long-term 

unemployment not only imposes exceptional near-term hardships on workers and their 

families, it also erodes skills and may have long-lasting effects on workersâ€™ employment 

and earnings prospects.
