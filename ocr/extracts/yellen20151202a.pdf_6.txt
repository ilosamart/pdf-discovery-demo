FOMC’s goal of maximum employment.  However, less progress has been made on the 

second leg of our dual mandate--price stability--as inflation continues to run below the 

FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.  Overall consumer price inflation--as 

measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures--was 

only 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October.  However, this number largely 

reflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014 that, in turn, has 

pushed down retail prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products.  Because 

food and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding those 

two categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future 

overall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation.  But core inflation--which ran 

at 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent 

objective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  The stronger dollar has 

pushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on 

core inflation.3  The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect 

effects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers 

passed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy-related costs.  Taking 

account of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to 

1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States 

has been running in the vicinity of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.   

Let me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several 

years.  To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that 

will be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in
