teach and apply in the classroom guide those decisions and even help explain human 

behavior outside of the workings of the economy.  For example, to continue to grow and 

succeed, any business owner should understand the differences between fixed cost, 

variable cost, average cost, and marginal cost.  Businesses and investors need to 

understand present or discounted value, but so should any parent or grandparent starting a 

college fund.  Economics teaches us about the power of incentives, which are central to 

thinking about and understanding regulatory and tax policy.  But incentives also help 

motivate people in a variety of other settings, such as encouraging students to do their 

best in school, helping reduce traffic jams, or even nudging someone to save more or to 

exercise regularly.  Economics is a practical and powerful tool for understanding how we 

relate to each other.   

And that’s why what you do for your students is so important.  Like all teachers, 

you are helping prepare them for success in life.  The knowledge you impart and the 

intellect and talents you help develop are tools that your students can use to achieve that 

success.  Economics teaches analytical and critical thinking skills useful to anyone.  Part 

of your students’ success is their economic success as capable, creative, and productive 

members of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances.  Your 

students benefit from this education, but so does everyone else in society.  We all benefit 

when better-educated citizens support economic policies that help our nation prosper.  

We all benefit from the capability, creativity, and productivity of our workforce, because 

nothing is more important to a healthy and growing economy.  Responsible consumers 

skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times, and stronger 

household finances overall can help sustain economic growth and mitigate a downturn.
