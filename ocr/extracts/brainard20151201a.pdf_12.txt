federal funds rate. 16  As a result, policy is likely to remain more constrained at the zero 

lower bound than above it.  As the probability of hitting the zero lower bound increases, 

the asymmetry in policy flexibility becomes more pronounced.  Because we have more 

space to respond by raising rates if inflationary forces accelerate than by cutting rates if 

disinflationary forces emerge, when nominal neutral rates are likely to be lower on 

average, we should be cautious about raising rates, do so gradually, and carefully assess 

the effects on economic and financial conditions as we go.  Moreover, because the 

Federal Reserve’s asset holdings help maintain accommodative financial conditions, it 

would be prudent to maintain reinvestments until the normalization of the federal funds 

rate is sufficiently far along to allow room to cut nominal rates if economic conditions 

deteriorate. 

The asymmetry of policy flexibility at the zero lower bound also arises when 

there is uncertainty about the level of the neutral real rate.  As discussed in recent papers, 

if there is significant uncertainty about the level of the neutral real rate, risk management 

considerations suggest that policymakers should respond cautiously to signs that the 

neutral real rate may be rising, particularly when the policy rate is close to the zero lower 

bound.17  In the presence of uncertainty, there is a risk that the actual neutral real rate is 

either higher or lower than current estimates of the neutral real rate, and the stance of 

policy will therefore be either more accommodative or more restrictive than intended.  If 

the actual neutral rate is higher than estimated, and policy is more accommodative than 

intended, the stance of policy can be readily tightened later to restrain any buildup in 

inflationary pressures.  But, if the actual neutral real rate is lower than estimated, and the
