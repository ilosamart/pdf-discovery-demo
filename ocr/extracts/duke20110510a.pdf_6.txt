and novel responses to the challenges facing our communities.  The collaborative efforts 

and information sharing from national housing and community development experts, 

including those led by our own staff, helped bring these innovative efforts to fruition.   

For example, as a result of our neighborhood stabilization work, some Reserve Banks 

partnered with national groups to help declining cities learn how to use land banks as a 

potential tool to address high rates of foreclosure and vacant properties.  Based on the 

initial success of the Genesee County Land Bank, established in Michigan in 2002, and 

resources provided by the National Vacant Properties Campaign, land banking is 

becoming an integral part of community revitalization efforts for many places across the 

country.  For example, the city of Cleveland has used the Cuyahoga County Land Bank 

as an important tool to address its vacant property issue.  Cuyahoga County works with 

lenders and servicers, including the government sponsored entities (GSEs), to access 

properties quickly after they become vacant.  This enables the county to make decisions 

regarding the REO before it becomes dilapidated or a nuisance for neighboring 

properties.   

Because dealing with vacant property is a high profile issue in Cleveland, the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly participates in conversations about 

solutions, such as land banking, and provides research on the neighborhood dynamics of 

this problem to support communities crafting solutions.  The Bank recently released the 

“Adaptive Policies Needed to Address Changing Foreclosure Landscape”5 paper to 

highlight the changing circumstances driving the foreclosure crisis and the need for
