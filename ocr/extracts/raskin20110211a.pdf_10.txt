 This means that future pooling and servicing agreements will need to look 

different than those of the past.  They will need to be much more detailed and provide

and time is of the essence because the drag on our recovery is palpable.  We need the 

incentives that permit us to reengineer this sector of the market and build a business 

model that actually works.  That model will need to provide adequate and appropriate 

compensation for servicers, protect consumers, give investors what they need, and be
