step in this process, the slowing of growth in the relatively developed and globally 

integrated Asian economies was matched by an acceleration of growth in the less 

developed and less integrated economies, maintaining the overall rapid pace of growth in 

the region.3     

Now, with China perhaps beginning to follow the same trajectory of slowing 

growth as has been experienced by its predecessors in the East Asian growth model and 

without economies of sufficient scale to fill the gap (with the notable exception of India, 

which I will discuss later), growth for the region as a whole is declining.  As shown in 

table 2, taken from the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) regional outlook 

for Asia, growth in emerging Asia is set to decline in 2015 and 2016, with China’s 

growth decelerating.4  Furthermore, the IMF projections through 2020 call for almost no 

pickup from this slower pace. 

In my discussion, I will first address some of the factors behind slowing growth in 

emerging Asia, importantly including demographics.  I will then cover one of the global 

implications of this deceleration, the effect on commodity markets, before looking at the 

                                                 
   As production of labor-intensive goods has moved from one group of countries to the next, concerns have 
been raised about a decrease in “competitiveness” in the relatively more developed Asian economies.  
These concerns have been particularly pronounced in regard to China, where commentators have 
questioned whether China’s rise has come at the expense of growth in its neighbors or provided an extra 
impetus to growth.  Research studies (see Zheng, Wern, and You (2005) and Haltmaier and others (2007)) 
have generally found that China’s rise has been positive for regional growth, with China’s development as 
an export platform boosting the overall competitiveness of the region’s exports.    
3 In addition to integration with the global economy, a number of other factors have also contributed to the 
East Asian growth miracle.  With regard to China, Brandt and Rawski (2008) highlight the importance of 
incremental reform focused on removing the most binding constraints on economic activity.  Of course, 
reform is not independent of global integration, as the heightened international competition associated with 
opening an economy likely incentivizes increased reform.   
4  The IMF does not include Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, or Taiwan in its definition of emerging Asia.  
For the purposes of my discussion, I group these four economies along with China, India, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam as emerging Asia.
