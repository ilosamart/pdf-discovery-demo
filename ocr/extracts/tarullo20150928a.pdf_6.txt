probability of insolvency below that which would be warranted if the sole regulatory aim were to 

protect customers, depositors, or even a government deposit insurance fund.  As has been much 

discussed in recent years, pre-crisis financial regulatory regimes had substantially undervalued 

systemwide considerations.  Indeed, in the first instance the crisis spread not only because of the 

direct effects engendered by the insolvency of individual firms, but also because of the dramatic 

contraction of funding available throughout markets for widely held assets such as mortgage-

backed securities.  The pre-crisis explosion of short-term wholesale funding, both inside and 

outside traditional banks, left the entire financial system vulnerable to the disappearance of this 

market funding as real estate prices declined sharply and uncertainty spread about the value of 

the assets being funded.  Concerns about solvency accelerated the run of wholesale funding from 

Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, raising the prospect of classic fire sales of their assets, with 

consequent depressing effects on the balance sheets of all firms holding these assets. 

Experience during the financial crisis vindicated the view of those who had argued that 

liquidity, as well as capital, in large intermediaries needed to be regulated.2  It also buttressed the 

view that capital and liquidity regulation are closely related and need to be developed in tandem, 

if not as part of the same regulatory framework.  Much academic research prompted by the crisis 

has focused on the interrelationship between funding and solvency problems.3 

Here, then, is another way in which the characteristics of the liability side of an 

intermediary’s balance sheet should determine the form and stringency of capital regulation.
