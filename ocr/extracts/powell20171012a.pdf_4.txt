Over the past couple of years, however, net inflows have recovered and have 

averaged, if China is excluded, 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016 and about 1-1/2 percent of 

GDP in early 2017.  As shown in slide 3, other measures of capital flows, such as flows 

into EME investment funds, show an even sharper rebound.   

The recent recovery of investor appetite for EME exposure has shown up in asset 

prices as well.  Emerging-market credit spreads have declined, and equity prices have 

risen (slide 4).  These developments are not occurring in isolation, but in the context of a 

general improvement in the global outlook and in investor risk sentiment.  The 

improvement in economic fundamentals raises the following question:  To what extent 

can the recent recovery in EME capital flows be explained by these better economic 

fundamentals?   

One way to shed light on this question is to compare the recent behavior of EME 

capital flows with what we might expect from a model of these flows based on historical 

data.  In a recent study, Federal Reserve staff regressed net private capital inflows into 

several key EMEs on measures of investment opportunities in these economies, monetary 

policy variables, and risk sentiment variables.3  As can be seen in slide 5, by comparing 

the solid and dashed lines, the model does a fairly good job overall of fitting the data.   

It is instructive to look at what the model tells us about the slowing of flows 

between 2010 and 2015.  Note that the falloff in commodity prices (the red portion of the 

                                                 
3 The specific variables in the regression include the GDP growth differential between EMEs and advanced 
economies, commodity prices, EME interest rate differentials with advanced economies, measures of the 
Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, the VIX (which is the one-month-ahead option-implied volatility of 
the S&P 500 index), and country-specific emerging market credit spreads (see Clark and others, 2016). 
Note that, because of special factors driving its flows over the past few years, China is not included in this 
analysis. Other studies that have also examined determinants of EME capital flows include International 
Monetary Fund (2016b), Koepke (2015), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Fratzscher (2012), and Ghosh and 
others (2012).  Generally, these papers find that many factors, including both “pull” and “push,” affect 
EME capital flows.
