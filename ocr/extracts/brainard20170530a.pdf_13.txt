experience.  And using two tools at once could easily foster confusion.  Thus, in my 

view, predictability, precision, and clarity of communications all argue in favor of 

focusing policy on the federal funds rate as the single active tool.  In this framework, the 

balance sheet essentially would remain subordinate to the federal funds rate.   

Under the subordinated balance sheet approach, once the change in reinvestment 

policy is triggered, the balance sheet would essentially be set on autopilot to shrink 

passively until it reaches a neutral level, expanding in line with the demand for currency 

thereafter.  I favor an approach that would gradually and predictably increase the 

maximum amount of securities the market will be required to absorb each month, while 

avoiding spikes.  Thus, in an abundance of caution, I prefer to cap monthly redemptions 

at a pace that gradually increases over a fixed period.  In addition, I would be inclined to 

follow a similar approach in managing the reduction of the holdings of Treasury 

securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), calibrated according to their particular 

characteristics. 

The Committee’s policy normalization principles have made clear that the Federal 

Reserve “will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement 

monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”12  Over time, the gradual reduction in our 

balance sheet should result in a gradual decline in reserves to a longer-run level that is 

well below today’s level but likely somewhat higher than in the pre-crisis regime.  It is 

difficult to know in advance with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop.  

That minimum level will depend on the structural demand for reserves and the short-term 

variability in the demand for and supply of reserves.  During the process of balance sheet
