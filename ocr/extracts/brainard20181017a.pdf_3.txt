been shown to be an important step to financial inclusion, particularly in developing 

countries.  For instance, a 2013 experiment provided savings accounts to a random 

sample of market vendors in Kenya, most of whom were women.  The vendors with 

accounts saved at a higher rate and invested 60 percent more in their businesses relative 

to those who did not have accounts.2  Similarly, women-headed households in Nepal 

ultimately spent more on nutritious foods and education when they received free savings 

accounts relative to those who did not.3  

Using account access as a proxy for financial inclusion suggests substantial 

progress has been made.  According to the Findex Database, over two-thirds of adults 

around the globe now have some form of financial account, up from roughly half just 

seven years ago.4  This represents an increase of 800 million people.  Here in the United 

States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) most recent survey of 

unbanked and underbanked households found that 7 percent of U.S. households in 2015 

were “unbanked.”5  The unbanked rate was nearly a percentage point lower than the prior 

survey in 2013 and is lower than in earlier years.  Even with this modest improvement,
