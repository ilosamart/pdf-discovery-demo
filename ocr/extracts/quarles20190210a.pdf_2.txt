Let me begin by thanking the Bank for International Settlements and Agustín Carstens 

for the invitation to join you today.  In considering venues for my inaugural speech as chair of 

the Financial Stability Board (FSB), I found this particular opportunity quite fitting.  It is an 

honor to be here, in Hong Kong, with colleagues from around the world, representing central 

banks who are committed to advancing financial stability not only in their home countries but 

also globally. 

I would like to discuss with you tonight my view of how the work of the FSB must 

evolve, and some key principles that I think should inform that work.  My predecessor, Bank of 

England Governor Mark Carney, guided the FSB for the last seven years along a path that was 

formidably challenging.  The Global Financial Crisis had exposed fault lines in the financial 

system that had to be addressed immediately, comprehensively, and vigorously.  The body of 

post-crisis regulation that has resulted, though it involved the energy and efforts of a 

kaleidoscopically varied host of standard setters, regulators, and central banks--including all the 

institutions in this room--was nonetheless accomplished under the aegis and at the instigation of 

the FSB.  It was a tour de force of orchestration, and it has unquestionably made the financial 

system safer and more resilient. 

Today, however, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed.  Basel III is 

final, the largest global banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter 

derivatives markets are safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-to fail 

institutions.  Through greater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from 

non-bank financial intermediation.  And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and 

unsung task of establishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSB’s 

clearly defined principles.
