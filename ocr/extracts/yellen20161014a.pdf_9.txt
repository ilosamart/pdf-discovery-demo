Although the scope of these questions extends beyond the themes of this 

conference, it does include issues that are closely related.  Consider the influence of 

balance sheet conditions and noninterest credit terms on spending and overall activity--an 

area where it is important to take account of differences across individual households and 

firms, as I just noted.  Research on this topic has, of course, been ongoing for some time, 

and it has expanded greatly in the wake of the financial crisis.13  But I believe we have a 

lot more to learn about the ways in which changes in underwriting standards and other 

determinants of credit availability interact with interest rates to affect such things as 

consumer spending, housing demand and home prices, business investment (especially 

for small firms), and the formation of new firms.14  For example, is the persistent increase 

in the personal saving rate that we have observed since the collapse of the housing bubble 

primarily a result of a sustained shift toward more prudent underwriting standards by 

                                                 
13 For an example of early research on this topic, see Bernanke and Gertler (1989).  Other important pre-
crisis studies include the development of the financial accelerator model by Bernanke and others (1999a) 
and work by Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell (2003) on the bank balance sheet 
channel and the effects of bank loan supply shocks.  For a more recent summary of the role of banks in the 
monetary transmission mechanism, see Peek and Rosengren (2013).  Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmer (2012) 
provide evidence for the collateral channel of real estate for corporate investment, while Mian, Rao, and 
Sufi (2013) examine the influence of household balance sheets on consumption. 
14 More empirical work would be useful to disentangle the spending effects that result from changes in 
credit conditions from those that result from movements in interest rates, as estimates of the latter likely 
often inadvertently incorporate the former.  Most empirical models of the overall economy do not explicitly 
control for the influence of noninterest credit factors on consumption and investment; as a result, estimated 
interest rate effects will partially reflect the influence of these factors to the extent these factors are 
correlated with interest rates.  There are many reasons to suspect that this is the case.  Movements in 
interest rates influence a firmâ€™s cash flow and the value of its collateral, all else being equal.  Higher 
interest rates also adversely affect consumer spending and especially residential investment, both by 
forcing households to devote a greater portion of their income to debt service and by making it more 
difficult to qualify for a loan because of maximum payment-to-income rules.  Evidence for these effects is 
provided by Gertler and Karadi (2015), who show that relatively small changes in short-term interest rates 
are correlated with large movements in credit costs.  Such correlations and interactions may explain why 
some types of spending appear to be more correlated with movements in nominal interest rates than with 
real interest rates; see Fair (2004, ch. 3) for evidence on this point.  Finally, the relative contributions of 
relaxed lending standards, low interest rates, and other factors to housing bubbles, both in the United States 
and abroad, remains an open and unsettled topic; Agnello and Shucknecht (2011) present cross-country 
evidence that monetary policy plays an important role, while Dokko and others (2011) argue that monetary 
policy was a minor influence in the most recent episode.
