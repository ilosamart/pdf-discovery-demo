be able to cut the funds rate further.  Moreover, in the latter case, the economy could face 

an increased risk of deflation--falling prices.  As the case of Japan illustrates, deflation 

may impede economic growth while being very difficult to escape.  To try to preempt 

such outcomes, a strong case existed for monetary policy to be more accommodative than 

suggested by standard policy rules calibrated to normal times.4 

So the Committee faced a situation in which more monetary policy 

accommodation was needed, and possibly for quite a long time--yet its basic policy tool, 

the federal funds rate target, had been pushed to its limit.  To put the Committee’s 

problem another way, standard policy rules and a range of other analyses implied that, to 

achieve the FOMC’s objectives, the target for the federal funds rate should be set well 

below zero, which, of course, was not feasible.  Fortunately, as I discussed earlier, the 

degree of accommodation provided by monetary policy depends not just on the current 

value of the policy rate, but on public expectations of future settings of that rate.  The 

Committee accordingly realized that it could ease policy further--and reduce uncertainty 

about future policy--by assuring the public and markets that it intended to keep the policy 

rate low for some time, and for a longer period than the public initially expected.   

At first, the Committee employed purely qualitative language to send this 

message:  After the FOMC stated in December 2008 that it would likely be appropriate 

for the federal funds rate to remain near zero for “some time,” it changed the formulation 

in March 2009 to “an extended period.”5  However, such language did not convey very 

precisely the Committee’s intentions.  In August 2011, the Committee introduced a 

specific date into its guidance, stating that conditions would likely warrant keeping the
