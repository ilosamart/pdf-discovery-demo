they mean policies that will reduce the supply of credit to the housing sector without 

changing the central bank interest rate. 

Sector-specific regulatory and supervisory policies in the financial sector were 

used extensively and systematically in the United States in the period following World 

War II until the 1990s and are now being used in other advanced and developing 

countries.  Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert review the use of such measures in the United 

States.10  Frequently, these policies were aimed at encouraging or discouraging activity in 

particular sectors, for example agriculture, exports, manufacturing, or housing; 

sometimes broad, non-interest-rate measures were used to try to deal with inflation or 

asset-price increases, for instance, the use of credit controls.     

The issue of how monetary policy should relate to asset-price inflation had been

namely that monetary policy--meaning interest rate policy--should not react to rising 

asset prices or suspected bubbles except to the extent that they affect either employment 

and/or price stability.  Operationally, this approach was much more likely to lead to
