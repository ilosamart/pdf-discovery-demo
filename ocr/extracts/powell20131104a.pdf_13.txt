stop.  The timing of this moderation in the pace of purchases is necessarily uncertain, as it 

depends on the evolution of the economy.   

While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal 

funds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the 

overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive.  First, tightening will in all 

likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the 

United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered 

by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.  Second, although conditions vary 

from country to country, on the whole, EMEs exhibit greater resilience than they did in 

prior decades, reflecting, among other factors, more flexible exchange rates, greater 

stocks of international reserves, stronger fiscal positions, and better regulated and more 

conservatively managed banking systems.  

EMEs have policy tools to help manage any negative externalities that may arise, 

and recent developments provide additional rationale for them to redouble their efforts to 

bolster their resiliency.14  Reducing vulnerabilities, improving policy frameworks, and 

safeguarding the financial sector will go a long way toward making EMEs more robust to 

a wide range of shocks, not just those that may arise from changes in monetary policy in 

the advanced economies.  Global investors should also learn from the experience of this 

summer, when it became clear that unwinding leveraged carry trades can be difficult in 

an environment of lower liquidity. 

As for advanced economies, policymakers should move gradually to restore 

normal policies only as their economic recoveries are more firmly established, consistent 

with their mandates.  In addition, policymakers should communicate as clearly as
