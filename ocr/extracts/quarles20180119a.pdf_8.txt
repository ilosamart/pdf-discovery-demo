that they apply to G-SIB banks.  I believe it is time to take concrete steps toward calibrating 

liquidity requirements differently for large, non-G-SIBs than for G-SIBs.  And I see prospects for 

further liquidity tailoring in that the content and frequency of LCR reporting are the same for the 

range of firms currently subject to the modified LCR as they are for the large non-G-SIBs that 

are subject to the full LCR.  We should also explore opportunities to apply additional tailoring 

for these firms in other areas, such as single counterparty credit limits and resolution planning 

requirements. 

Another area that I think we should revisit are the “advanced approaches” thresholds that 

identify internationally active banks.  These thresholds are significant not only for identifying 

which banking firms are subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements, but 

also for identifying which firms are subject to various other Basel Committee standards, such as 

the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and the LCR.  The metrics 

used to identify internationally active firms--$250 billion in total assets or $10 billion in on-

balance-sheet foreign exposures--were formulated well over a decade ago, were the result of a 

defensible but not ineluctable analysis, and have not been refined since then.  We should explore 

ways to bring these criteria into better alignment with our objectives.  

A third area in which I will be working with my Board colleagues is a meaningful 

simplification of our framework of loss absorbency requirements.  There are different ways to 

count the number of loss absorbency constraints that our large banking firms face--which is 

perhaps in itself an indication of a surfeit of complexity if we can’t be perfectly sure of how to 

count them--but the number I come up with is 24 total requirements in the framework.  While I 

do not know precisely the socially optimal number of loss absorbency requirements for large 

banking firms, I am reasonably certain that 24 is too many.  Candidates for simplification
