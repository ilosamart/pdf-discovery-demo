sheet or warehousing capacity, guarantee fees charged by the GSEs, borrowers’ ability to 

obtain private mortgage insurance or second liens, and investor appetite for private-label 

mortgage securitizations.  Respondents appeared to put particular weight on GSE 

putbacks, the economic outlook, and the risk-adjusted opportunity cost.  In addition, 

several large banks cited capacity constraints and borrowers’ difficulties in obtaining 

private mortgage insurance or second liens as at least somewhat important factors in 

restraining their willingness to approve such loans. 

Over time, some of these factors should exert less of a drag on mortgage credit 

availability.  For example, as the economic and housing market recovery continues, 

lenders should gain confidence that mortgage loans will perform well, and they should 

expand their lending accordingly. 

Capacity constraints will likely also ease.  Refinancing applications have 

expanded much more over the past year and a half than lenders’ ability to process these 

loans.  For example, one measure of capacity constraints--the number of real estate credit 

employees--has only edged up over this period (figure 13).  When capacity constraints 

are binding, lenders may prioritize the processing of easier-to-complete or more 

profitable loan applications.  Indeed, preliminary research by the Board’s staff suggests 

that the increase in the refinance workload during the past 18 months appears to have 

been associated with a 25 to 35 percent decrease in purchase originations among 

borrowers with credit scores between 620 and 680 and a 10 to 15 percent decrease among 

borrowers with credit scores between 680 and 710.

  Any such crowding-out effect 

should start to unwind as the current refinancing boom decelerates.

 These estimates are smaller than the estimates in the March 2013 Mortgage Bankers Association speech 

because capacity constraints appear to have become less severe in recent months (see Duke, “Comments on
