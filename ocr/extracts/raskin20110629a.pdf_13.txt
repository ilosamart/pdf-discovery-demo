we all have a stake.  One of the positive commitments that can emerge from this period of 

terrible economic distress is the determination that all Americans, regardless of income, 

have access to reasonably priced financial products and services so that they may fully 

participate in our nationâ€™s economy and safely build assets for their futures.   

Thank you.
