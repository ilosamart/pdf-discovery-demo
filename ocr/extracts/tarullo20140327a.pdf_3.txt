legitimate differences within the broader convergence around minimum regulatory and 

supervisory standards developed at the Basel Committee, the International Organization of 

Securities Commissions, the Financial Stability Board, and other forums. 

 These opening observations are important in responding to the curious charge of 

“Balkanization” that has been levelled at the United States and, to a lesser extent, some other 

jurisdictions, as a result of actions taken or proposed in response to problems presented by 

foreign banks during the crisis.  I say “curious” for several reasons.  One is that the charge 

reflects a misunderstanding of the allocation of responsibility between home and host supervisors 

that has evolved in the Basel Committee during the past several decades.  Another is that the 

charge seems implicitly, and oddly, premised on the notion that what we had in 2007 was a well-

functioning, integrated global financial system with effective consolidated supervision of global 

banks.  A third is that the charge overlooks the fact that much of what the United States is now 

doing is matching what the EU has quite sensibly been doing for years.   

In the rest of my remarks I will elaborate on these points, though not in the spirit of a 

debater’s arguments, but in an effort to answer the question I posed a moment ago: How, that is, 

can we successfully reduce the risks to financial stability posed by large, internationally active 

banks?  As I hope will become apparent, a theme I wish to emphasize is that we need to redouble 

efforts at genuine supervisory cooperation if we are to manage effectively the vulnerabilities and 

challenges posed by the perennial home-host issue. 

International Principles on Home- and Host-Country Responsibilities 

While the circumstances and risks may have changed, the issue of the appropriate roles of 

home and host countries is not a new one.  Indeed, it was a key motivation for creation of the 

Basel Committee in 1975 following the failures of the Herstatt and Franklin National banks.
