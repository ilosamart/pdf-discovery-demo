restraint on net exports stemming from the appreciation of the dollar over the past year, 

and from global developments more generally, may be a negative influence on GDP 

growth for somewhat longer, but that restraint is likely to continue to be outweighed by 

the other sources of growth. 

Although the labor market has been approaching estimates of maximum 

employment, inflation has been well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.  Inflation 

has been held down by the declines in crude oil prices over the past year, and the stronger 

dollar is exerting downward pressure on U.S. inflation as well.  Year-over-year changes 

in headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices have been running only a 

little above zero, and core inflation is at about 1-1/4 percent.  But for reasons discussed at 

length in Janet Yellen’s recent speech at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, as 

long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, inflation is likely to move back 

toward 2 percent as the transitory effects of oil prices and the dollar fade, and as the 

economic expansion continues.  

What about Monetary Policy?  

In support of our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability, the 

Federal Reserve has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy stance since 

the financial crisis; this policy has fostered the marked improvement in labor market 

conditions that we have seen and has helped check undesirable disinflationary pressures.   

In its statement at the end of the September meeting, the FOMC noted that it 

anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate
