U.S., Mexican, and global economies.  My appreciation for his wisdom and insight as an 

economist and policymaker has grown with each encounter. 

Our productive and, I hope, mutually beneficial relationship reflects the close 

relationship of the United States and Mexico.  Our countries are tightly linked through 

trade.  The United States is by far Mexico’s largest trading partner, accounting for about 

two-thirds of total Mexican merchandise trade.  Mexico, in turn, accounts for about one-

eighth of the United States’ foreign trade, ranking it--along with Canada and China--

among our three largest trading partners.  Not surprisingly, then, the growth of the 

Mexican and U.S. economies are strongly related. 

I’d be remiss if I concluded without noting Mexico’s tremendous economic 

strides during the past two decades.  It has tamed the rampant inflation that prevailed 

before the 1990s, placed its budget on a sounder footing, and avoided the repeated 

financial crises to which it was once prone.  Great credit goes to the thoughtful policies 

designed by Agustín and other economic leaders in Mexico.  Because the prosperity of 

our countries is so closely linked, we in the United States benefit from their foresight and 

hard work. 

Our economies continue to face challenges that require mutual cooperation.  We 

are working together to promote international financial stability, both bilaterally and 

through international forums such as the Group of Twenty and the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision. 

In closing, I deeply appreciate receiving the chamber’s Good Neighbor Award.   

Agradezco profundamente su gentileza.
