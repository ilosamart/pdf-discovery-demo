to qualify for loans, especially under current stricter standards.   

My conversations with bankers in recent weeks, however, lead me to be

  More recently, the banking agencies jointly 

issued guidance encouraging banks to work with borrowers to restructure troubled 

commercial real estate (CRE) loans in a prudent manner, and reminded examiners that--

absent other adverse factors--a loan should not be classified as impaired based solely on a
