A “Substantial Improvement in the Outlook for the Labor Market”   

The first imperative will be to judge what constitutes a substantial improvement in 

the outlook for the labor market.  Federal Reserve research concludes that the 

unemployment rate is probably the best single indicator of current labor market 

conditions.  In addition, it is a good predictor of future labor market developments.  Since 

1978, periods during which the unemployment rate declined ½ percentage point or more 

over two quarters were followed by further declines over the subsequent two quarters 

about 75 percent of the time. 

That said, the unemployment rate also has its limitations.  As I noted before, the 

unemployment rate may decline for reasons other than improved labor demand, such as 

when workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force.  In addition, while 

movements in the rate tend to be fairly persistent, recent history provides several cases in 

which the unemployment rate fell substantially and then stabilized at still-elevated levels.  

For example, between the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, the 

unemployment rate fell ½ percentage point but was then little changed over the next two 

quarters.  Similarly, the unemployment rate fell ¾ percentage point between the third 

quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, only to level off over the subsequent spring 

and summer.  

To judge whether there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the 

labor market, I therefore expect to consider additional labor market indicators along with 

the overall outlook for economic growth.  For example, the pace of payroll employment 

growth is highly correlated with a diverse set of labor market indicators, and a decline in
