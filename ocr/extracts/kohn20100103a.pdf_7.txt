terms and standards for lending and to raise the rates they charge relative to benchmark 

rates.  I expect bank credit to turn around only slowly as banks rebuild capital and 

become less uncertain about economic prospects.   

 Lingering credit constraints are a key reason why I expect the strengthening in 

economic activity to be gradual and the drop in the unemployment rate to be slow.  Even 

as the impetus from fiscal policy and the inventory cycle wanes later in 2010, however, 

private final demand should be bolstered by further improvements in securities markets 

and the gradual pickup in credit availability from banks.  In addition, spending on houses, 

consumer durables, and business capital equipment should rebound from what appear to 

be exceptionally low levels.  We have already seen some hints of this increase in private 

demand in recent months.  But, understandably, households and businesses and bank 

lenders remain very cautious, and the odds are that the pickup in spending will not be 

very sharp.    

 In an environment of considerable persisting slack in labor and product markets, 

and with productivity having increased substantially in recent quarters, cost and price 

inflation should remain quite subdued.  In the short run, headline inflation will be driven 

importantly by movements in energy and food prices; judging from the structure of 

futures prices, markets are not expecting a further sharp rise in those prices, and thus 

headline inflation should retreat toward core inflation.  Inflation outside of the food and 

energy sectors has been declining slowly, held up by relatively stable inflation 

expectations.  Some further slowing is possible if the economic rebound is as gradual as I 

think it is likely to be.  As I have already noted, keeping inflation expectations anchored 

will be critical for achieving our objectives for prices and output.
