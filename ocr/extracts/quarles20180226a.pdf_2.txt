Thank you for the opportunity to take part in this important and influential 

conference.1  I would like to discuss my view of current economic conditions in the 

United States, provide an assessment of the sustainability of the current momentum in the 

economy, and then conclude with a look at some of the potential implications that would 

follow from a sustained upturn in economic growth.  To preview my conclusions, I am 

fairly optimistic about the current state of the economy.  Along many dimensions, it has 

been quite some time since the economic environment has looked as favorable as it does 

now.  Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth through the final three quarters of 2017 

averaged almost 3 percent, a considerable step-up over the 2 percent average annual pace 

recorded over the previous eight years.  The sustainability of the recent upturn in growth 

will depend importantly on whether some of the factors that have been holding back 

growth for the past decade diminish, including weak investment and productivity.  In 

some cases, I believe the data look encouraging--for example, the recent strength of 

investment--but in others, less so, particularly the continued softness of productivity 

growth.  On balance, I am cautious, but I am also optimistic enough to believe that the 

factors that have been holding back growth need not be permanent and could turn, even 

fairly rapidly.   

What would be the likely consequences if growth were to shift up on a sustained 

basis?  Here I think it will be important to consider and observe the form that higher 

growth takes.  In particular, it matters whether growth is embodied in a sustained increase 

in the productive capacity of the economy or, instead, is primarily the product of a boost 

to aggregate demand.  The split between the two will likely have important implications
