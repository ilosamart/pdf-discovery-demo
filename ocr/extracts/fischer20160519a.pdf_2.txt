It is an honor for me to speak at the opening of this conference in honor of 

Michael Woodford, whose contributions to the theory of economic policy are frequently 

a central part of the economic analysis that takes place in the policy discussions at the 

Federal Reserve.1   

The main story I want to tell today is about the quality of Michael’s major book, 

Interest and Prices (henceforth MWIP).  I will start with his predecessors, beginning as 

Michael does in his Interest and Prices with Wicksell.2 3  I shall quote key points from 

and about Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (henceforth KWIP), and following that, from 

Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices (second edition, 1965) (henceforth MIP), which 

are relevant to MWIP, Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices (2003). 

I. Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (1898) 

1. Inflation.  The subtitle of Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (KWIP) is A Study of 

the Causes Regulating the Value of Money and its opening paragraph 

emphasizes the problem of inflation:    

Changes in the general level of prices have always excited great 

interest.  Obscure in origin, they exert a profound and far-

reaching influence on the whole economic and social life of a 

country.

Paustian, David Reifschneider, Jeremy Rudd, and Stacey Tevlin of the Federal Reserve Board for their 

advice and assistance. 
2 Wicksell’s Interest and Prices, published in German in 1898 as Geldzins und Guterpreise by Gustav 

Fischer (Jena), was first published in English (translated by R.F. Kahn) by Macmillan & Co. in 1936.  It 

was published in the United States by Augustus Kelley in 1965 in the series Reprints of Economic Classics.   
3 See Torsten Gardlund (1958), The Life of Knut Wicksell, trans. Nancy Adler (Brookfield, Vt.:  Edward 

Elgar).  Wicksell was not only a superb economist but also a remarkably interesting man, whose major 

works in economics were published starting in the late 1890s, when he was nearing the age of 50 (he was 

born in 1851 and died in 1926).  Much of his earlier work was on Malthus and Malthusianism.  The last 

paragraph of the text of Gardlund’s book (p. 330) is about Wicksell’s funeral and reads “Various 

associations and academic institutions sent the customary wreaths, but many of Wicksell’s friends and 

disciples, honoring a request, instead sent their contributions to the Malthusian Advice Bureau.”
