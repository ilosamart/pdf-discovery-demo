of capital planning, providing greater detail than what is included in the annual CCAR 

instructions.14   

I anticipate that we will take additional steps to integrate ongoing supervisory 

assessments of risk-management and other internal control processes with the annual CCAR 

exercise, and to assure that communications in both directions are heard.  One such step has just 

recently begun: The committee chaired by senior Board staff that is responsible for the oversight 

of CCAR, supported by the relevant horizontal assessment teams, will directly engage with firms 

during the course of the year to evaluate progress in remediating weaknesses or other issues 

identified in the post-CCAR letters.  Increasingly, our regular supervisory work on topics such as 

risk-identification and internal audit will focus on processes that are critical to risk management 

and capital planning at the firms, areas of focus for CCAR.  The aim of these and additional 

measures is to make CCAR more the culmination of year-round supervision of risk-management 

and capital planning processes than a discrete exercise that takes place at the same time as the 

supervisory stress tests. 

 Finally, I would note that, to provide investors, counterparties, analysts, and the public 

with better information on the meaning of an objection on qualitative grounds to a capital 

distribution plan, we now release our decisions on each capital plan and, for firms whose capital 

plans were objected to, provide a summary of the specific reasons for those objections.15 

Conclusion 

 Although strong capital regulation is critical to ensuring the safety and soundness of our 

largest financial institutions, it is not a panacea, as indeed no single regulatory device can ever
