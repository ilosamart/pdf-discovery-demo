issued in recent months--corresponding to roughly $250 million in loans a month--were sold to 

investors that financed the acquisitions in part with TALF loans.  In an encouraging sign, rate 

spreads for asset-backed securities (ABS) have declined significantly, and a substantial amount 

of ABS are now being brought to market and purchased by investors without TALF financing.  

Thus, the TALF and other Federal Reserve programs provided critical liquidity support to the 

economy until the financial system stabilized.  With the extraordinary stress on liquidity in many 

markets having abated, many of these programs either have been or are scheduled to be wound 

down. 

A second reason to expect some improvement in credit conditions for small businesses is 

that bank attitudes toward lending, including small business lending, may be shifting.  The 

January SLOOS showed that bank tightening of credit standards for small business C&I lending 

appeared to be nearing an end with similar numbers of banks reporting tightening and easing of 

their lending standards. 

 There is also some tentative, anecdotal evidence that many bankers may be devoting 

considerably more energy toward extending new loans in 2010, as contrasted with their 

overwhelming preoccupation in 2009 with collecting on or writing down loans already on their 

books.  With respect to small business lending in particular, some banks have instituted so-called 

“second look” programs that--as the name implies--involve a reconsideration of loan applications 

that would not be pursued based on a credit scoring model alone.  Some banks are also 

increasing lending through the use of SBA guarantees.  Finally, the more noticeable 

improvement that has already taken place in credit conditions for larger companies should, to 

some degree, pass through in the form of trade credit to the smaller suppliers or distributors for 

the larger firms.
