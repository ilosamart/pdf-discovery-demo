The labor market has continued to strengthen. Payroll growth has averaged 

175,000 over the past three months, more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the 

labor market.  Although earlier in the recovery, it appeared that the U-3 unemployment 

rate was running ahead of broader indicators of slack, more recently, it has been 

encouraging to see other margins of slack being drawn down.  The labor force 

participation rate has held stable, against what many believe to be a downward trend 

based on demographics, and the employment-to-population ratio has reached a new post-

recession high.  Moreover, the share of employees who work part time for economic 

reasons has recently moved down close to its pre-crisis level, after a long period of 

remaining at elevated levels.   

The most commonly used U-3 measure of the unemployment rate moved down to 

4.4 percent in April. This happens to be the cyclical low reached in 2006-07, although 

unemployment was at or below this level much of the time from the middle of 1998 to 

the middle of 2001.  Relative to recent decades, the unemployment rate is now quite low.  

In fact, some have voiced concerns that the economy has proven unable to sustain its 

expansion when the unemployment rate has fallen below these levels.  With that in mind, 

it is worth asking whether we should be worried that history will inevitably repeat itself.   

The truth is, we cannot know for sure.  Although rising inflation often heralded 

the death knell of economic expansions in earlier decades, inflation expectations have 

been well anchored and rising inflation has presented less of a risk in the most recent 

business cycles.2  From 1998 to 2001, for instance, core personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) inflation never exceeded 2 percent on a four-quarter basis.  Core PCE 

                                                 
2 In the period from 1950 to 2000, inflation often rose late in the business cycle.  In response, the Federal 
Reserve raised interest rates, which in turn led to a weaker economy.
