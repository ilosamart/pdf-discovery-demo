way from those offered by our current models.  So I do not intend anything that follows 

as a comment on the current stance of our policy.  

Before getting too deep into the details, let me preview my bottom line.  I am 

going to try to make the case that, all else being equal, monetary policy should be less 

accommodative--by which I mean that it should be willing to tolerate a larger forecast 

shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its full-employment level--when 

estimates of risk premiums in the bond market are abnormally low.  These risk premiums 

include the term premium on Treasury securities, as well as the expected returns to 

investors from bearing the credit risk on, for example, corporate bonds and asset-backed 

securities.  As an illustration, consider the period in the spring of 2013 when the 10-year 

Treasury yield was in the neighborhood of 1.60 percent and estimates of the term 

premium were around negative 80 basis points.3  Applied to this period, my approach 

would suggest a lesser willingness to use large-scale asset purchases to push yields down 

even further, as compared with a scenario in which term premiums were not so low.4   

The informal intuition I have in mind is that there is a cost associated with 

pushing risk premiums too low, because doing so increases the likelihood that they may 

revert back in a way that hinders the Federal Reserveâ€™s ability to achieve its mandated 

objectives.  In what follows, I will try to make this intuition more precise and to 

generalize its applicability.  

                                                 
3 The 10-year nominal rate hit 1.63 percent on May 2, 2013.  An estimate of the term premium based on the 
oft-cited methodology of Kim and Wright (2005) was negative 0.78 percent on this day. 
4 Again, I stress that this statement is directional, not quantitative--I am not claiming that the magnitude of 
the adjustment one would want to make is large, or that the policy we had in place at the time was 
miscalibrated in any absolute sense.  Rather, my point is just that the financial stability costs of asset 
purchases are likely to loom larger when term premiums are more negative, and that this consideration 
belongs in the discussion.
