One piece of unfinished business on the international capital regulatory agenda arises 

from the agreement by the GHOS in September that systemically important financial institutions 

should have loss absorbing capacity beyond the Basel III requirements.  This international 

position parallels the Dodd-Frank requirement that the Federal Reserve apply capital 

requirements to large, interconnected financial institutions that are more stringent than those 

applied to other banks.  We think it serves U.S. interests to develop our plans for implementing 

our domestic statutory obligation in tandem with our participation in this international process, 

so as to maximize the chances of convergence of international standards and our own practice.  

Work on this issue in the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board will continue well 

into next year.   

Dividend Policy 

Before closing, I want to address requests for renewed or increased dividends by our 

large bank holding companies, an issue in which there has been substantial recent interest.  

During the crisis, dividends were eventually suspended or reduced to minimal levels by all the 

banking organizations covered by the SCAP.  As the financial system has stabilized, some firms 

have indicated an interest in resuming or increasing dividends, or repurchasing shares.  We have 

been concerned with the safety and soundness implications of resuming or increasing capital 

distributions in the absence of a strong, forward-looking demonstration that the capital position 

of a firm would be protected even under stressed conditions.  Until Basel III was completed and 

Dodd-Frank enacted, it was obviously difficult for any firm to make that kind of demonstration, 

since its future capital needs and potential business model changes were obviously unknown.   

While there continues to be a relatively high degree of uncertainty about near- to 

medium-term economic prospects, the basic questions surrounding capital and regulatory reform
