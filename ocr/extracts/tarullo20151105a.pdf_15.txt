At present, both those groups have useful processes for overseeing the implementation of 

agreed upon international standards.  But they tend to be a bit formalistic, concentrating on 

comparing the language of domestic implementation to that of the international standards, rather 

than examining whether domestic practice in fact ensures substantive compliance or gaining a 

shared understanding of the unique risks in each market.   

It would, I believe, be counterproductive to establish in either the Basel Committee or the 

FSB the kind of adversarial dispute settlement process associated, for example, with the World 

Trade Organization.  It is in the interest of all members of those bodies to cooperate in the shared 

task of overseeing internationally active banks.  Thus, the better approach to compliance would 

be one that simultaneously provides regulators with a way to work with one another and to gain 

deeper insight into how their counterparts in other jurisdictions are applying prudential 

standards.   

For example, there has been considerable documentation of the interjurisdictional 

divergence in risk weights for similar exposures under the internal models-based capital 

approaches of Basel II.8  While the Basel Committee has been working on this issue,9 I suspect 

that one of the most effective ways of promoting broadly comparable risk weighting would be to 

have technically competent supervisory staff from other jurisdictions participate with home 

regulators in the actual bank model validations, oversight, and related supervisory functions.  

Similarly, as stress testing becomes a more important global financial stability tool, it will be 

useful to have staff experienced in stress testing at home participating in the stress testing
