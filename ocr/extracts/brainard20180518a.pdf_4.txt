offer my preliminary thoughts on the opportunity before us to make the regulations even more 

effective in this regard.    

The CRA was enacted in 1977 to combat the legacy of redlining--literally, the 

demarcation in red ink of neighborhoods deemed too risky for lending.  Federal lending agencies 

used these redlined maps in deciding where to guarantee mortgage loans.6  Not surprisingly, the 

resulting deprivation of credit stifled opportunity for the people living in these areas.   

Through the CRA, Congress requires the federal banking agencies to encourage banks 

and thrifts to help meet the credit needs of the communities they are chartered to serve, including 

low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safety and soundness. It requires the 

Federal Reserve and other agencies to evaluate how well banking institutions help meet those 

needs and to assign ratings to their performance.7  The CRA further requires the agencies to 

make public both the ratings and their written evaluations of the banks’ performance.  This 

transparency provides an incentive for banks to work with their communities to meet the needs 

of low- and moderate-income members and provides important information to enable community 

members to engage meaningfully with banks.   

Research has demonstrated that the CRA has had a positive effect on low- and moderate- 

income neighborhoods.8  The CRA is unique in that it puts decisionmaking about the

maps created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s were used to designate areas considered 
hazardous for mortgage lending and influenced whether mortgage loans qualified for government guarantees from 
the Federal Housing Administration. To view interactive historical maps, see

compliance. 
8 CRA-related mortgage loans had delinquency rates lower than the average across all 2006-vintage mortgages and 
sharply lower than those of subprime loans; see Neil Bhutta, and Glenn B. Canner, “Mortgage Market Conditions 
and Borrower Outcomes: Evidence from the 2012 HMDA Data and Matched HMDA-Credit Record Data,” Federal 
Reserve Bulletin 99 (November 2013).  In addition, a study of mortgage loans originated between 2003 and 2006 as 
part of a CRA targeted, low- to moderate-income homebuyer program found that they performed nearly as well as
