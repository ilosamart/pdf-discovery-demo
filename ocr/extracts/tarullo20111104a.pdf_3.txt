respects:  Required capital levels were much too low, particularly trading book capital 

requirements.  In evaluating the condition of financial firms at the height of the crisis, markets 

focused on common equity ratios and virtually ignored the Tier 1 ratio enshrined by Basel I and 

Basel II.  Moreover, markets and supervisors both used a much more forward-looking capital 

calculation than under prevailing regulatory requirements--subtracting losses that they estimated 

would be sustained in an adverse scenario to determine whether firms would have enough capital 

to remain viable financial intermediaries.  Finally, the significant interconnectedness among 

globally active firms, and the high degree of correlation in their assets, underscored the 

vulnerability of the entire international financial system to the potential failure of these firms. 

In response to these revealed regulatory shortcomings, the Basel Committee has 

announced four sets of changes to minimum prudential standards for internationally active 

banks:  First, in 2009 it revised and strengthened the market risk requirements of Basel II, in 

what has become known as Basel 2.5.  Second, last year it issued Basel III, which improved the 

quality and increased the quantity of minimum capital requirements, created a capital 

conservation buffer, and introduced an international leverage ratio requirement.  Third, and 

coincident with Basel III, the committee issued a framework for quantitative liquidity 

requirements.  Fourth, it has just today released the rules text of its assessment methodology for 

determining an additional capital requirement for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)--

popularly referred to as a “capital surcharge.”    

In the Basel Committee itself, work on Basel 2.5 and Basel III has been essentially 

complete for some time.  As reported recently by the committee,1 implementation of Basel 2.5
