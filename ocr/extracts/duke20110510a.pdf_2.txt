Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be in St. Louis to open the third biennial 

Exploring Innovation Conference.  The first Exploring Innovation conference was 

opened four years ago by Professor Andrew Hargadon, the Charles J. Soderquist Chair in 

Entrepreneurship at the University of California, Davis and a senior fellow at the 

Kauffman Foundation.  His remarks established a framework of collaboration for 

innovation in community development finance.  Since then, this conference has served as 

a forum for sharing ideas and maintaining the networks that are so critical to this work. 

Professor Hargadon initially set the stage by explaining that innovation and 

creativity are not the same.  An individual acting alone to solve a problem can be 

creative, while innovation is the process of adding value by applying a new idea or 

method to something that is already established.  For example, Henry Ford did not 

contribute the creative energy to invent an automobile.  Rather, Ford’s innovation was the

industry’s assembly line process, resulting in a means to mass produce cars.  On the same 

note, Apple did not invent the MP3 player with the introduction of the iPod.  Rather, the 

company used existing technology and a collaboration with the music industry to develop 

iTunes software, bringing an affordable application of the MP3 to the public.  In each of 

these examples, improving upon a good idea was as important, if not more important, 

than the initial idea.  The message for community development professionals was the 

importance of collaboration, sharing ideas, and building upon the ideas of others in order 

to innovate for the benefit of our communities. 

The significance of Professor Hargadon’s message should not be lost in today’s 

challenging economic climate.  Times are particularly difficult for residents of our low-
