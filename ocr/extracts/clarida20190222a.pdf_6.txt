As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy 

framework known in the research literature as “flexible inflation targeting.”10  However, 

the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most 

flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that 

when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the 

other.  We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has 

served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary 

policies that entailed some risk of inflation. 

The review of our current framework will be wide ranging, and we will not 

prejudge where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad 

questions. 

Three Questions 

The first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives 

with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to 

reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”  

Under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting 

central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that 

many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as 

“bygones.”  This means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls 

with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation 

trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target).  Central banks are generally 

believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the
