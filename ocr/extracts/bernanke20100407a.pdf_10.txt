we will never again face the unpalatable choice between bailouts and a disorderly 

bankruptcy that threatens to bring down our financial system, we must bring an end to the 

belief that some financial institutions are too big to fail.  To do that, we urgently need a 

new resolution regime for large, complex, and interconnected financial firms, similar to 

that already established for banks.  To end too-big-to-fail, the new regime should permit 

regulators to close a failing firm and impose losses on shareholders and creditors; indeed, 

I would argue that no financial instrument counted as regulatory capital should be 

allowed to receive any protection from losses.  At the same time, regulators must have 

the tools necessary to minimize the associated disruption to the financial system and the 

broader economy.3   

The Federal Reserve strongly supports ongoing congressional efforts to reform 

our financial regulatory framework, but we are not waiting for new legislation to make 

improvements.  We have been working hard to strengthen our own oversight of financial 

institutions and to broaden our field of vision to include potential risks to the financial 

system as a whole as well as risks to individual firms.  For example, we have played a 

key part in ongoing international efforts to ensure that systemically critical financial 

institutions hold more and higher-quality capital and have sufficient liquid assets on hand 

to be able to survive a market crisis.  And we are leading the international and domestic 

initiative to push banking organizations of all sizes to ensure their compensation practices 

link pay to performance and do not encourage excessive risk-taking. 

To make our supervision more effective and better able to identify risks to the 

financial system as a whole, we are also making fundamental changes to our daily 

                                           
3 Because most large financial firms are multinational, the development of an effective regime will require 
consultation and collaboration with authorities abroad.
