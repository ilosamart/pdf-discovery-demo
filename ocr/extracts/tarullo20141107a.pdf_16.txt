measures, particularly since the financial crisis.  Tiered regulation and supervision is a reality.  

My hope is that by acknowledging and, indeed, applauding that reality, legislators and prudential 

regulators can shape an oversight regime that most effectively realizes the complementary goals 

of banking soundness, financial stability, and economic growth.  Post-crisis attention has 

understandably been focused on too-big-to-fail issues and other sources of systemic risk.  But 

now is a good time to look at the other end of the banking industry, where the contrast is 

substantial.  Smaller banks present a very different set of business models.  Their risks and 

vulnerabilities tend to grow from different sources.  An explicit and sustained tailoring of 

regulation and supervision for community banks not only seems reasonable, it seems an 

important and logical next step in financial regulatory reform.
