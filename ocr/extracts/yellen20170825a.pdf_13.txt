market participants assign a low probability to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm.  

Market-based assessments of the loss-absorbing capacity of large U.S. banks have moved 

up in recent years, and market-based measures of equity now lie in the range of book 

estimates of equity.  To be sure, market-based measures may not reflect true risks--they 

certainly did not in the mid-2000s--and hence the observed improvements should not be 

overemphasized.16  But supervisory metrics are not perfect, either, and policymakers and 

investors should continue to monitor a range of supervisory and market-based indicators 

of financial system resilience.   

Economic research provides further support for the notion that reforms have made 

the system safer.  Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of bank capital mitigate 

the risk and adverse effects of financial crises.17  Moreover, researchers have highlighted 

how liquidity regulation supports financial stability by complementing capital 

                                                 
16 For example, Natasha Sarin and Lawrence Summers have reviewed market-based measures of bank 

equity and related measures of bank risks and concluded that such measures have not improved since the 

mid-2000s.  This assessment may understate the improvement in fundamental risk within the banking 

sector, as it takes the elevated valuations and low assessment of default risk implied by market prices 

during the earlier period as indicative of fundamentals.  Despite these shortcomings, their analysis is a 

useful reminder of the importance of considering both regulatory metrics and assessments implied by 

market prices.  See Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers (2016), “Understanding Bank Risk through 

Market Measures,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 57-109,

17 For example, see the review of evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An 

Empirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US,” Finance and 

Economics Discussion Series 2017-034 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 

April), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf.  Some research is less 

supportive of the role of bank capital in limiting the risk of financial crises but suggests that higher levels of 

bank capital limit the economic costs of a financial crisis (for example, Òscar Jordà, Björn Richter, Moritz 

Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor (2017), “Bank Capital Redux:  Solvency, Liquidity, and Crisis,” NBER 

Working Paper Series 23287 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, March)).  Some 

of the differences in findings across studies may be due to the degree to which the studies incorporate data 

from different countries and over different periods, as researchers disagree over the extent to which 

comparisons across countries or periods appropriately account for other factors that differ across such 

dimensions.
