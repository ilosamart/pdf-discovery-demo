half, and, in another encouraging sign, the pace of hiring has also stepped up in the past 

year or so, though it too continues to run somewhat below the levels that prevailed 

through the middle part of the last decade.   

Finally, the pace of wage increases also may help shed some light on the degree 

of labor market slack, since wage movements historically have tended to respond to the 

degree of tightness in the labor market.  Here too, however, the signal is not entirely 

clear, as other factors such as longer-run trends in productivity growth also generally 

influence the growth of compensation.  Key measures of hourly labor compensation rose 

at an annual rate of only around 2 percent through most of the recovery.  More recently, 

however, some tentative hints of a pickup in the pace of wage gains may indicate that the 

objective of full employment is coming closer into view.   

Recent Inflation Developments 

While the labor market has moved closer to the FOMC’s mandated goal of 

maximum employment, less progress has been made in moving inflation close to the 

FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, which the Committee considers to be 

consistent with our mandated goal of price stability.  Overall consumer price inflation has 

been close to zero over the past year, in large part because the big drop in crude oil prices 

since last summer has pushed down prices for gasoline and other consumer energy 

products.  Price inflation excluding the volatile categories of energy and food prices, or 

so-called core inflation, is often a better indicator of future overall inflation.  But it too is 

running below our 2 percent objective and has been over most of the recovery.  The 

recent low level of core inflation--1.2 percent over the past 12 months--partly reflects the 

appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar during the second half of
