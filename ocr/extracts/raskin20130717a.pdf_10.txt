earlier, an aspect of credit-driven asset bubbles is financial institutions’ increased reliance 

on unstable short-term wholesale funding, a reliance that makes them vulnerable to 

heightened rollover risk, sudden losses of confidence, and funding runs. Liquidity 

regulation increases the stock of cash or easily marketable securities available to 

institutions in the event of a funding run or margin call.  

Liquidity regulation also discourages use of unstable short-term wholesale 

funding of illiquid longer-term assets in the first place. Truly liquid assets, such as cash 

or Treasury securities, are low-yielding, and being required to hold them means lower 

earnings. Therefore, minimum liquidity requirements raise the cost, and so reduce the 

amount of, liquidity risk taking, reducing the chances of a liquidity crisis and asset fire 

sales. In that sense, minimum liquidity requirements also lean against building 

vulnerabilities that could accompany the growth of an asset bubble. 

Indeed, regulators might vary liquidity requirements in a countercyclical way, 

with greater liquidity required during the development of credit-fueled asset bubbles, in 

order to regulate the amount of allowable maturity transformation.  


Margins and Haircuts  

A third class of policies that could be helpful in addressing credit-fueled asset bubbles is 

margins and haircuts on securities financing transactions.  

Such transactions could include, for example, bilateral repurchase transactions in 

which a broker–dealer, in order to fund its holdings of some security, borrows short-term 

from a money market mutual fund, while pledging a security of greater value as 

collateral. The excess of the value of the security over the amount borrowed at the time of
