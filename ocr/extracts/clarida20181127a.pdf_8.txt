FOMC participants have, over the past nearly seven years, revised their estimates of both 

u* and r* substantially lower as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well 

below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation or inflation expectations 

those earlier estimates would have predicted.  And these revisions to u* and r* almost 

certainly did have an important influence on the path for the policy rate that was actually 

realized in recent years.7  I would expect to revise my estimates of r* and u* as 

appropriate if incoming data on future inflation and unemployment diverge materially 

and persistently from my baseline projections today. 

Consequences for Monetary Policy 

What does this mean for the conduct of monetary policy?  As the economy has 

moved to a neighborhood consistent with the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, risks have 

become more symmetric and less skewed to the downside than when the current rate 

cycle began three years ago.  Raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the 

economic expansion, while moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and 

inflation expectations down the road that could be costly to reverse, as well as potentially 

pose financial stability risks. 

Although the real federal funds rate today is just below the range of longer-run 

estimates presented in the September SEP,  it is much closer to the vicinity of r* than it 

was when the FOMC started to remove accommodation in December 2015.  How close is 

a matter of judgment, and there is a range of views on the FOMC.  As I have already

inference of some private-sector forecasters as well as some other FOMC participants.  For example, see
