  I don’t mean to suggest that there aren’t some workers who have been stranded by 

structural changes in the economy.  More can and should be done to help dislocated 

workers acquire new skills to transition from industries and occupations with fewer 

opportunities.  But making this transition will be much easier in a healthy economy, 

which is one reason why I am encouraged by the evidence that elevated unemployment is 

indeed largely cyclical.  I will now describe what the Federal Reserve is doing to try to 

raise demand and create jobs.  

 I have described the two unconventional policy tools that the FOMC has 

employed since it reduced the target federal funds rate in 2008 to its effective lower 

bound.  The first is large-scale asset purchases, intended to lower long-term interest rates 

to encourage borrowing for spending and investment.  Between 2008 and mid-2011, the 

FOMC purchased agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), agency debt, 

and Treasury securities totaling $2.3 trillion.  In 2011, the FOMC began the maturity 

extension program, under which it reduced its holdings of short-term Treasury securities 

and used the proceeds to purchase an equivalent amount of longer-term Treasury 

securities.   

However, as the scheduled endpoint of that program approached, it became clear 

that the economy remained weak, and the FOMC took a series of steps to provide further 

impetus to the recovery.  In June 2012, the Committee extended its maturity extension 

program until the end of the year.  Then in September, it made a major new commitment 

to asset purchases.  Unlike its past purchase programs, which were fixed in size, this time 

the FOMC stated its determination to continue the program, provided that inflation 

remains well contained, until it judges that there has been a substantial improvement in
