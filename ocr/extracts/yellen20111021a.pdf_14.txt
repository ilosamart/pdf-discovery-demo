Four times a year the FOMC publishes the Summary of Economic Projections 

(SEP), which conveys information about Committee participants’ economic outlook for 

the next several calendar years and over the longer run.  The SEP includes projections of 

real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, the PCE inflation rate, and the “core” inflation 

rate for PCE excluding food and energy.  Since last spring, the Chairman has been 

conducting a news conference in conjunction with each release of the projections to help 

explain the FOMC’s policy decisions in the context of our economic outlook. 

The longer-run projections in the SEP convey Committee participants’ individual 

assessments of the rates of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation to which the 

economy would be expected to converge under appropriate policy and in the absence of 

further shocks.  The longer-run inflation projections indicate that most Committee 

participants judge inflation of 2 percent or a bit less to be most consistent with our 

statutory mandate.  In the latest projections, participants’ estimates for the longer-run 

normal rate of unemployment had a range of 5 to 6 percent--well below the current 

unemployment rate of 9.1 percent and hence underscoring the degree to which the 

economy remains quite far from its balanced-growth path. 

Of course, there is always room for further improvement, and therefore the 

Committee continues to explore ways of enhancing the clarity of our communications.  

For example, as noted in the minutes of our September meeting, we have been discussing 

potential approaches for providing more information--perhaps through the SEP--
