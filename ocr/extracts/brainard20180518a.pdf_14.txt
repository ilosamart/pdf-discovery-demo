The Path Forward 

In our effort to refresh the CRA regulations, we will continue to honor the purpose of the 

CRA by encouraging banks to engage in local community and economic development initiatives.   

I am confident that there are ways to update the areas where we evaluate a bank’s CRA 

performance without losing the core focus on place.  We should do more to encourage banks to 

offer deposit and credit products designed to help rent-burdened customers save for 

homeownership and build strong credit scores that will enable them to succeed in obtaining 

mortgage credit on favorable terms. We should do more to encourage banks to lend to the 

underserved entrepreneurs and small businesses that hold the promise of providing jobs and 

growing local economies.  Even as the economy looks strong overall, significant challenges 

remain for low- and moderate-income areas, making the CRA and its focus on local credit needs 

more important than ever.  I look forward to hearing from you over the next several months to 

help inform our interagency effort to refresh the CRA regulations.   

This conference is an opportunity for ANHD members to envision the future for New 

York’s neighborhoods and discuss critical actions to achieve that vision.  I know you have a full 

agenda today, replete with pressing conversations on the compelling challenges that face your 

neighborhoods.  I want to applaud your work to ensure that all of New York’s neighborhoods are 

communities of opportunity.  Thank you.
