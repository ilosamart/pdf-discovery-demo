Good morning.  Thank you for inviting me to be with you today.  The Committee 

for Economic Development has a long and distinguished record in identifying and 

addressing crucial issues related to our nation’s economic growth and productivity.  And 

today’s conference on fiscal sustainability and the global economy fits squarely within 

that tradition.  My remarks will focus on the challenges faced by U.S. policymakers as 

they confront the need to put fiscal policy on a sustainable track in the long term while 

providing support to the economy in the near term.  I will also offer some thoughts on the 

recent actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve and on the implications of our nation’s 

fiscal and monetary policy choices for the global economy.1

The Challenge of Achieving Fiscal Sustainability in the United States 


Charting a sensible course for the federal budget is an essential but formidable 

task for U.S. policymakers.  Since the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, 

the federal budget deficit has soared as the weak economy has depressed revenues and 

pushed up expenditures and as necessary policy actions have been taken to help ease the 

recession and shore up the financial system.  At 9 percent of gross domestic product 

(GDP), the budget deficit in fiscal year 2010 was a little lower than it had been a year 

earlier, but it was still considerably above the average of 2 percent of GDP during the 

pre-crisis period from fiscal 2005 to 2007.  As a result of the recent deficits, federal debt 

held by the public has increased to around 60 percent of GDP--a level not seen in 60 

years.
