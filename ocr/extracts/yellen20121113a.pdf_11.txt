approach” as it “seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and 

deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level.”12  

The specification of 2 percent as the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal, as 

measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE), reflected careful deliberation.  The Committee judged that the PCE price index is 

the most reliable measure of prices that are relevant for households and, in choosing the 

2 percent goal, balanced two main considerations.  First, any rate of price inflation, 

whether positive or negative, imposes some costs on society, making planning more 

difficult and creating distortions in the economy.  Second, were the FOMC to aim for 

zero inflation to eliminate these costs, it would face greater difficulty in providing 

sufficient monetary accommodation in response to large negative shocks.  With inflation 

at zero, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates implies that real short-term 

interest rates cannot be reduced below zero.  In contrast, with low but positive inflation, 

they can be.13  History has shown that sustained periods of even mild deflation can 

impose immense costs in terms of slow growth and high unemployment.14  Thus, 

balancing the goal of maximum employment against the costs of modest inflation, the 

Committee chose 2 percent measured inflation as the value it judged likely to provide an 

adequate buffer against costly deflations while keeping the costs of inflation quite small.   

Given that the rate of inflation over the longer run is determined solely by 

monetary policy, central banks can, and indeed must, determine the long-run level of

13 Due to well-known upward biases in the PCE and other indexes of consumer prices as measures of the 
cost of living, zero inflation, properly measured, corresponds to a positive measured level of PCE inflation, 
most likely on the order of 1/2 percent.
