undue angst and, in an abundance of caution, subject you to a series of expensive, and ultimately 

unnecessary, follow-up measures.  

A false positive in banking supervision occurs when examiners inaccurately identify a 

sound bank as having significant problems.  When this happens, we may then take the step of 

accelerating onsite examinations even though the bank remains in satisfactory condition.  To be 

clear, we err on the side of accepting some false positives because, as we saw during the crisis, 

the costs of missing too many problems are so high.  Having said that, we recognize that false 

positives are not free:  They impose a real cost on examiners in the form of resource use and also 

on banks in terms of imposing the burden of an onsite review.   

In one way, effective supervision is striking a balance between false negatives and false 

positives, recognizing the costs of each.  As we look forward, I think policymakers will need to 

find a similar balance between the responsibilities of examiners and the responsibilities of banks 

to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and to maintain a safe and sound banking 

system.  Make no mistake, the crisis made clear that more effective regulations and more 

consequential examiner reviews of banks are needed.  But, at the same time, banks have a 

fundamental--arguably the fundamental--role to play in improving financial system resilience.      

So, how do the responsibilities of banks and examiners meet to maximize safety and 

soundness?  When I imagine the model of a healthy bank--no matter its size or complexity--I 

picture a series of concentric circles.  The inner circles are composed of the systems and 

functions that keep the bank healthy and allow it to meet the credit needs of its community while 

remaining financially sound and compliant with its legal and regulatory obligations.  Inner circle 

systems and functions help the bank identify, monitor, and remedy the various problems that 

arise in its ordinary course of business.  These would include, among other things, internal audit,
