I would like to thank the Group of Thirty for inviting me to participate in their 

International Banking Seminar and also thank Luis Alberto Moreno of the Inter-

American Development Bank for hosting this event.  My comments today will focus on 

U.S. economic prospects and monetary policy.   

Economic activity in the United States has been growing moderately so far this 

year, and the labor market has continued to strengthen.  The terrible hurricanes that hit 

Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and our neighbors in the Caribbean caused tremendous

activity will recover quickly.   

Starting with the labor market, through August, payroll job gains averaged
