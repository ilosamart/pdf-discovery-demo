the median projection of FOMC participants reported in the March SEP, the federal funds 

rate will soon approach midway to its expected long-run equilibrium value.   

I shared my framework for thinking about the change in balance sheet policy in 

early March, and today I will elaborate on the approach that seems most appropriate to 

achievement of our goals.7  Consideration that normalization of the federal funds rate is 

well underway was the criterion the Committee adopted in its December 2015 decision to 

continue to reinvest principal payments.  In my view, that “well under way” standard has 

served an important purpose.8  With asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary 

policy to respond to shocks, maintaining reinvestments provided an important benefit by 

enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would have been possible with a 

shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for reductions if conditions 

deteriorate.  This approach has ensured that our most proven tool, the federal funds rate, 

will have reached a level at which it can be cut if needed to buffer adverse shocks, thus 

helping to guard against the asymmetric risks associated with the effective lower bound.  

With the federal funds rate projected to be in the range that is midway to the Committee’s 

projection of the long-run value of the federal funds rate later this year, I would consider 

it reasonable to assess that this threshold will have been attained before too long. 

As we shrink the size of our balance sheet, the public’s holdings of Treasury 

securities will rise, and that will tend to boost longer-term interest rates.  In particular, 

most studies conclude that increases in central bank holdings of longer-maturity assets 

chiefly affect interest rates by reducing the quantity of longer-term securities held by the 

public and putting downward pressure on the term premium--that is, the difference
