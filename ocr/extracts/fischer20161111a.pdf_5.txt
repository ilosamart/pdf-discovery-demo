actions of major central banks, including especially those of the Federal Reserve, have 

been the focus of analysis and debate for decades and have attracted considerable 

attention since the global financial crisis.4   Foreign economies were affected when the 

Fed engaged in unconventional monetary policy stimulus and will likely experience some 

effects of the Fed’s ongoing normalization of policy.  

The Federal Reserve’s focus on supporting domestic objectives for inflation and 

employment has sometimes been criticized as having potentially undesirable effects on 

the global economy.  The unconventional policies that the Federal Reserve implemented 

following the global financial crisis, and particularly our large-scale asset purchases, have 

been characterized by some observers as supporting the U.S. economy by putting 

downward pressure on the dollar and thus hurting our trading partners.5  

My reading of the evidence is that, overall, Federal Reserve policies during that 

period probably boosted foreign economic output.  It is indeed likely that the depreciation 

of the dollar that accompanied U.S. asset purchases and forward guidance reduced 

foreign net exports and thus weighed on foreign GDP through the exchange rate channel.  

However, our accommodative policies also increased U.S. domestic demand, a second 

key channel of transmission that operated to boost the net exports of our foreign trading 

partners.  Empirical estimates suggest that these countervailing effects roughly canceled 

                                                 
4 Exchange rate issues leading up to the Great Depression were prominent, particularly vis-à-vis the French 
franc, which was returned to the gold standard at what was seen at the time as a highly favorable rate 
(Irwin, 2012).  The pioneering analysis of Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962) provides the standard 
framework for post-World War II analysis of the channels through which monetary policy actions are 
transmitted abroad.  In recent years, there has been a rapidly expanding empirical literature assessing 
spillovers from Federal Reserve policy actions, including those from unconventional policies such as large-
scale asset purchases--for example, Fratzscher, DeLuca, and Straub (2013); Rogers, Scotti, and Wright 
(2014); and Neely (2015).   
5 Bernanke (2015) discusses some of these critiques of Fed policy in the context of a more general analysis 
of how Fed policies have affected the global economy since the financial crisis.
