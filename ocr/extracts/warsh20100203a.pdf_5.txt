Second, the regulatory reform discussion of the past year seems overly preoccupied with 

questions of institutional design.  There are doubtless efficiencies to be gained in sharing best 

practices, integrating operations, and minimizing regulatory gaps among regulators.  But, it is far 

from obvious that real regulatory reform hinges on figuring the optimal number of regulators, or 

the precise composition of an oversight council.   

I happen to believe that the Federal Reserve should play a critical role in the supervision 

of financial firms, but that should not obfuscate the larger point.  If real reform were chiefly 

about the number of financial regulators in Washington--or even the precise relationships 

between financial regulation and the role of the central bank--we should find an institutional 

design among major financial centers around the world that lived up to its promise.  We find no 

such example.  Policymakers, in my view, should be more focused on what constitutes effective 

prudential supervision, rather than be diverted to the less consequential discussion as to who 

should perform it.   

Third, some of the reform measures advocated over the past year could risk re-creating 

the status quo ante.  But the status quo ante will no longer do.  There is no going home again.  If 

policymakers had gone into the crisis with the resolution authority to shut down non-banks and 

complex bank holding companies quickly, we might well have had better options to ensure an 

orderly disposition of failing firms.  Placing this arrow in our quiver now, however, is not 

enough to arm us for the challenges ahead.  Granting new powers to resolve failing firms in the 

discretionary hands of regulators is unlikely, in the near-term, to drive the market discipline 

required to avoid the recurrence of financial crises.   

To be clear:  New resolution authority is a welcome step forward, but its efficacy should 

not be overstated.  And this authority could be made more credible by replicating, as much as
