unemployment, the continued weakness in aggregate demand is likely the predominant 

factor.  Consequently, the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policies, by 

providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help, over time, to reduce 

long-term unemployment as well.  

Recent Labor Market Developments 

As background for my discussion, let me provide a brief review of recent job 

market indicators.  As this audience is well aware, job creation has picked up recently.  

Private payroll employment (figure 1) increased by nearly 250,000 jobs per month, on 

average, in the three months ending in February, and by about 190,000 jobs per month, 

on average, over the past 12 months.  At the same time, layoffs in the public sector 

appear to be moderating.  Together with a lengthening of the average workweek, these 

employment gains have contributed to a significant increase in aggregate hours worked 

(figure 2).   

The increase in hours worked is encouraging, because the decline in hours during 

the recent recession was extraordinary.  From the peak of this series in December 2007 to 

its trough in February 2010, aggregate hours on the job by production workers fell by a 

remarkable 9-1/2 percent; by comparison, production-worker hours declined by “only” 5-

3/4  percent during the severe 1981-82 recession.  Currently, hours worked are still about 

4 percent below the pre-recession peak--a clear improvement from where we were two 

years ago, but still far from where we would like to be. 

The government estimates payroll employment--the number of jobs--from a 

survey of businesses--the establishment survey.  A monthly survey of about 60,000 

households, which provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate,
