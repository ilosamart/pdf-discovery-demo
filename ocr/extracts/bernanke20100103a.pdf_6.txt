important to keep in mind.5  Notably, simple policy rules like the Taylor rule are only 

rules of thumb, and reasonable people can disagree about important details of the 

construction of such rules.  Moreover, simple rules necessarily leave out many factors 

that may be relevant to the making of effective policy in a given episode--such as the risk 

of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound, for example--which is why we do not 

make monetary policy on the basis of such rules alone.  For these reasons, even strong 

proponents of simple policy rules generally advise that they be used only as guidelines, 

not as substitutes for more complete policy analyses; and that, to ensure robustness, the 

recommendations of a number of alternative simple rules should be considered (Taylor, 

1999a).  That said, as much of the debate about monetary policy after the 2001 recession 

has made use of such rules, I will discuss them here as well. 

The well-known Taylor rule relates the prescribed setting of the overnight federal 

funds rate--the interest rate targeted by the FOMC in its making of monetary policy--to 

two factors:  (1) the deviation, in percentage points, of the current inflation rate from 

policymakers’ longer-term inflation objective; and (2) the so-called output gap, defined 

as the percentage difference between current output (usually defined as real GDP) and the 

“normal” or “potential” level of output.  In symbols, the standard form of the Taylor rule 

is given by the equation shown in Slide 2.  In this equation,  is the prescribed value of 

the policy interest rate in a given period t;  is the deviation of the actual inflation 

rate π from its target  in period t; and , the “output gap,” is the deviation of 

actual real output y from potential output  in period t.  The parameters a and b are

today.
