accommodation from short-term interest rate policy could be provided by lengthening the 

period over which the policy rate was expected to remain at its lower bound.  The 

knowledge that the short-term policy rate likely would be lower for longer would put 

downward pressure on longer-term rates.  The FOMC has provided forward guidance on 

the policy rate in its postmeeting statements ever since the target federal funds rate was 

brought to the lower bound in December 2008.  In addition, the SEP shows individual 

FOMC participants’ expectations regarding the policy rate, though it does not identify the 

individuals in the interest rate dot plot.  In the United Kingdom, the MPC started 

providing forward guidance in its postmeeting statements in 2013.23

As the policy rate--Bank Rate--is still at its lower bound in the United Kingdom, 

it remains to be seen whether MPC forward guidance will continue during policy firming.  

For its part, the FOMC has provided forward guidance in its policy statements during the 

tightening phase that began with the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate 

in December 2015. I expect that the Bank of England will also likely continue to use 

forward guidance when it begins to raise the policy interest rate above its effective lower 

bound.

Asset purchases are less of a new tool than forward guidance.  In the early post-

World War II decades, both U.K. and U.S. authorities sporadically attempted to influence 

long-term interest rates directly by transacting in longer-term Treasury securities.  By 

1997, however, monetary policy operations in longer-term securities markets had fallen 

into disuse.24 The financial crisis changed matters, with both countries’ central banks

been absent since the Operation Twist experiment of the early 1960s (see, for example, Meltzer (2009, pp. 
316-23)).  In the United Kingdom, operations in longer-term securities markets had continued to figure
