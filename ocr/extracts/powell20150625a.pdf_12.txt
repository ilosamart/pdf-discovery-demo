the Federal Reserve’s triennial payments study, which presents statistics on fraud for the 

largest retail payment systems that could be used by companies and the media when 

explaining risks to consumers.9 

 Knowledge is power.  Education is critical to fostering the security of the payment 

system and, ultimately, to maintaining public confidence. 

Conclusion 

 The things I’ve discussed today apply to all payment system participants. Each of 

us has an important role to play in building a safer payment system.  Given the payment 

system’s complexity, it’s important to keep in mind that we all need to work together 

when we innovate, prevent, plan, and educate. 

I want to close by asking for your support.  With our payment system 

improvement effort in full swing, now is the perfect time for payment system participants 

to come together to build a safer and more efficient payment system.  If you’ve joined 

one of our task forces, I hope that you will maintain a high level of engagement.  If you 

haven’t, I encourage you to do so, or at least to follow their progress.  We will continue 

to seek input and provide updates through live and virtual forums, surveys, industry- and 

Federal Reserve-sponsored groups and events, and online feedback mechanisms.  Thank 

you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for organizing this conference and to all 

of you for participating.
