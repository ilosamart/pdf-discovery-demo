individual assessment of the path of the federal funds rate over the next three years that is 

most likely to promote maximum employment and stable prices.18 

The dot plot presents a number of challenges.  The individual dots are not tied to 

the individual macroeconomic forecasts presented in the SEP, and no information is 

provided on the identity of the forecaster--for example, voting members of the 

Committee are not distinguished from non-voting participants.  There is no easy path to 

the identification of a Committee reaction function.  The dots speak as of their date of 

publication after the FOMC meetings held in March, June, September, and December.  

Three months pass between SEPs.  The economic outlook can change quite significantly, 

making the reigning dots look out of touch.  On occasion, the dot plot and the 

postmeeting statement have seemed to send conflicting signals.  The dot plot reflects 

individual views of appropriate policy, while the postmeeting statement reflects the 

consensus of the Committee. 

The authors weigh these challenges and ponder whether to eliminate the dot plot; 

some appear to favor that idea.19  I doubt that most market participants would welcome 

the elimination of this chart.  The SEP provides a number of benefits.  It requires FOMC 

participants to write down their forecasts for inflation, unemployment, and growth, as 

                                                   
18 In the SEP collected prior to the March and June FOMC meetings, participants submit projections for the 
current calendar year and two subsequent years; in the September SEP, the forecast horizon is extended out 
an additional calendar year.  Thus, the forecast window does not remain constant for the different SEPs in a 
given year; Wrightson commentary has suggested that a rolling forecast horizon might be an improvement 
over the current calendar-year focus (Wrightson ICAP (2016), “January 26-27 FOMC Minutes Recap,” 
February 18).

usefulness and they risk sending a signal that (Fed officials) have a ‘plan’ rather than that they are data 
dependent” (see Ann Saphir (2016), “Fed’s ‘Dot Plot’ Looks Increasingly out of Touch on Rates,” Markets, 
Reuters, February 14, paragraph 8, http://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-path-analysis-
idINKCN0VN0PU); and in a 2012 speech, former Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney stated, 
“Overall research has not generally found that publishing a path leads to better outcomes.”  (Mark Carney 
(2012), “Guidance,” a speech delivered to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Canada, December 11,
