reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  

Thus, our policy will be data dependent, and the FOMC at upcoming meetings will weigh 

possible adjustments to the level of the target federal funds rate, based on its assessment 

of incoming data and the economic outlook.   

Regarding inflation, an important factor working to increase confidence in the 

inflation outlook will be continued improvement in the labor market.  Theoretical and 

empirical evidence suggests that inflation will eventually begin to rise as resource 

utilization tightens.  And while the link between wages and inflation can be tenuous, it is 

encouraging that we are seeing tentative indications of an acceleration in labor 

compensation.   

Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, the Committeeâ€™s assessment is 

that economic conditions will likely warrant raising the federal funds rate only gradually.  

Thus, we expect that the target federal funds rate will remain for some time below levels 

viewed as normal in the longer run.  But that is only a forecast, and monetary policy will, 

in practice, be determined by the data--primarily data on inflation and unemployment. 

What about financial stability?  We are aware of the possibility that low interest 

rates maintained for a prolonged period could prompt an excessive buildup in leverage or 

cause underwriting standards to erode as investors take on risks they cannot measure or 

manage appropriately in a reach for yield.  At this point, the evidence does not indicate 

that such vulnerabilities pose a significant threat, but we are carefully monitoring 

developments in this area.
