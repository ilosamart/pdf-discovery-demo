from participating in the HARP program.  Risk-based pricing is a standard 

risk-management tool for lenders in evaluating new risk.  However, when the 

lender or guarantor already owns the credit risk, refinancing a low- or no-

equity loan can actually reduce risk because it reduces payments and thus 

makes default less likely.     

2. Limited lender competition for HARP refinance loans due to lender 

concerns about taking on “putback” risk from previous underwriting.  

Putback risk is the possibility that the loan originator will have to repurchase 

the loan from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) because the 

underwriting violated GSE guidelines.  Although the streamlined HARP 

guidelines do not require lenders to verify all aspects of a borrower’s 

application, lenders who process the HARP refinancings have putback risk 

both from the refinance and from the original underwriting, even if the 

refinancing lender did not underwrite the original loan.  This risk may make 

lenders reluctant to refinance loans originated by other lenders and so limits 

participation in the program.  Perhaps competition among potential lenders 

could be increased if a minimum number of timely payments could be used as 

a proxy for sound original underwriting to relieve the liability of the 

refinancing lender for the mistakes of previous lenders. 

3. Junior lienholders.  In some cases, holders of junior liens are refusing to 

allow their loans to remain subordinate to a proposed new refinance loan, thus 

holding up the HARP process.
