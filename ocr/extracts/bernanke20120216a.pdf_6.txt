Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC).
2
  The council’s membership is drawn from 

smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations.  Each of the 12 Reserve Banks 

around the country has a local advisory council, and one representative from each local 

council serves on the national council that meets with the Board in Washington twice a 

year.  These meetings allow the Federal Reserve Board to hear directly from community 

bankers about supervisory and regulatory issues that affect their institutions as well as 

about local economic trends.   

At a recent meeting, for example, one of our CDIAC members asked us to be 

clearer about whether particular rules and guidance apply to community banks.  Having 

heard from this banker as well as others, we are now working to more explicitly indicate 

which banks will be affected when we issue new regulatory proposals, final rules, or 

regulatory guidance.  As a first step in this effort, when issuing supervisory letters, we 

have begun to state specifically if and how new guidance will apply to community 

banks.

  Although this change seems relatively simple, we hope it will help banks avoid 

allocating precious resources to poring over supervisory guidance that does not apply to 

them.  We also hope that it will provide greater clarification to our examiners, who are on 

the frontline fielding questions from bankers and working closely with their state 

regulatory counterparts. 

In addition to the advisory council, the Board last year established a special 

supervision subcommittee to more effectively address community banking issues.
