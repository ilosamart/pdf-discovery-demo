asset holdings were forced to sell, driving down asset prices further and setting off a 

cycle of deleveraging and further asset liquidation.  

To monitor intermediation by broker-dealers, the Federal Reserve in 2010 created 

a quarterly Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which asks 

dealers about the credit they provide.

  Modeled on the long-established Senior Loan 

Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices sent to commercial banks, the survey 

of senior credit officers at dealers tracks conditions in markets such as those for securities 

financing, prime brokerage, and derivatives trading.

  The credit officer survey is 

designed to monitor potential vulnerabilities stemming from the greater use of leverage 

by investors (particularly through lending backed by less-liquid collateral) or increased 

volumes of maturity transformation.  Before the financial crisis, we had only very limited 

information regarding such trends.   

We have other potential sources of information about shadow banking.  The 

Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research and Federal Reserve staff are 

collaborating to construct data sets on triparty and bilateral repo transactions, which 

should facilitate the development of better monitoring metrics for repo activity and 

improve transparency in these markets.  We also talk regularly to market participants 

about developments, paying particular attention to the creation of new financial vehicles 

that foster greater maturity transformation outside the regulated sector, provide funding 

for less-liquid assets, or transform risks from forms that are more easily measured to 

forms that are more opaque.
