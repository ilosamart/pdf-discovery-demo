I would like to thank the organizers of the conference for inviting me to this 

event.1  I have been invited in the past and had very much wanted to take part--especially 

in light of my having been born in Zambia and having received my schooling in Zambia, 

South Africa, and Zimbabwe--but somehow it never worked out.  I am therefore 

especially delighted finally to be here.  In my talk today, I will focus on both the 

challenges facing the Federal Reserve and those facing central banks of developing 

countries in our increasingly interconnected world.  But let me begin my remarks with a 

very brief digression on the history of central banking to put recent developments in

fulfills the functions of a central bank.  But this was not always the case in the past.  Even 

after the advanced economies began to set up central banks, it was not widely accepted 

that smaller nations needed one.  Although the first central bank, the Swedish Riksbank, 

dates back to 1668, it was only in 1920 that the case for setting up a central bank in 

almost all countries was recognized among official circles in a resolution of the League 

of Nations’ conference in Brussels that year, which stipulated, among other things, that 

“in countries where there is no central bank of issue, one should be established.”2   

At the time, the main concern of the participants in the conference was the 

preservation of the international monetary order, by which was meant the possibility for 

both the private and public sectors of all countries to engage in domestic and international
