County Hospital.  Dr. Williams worked with local organizations to develop a business 

plan and obtain the financing needed to open a business that is critical to the community.  

DeWitt, Arkansas, is another rural community where entrepreneurship is sparking 

a local revival.  DeWitt is a town of about 3,000 people.  Like Itta Bena and many small 

towns, it has seen a steady decline in population over the past few decades.  The economy 

there is a mix of manufacturing and agriculture, and many families have farmed the land 

for generations, such as the family of Tami and Troy Hornbeck. 

The Hornbecks grew up in DeWitt, starting and eventually selling a successful 

business built on a new soybean varietal that grows well in the South.  More recently, 

they have been helping lead a new industry in their community using waste vegetable oil 

from local restaurants and oil pressed from camelina, a crop farmers are beginning to 

grow locally.  This cooperative effort involves a partnership between a community 

college, a university, the local government, farmers and restaurants, and a Community 

Development Financial Institution, or CDFI, among others.11  While still in the early 

stages, it has led to the creation of several new businesses and imbued the town with a 

new sense of what is possible. 

Entrepreneurs such as the Hornbecks and Dr. Williams need support to succeed, 

the kind of support HBCUs and other institutions of higher education have long provided.  

MVSU itself is supporting rural minority entrepreneurs through its participation in the 

HBCU Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Initiative, which teaches students how to start and 

grow a business.
