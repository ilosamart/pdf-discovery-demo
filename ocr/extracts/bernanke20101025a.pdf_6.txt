Under the auspices of the MORE initiative, the Federal Reserve sponsored 

conferences such as this one, and the summit held last month on Real Estate Owned and 

Vacant Property Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization.  Participants at that meeting 

examined the community effects of foreclosed and vacant properties with the goals of 

helping practitioners better understand barriers to stabilizing neighborhoods, sharing 

practices that show promise, and discussing regional differences.  As part of that summit, 

the Federal Reserve released 17 papers analyzing trends, challenges, and possible 

solutions for addressing foreclosures and promoting neighborhood stabilization.  A few 

of the emerging solutions highlighted at the event were: a national “first-look” property 

program, which gives nonprofits and municipalities the right of first refusal on 

repossessed properties to facilitate neighborhood stabilization; new methods of municipal 

code enforcement; and innovative land-banking strategies.  We will be using these ideas 

and others to inform our community development efforts over the coming year.  

To ensure that we have access to more detailed data on mortgage and credit 

markets, the Federal Reserve System has created the Risk Assessment, Data Analysis, 

and Research, or RADAR, data warehouse.  This new platform will help inform our 

monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and community development.   

Over the next two days, I understand that you will be hearing about policy-

oriented research on the U.S. housing and mortgage markets--an area of first-order 

importance to policymakers.  You will have the opportunity to discuss the current 

situation and the outlook for mortgage foreclosures, consider their consequences for 

neighborhoods, and evaluate efforts to mitigate foreclosures.  Also, you will learn results
