A second approach, currently under consideration by regulators, would be to seek 

modifications to standard contractual cross-default, netting, and related practices.  This approach 

would use contractual measures to achieve the same end of having these arrangements 

effectively governed by resolution decisions in home countries.  Of course, even if agreement 

were reached among regulators, in consultation with relevant industry associations, and effective 

steps were taken to implement that agreement, it could take some time for the new terms to be 

widely adopted in relevant markets.  But a regulatory timeline could be set to speed up the 

process.  This approach may be the most promising for tackling this vexing problem. 

Resolution and Regulation 

  The resolution mechanism created by Title II of Dodd-Frank is gaining greater 

operational credibility as the FDIC builds out its single-point-of-entry approach.  With each rule, 

policy statement, cross-border agreement, and firm-specific resolution plan, that credibility is 

further increased.  Additional measures such as those I have suggested today will continue to 

enhance this third option of orderly resolution, and relieve government officials of the Hobson’s 

choice of bailout or disruptive bankruptcy for systemically important financial firms. 

 However, as is apparent from the amount of work and planning involved in this effort—

particularly, though not exclusively, on cross-border matters—the construction of a resolution 

framework remains an ongoing challenge.  Moreover, even when a large, complex firm can be 

resolved at no cost to taxpayers without provoking a systemic crisis, there will very likely still be 

significant negative externalities in the financial system.  That is, even if a firm is not too-big-to-

fail, it may still be of sufficient systemic importance to make its failure a costly event. 

Thus, even as policymakers strive to increase prospects for orderly resolution, we must 

continue efforts to reduce prospects for the failure of a systemically important firm that would
