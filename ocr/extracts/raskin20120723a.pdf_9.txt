I dissented in the vote for approval of the proposed implementation of the Volcker Rule.  

Let me say a bit about that dissent now.  One reason for my vote was my sense that the proposed 

regulation’s guard rails were insufficient.  I was concerned that, as proposed, the guard rails were 

too broad and would allow banks to be able to go too far off the road.  Further, I was concerned 

that the guard rails as crafted could be subject to significant abuse--abuse that would be very 

hard for even the best supervisors to catch.   

I feel it is very important that the guard rails be strong and be set very close to the road 

because of the potentially severe dangers of, and costs associated with, proprietary trading by 

institutions that have access to the federal safety net.  In fact, it is not inconceivable to think that 

the potential costs associated with permitting hedging and market-making within these 

exemptions still outweigh the benefits we as a society supposedly receive from permitting these 

capital market activities.  The potential compliance, supervisory, and other costs could be so 

great as to eliminate whatever value may arguably be derived by virtue of these capital market 

activities. 

What might such benefits be?  Improved market liquidity and reduced credit spreads are 

among the benefits of proprietary trading I’ve heard discussed.   

First and foremost, it is traditional banking of the sort engaged in by community banks 

that promotes true liquidity in regions and within sectors, through deposit-taking and lending.  

Sure, liquidity in opaque financial markets may have increased in recent years by virtue of 

proprietary trading, but how has this market liquidity benefited consumers, retail investors, small 

business owners, and homeowners?  Second, the Volcker Rule does not prohibit proprietary 

trading by all entities.  Rather, it focuses solely on government-backstopped banks and their 

affiliates.  Thus, even if federally insured banks are precluded from making markets, these
