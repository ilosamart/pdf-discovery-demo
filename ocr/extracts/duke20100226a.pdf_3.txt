nearly 2 percent.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, including loans to small businesses, 

fell particularly rapidly, declining by double-digit percentages during 2009.1  Commercial real 

estate (CRE) and credit card lending, categories that include loans to small businesses, also fell 

throughout the year. 

 Notably, the contraction in lending has been less severe at smaller banks, which tend to 

cater to small businesses.  For example, banks with less than $10 billion in total assets reduced 

their business loans (including C&I and CRE loans) at about a 12.8 percent annual rate in the 

fourth quarter of 2009, while at larger banks business loans dropped at a pace of more than 20 

percent.  Although the pattern of reduced lending differed across banks, in aggregate, banks of 

all sizes have reduced their business loan portfolios.  This development is especially problematic 

for small businesses, given that they typically lack access to public capital markets.   

 The terms of the small business loans that are being made also have tightened 

considerably since the beginning of the recession.  Responses to the Federal Reserve’s Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicate that banks, on net, 

have significantly tightened credit standards on C&I loans to small firms over the past few years.  

In addition, the pricing of C&I loans to small businesses became more stringent last year.  Data 

from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business Lending show that interest rate spreads 

on loans between $100,000 and $1,000,000 increased by about 100 basis points during 2009, 

reaching their highest levels in more than a decade.  However, pricing for large loans has 

tightened as well, with spreads on loans from $10 million to $25 million also increasing about 

100 basis points in 2009. 


                                                            
1   The most recent data from the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds report indicate that, for example, C&I lending by 
commercial banks declined by about 24 percent.  Declines for other categories of lending in the same period were 
about 9 percent for commercial real estate and residential real estate, and 5 percent for consumer lending.
