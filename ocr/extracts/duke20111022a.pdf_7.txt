goal for many Americans, so it is especially important that they have an understanding of the 

level of resources they will need in retirement and the investment options available to them.  

Despite these recent trends, most people have the ability to save if they plan accordingly. 

One way to establish and maintain regular savings is through automation.  Think about your own 

401(k).  At one point, perhaps when you were hired, you made one decision to save, and the rest 

was done for you--automatic payroll deductions, investments, statements, etc.  Automatic payroll 

deductions can also be established to build general savings, savings for college, and other critical 

pre-retirement assets.  Experiments with automatic savings programs like “Auto401(k)s,” the 

“Save More Tomorrow” concept, and “AutoSave” have generated encouraging results.   

In addition to tax-advantaged and automatic savings programs, there are a number of 

targeted savings initiatives that can help families save.  For example, low-income residents of 

Virginia are eligible to participate in the Virginia Individual Development Accounts (VIDA) 

Program, which matches $2 for every $1 saved in a VIDA account.  Like other individual 

development accounts (IDA), this program encourages low-income individuals to save for 

specific needs by matching the contributions of the account holder.  In the case of VIDA, the 

combined savings can be used for the purchase of a first home, to start a business, or to finance 

higher education.   

Similar in concept to the IDA, a new child development account (CDA) is being piloted 

for a small number of third and fourth graders in Alexandria, Virginia that can be used later in 

life to further the child's education, to purchase a home, or to capitalize a small business.  Under 

the Child$ave program, contributions to the account can be made from any private source with 

businesses encouraged to establish accounts bearing their name, such as, "Jonathan Swift, a 

Safeway Scholar.”  And this type of initiative is popping up all over the country.  In San
