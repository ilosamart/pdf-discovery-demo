committee rather than by a rule?  One answer is that laws in most countries are passed by 

institutions in which committee deliberation is the norm.  Of course, we then have to ask 

why that has become a norm in almost all democracies.  The answer is that 

opinions--even on monetary policy--differ among experts, while the economy is in a 

constant process of change.   

Because opinions differ among experts, democracies tend to prefer committees in 

which decisions are made by discussion among the experts--and, in many cases, other 

representatives of the public--who discuss, try to persuade each other, and must at the end 

of their deliberations reach a decision.  But those decisions have to be explained to the 

public and to other parts of the government--and hence the appropriate emphasis on 

transparency and accountability.  That is the democratic way of making decisions when 

opinions differ, as they often do in the monetary field. 

I have been a governor of two central banks and, even as the sole monetary policy 

decisionmaker in the Bank of Israel, would sometimes find that my initial view on the 

next decision changed as a result of discussions with the informal advisory committee 

with whom I consulted at that time.  Those discussions, which recognize human frailty in 

analyzing a situation and the need to act despite considerable uncertainties, are the reason 

why committee decisionmaking is, on average, preferable to the use of a rule.19   

Emphasis on a single rule as the basis for monetary policy implies that the truth 

has been found, despite the record over time of major shifts in monetary policy--from the 

gold standard, to the Bretton Woods fixed but changeable exchange rate rule, to 

                                                 
19 The existing literature on monetary policy committees has found that committee decisions tend to be 
better than decisions made by a sole policymaker.  See, for example, Blinder and Morgan (2005); 
Lombardelli, Proudman, and Talbot (2005); and Warsh (2016).
