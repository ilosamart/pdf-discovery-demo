borrowers and local economic conditions is most likely to be significant in making decisions on 

creditworthiness. 

Large numbers of community banks thrive in the United States operating under the model 

just described.  But, as with all banks, the fortunes of these institutions have ebbed and flowed 

with economic conditions, and the number of community banks has consistently declined over 

the last few decades.  During the current economic downturn, community banks have been 

particularly hard hit.  During 2009, banks with assets of $10 billion or less recorded an aggregate 

net loss of more than $4 billion.  This weak performance stemmed primarily from sustained 

deterioration in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans.  Loan loss provisions 

reached $33.0 billion, seven times the pre-crisis level of $4.5 billion recorded in 2006.  Net 

interest margins also narrowed, squeezed by a substantial rise in nonaccruing assets, and the 

nonperforming assets ratio reached nearly five percent.  

Almost one in every three community banks recorded a net loss last year.  Moreover, 

only a little more than one quarter of these institutions reported a return on assets of one percent 

or more (a typical measure of sound earnings performance), down from 56 percent of institutions 

in the pre-crisis year 2006.  And the FDIC problem list recently reached 702 banks and thrifts, its 

highest level since 1993.   

The Challenges for Community Banks 

Given these circumstances, the immediate challenges for many community banks are 

clear.  The first order of business for many will be to address concentrations and weaknesses in 

commercial real estate (CRE) lending activities.  This will require not only rethinking credit 

administration practices and management information system (MIS) requirements, but also 

expanding loan workout expertise and disposing of acquired real estate with a minimum of
