As my colleague at the Board, Jay Powell, recently discussed at a conference in New 

York, the Federal Reserve has been working with the banking industry and a wide range of other 

payment system stakeholders to better understand the consequences of this state of affairs and 

support efforts to expand the available options through our payment system improvement 

initiative.4  For example, based on recommendations from the industry, the Federal Reserve is 

currently studying potential improvements in its settlement services--a traditional core function 

of a central bank--that could address the future needs of a ubiquitous real-time retail payments 

environment. 

Building on our existing banking system also makes sense from a financial stability 

perspective.  Federally insured and supervised institutions are the core of our current payment 

system and largely address the potential financial stability problem of relying on payment 

systems with unbacked and unregulated digital currencies at their heart.  But leveraging our 

existing banking system does not suggest that there is no room for new or emerging institutions 

and technologies.  Indeed, there are a number of promising avenues that would allow the 

innovations that appear to be of the greatest interest to households and business--attributes like 

instant payment capabilities and around-the-clock operations--to be offered using a variety of 

existing and new technologies without requiring significant tradeoffs in safety and resiliency.    

Summary 

 To conclude, our financial stability requires that the payment system be reliable and 

dependable so that the public can trust it.  As a result, there can be a tension between innovation 

and the need for financial stability in the overall payment system.  Innovation must therefore
