Thank you.  I thought I would focus my remarks today on one piece of the 

shadow banking system, namely the market for securities financing transactions (SFTs).  

In so doing, I want to call attention to the fire-sales problem associated with SFTs, and 

consider potential policy remedies.1 I will do so in three parts.  First, I will briefly discuss 

the welfare economics of fire sales.  That is, I will try to make clear when a forced sale of 

an asset is not just an event that leads to prices being driven below long-run fundamental 

values, but also one that involves a market failure, or externality, of the sort that might 

justify a regulatory response.  Second, I will argue that securities financing transactions 

are a leading example of the kind of arrangement that can give rise to such externalities, 

and hence are particularly deserving of policy attention.  And third, I will survey some of 

the recently enhanced tools in our regulatory arsenal (e.g., capital, liquidity, and leverage 

requirements) and ask to what extent they are suited to tackling the specific externalities 

associated with fire sales and SFTs.   

To preview, a general theme is that while many of these tools are likely to be 

helpful in fortifying individual regulated institutions—in reducing the probability that, 

say, a given bank or broker-dealer will run into solvency or liquidity problems—they fall 

short as a comprehensive, marketwide approach to the fire-sales problem associated with 

SFTs.  In this regard, some of what I have to say will echo a recent speech by my Board 

colleague Daniel Tarullo.2

Markets” (October 4, 2013). I am grateful for comments from Matt Eichner, Mike Gibson, Nellie Liang, 
Bill Nelson, and Mark Van Der Weide. The thoughts in this speech are my own, and are not necessarily 
shared by other members of the Federal Open Market Committee.
