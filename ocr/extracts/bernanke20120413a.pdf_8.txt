increased access of consumers and small and medium-sized businesses to capital markets.  

However, the expanded use of this model to finance subprime mortgages through 

securitization was mismanaged at several points, including the initial underwriting, which 

deteriorated markedly, in part because of incentive schemes that effectively rewarded 

originators for the quantity rather than the quality of the mortgages extended.  Loans 

were then packaged into securities that proved complex, opaque, and unwieldy; for 

example, when defaults became widespread, the legal agreements underlying the 

securitizations made reasonable modifications of troubled mortgages difficult.  Rating 

agenciesâ€™ ratings of asset-backed securities were revealed to be subject to conflicts of 

interest and faulty models.  At the end of the chain were investors who often relied 

mainly on ratings and did not make distinctions among AAA-rated securities.  Even if the 

ultimate investors wanted to do their own credit analysis, the information needed to do so 

was often difficult or impossible to obtain. 

 Dependence on short-term funding, high leverage, and inadequate risk 

management were critical vulnerabilities of the private sector prior to the crisis.  

Derivative transactions further increased risk concentrations and the vulnerability of the 

system, notably by shifting the location and apparent nature of exposures in ways that 

were not transparent to many market participants.  But even as private-sector activities 

increased systemic risk, the public sector also failed to appreciate or sufficiently respond 

to the building vulnerabilities in the financial system--both because the statutory 

framework of financial regulation was not well suited to addressing some key 

vulnerabilities and because some of the authorities that did exist were not used 

effectively.
