dismiss a risk simply because it is improbable in his or her favorite model.  I donâ€™t know of any 

formal model that predicted what we have just been through.  Rather, policymakers need to 

weigh the predictions of competing models in light of both theory and empirical evidence.  They 

also need to be prepared to adjust these weights or even abandon some models when the 

incoming data are inconsistent with the view of the world embodied in the particular model.  

In my experience, these and other considerations put a premium on flexibility.  The need 

to learn from and respond to news means that policy should have a substantial discretionary 

component.  We have certainly needed to innovate over the past several years to contain the 

damage from unprecedented events in financial markets.  But discretion has its limits as well.  

We must be able to explain and justify our actions within a coherent framework--even if the 

elements of that framework are adjusted from time to time as experience dictates.  And to the 

extent that we can act predictably, households and businesses will be able to anticipate our 

actions, reinforcing their effects.  Finally, we must not be flexible about our objectives.  The 

goals of monetary policy--price stability and maximum employment--are stable and well known.  

The flexibility relates to the actions we take to get there.  

Conclusion 

The economy appears to be moving in the right direction, though not as quickly as we all 

would like.  As I prepare to step down from my current position, I recognize that I am leaving 

Janet and my other colleagues with some formidable tasks.  But I am confident that under the 

leadership of Chairman Bernanke, the Federal Reserve will be able to foster the restoration of 

prosperity and stability for the U.S. economy over the years to come.
