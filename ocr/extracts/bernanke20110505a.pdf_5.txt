example, would they be forced into a fire sale of assets, which itself could be 

destabilizing, or would they cease to provide funding or critical services for other 

financial actors?  Finally, what implications would these developments have for the 

broader economy?  The analysis of risks from a systemic perspective, not just from the 

perspective of an individual firm, is the hallmark of macroprudential regulation and 

supervision.  And the remedies that might emerge from such an analysis could well be 

more far-reaching and more structural in nature than simply requiring a few firms to 

modify their funding patterns. 

Implementing the Macroprudential Approach in the United States 

Let me be more concrete and talk about the implementation of the 

macroprudential approach in the context of the evolving U.S. regulatory system. 

The first required element of macroprudential oversight is a system for 

monitoring evolving risks to financial stability.  Beyond assigning individual regulatory 

agencies this responsibility, the Dodd-Frank Act took the additional step of setting up a 

new body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, as I mentioned earlier.  The council 

is charged with monitoring the U.S. financial system, identifying risks that threaten the 

stability of that system, and promoting market discipline and other conditions that 

mitigate excessive risk-taking in financial markets.  The council is made up of 10 voting 

members--including the Federal Reserve--and 5 nonvoting members, who serve in an 

advisory capacity.1

voting members include the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, the Bureau 
of Consumer Financial Protection, and an independent insurance expert appointed by the President. The 
latter two seats are not yet filled.
