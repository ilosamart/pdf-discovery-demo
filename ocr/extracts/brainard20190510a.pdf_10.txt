the Great Recession, the rise in consumer debt, such as credit cards, auto loans, and 

student loans, has been relatively steady.   

The rapid growth in liabilities reflects both short-term cash flow management and 

longer-term investments.  Taking on debt is an important way for middle-income families 

to help buffer unexpected expenses or a temporary loss of income, as indicated by the 8 

in 10 middle-income adults who are at least somewhat confident that they could obtain an 

additional credit card if they applied for it.15  Debt is also a critical mechanism for 

making key middle-class investments, which I turn to next.   

Investing in the Future 

There is a palpable sense that the opportunity to reach the middle class and remain 

in it is receding for many middle-income households.  Many households find it 

challenging to make key middle-class investments because incomes at the middle are not 

keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership, and it is difficult to 

save enough.  Often, making these investments requires having some savings in the first 

placeâ€”for instance, to make a down payment on a home, forgo income for a few years 

while paying tuition, or secure credit for a small business. 

Disparities by race and ethnicity 

This challenge is compounded for some racial and ethnic minority groups that 

have experienced large and persistent racial gaps in wealth.  In 2016, the average wealth 

of white households ($933,700) was seven times the average wealth of black households 

($138,200) and five times that of Hispanic households ($191,200).  Even among 

households at the middle of the income distribution, the average wealth in 2016 of white
