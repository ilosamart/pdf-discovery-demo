There are a number of ways to define middle income.  I will primarily focus on 

households between the 40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution.  In 2018, 

these households had incomes between $40,000 and $85,000.3   

To explore the issues associated with financial resilience and intergenerational 

financial well-being, it is necessary to go beyond measures of income and better 

understand household assets and liabilities.   

Today I will share with you findings from a promising new data resource 

developed by Federal Reserve staff, the Distributional Financial Accounts (DFAs).  

These accounts combine household-level data on balance sheets, incomes, and 

demographic characteristics of families in the United States from the triennial Survey of 

Consumer Finances (SCF) with aggregate data from the Financial Accounts of the United 

States to track the distribution of these household assets and liabilities on a quarterly 

basis.4  The timeliness of the data, which are currently available through the fourth 

quarter of 2018, can provide valuable insights into how different types of households are 

faring over the business cycle.   

I will also share some new results from the 2018 Survey of Household Economics 

and Decisionmaking (SHED), which deliver further insights on the financial resilience of 

                                                 
3 This definition errs slightly on the higher side of what might be considered middle income, but the results 
are qualitatively robust to taking the middle third of the income distribution.
