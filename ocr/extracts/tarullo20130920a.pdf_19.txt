The second place to work on time-varying tools is found in another element of the 

new capital regime, the countercyclical buffer provision of Basel III.  This provision 

envisions an increase in the applicable risk-weighted capital requirements of financial 

companies by up to 2½ percentage points when “credit growth is excessive and is leading 

to the buildup of system-wide risk.”

  While stress testing has a built-in degree of time-

variance (since macroeconomic scenarios must be constructed annually), the 

countercyclical buffer is intended to be purely time variant, in that it is to be activated 

when, and only when, there is “excess aggregated credit growth,” a condition that the 

Basel Committee anticipates will occur only infrequently.

The principal macroprudential rationale of the countercyclical buffer is one of 

increasing resiliency: that the banking system as a whole will have enough capital to 

continue effective intermediation, even if a period of stress follows what turned out to be 

a period of unsustainable, rapid credit growth that leads to unusually high losses as asset 

prices plummet thereafter.

Resilient Banks and Banking Systems,” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June), p. 

57, www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf.  Basel III introduced the concept of a capital “buffer” to supplement the 

long-established concept of minimum capital requirements.  In brief, the idea is that a bank’s distribution of 

capital to shareholders or employees will be progressively more restricted as capital levels fall below 

required buffers, but—unlike the case where capital levels fall below minimum requirements—a bank need 

not bring its capital levels above the buffer by shedding assets or raising new capital.  Basel III introduced a 

“fixed” capital buffer of 2½ percent of common equity on top of the 4½ percent minimum capital 

requirement.  The countercyclical capital buffer would be placed on top of the fixed buffer.  If applied at its 

maximum 2½ percent amount, the countercyclical buffer would thus require that a bank maintain equity 

capital of at least 9½ percent of risk-weighted assets in order to remain unencumbered by restrictions on 

capital distributions.  There is a view held by some that large banks would be under considerable market 

pressure to maintain their capital levels above the 7 percent total minimum requirement and fixed buffer (as 

well as the added systemic surcharge for those banks subject to it), even in stressed periods.
