some assets to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets that collateralize the 

securities.8  With “skin in the game,” the incentive to cut corners in extending loans is 

reduced, and the entire chain created when assets are securitized should be stronger.  

Transparency has also been enhanced with stronger disclosure requirements for 

securitizations. 

At this stage of the recovery, there are signs of reduced nonbank financial sector 

vulnerabilities.  Leverage is quite low in parts of the sector and appears moderate overall.  

Leverage at hedge funds, while difficult to measure, is an exception and appears in 

aggregate to have trended upward in recent years.  Market-level information on short-

term wholesale funding--such as commercial paper and repurchase agreements--indicate 

subdued activity after its level fell dramatically during the crisis.  While issuance of 

securitizations has been picking up, its levels remains moderate. 

The available data paint a picture of a nonbank sector that has generally reduced

Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission—approved a final rule requiring sponsors of securitization transactions to retain risk in those 
transactions.  The final rule generally requires sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain not less 
than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance.  As required by the Dodd-

QRMs from the risk retention requirement.  The final rule aligns the QRM definition with that of a 
qualified mortgage as defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The final rule also does not 
require any retention for securitizations of commercial loans, commercial mortgages, or automobile loans 
that meet specific standards for high quality underwriting.  For more information, see the press release on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141022a.htm
