Both the short-term wholesale funding and asset management examples point to the 

broader objective for macroprudential policy of developing what we might term “prudential 

market regulation”--that is, a policy framework that builds on the traditional investor protection 

and market functioning aims of securities regulation by incorporating a system-wide perspective.  

Like the reforms to banking regulation that followed the crisis, this new form of regulation might 

start by strengthening some of the firm- or fund-specific measures associated with those 

traditional regulatory aims, but then move forward to take into account such considerations as 

system-wide demands on liquidity during stress periods and correlated risks among asset 

managers that could exacerbate liquidity, redemption, and firesale pressures.  The specific 

policies associated with prudential market regulation might be transaction-specific, or apply to 

certain kinds of business models.  In her important speech last month, Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Jo White provided a roadmap for beginning to develop just such 

a regulatory approach for the asset management industry.7 

In thinking about short-term wholesale funding and some forms of asset management, we 

encounter a background circumstance that complicates the task of developing effective 

macroprudential tools.  Demand for safe short-term assets is both real and substantial, emanating 

from multiple sources, including sovereign nations that wish to self-insure against exchange rate 

pressures; non-financial corporations that have increased their cash holdings in the wake of the 

market disruptions associated with defaults by Enron and other companies; and institutional 

investors protecting themselves against redemption demands or other unexpected cash needs.  

While it is important to adopt measures that protect against runs and that counteract the illusion
