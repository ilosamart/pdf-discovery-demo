from investment banking could at least mitigate the risks of extending the safety net 

provided depository institutions to underwriting, trading, and other activities of very large 

firms.  But an IO perspective suggests that the proposal could entail substantial costs.  

The reinstatement of Glass-Steagall would mean that bank clients could no longer retain 

one financial firm that would have the capacity to offer the whole range of financing 

options--from lines of credit to public equity offerings--depending on a client’s needs and 

market conditions.  Moreover, many banks that are far too small ever to be considered 

TBTF do provide some capital market services to their clients--often smaller businesses--

a convenience and possible cost savings that would be lost under Glass-Steagall 

prohibitions.8   

With the present state of research, it is virtually impossible to quantify the social 

benefits of these economies.  However, what seems the likelihood of nontrivial benefits 

from current affiliations is a good reason to be cautious about adopting this proposal. 

Capping nondeposit liabilities   

Proposals to place a cap on a bank’s nondeposit liabilities as a fraction of U.S. 

gross domestic product (GDP) have been promoted as more directly responsive to the 

sources of systemic risk than are proposals to reinstate Glass-Steagall or to cap the total 

assets of a bank.  Many studies of the financial crisis demonstrate that the reliance of 

large financial firms on nondeposit funding made them, and the financial system as a 

whole, susceptible to the dramatic runs that peaked in the fall of 2008.  For the largest 

                                                 
8 A variation on the Glass-Steagall reinstatement proposal is to prohibit only securities trading by affiliates 
of insured depository institutions.  This proposal may also negate certain economies of scope, which seem 
quite likely to exist in firms that make markets in securities that they have underwritten, and thus also 
economies of scale, which may be realized by making markets in other securities once a firm is in that 
business.  Note in this regard that the so-called Volcker rule, included in the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits 
only proprietary trading, not all trading.  Whatever the practical difficulties of distinguishing proprietary 
from nonproprietary trading, the distinction in the legislation rests on the apparent assumption that there are 
efficiencies to be gained in having underwriting firms trade.
