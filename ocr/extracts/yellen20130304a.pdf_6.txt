  Also in September, the Committee changed the language related to that 

commitment, dropping the reference to “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued 

outlook for inflation.”  Instead, it emphasized that “a highly accommodative stance of 

monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic 

recovery strengthens,” clarifying the Committee’s intention to continue to provide 

support well into the recovery.

Finally, last December, the Committee recast its forward guidance for the federal 

funds rate by specifying a set of quantitative economic conditions that would warrant 

holding the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound.  Specifically, the Committee 

anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate “at 

least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between 

one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the 

Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue 

to be well anchored.”

An important objective of these changes in forward guidance is to enhance the 

public’s understanding of the Committee’s policy strategy and its “reaction function”--

namely, how the FOMC anticipates varying its federal funds rate target in response to 

evolving economic developments.  For example, the Committee’s initial, calendar-based 

guidance did not clearly convey the rationale for the specified date.  In particular, when 

the Committee extended the calendar date, the public was left to infer whether the change 

reflected a deterioration in the Committee’s economic outlook or, instead, a decision to 

increase policy accommodation.
