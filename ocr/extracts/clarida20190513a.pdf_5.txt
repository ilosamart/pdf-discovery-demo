The program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the 

review. 

Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal Open 

Market Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy, 

beginning around the middle of the year.  We expect to make our conclusions public in 

the first half of 2020. 

Concluding Thoughts 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict 

our ultimate finding.  What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary 

policy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and 

sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
