Basel III also includes quantitative liquidity rules that reflect contractual and other risks 

that arise from bank sponsorship of off-balance-sheet vehicles. 

 A second area of ongoing reform is money market funds.  In an important step 

toward greater stability, the SEC in 2010 amended its regulations to, among other things, 

require that money market funds maintain larger buffers of liquid assets, which may help 

reassure investors and reduce the likelihood of runs.  Notwithstanding the new 

regulations, the risk of runs created by a combination of fixed net asset values, extremely 

risk-averse investors, and the absence of explicit loss absorption capacity remains a 

concern, particularly since some of the tools that policymakers employed to stem the runs 

during the crisis are no longer available.  SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has advocated 

additional measures to reduce the vulnerability of money market funds to runs, including 

possibly requiring funds to maintain loss-absorbing capital buffers or to redeem shares at 

the market value of the underlying assets rather than a fixed price of $1.  Alternative 

approaches to ensuring the stability of these funds have been proposed as well.  

Additional steps to increase the resiliency of money market funds are important for the 

overall stability of our financial system and warrant serious consideration. 

 A third set of emerging reforms is aimed at repo markets, an area in which the 

Federal Reserve has taken an active role.  The initial efforts have focused on the 

vulnerabilities created by the large amounts of intraday credit provided by clearing banks 

in the triparty repo market.  Intraday credit, while a great convenience in normal times, 

may foster systemic risk by creating large mutual exposures between securities dealers 

and clearing banks.  In times of market stress, a dealer default on intraday credit extended 

could be large enough to pose a threat to the stability of the clearing bank--institutions
