Happy New Year.  I am very glad to be speaking to you here in New York, a city 

I lived and worked in for 30 years before joining the Federal Reserve Board in 

September.  The new year is often a time when people make resolutions--resolutions to 

exercise more, learn a new skill, or spend more quality time with family and friends.  My 

resolution, as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to work with 

my colleagues to implement a monetary policy that will sustain economic growth and 

maximum employment at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.1   

Initial Conditions and What I Am Looking for in 2019 

As we begin 2019, the initial conditions for the real economy are favorable.  

Through the first three quarters of last year, gross domestic product growth averaged 

3.2 percent.  Private-sector forecasts as well as our Summary of Economic Projections 

indicate that, when the data for the fourth quarter are released, they will show the 

economy likely grew at 3 percent or perhaps a little faster in 2018 for the year as a whole.  

If so, economic growth in 2018 would be the fastest annual growth rate recorded in 

13 years.  In terms of the economic outlook, ongoing momentum heading into this year 

indicates that that above-trend growth is likely to continue in 2019.  If the economy 

continues to grow in 2019 along the lines that I expect, in July the current expansion will 

become the longest in recorded U.S. history. 

The labor market remains healthy, with an unemployment rate near the lowest 

level recorded in 50 years and with average monthly job gains continuing to outpace the 

increases needed over the longer run to provide employment for new entrants to the labor 

                                                 
1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or 
FOMC participants.  I would like to thank Brian Doyle, David Lebow, and Ellen Meade for their assistance 
in preparing these remarks.
