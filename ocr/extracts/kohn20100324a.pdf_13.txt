nominal interest rates and thus give central banks more room to lower interest rates in response 

to a bad shock to the economy before running against the zero bound.   

 Although I agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, I do 

not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets.  Central banks around the world 

have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by 

businesses and households when making decisions about the future.  Moreover, inflation 

expectations are well anchored at those low levels. 

Increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse 

economic outcomes over time.  First of all, inflation expectations would necessarily have to 

become unanchored as inflation moved up.  I doubt households and businesses would 

immediately adjust their expectations up to the new targets and that expectations would then be 

well anchored at the new higher levels.  Instead, I fear there could be a long learning process, 

just as there was as inflation trended down over recent decades.  Second, 4 percent inflation may 

be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation more into 

account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that otherwise 

transitory inflation would become more persistent.   

For both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make 

expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other 

economic conditions.  That greater sensitivity would reduce the ability of central banks to buffer 

the economy from bad shocks.  It could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run 

and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates.  It is notable that while the 

economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central bank has 

raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis.
