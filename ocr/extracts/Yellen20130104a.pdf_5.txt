Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and changes in supervisory practices by the Federal 

Reserve and other financial regulators are intended to do just that. 

In my remarks, I will discuss a few of the major regulatory and supervisory 

changes under way to address the potential for excessive systemic risk arising from the 

complexity and interconnectedness that characterize our financial system.  The design of 

an appropriate regulatory framework entails tradeoffs between costs and benefits, and to 

illustrate them, I will discuss in some detail proposals currently under consideration to 

mitigate risk in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which proved to be an important 

channel for the transmission of risk during the recent crisis.  I am quite aware that some 

reforms in the wake of the financial crisis, including those pertaining to derivatives, have 

been controversial.  In connection with recent rulemakings--and, more broadly, in the 

arena of public debate--critics have asked whether complexity and interconnectedness 

should be treated as potential sources of systemic risk.  This is a legitimate question that 

the Federal Reserve welcomes and itself seeks to answer in its roles of researcher, 

regulator, and supervisor.  Let me say at the outset, though, that a lack of complete 

certainty about potential outcomes is not a justification for inaction, considering the size 

of the threat encountered in the recent crisis.   

Responsible policymakers try to make decisions with the best information 

available but would always like to know more.  With that in mind, Iâ€™ll begin by briefly 

surveying research that highlights ways in which network structure and 

interconnectedness can give rise to or exacerbate systemic risk in the financial system.
