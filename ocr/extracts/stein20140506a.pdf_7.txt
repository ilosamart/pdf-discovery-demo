I agree completely with this view, and I suspect that many in the market also 

understand the distinction that is being drawn--that as policy normalizes, forward 

guidance will be less commitment-like and, hence, a less precise guide to our future 

actions than it has been in the recent past.  But I would not want to presume that 

everybody is thinking about it the same way; one can imagine that there might again be 

some optimists who are in this case underestimating the degree of uncertainty about the 

future path of policy and are placing levered bets accordingly.  So we may have some 

further bumps in the road as this all plays out.  

The Committee Is Not a Single Person 

It is common to hear observers talk about the Committee’s reaction function, 

which describes how we will behave in various contingencies.  However, even if all of 

the individual members of the Committee have well-defined and carefully thought-out 

individual reaction functions--that is, each member knows what his or her policy 

preference is for any given state of the world--it does not follow that the Committee as a 

whole has an equally well-defined reaction function. 

The reason for this divergence is that when one says that the Committee has a 

reaction function for how it will behave if contingency X arises, such a statement implies 

that we have fully litigated this contingency in advance.  In other words, we have debated 

the pros and cons, we have hashed out our differences, and we have come to an 

agreement on how to proceed under contingency X.  But such litigation is difficult and
