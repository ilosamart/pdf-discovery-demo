Since the first CCAR there has been notable improvement in the firms’ capital planning 

processes.  Many firms have made meaningful investments in their risk-measurement processes, 

including significant enhancements to their internal data and management information systems.  

Many firms have adopted a formal framework to inform their capital planning through an 

analysis of their vulnerabilities and capital adequacy under a range of potential adverse 

scenarios.  They have also taken steps to enhance the integrity of their risk measures, analysis, 

and the decision-making around their capital levels and distributions. 

Despite these advances, there is continuing need for improvement in the firms’ capital 

planning processes.  Some firms still lack reliable information about their businesses and 

exposures.  Firms also are sometimes unable to measure or understand how stressful conditions 

can change the performance of their material business lines.  In particular, the capacity to assess 

the impact of tail risks remains in need of further development at many firms.  These deficiencies 

are, in some instances, compounded by weak oversight by senior management and boards of 

directors, and lack of effective checks and accountability in the process.   

The Qualitative Assessment in CCAR 

The importance we attach to these risk-management and capital planning processes is 

reflected in the component of CCAR known as the qualitative assessment.  This assessment 

covers a range of topics, including the extent to which the design of a firm’s internal scenario 

captures the specific risks from the firm’s activities, the firm’s methods for projecting losses 

under stress scenarios, and how the firm identifies appropriate capital levels and plans for 

distributions.  As detailed in our CCAR regulation, where these processes are found to be 

inadequate, or to raise safety and soundness concerns, they may form the basis for an objection
