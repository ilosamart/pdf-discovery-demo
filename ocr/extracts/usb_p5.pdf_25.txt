license is not a document but a provision in the
regulation itself authorizing certain transactions;
the branch must request the customer to sign an
affidavit stating that the particular transaction is
covered by a general license. The specific license
is a document (with U.S. Treasury seal, signa-
ture of OFAC’s Chief of Licensing and control
number) issued by OFAC on a case-by-case
basis to a specific individual or company allow-
ing an activity that otherwise is prohibited by
the regulations; the branch must request to see
the original license.

Blocking an account allows only credits to be
posted to a customer’s account. If OFAC imposes
the blocking of an account, then the account
cannot be used to settle claims, i.e., the branch is
prohibited from offsetting the account; no deb-
iting is allowed. Assets can also be blocked
whereby the Treasury Department exercises
powers and privileges associated with owner-
ship of all property and interests in property of
the sanctioned country’s government, its agen-
cies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities in
the United States or within the possession or
control of U.S. persons. An institution’s corre-
spondent banks accounts can also be blocked or
frozen. The branch is not allowed to tell its
customer if his/her account has been blocked by
OFAC.

A 602 Request is a national emergency inquiry
requested by the U.S. Secretary of State. The
U.S. government does not need an injunction
order for this request, and the recipient of such
a request must respond to the inquiry.

Any violation of the regulations implement-
ing the sanctions subjects the violator to crimi-
nal prosecution. Criminal penalties for violating
sanctions range up to 12 years in prison and
$1 million in corporate fines and $250,000 in
individual fines, per incident. In addition, civil
penalties of up to $250,000 per violation may be
imposed administratively.

Regulation K, International Banking
Organizations—12 CFR 211

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System’s Regulation K, Subpart B was issued

pany Act of 1956 (BHCA) and the International
Banking Act of 1978 (IBA). It applies to FBOs
with respect to:

• limitations on interstate banking;
• exemptions from the nonbanking prohibitions

of the BHCA and the IBA;
• the approval of the establishment of an office

of a foreign bank in the U.S.;
• the termination of a foreign bank’s branch or

agency;
• the examination of an office of a foreign bank

in the U.S.;
• the disclosure of supervisory information to a

foreign supervisor; and

state branches and state agencies of a foreign
bank.

The following is a brief summary of Regula-
tion K:

Section 211.21—Definitions

Section 211.22—Limitation on Interstate

Section 211.23—Nonbanking Activities of
FBOs

An organization must qualify for exemption
from these prohibitions by meeting certain asset,

ceases to be eligible for the exemption, the
organization may apply to the Federal Reserve
Board for a specific determination of its eligi-
bility. Refer to the regulation for details. If an
organization qualifies for this exemption, it may
engage in certain activities and investments
cited in the regulation. Refer to the regulation
