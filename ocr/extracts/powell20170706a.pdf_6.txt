There has also been meaningful progress in reforming the old system.  In 2008, Congress 

enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which, among other things, created the 

Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), modeled on and with similar powers to the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Under the FHFA’s oversight, the two GSEs’ retained portfolios 

have declined to about half of their pre-crisis size, and are expected to continue on a downward 

path.  The FHFA and the GSEs have also been working to develop a market for the GSEs to lay 

off their credit risk.  These innovative transactions have raised about $50 billion in private capital 

that now stands between taxpayers and mortgage credit risk in the GSEs’ portfolios.  In addition, 

the creation of a Common Securitization Platform should strengthen the GSEs’ securitization 

infrastructure and facilitate further reforms with an eye toward enhancing competition.     

New regulations have also been put in place since the crisis with the goal of encouraging 

sound underwriting of mortgage loans.  Today, lenders must make a good faith effort to 

determine that the borrower has the ability to repay the mortgage.  Moreover, if the lender 

provides a “qualified mortgage” contract to the borrower, then the lender needs to meet certain 

other requirements.4  For example, some contract features such as an interest-only period or 

negative amortization, where the loan balance increases even though the borrower is making 

payments, are taboo.  Upfront points and fees are limited too.
