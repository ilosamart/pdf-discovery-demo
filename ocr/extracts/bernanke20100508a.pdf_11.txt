Devices like gratitude journals help people remain aware of the fortunate aspects of their 

lives, offsetting the natural human tendency to take those things for granted after a while. 

Happiness research can be useful for individuals, but it also has implications for 

policymakers.  For one, the policy goals of promoting economic growth and employment, 

though not--as we have seen--the only appropriate goals, are worthwhile nonetheless.  On 

average, as I have already noted, citizens of richer countries report higher levels of life 

satisfaction, no doubt in part because they tend to be healthier, to have more leisure time 

to pursue hobbies or socialize, and to have more interesting work.  Generally, richer 

countries also have fewer citizens in severe poverty.   

But, again, many things beside income contribute to feelings of well-being.  For 

example, as I mentioned, social interactions appear very important for individual 

happiness.  One application of this insight--and this is just an example of the type of 

research connected with the “economics of happiness” that may bear policy insights--

involved a program in Canada in which recipients of employment insurance or income 

assistance were offered jobs in community development and opportunities to develop a 

social network.14  Being unemployed is stressful, not just because of loss of income but 

also because of feelings of loss of control and diminished self-worth.  But individuals 

who participated in these opportunities reported higher satisfaction than those who did 

not.  Further study could shed light on the effectiveness of alternative approaches to 

traditional unemployment insurance programs. 

More generally, economic policymakers should pay attention to family and 

community cohesion.  All else equal, good economic policies should encourage and
