moment.  But that does not mean that the Federal Reserve would be unable to provide 

appreciable accommodation should the ongoing expansion falter in the near term.  In 

addition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero, the FOMC could 

resume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this 

level until conditions had improved markedly--although with long-term interest rates 

already quite low, the net stimulus that would result might be somewhat reduced. 

Despite these caveats, I expect that forward guidance and asset purchases will 

remain important components of the Fed’s policy toolkit.  In addition, it is critical that the 

Federal Reserve and other supervisory agencies continue to do all they can to ensure a 

strong and resilient financial system.  That said, these tools are not a panacea, and future 

policymakers could find that they are not adequate to deal with deep and prolonged 

economic downturns.  For these reasons, policymakers and society more broadly may 

want to explore additional options for helping to foster a strong economy. 

On the monetary policy side, future policymakers might choose to consider some 

additional tools that have been employed by other central banks, though adding them to 

our toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits and, in some 

cases, could require legislation.  For example, future policymakers may wish to explore 

the possibility of purchasing a broader range of assets.  Beyond that, some observers have 

suggested raising the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or implementing policy 

through alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as price-level or nominal GDP 

targeting.  I should stress, however, that the FOMC is not actively considering these 

additional tools and policy frameworks, although they are important subjects for research.
