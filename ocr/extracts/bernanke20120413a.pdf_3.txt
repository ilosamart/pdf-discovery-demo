escape comprehensive supervision; failures of supervisors to effectively apply some 

existing authorities; and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a 

whole (that is, the lack of a macroprudential focus in regulation and supervision). 

 The distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities is helpful in that it allows us 

to better understand why the factors that are often cited as touching off the crisis seem 

disproportionate to the magnitude of the financial and economic reaction.  Consider 

subprime mortgages, on which many popular accounts of the crisis focus.  

Contemporaneous data indicated that the total quantity of subprime mortgages 

outstanding in 2007 was well less than $1 trillion; some more-recent accounts place the 

figure somewhat higher.  In absolute terms, of course, the potential for losses on these 

loans was large--on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars.  However, judged in 

relation to the size of global financial markets, aggregate exposures to subprime 

mortgages were quite modest.  By way of comparison, it is not especially uncommon for 

one dayâ€™s paper losses in global stock markets to exceed the losses on subprime 

mortgages suffered during the entire crisis, without obvious ill effect on market 

functioning or on the economy.  Thus, losses on subprime mortgages can plausibly 

account for the massive reaction seen during the crisis only insofar as they interacted with 

other factors--more fundamental vulnerabilities--that served to amplify their effects.    

 On the surface, the puzzle of disproportionate cause and effect seems somewhat 

less stark if one takes the boom and bust in the U.S. housing market as the trigger of the 

crisis, as the paper gains and losses associated with the swing in house prices were many 

times the losses associated directly with subprime loans.  Indeed, the 30 percent or so 

aggregate decline in house prices since their peak has by now eliminated nearly $7
