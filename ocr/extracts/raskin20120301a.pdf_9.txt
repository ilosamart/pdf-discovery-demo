from interest-bearing assets; indeed, the flow of interest income that households earn on 

their savings has declined about one-fourth since the recession began.  However, I would 

also emphasize that many households are benefiting from the low level of interest rates, 

and some critics of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy seem to 

minimize this point.  Purchases of motor vehicles and other household durables can be 

financed more cheaply, and in many cases, households have been able to refinance their 

mortgages into lower-rate loans, freeing up income for other uses. 

In addition, interest-bearing assets represent only a modest portion of overall 

household assets.  According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, less 

than 7 percent of total household assets are directly held in transaction accounts, 

certificates of deposit, savings bonds, and bonds.

  Instead, the bulk of household wealth 

is held in stocks, retirement accounts, business equity, and real estate.  For these other 

types of assets, rates of return depend primarily on the strength of the economy and how 

fast the economy is growing.  Thus, these returns should be supported, over time, by the 

accommodative monetary policy that we have in place.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve 

aims to keep inflation low and stable over time, which limits the risk to investors that 

high inflation will undermine the value of their savings.   

 I also want to specifically address the argument raised by critics that an extended 

period of low interest rates will discourage households from saving and, as a result, 

diminish the longer-run economic growth prospects of the U.S. economy.  Currently, 

households have a number of reasons to save in addition to their desire to earn interest.
