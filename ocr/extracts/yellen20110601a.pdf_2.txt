 
 Let me begin by thanking Governor Shirakawa and the Bank of Japan for inviting me to 

participate in this important conference on linkages among monetary policy, financial markets, 

and the real economy.  The severe economic consequences of the recent financial crisis have 

underscored the need for central banks to vigilantly monitor the financial system for emerging 

risks to financial stability.  Indeed, such vigilance may be particularly important when monetary 

policy remains highly accommodative for an extended period.  As many observers have argued, 

an environment of low and stable interest rates may encourage investor behavior that could 

potentially lead to the emergence of financial imbalances that could threaten financial stability.1   

 Monetary policy in the United States has been highly accommodative now for a number 

of years.  Since late 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has kept the target 

federal funds rate close to zero and has purchased a substantial amount of longer-term Treasury 

and agency securities.  My reading of the evidence is that those securities purchases have proven 

effective in easing financial conditions, thereby promoting a stronger pace of economic recovery 

and checking undesirable disinflationary pressures.  Moreover, I believe that the current 

accommodative stance of U.S. monetary policy continues to be appropriate because the 

unemployment rate remains elevated and inflation is expected to remain subdued over the 

medium run.     

 Today, I will describe some of the surveillance practices that the Federal Reserve has put 

in place to monitor risks to financial stability, particularly risks stemming from potential 

interactions between a run-up in asset prices and leverage, and I will offer our perspective on the 

current financial situation.  At present, we see few indications of significant imbalances, despite 

some recent developments warranting close attention, including signs of valuation pressures in

preparing these remarks.
