somewhat.  The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly 

balanced. 

Moreover, after remaining disappointingly low through mid-2016, inflation 

moved up during the second half of 2016, mainly because of the diminishing effects of 

the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices.  More recently, higher energy 

prices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation, with the total PCE price index rising 

nearly 2 percent in the 12 months ending in January.  Core PCE inflation--which 

excludes volatile energy and food prices and, therefore, tends to be a better indicator of 

future inflation--has been running near 1-3/4 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation 

compensation have moved up, on net, in recent months, although they remain low.  

With the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target, the 

median assessment of FOMC participants as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4 

percentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be 

appropriate over the course of this year.  In light of current economic conditions, such an 

increase would be consistent with the Committeeâ€™s expectation that it will raise the target 

range for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds 

rate close to some estimates of its current neutral level.  However, partly because my 

colleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat over the 

longer run, we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.   

Our individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate 

reflect economic forecasts that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a 

moderate pace in coming years, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat 

further, and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term.  In short, we
