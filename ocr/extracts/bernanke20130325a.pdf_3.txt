Because I have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, I thought today 

I would tackle a different and more recent issue that has arisen in the aftermath of the 

crisis--the issue of whether, in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing 

a competitive depreciation of exchange rates.2  Like other aspects of the crisis, the notion 

of competitive depreciation has strong classical antecedents, particularly in relation to the 

global Great Depression of the 1930s.  So let me start by briefly revisiting the older 

discussion and its evolution. 

As my audience knows, on the eve of the Great Depression the exchange rates of 

most industrial countries were determined by the rules of the international gold standard--

or, more technically, by the gold-exchange standard, as foreign exchange (primarily 

dollars and pounds sterling) was used along with gold as a form of international reserves.  

The gold standard, which had been suspended during World War I, was painstakingly 

rebuilt in the 1920s.  Unfortunately, the reconstructed gold standard had a number of 

serious problems.  For one, the exchange rates implied by the gold valuations that 

countries chose for their currencies following World War I were in some cases far from 

the levels consistent with balanced flows in trade and payments.  Notably, as John 

Maynard Keynes pointed out in his famous pamphlet, The Economic Consequences of 

Mr. Churchill, the British pound was overvalued under the new gold standard, which 

disadvantaged British exports and contributed to weak economic conditions in the United
