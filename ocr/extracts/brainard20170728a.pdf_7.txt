In the tradition of the discipline of economics, I have cited empirical support for 

the argument that diversity is good for economics.  I know from my own personal 

experience we can and must do better, and in that spirit I want to tell you about one of my 

experiences that might resonate with some of you here.  When I served at the Treasury 

Department for President Obama, one of my responsibilities was to represent the United 

States in the Group of 20 (G-20) deputy ministers of finance and central bank officials.  

At one of our negotiating meetings, the nearly 50 officials gathered for a group photo.  

When this photo was distributed to each of us as a memento, it caused a bit of a stir.  I 

remember a colleague from another delegation doing a double take when he looked at the 

photo.  He turned to me and said “Did you realize you are the only woman in this 

group?”  I had indeed already noticed that.  And I am happy to say that his delegation 

added a woman after that. 

Since that time, we have seen some particularly noteworthy milestones.  At the 

time, there had been only one woman among the G-20 countries serving as head of a 

central bank, in South Africa, and none among the G-7 advanced economies.  Since then, 

two other women have led G-20 central banks, and now I have the honor of serving with 

the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen.   

So what’s my take away from that experience?  It was a good reminder to me that 

we have to see the challenges that are right in front of our eyes if we want to address 

them and we should not be satisfied until the people sitting around every decisionmaking 

table look like America in all its rich diversity. 

Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta hired Raphael Bostic as its 

president and chief executive officer, the first African-American to lead a Reserve Bank.
