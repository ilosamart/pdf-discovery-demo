payments.  That group can readily obtain a mortgage.  The other, much larger group lacks 

one or both advantages, and it faces much greater hurdles in the mortgage market.  So 

there is some chance that the principal effect of renewed MBS purchases would be to 

allow those in the first group who have already refinanced to do so once again or to buy a 

new home at a somewhat lower mortgage rate.  These outcomes would be helpful, but the 

effectiveness of an MBS purchase program would be amplified, perhaps significantly, if 

certain nonmonetary policies were changed.   

Proposals for promoting refinancing have been made by many academics, 

policymakers, and policy analysts.  Any proposals that could sensibly and effectively be 

implemented would increase the effect of an MBS purchase program.  For example, 

action could be taken to bring the benefits of refinancing to underwater borrowers.  In 

principle, borrowers with mortgages that are guaranteed by government-sponsored 

enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and that have loan-to-value ratios of up to 125 

percent can refinance through the Home Affordable Refinance Program.  In practice, 

though, numerous obstacles have kept the program from helping many potentially 

eligible borrowers.  Underwater borrowers whose loans are not guaranteed by GSEs are 

essentially unable to refinance at all.  Policy changes directed at this last, larger group of 

homeowners would have to be carefully designed so as not to transfer credit risk from 

private investors to the government, and could well require legislation.   

Needless to say, though, an MBS repurchase program will not cure all that ails the 

housing market, much less fill the whole aggregate demand shortfall.  There is a host of 

other problems, including continuing issues in mortgage servicing, uncertainty as to when 

house prices will have bottomed out in local markets, ambiguity about the scope of
