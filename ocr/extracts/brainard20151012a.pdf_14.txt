To be fair, the past few years have demonstrated the capacity and will of central 

banks in many jurisdictions to deploy unconventional monetary policy tools, including 

quantitative and credit easing, forward guidance, and negative rates.  That said, resorting 

to such tools is not without costs and uncertainties.   

We should not take the continued strength of domestic demand growth for 

granted.  Although the outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing 

on net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad appear tilted to the downside.  Our 

economy has made good progress toward full employment, but sluggish wage growth 

suggests there is some room to go, and inflation has remained persistently below our 

target.  With equilibrium real interest rates likely to remain low for some time and policy 

options that are more limited if conditions deteriorate than if they accelerate, risk-

management considerations counsel a stance of waiting to see if the risks to the outlook  

diminish.
