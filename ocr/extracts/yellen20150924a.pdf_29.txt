Appendix:  The Estimated Inflation Model and Inflation Decomposition Procedure 

The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations--

an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE inflation.35  The 

identity is 

𝜋𝑡 =  𝜋𝑡
𝑐 + 𝜔𝑡

𝑒𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐸𝑡 + 𝜔𝑡
𝑓

𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐹𝑡,  

where 𝜋𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡
𝑐 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total 

and core PCE prices, respectively; 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐸𝑡 and 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐹𝑡 are annualized growth rates for 

prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both 

expressed relative to core PCE prices; and  𝜔𝑡
𝑒 and  𝜔𝑡

𝑓
 are the weights of energy and 

food in total consumption.  The core inflation forecasting equation is 

𝜋𝑡
𝑐 = .41𝜋𝑡

𝑒 + .36𝜋𝑡−1
𝑐 + .23𝜋𝑡−2

𝑐 − .08𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 + .57𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡,  

where 𝜋𝑡
𝑒  is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization; 

𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods; 𝜖𝑡 

is a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates 

obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4. 

For estimation purposes, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate 

less the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural 

rate, while 𝜋𝑡
𝑒  is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation 

reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 40 basis 

                                                 
35 This appendix was revised on December 17, 2015, to provide additional information on the definition of 

core import inflation and its implications for the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with stable 

inflation.  In addition, the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor 

used to convert historical readings on expected long-run inflation from a CPI basis to a PCE basis was 

50 basis points.
