have also been affected, with Canadian GDP declining in the first two quarters of the 

year.5 

In addition, many non-commodity-producing East Asian economies are closely 

tied to China through trade and investment.  Because of these ties, and for other 

idiosyncratic reasons, growth in East Asian economies has been weak so far this year.  

Growth in emerging Asia economies outside of China that are important destinations of 

U.S. exports slipped to 2-1/2 percent in the first half of the year, well below a trend rate 

of close to 5 percent.   

Downgrades to foreign growth affect the U.S. outlook through several channels.  

First, weak growth abroad reduces demand for U.S. exports.  Second, the expected 

divergence in U.S. growth increases demand for U.S. assets, putting upward pressure on 

the dollar, which, in turn, weighs on net exports.  The estimated effect of dollar 

appreciation on net exports has been shown to be substantial and to persist for several 

years.6  Weak demand weighs on global commodity prices, which, together with the 

effects on the dollar, restrains U.S. inflation.  Finally, the anticipation of weaker global 

growth can make market participants more attuned to downside risks, which can reduce 

prices for risky assets, both abroad and in the United States--as we saw in late August--

with attendant effects on consumption and investment.

Commodity Exporters Headed?  Output Growth in the Aftermath of the Commodity Boom,” chapter 2 of

6 Looking across a broad set of countries, the IMF (2015) estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the 

real exchange rate will cause an eventual 1.5 percentage point reduction in the contribution of net exports 

to real GDP, with effects lasting for several years (see chapter 3, “Exchange Rates and Trade Flows:  

Disconnected?” available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/pdf/c3.pdf).
