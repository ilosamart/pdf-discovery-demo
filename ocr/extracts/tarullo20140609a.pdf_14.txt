objectives discussed earlier.  Indeed, these requirements counteract the practices seen at some 

banks in the run-up to the financial crisis, whereby boards of directors continued to return capital 

to shareholders even as conditions deteriorated severely.13  Tying capital levels to corporate 

governance decisions about capital distributions simply recognizes that capital levels and capital 

distributions are two sides of the same coin. 

A third kind of measure seeks to affect the institutions and processes of corporate 

governance, rather than directly to change incentive structures or regulate decisions.  Many 

possible actions of this sort would really be efforts to improve the risk-assessment and risk-

management capacities of management and boards, rather than to focus specifically on the 

divergence between shareholder and regulatory interests with respect to risk appetite.  An 

effective system of controls is important both to shareholders and to regulators.  Thus, for 

instance, the considerable and continuing emphasis we have placed on firms developing and 

maintaining effective management information systems makes risk assessment work better for 

shareholders, even as it facilitates supervisory oversight. 

With respect to the institutional features of board oversight of risk management, there is 

also substantial overlap in the interests of shareholders and regulators.  For example, both 

shareholders and supervisors should expect a board to include members with the expertise, 

experience, and time commitment that are appropriate to risk management of the kinds of 

activities in which the financial firm engages.  Of particular interest are three board positions--

the nonexecutive chair or lead director, the head of the risk committee, and the head of the audit 

committee.  More generally, shareholders and supervisors must have confidence that globally 

active institutions with hundreds of thousands of employees have audit and risk committees with
