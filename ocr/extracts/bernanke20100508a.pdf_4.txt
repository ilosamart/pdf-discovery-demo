health indicators than poor countries.  Likewise, as the United States has grown richer 

over time, longevity and other measures of health have improved. 

Another thing that most people value is a clean environment.  Air and water 

quality are not included in the broadest measure of economic activity emphasized in 

government statistics, the gross domestic product (GDP), although some economists have 

worked on ways to do so.  But again, rich countries have more resources to devote to 

maintaining a clean environment and do tend to have better air and water quality than 

poor and middle-income countries, notwithstanding the fact that rich countries by 

definition produce more goods and services.  Rich countries also generally provide 

people more leisure time, less physically exhausting and more interesting work, higher 

education levels, greater ability to travel, and more funding for arts and culture.2  Again, 

these linkages, together with the benefits of enjoying a wide variety of goods and 

services, are the reason that economic policymakers--at the behest of the public--usually 

put heavy emphasis on job creation and growth.  Along with price stability, maximum 

employment is one of the Congress’s two mandated objectives for the Federal Reserve.  

And, indeed, economists researching happiness and life satisfaction have found that both 

inflation and unemployment detract from happiness, consistent with the focus on these 

macroeconomic conditions in the mandate of the Federal Reserve.3  

                                                      
2 Economists have long noted the importance of the rich array of factors that contribute to individual and 
societal welfare.  For example, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has been particularly clear in his discussions of 
the range of capabilities that contribute to welfare while also emphasizing that growth in income is one (but 
most certainly not the only) means to expanding welfare.  See Amartya Sen (1999), Development as 
Freedom (Oxford, England:  Oxford University Press).
