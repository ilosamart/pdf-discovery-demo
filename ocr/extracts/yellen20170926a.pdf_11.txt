and services at a particular time, firms take into account the rate of overall inflation they 

expect to prevail in the future.  Monetary policy presumably plays a key role in shaping 

these expectations by influencing the average rate of inflation experienced in the past 

over long periods of time, as well as by providing guidance about the FOMC’s objectives 

for inflation in the future.  Even so, economists’ understanding of exactly how and why 

inflation expectations change over time is limited.17  Moreover, we have to contend with 

the fact that we do not directly observe the inflation expectations relevant to wage and 

price setting.  Instead, we can only imperfectly infer how they might have changed based 

on survey responses and other data. 

The FOMC’s outlook depends importantly on the view that longer-run inflation 

expectations have been stable for many years at a level consistent with PCE price 

inflation that will average around 2 percent in the longer run.  Provided this stability 

continues, standard models suggest that actual inflation should stabilize at about 

2 percent over the next two or three years in an environment of roughly full employment, 

absent any future shocks.  However, there is a risk that inflation expectations may not be 

as well anchored as they appear and perhaps are not consistent with our 2 percent goal.  

To assess this risk, the FOMC considers a variety of survey measures of expected longer-

run inflation, some of which are shown in figure 9.  Long-range projections of PCE price 

inflation made by private forecasters, the solid red line, have been remarkably stable for 

many years, as have been the longer-run inflation expectations reported in surveys of 

                                                 
17 As I discussed in a speech one year ago, I view expectations formation as one of the key areas requiring 
further research by economists (see Yellen, 2016).
