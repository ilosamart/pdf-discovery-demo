a general rise in inflation or longer-term inflation expectations.  The public seemed to 

correctly perceive that the Federal Reserve would not allow an oil price shock to 

precipitate a general rise in inflation.  Longer-term inflation expectations remained well 

anchored, and hence no aggressive and recessionary disinflation action by the Federal 

Reserve was required.  Thus, over the quarter century up to the mid-2000s, the Federal

accuracy.   

Unfortunately, recent events have made it harder for the public to predict the 

future course of monetary policy.  Economic weakness since the financial crisis and the 

Great Recession has confounded hopes for a speedy recovery and has required 

unprecedented monetary policy actions.  Shortly after the financial crisis erupted, the 

Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to almost zero and launched a number of 

temporary liquidity and credit programs to keep the financial system operating.  Even 

these aggressive policy responses, however, were not enough to halt the contraction, and 

further action was needed to stop the economy from falling into a second Great

purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency debt and MBS in an effort to put 

further downward pressure on long-term interest rates and so stimulate the economy.   

With the federal funds rate near zero, and the Federal Reserve deploying the new 

tool of large-scale asset purchases, it became much more difficult for the public to 

anticipate how the FOMC would likely conduct policy over time, and how the overall
