Two remaining challenges loom large: ensuring that all systemic financial firms have 

sufficient unsecured long-term debt at the parent level to recapitalize a bridge holding company 

in OLA; and mitigating cross-border impediments to resolution of a multinational financial firm. 

In consultation with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve is considering the pros and cons of a 

regulatory requirement that systemic U.S. financial firms maintain a minimum amount of long-

term unsecured debt.  Such a requirement would help ensure that equity and long-term debt 

holders of a systemic firm can bear potential future losses at the firm and sufficiently capitalize a 

bridge holding company.     

The cross-border activities of large institutions present another set of challenges to an 

orderly resolution.  OLA is limited in its applicability to U.S.-chartered entities.  Subsidiaries and 

bank branches of a U.S.-based systemic firm chartered in other countries could be ring-fenced or 

wound down separately under the insolvency laws of those countries, if foreign authorities did 

not have full confidence that local interests would be protected.  Certain OLA stabilization 

mechanisms, including the one-day stay provision with respect to over-the-counter derivatives 

and other qualified financial contracts, may not apply outside the United States.  Accordingly, 

counterparties to qualified financial contracts with the foreign subsidiaries and branches of a 

U.S. firm may have contractual rights and substantial economic incentives to terminate their 

transactions as soon as the U.S. parent enters an OLA resolution.  Today, regulators and the 

industry are focused on the potential for addressing this concern through modifications to 

contractual cross-default practices and other means.    

Further progress on these cross-border challenges will require significant coordination 

among U.S. regulators and the key foreign central banks and supervisors for the largest financial 

firms.  For example, the FDIC and the Bank of England are deeply engaged in this important
