the financial system and restore more-normal functioning to key financial markets.  The 

initial upturn in activity, which was reasonably strong, reflected a number of factors, 

including efforts by firms to better align their inventories with their sales, expansionary 

monetary and fiscal policies, improved financial conditions, and a pickup in export 

growth.  However, factors such as fiscal policy and the inventory cycle can provide only 

a temporary impetus to recovery.  Sustained expansion must ultimately be driven by 

growth in private final demand, including consumer spending, business and residential 

investment, and net exports.  That handoff is currently under way.  However, with growth 

in private final demand having so far proved relatively modest, overall economic growth 

has been proceeding at a pace that is less vigorous than we would like. 

In particular, consumer spending has been inhibited by the painfully slow 

recovery in the labor market, which has restrained growth in wage income and has raised 

uncertainty about job security and employment prospects.  Since June, private-sector 

employers have added, on net, an average of only about 85,000 workers per month--not 

enough to bring the unemployment rate down significantly.  

Consumer spending in the quarters ahead will depend importantly on the pace of 

job creation but also on householdsâ€™ ability to repair their financial positions.  Some 

progress is being made on this front.  Saving rates are up noticeably from pre-crisis 

levels, and household assets have risen, on net, over recent quarters, while debt and debt 

service payments have declined markedly relative to income.1  Together with expected 

further easing in credit terms and conditions offered by lenders, stronger balance sheets 

should eventually provide households the confidence and the wherewithal to increase 

                                                 
1 Some of the reduction in household debt burdens is the result of defaults and writedowns rather than 
higher saving.
