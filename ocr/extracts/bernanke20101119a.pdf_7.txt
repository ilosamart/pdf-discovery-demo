to more accommodative financial conditions, which support household and business 

spending.  As I noted, the evidence suggests that asset purchases can be an effective tool; 

indeed, financial conditions eased notably in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s policy 

announcement. 

Incidentally, in my view, the use of the term “quantitative easing” to refer to the 

Federal Reserve’s policies is inappropriate.  Quantitative easing typically refers to 

policies that seek to have effects by changing the quantity of bank reserves, a channel 

which seems relatively weak, at least in the U.S. context.  In contrast, securities 

purchases work by affecting the yields on the acquired securities and, via substitution 

effects in investors’ portfolios, on a wider range of assets. 

This policy tool will be used in a manner that is measured and responsive to 

economic conditions.  In particular, the Committee stated that it would review its asset-

purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and would adjust the 

program as needed to meet its objectives.  Importantly, the Committee remains 

unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the level of 2 

percent or a bit less that most FOMC participants see as consistent with the Federal 

Reserve’s mandate.  In that regard, it bears emphasizing that the Federal Reserve has 

worked hard to ensure that it will not have any problems exiting from this program at the 

appropriate time.  The Fed’s power to pay interest on banks’ reserves held at the Federal 

Reserve will allow it to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten 

policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high.  Moreover, the Fed has invested 

considerable effort in developing tools that will allow it to drain or immobilize bank 

reserves as needed to facilitate the smooth withdrawal of policy accommodation when
