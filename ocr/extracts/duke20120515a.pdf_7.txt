the credit scores of borrowers in the bottom 10 percent of those who obtained credit have 

risen from around 625 in 2006 to approximately 690 today. 

Tight mortgage underwriting standards make obtaining mortgage credit 

particularly more difficult for first-time homebuyers.  Because first-time homebuyers 

tend to be younger than other homebuyers, they also tend to have lower credit scores and 

fewer financial assets that can be used for down payments.  As a result, tight lending 

standards would be expected to constrain their demand by more than it would for other 

homebuyers.  Indeed, research by Federal Reserve staff finds that first-time homebuying 

during the past two years has been quite weak by historical standards, and that this 

weakness has been particularly pronounced among borrowers with lower credit scores. 

Understanding Tight Mortgage Credit Conditions 

So why is access to mortgage credit so tight?  Lenders may have tightened credit 

standards partly as a correction for the lax and problematic lending standards that 

prevailed in the years leading up to the peak in house prices.  And, given the significant 

consequences that those lax lending standards had for many households, communities, 

financial institutions, and the economy, some tightening of credit standards is warranted.  

But it seems likely that other factors are at work as well. 

Constraints on lendersâ€™ capacity to process loan applications have reportedly been 

part of the story.  Since the crisis hit, some lenders have closed their doors, and others 

have cut back substantially on staff.  In addition, a shift to full documentation of income 

and assets, along with a heightened concern that underwriting mistakes could cause 

lenders to be forced to repurchase seriously delinquent loans, has lengthened the time 

required to originate each mortgage.  Indeed, according to Home Mortgage Disclosure
