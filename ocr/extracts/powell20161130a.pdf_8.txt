the Committee faces today.  I will pay particular attention to the dot plot, the cacophony 

issue, and the need to do a better job of explaining uncertainty. 

The Dot Plot 

The dot plot is not a consensus forecast of the Committee.  Rather, the dots 

represent each individual participant’s assessment of the appropriate policy path.  The 

Committee considered the use of a consensus forecast in 2012 but abandoned the effort 

after struggling to reach agreement on its parameters.13 

As you can see from figure 1, the median dots have moved down from SEP to 

SEP.  The December 2014 SEP median dots showed increases of 350 basis points over 

the years 2015-2017.  In the event, there was one 25 basis point rate increase in 2015, and 

the September 2016 SEP median shows one more in 2016 and two in 2017--for a total of 

100 basis points.  Figures 2 and 3 display rate expectations derived from financial market 

prices and forecasts made by financial market participants, respectively.  These market 

paths have also declined significantly over the period.  And the path estimated from 

overnight index swaps (figure 2) has been substantially below the SEP median.  It does 

not appear that markets have uncritically accepted the dots, let alone taken them as a 

commitment.14 

                                                 
13 According to the minutes from the October 22-23, 2012, FOMC meeting, “In their discussion, 
participants agreed that FOMC communications could be enhanced by clarifying the linkage between 
participants’ economic forecasts, including the underlying policy assumptions, and the Committee’s policy 
decision as expressed in the postmeeting statement.  However, most participants judged that, given the 
diversity of their views about the economy’s structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the 
Committee to agree on a fully specified longer-term path for monetary policy to incorporate into a 
quantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy 
decision comprises several elements.”  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012),

14 The expected policy rate paths shown in figures 1, 2, and 3 are not entirely comparable.  The SEP paths 
are median values of the modal projections of individual participants for the end of the calendar year.  The
