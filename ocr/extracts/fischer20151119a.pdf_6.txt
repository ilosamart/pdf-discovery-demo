Next, I would like to discuss the third factor weighing on Asian growth--trade.  

Global integration and trade growth have played a key role in the Asian economic 

success story, and the recent slowdown in global trade, over and above what might be 

expected given the weakness of advanced-economy demand discussed earlier, is likely to 

affect emerging Asian growth prospects.     

During the financial crisis, global trade collapsed.  After the immediate crisis 

faded, trade bounced back in many cases.  But the bounceback was more limited than the 

decline, with the increase in the volume of trade since 2012 only matching the pace of 

global output growth, a considerable deceleration from the previous two decades, when 

trade increased at twice the pace of global output.  While the legacy of the crisis, 

particularly the continued weakness of traded-good-intensive investment in many 

economies, has likely contributed to the weakness of global trade, a slowdown in intra-

Asian regional trade also appears to be a factor.  After increasing at an average rate of 

about 15 percent a year through the 2000s, nominal intra-Asian trade flows have flattened 

out considerably over the past couple of years, in part reflecting a slowdown in the 

growth of production sharing within the region.   

The outlook for a renewed surge in intra-Asian trade does not appear to be 

promising.  The growth of production-sharing networks in Asia has been tied to the 

region’s export-oriented growth model.  In particular, China’s integration into the global 

economy as the hub of this production network provided a significant boost to the 

development and growth of these networks.  As China and the region shift toward 

domestic demand and away from external demand, it seems unlikely that trade growth in 

the region will return to its earlier exceptional pace.
