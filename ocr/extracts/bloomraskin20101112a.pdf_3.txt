The number of foreclosures initiated on residential properties has soared from 

about one million in 2006, the year that house prices peaked, to 2.8 million last year. 

There were 1.2 million foreclosure filings in just the first half of this year.  In addition, 

right now nearly five million loans are somewhere in the foreclosure process, or are 90 

days or more past due and hence at serious risk for a foreclosure filing.   

Our projections remain very grim for the foreseeable future:  All told, we expect 

about two and one-quarter million foreclosure filings this year and again next year, and 

about two million more in 2012.  While these numbers are down from their peak in 2009, 

they remain extremely high by historical standards and represent a trauma in the lives of 

millions of people affected. 

 The most recent alarming development in the foreclosure process that has caught 

public attention involves improper activities by mortgage servicers.  But let’s remember 

that, for years, housing counselors and advocates nationwide have documented patterns 

of fraudulent and abusive mortgage servicing practices.  Current attention is focused on 

so-called “robo-signers,” individuals who appear to have attested to the validity of 

documents in a number of foreclosure filings so large as to suggest that something may 

be amiss in the recording process.  This development is troubling on its own, but it also 

shines a harsh spotlight on other longstanding procedural flaws in mortgage servicing.   

 Many may view these procedural flaws as trivial, technical, or inconsequential, 

but I consider them to be part of a deeper, systemic problem and am gravely concerned. 

During my time as Commissioner of Financial Regulation for the State of Maryland, I 

encountered a Pandora’s Box of predatory tactics that included:
