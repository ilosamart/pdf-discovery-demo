early years, even though CRA evaluations considered an institution’s provision of all 

types of credit in lower-income communities, most were primarily focused on mortgage 

credit.  This was in part due to the availability of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 

(HMDA) data which made robust analysis of mortgage lending possible.  In addition, the 

focus of community development advocates on housing issues, including the redlining 

practices that prompted CRA’s passage, eclipsed the law’s broad scope in public 

perception.  Only over time have community stakeholders come to appreciate the broader 

context of CRA.   

Today, financial institutions have become partners in community development, 

bringing with them an important source of capital and financial expertise.  By working 

together, bankers, community development practitioners, state and local governments, 

and other community stakeholders have learned a great deal, and the community 

development field has matured significantly.   

Places and People 
 

At one time, policy discussions revolved around whether community development 

was about people or places.  I would argue that the debate is over and both sides won.  

Successful community development is based on attention to both the physical 

infrastructure, whether housing or commercial spaces, and the health and welfare of the 

residents therein.  CRA supports community development by requiring financial 

institutions to identify and address the financial needs of the communities they serve.   

Safe and affordable housing will always be an important concern for lower-

income Americans, but the recent recession and resulting damage to communities across 

the country make it clear that communities are more than physical structures.  Sustainable
