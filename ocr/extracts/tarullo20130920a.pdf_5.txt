Macroprudential Foundation for the Regulation of Large Banking Organizations   

It is worth noting that the term “macroprudential regulation” can be found in 

Bank for International Settlements (BIS) documents beginning more than 30 years ago.  

It appears to have originated in specific contrast to traditional banking regulation, which a 

1979 background paper at the BIS characterized as focused on “sound banking practice 

and the protection of depositors at the level of the individual bank.”

  In fact, much of the 

New Deal legislation that would define the financial regulatory structure for more than 40 

years was in direct response to what we would today call systemic concerns, including 

banking panics and excessive leverage in equity markets.

  In the late 1970s, though, 

there was indeed reason for the development of an explicitly macroprudential 

perspective.  The New Deal regulatory system was beginning to break down in the face 

of profound changes in financial markets, most importantly the progressive integration of 

capital market and traditional lending activities.  The forms of regulation that were 

evolving as substitutes—principally, though not only, minimum capital requirements—

were largely based on what various BIS papers characterized as a microprudential 

approach to regulation. 

It is, however, equally worth noting that the use of the term macroprudential—

and, it would seem, the influence of the concerns lying behind the term—was somewhat 

irregular in the three decades after it was coined.  Discussion of the concept and its 

implications for regulation was more likely to be found in the papers of a few academics 

and intrepid BIS researchers than in the pronouncements of senior regulators or other

 The establishment of federal deposit insurance and the separation of commercial banking from investment 

banking—two key elements of New Deal financial reforms—were very much directed at what would today 

be characterized as systemic risks.
