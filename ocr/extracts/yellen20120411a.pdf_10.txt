speech, is that last year’s decline in unemployment represents a catch-up from the 

especially large job losses during late 2008 and 2009.

  According to this hypothesis, 

employers slashed employment especially sharply during the recession, perhaps out of 

concern that the contraction could become even more severe; in particular, the figure 

shows that in 2009, the unemployment rate rose by considerably more than the decline in 

GDP would have suggested.  Then, last year, employers may have become confident 

enough in the recovery to increase hiring and relieve the unsustainable strain that the 

earlier cutbacks had placed on their workforces.  I think the evidence is consistent with 

this hypothesis, and I have incorporated it into my own modal forecast. 

If last year’s Okun’s law puzzle was largely the result of such a catch-up in hiring, 

I would expect progress on the unemployment front to diminish unless the pace of GDP 

growth picks up.  After all, catch-up can go on for only so long.  Of course, there are 

other conceivable explanations for this puzzle, including some that would point to a faster 

decline in unemployment in coming years.  For example, GDP could have risen more 

rapidly over the past year than current data indicate.  It will be important to pay close 

attention to indicators of both the labor market and GDP to try to gauge the likely pace of 

improvement in economic activity going forward and, hence, the appropriate stance of 

monetary policy over time.   

Let me now turn to inflation.  Overall consumer price inflation has fluctuated 

quite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements in prices for oil and other 

commodities.  For example, inflation moved up in the first part of 2011 as a rise in the
