basis.  In many ways, that can be viewed as an opportunity, with the sustained expansion 

providing critical job opportunities to a broader set of applicants.  In parallel, it is also 

vital that a central bank meets its inflation target on a sustained basis, which will provide 

more capacity to buffer the economy if it encounters headwinds. 

We are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to meet our goals 

for many years to come, especially in light of the way the economy is changing, which I 

have been referring to as the “new normal.”4  There are a few key features of that new 

normal.  First, interest rates have stayed very low in recent years in the United States and 

in many other advanced economies, and it seems likely that equilibrium interest rates will 

remain low in the future.  Low interest rates present a challenge for traditional monetary 

policy in recessions.  In the past, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates 4 to 5 

percentage points in order to support household spending and business investment.  

However, when equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates 

and less room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool.   

Another big change in the economy is that inflation does not move as much with 

economic activity and employment as it has in the past, which is what economists mean 

when they say the Phillips curve is very flat.  A flat Phillips curve has important 

advantages:  The labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have 

been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, 

unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.
