bonds as collateral to borrow Treasury securities from the pension fund.  And why would 

the pension fund see this transaction as beneficial?  Tying back to the theme of reaching 

for yield, perhaps it is looking to goose its reported returns with the securities-lending 

income without changing the holdings it reports on its balance sheet. 

There are two points worth noting about these transactions.  First, they reproduce 

some of the same unwind risks that would exist had the clearinghouse lowered its own 

collateral standards in the first place.  To see this point, observe that if the junk bonds fall 

in value, the insurance company will face a margin call on its collateral swap with the 

dealer.  It will therefore have to scale back this swap, which in turn will force it to 

partially unwind its derivatives trade--just as would happen if it had posted the junk 

bonds directly to the clearinghouse.  Second, the transaction creates additional 

counterparty exposures--the exposures between the insurance company and the dealer, 

and between the dealer and the pension fund.  

As I said, we don’t have evidence to suggest that the volume of such transactions 

is currently large.  But with a variety of new regulatory and institutional initiatives on the 

horizon that will likely increase the demand for pristine collateral--from the Basel III 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio, to centralized clearing, to heightened margin requirements for 

noncleared swaps--there appears to be the potential for rapid growth in this area.  Some 

evidence suggestive of this growth potential is shown in exhibit 8, which is based on 

responses by a range of dealer firms to the Federal Reserve’s Senior Credit Officer 

Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms.
