review what has been done since the crisis to reduce the damage to the system from the failure of 

one of the very largest firms. 

Under Dodd-Frank, nearly all financial institution failures, including those of large, 

complex institutions, will continue to be addressed as they were before passage of the new law.  

The holding company will be resolved in bankruptcy.  Operating subsidiary failures will 

continue to be treated either under bankruptcy or, where applicable, under specialized resolution 

schemes, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Act for banks and the Securities Investor 

Protection Act for securities firms.   

Dodd-Frank eliminated the authority used by the Federal Reserve and other regulators to 

bail out individual institutions during the crisis, including Bear Stearns, Citicorp, Bank of 

America and AIG.  But Congress also recognized that there may be rare instances in which the 

failure of a large financial firm could threaten the financial stability of the United States.  To 

empower regulators to handle such a failure without destabilizing the financial system or 

exposing taxpayers to loss, Dodd-Frank created two important new regulatory tools.     

First, the Act requires large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms 

designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to submit a resolution plan or “living 

will” for their rapid and orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code.  Second, the Act created 

a new Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as a backup to resolution in an ordinary bankruptcy. 

The largest bank holding companies submitted their first annual “living wills” to the 

Federal Reserve and the FDIC last summer.  The initial round has yielded valuable information 

that is being used to identify and assess key challenges to resolvability under the Bankruptcy 

Code (Title I plans).  The Title I plans will help to focus firm efforts to mitigate those challenges
