systemic impact from the failure of a systemically important bank, as compared to the probable 

systemic impact from the failure of a large, but not systemically important, bank.  However, the 

surcharge levels ultimately agreed to by the Basel Committee were toward the low end of the 

range suggested by this analysis.  The levels included in the proposed rule are more in the middle 

of that range and thus higher than the Basel surcharges.  As suggested in an economic impact 

analysis undertaken by Basel Committee members, this higher level of surcharges should 

provide substantial net economic benefits by reducing the risks of destabilizing failures of very 

large banking organizations.  The proposed rule would also take into account a firm’s relative 

dependence on short-term wholesale funding, a source of systemic vulnerability to which I will 

return a bit later in these remarks.  During the transition period for implementation of the G-SIB 

surcharges (as modified following the notice and comment process), the affected firms will 

presumably be considering whether they wish to reduce or alter the range, amount, or types of 

their activities so as to place themselves in a lower “risk bucket,” with a concomitantly lower 

capital surcharge. 

A second kind of post-crisis regulatory reform with a macroprudential influence is the 

new set of quantitative liquidity requirements, including the now-adopted liquidity coverage ratio 

(LCR) and the internationally agreed-upon net stable funding ratio (NSFR) soon to be considered 

for adoption by U.S. banking regulators.  Having just recently given an entire speech on the 

subject, I will note here only that both the LCR and the NSFR--along with the Federal Reserve’s 

annual Comprehensive Liquidity Assessment and Review--were motivated by the systemic 

liquidity squeeze experienced during the crisis.  Even though the LCR, for example, is 

principally microprudential in design, it still reflects macroprudential concerns, as in its 

exclusion of deposits with other banks from the set of assets that qualify as highly liquid.  And,
