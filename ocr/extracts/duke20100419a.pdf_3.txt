our concerns overlap with those of economic development professionals: small business lending, 

commercial real estate, and workforce development.     

Small Business Lending 

 This year I have been asked about the tightening of credit for small businesses more 

often than any other topic.  Many audiences, including economists, community bankers, and the 

Congress are enormously concerned about the issue.  Not surprisingly, the success of small 

businesses is important to economic developers as well.  Small businesses employ nearly 40 

percent of the private sector workforce, making them a key component of the job market and a 

building block of the economy.  The health of state and local economies is directly tied to the 

opportunity for small businesses to prosper. 

Despite the best efforts of bankers and regulators, small businesses are still finding it 

difficult to obtain credit.  A recent study conducted by the National Federation of Independent 

Business (NFIB) found that only about half of the small employers who attempted to borrow in 

2009 received all the credit they wanted.  Nearly one-quarter received no credit at all.  A similar 

study in 2005 found nearly 90 percent of small employers had most or all their credit needs met, 

and only 8 percent obtained no credit.  Even though conditions in financial markets have 

continued to improve this year, access to credit remains restricted for many smaller businesses.  

Several factors are contributing to the reduced supply of bank loans.  For instance, in 

response to an increase in the number of delinquent and nonperforming loans, many banks have 

reduced existing lines of credit sharply and have tightened their standards and terms for new 

credit.  In other cases, banks whose capital has been eroded by losses or who have limited access 

to capital markets may be reducing risk assets to improve their capital positions, especially amid 

continued uncertainty about the economic outlook and possible future loan losses.
