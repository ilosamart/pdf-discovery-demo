to raise policy rates during its recovery period, unlike many other Latin American central

These developments underscore an important point--that while central banks may 

benefit from coordination and cooperation, taking the same policy stance at the same time 

typically will not be the best choice for all central banks.  Accordingly, it is imperative 

for each central bank to have monetary policy tools to appropriately address domestic 

objectives independent of the actions of other central banks.     

Conclusion 
 

In this age of global financial integration, the Federal Reserve and other central 

banks often must cooperate to achieve their individual mandates.  This need for 

coordination has been especially true during the recent crisis, when the actions of central 

banks working together proved very helpful in easing financial strains and boosting 

confidence.  Indeed, closer ties and more-open lines of communication across central 

banks are some positive outcomes of these difficult times.  This spirit of cooperation 

should continue as our respective central banks work to pursue monetary policies 

appropriate for our own economies while supporting stable financial systems around the 

world.
