over the medium term.  Employment growth last year averaged a solid 230,000 per 

month, and the unemployment rate declined from 5.6 percent to 5.0 percent over the 

course of 2015--and declined further to 4.9 percent last month.  This is close to the 

unemployment rate generally regarded as the full employment rate of unemployment.  

Inflation ran well below our target last year, held down by the transitory effects of 

declines in crude oil prices and also in the prices of non-oil imports.  Prices for these 

goods have fallen further and as you all know, for longer than expected.  Once these oil 

and import prices stop falling and level out, their effects on inflation will dissipate, which 

is the main reason we expect that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term, 

supported by a further strengthening in labor market conditions. 

Of course, with the federal funds target now at between 25 and 50 basis points, 

and the effective federal funds rate currently almost at the center of that target range, our 

monetary policy remains accommodative.  And, at the time of our January decision, my 

colleagues and I anticipated that economic conditions would evolve in a manner 

warranting only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate 

would likely remain, for some time, below the levels that we expect to prevail in the 

longer run.  I should emphasize, however, that that was an expectation, not a decision, 

and our future policy actions are by no means predetermined. 

During the years in which we held the federal funds rate near zero, the Federal 

Reserve also engaged in large-scale asset purchases to further ease financial conditions 

and promote economic recovery.  Consequently, the Federal Reserveâ€™s balance sheet 

grew from less than $1 trillion in mid-2008 to $4.5 trillion by late 2014.  As a result of 

the size of our balance sheet, the FOMC is employing new tools to implement monetary
