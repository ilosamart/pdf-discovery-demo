and monetary policy.  Our featured panel of national and community leaders moderated 

by President Rosengren will I’m sure offer valuable perspectives about how the monetary 

levers we pull and push affect communities, credit availability, and small businesses. 

Aside from being an intellectually stimulating two days, how does this week’s 

conference fit into the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications?  Let me describe briefly how the review is structured.  Over the past 

several months, the individual Reserve Banks have been hosting a series of Fed Listens 

events—seven so far including this conference—with at least five more to follow in 

coming months.  Each event is organized with a format and list of participants that works 

best for that District but with two common elements:  that Fed officials do most of the 

listening and that, when feasible, the events be live streamed.  In Dallas, we heard from 

local leaders about the challenges facing lower-income communities.  In Minneapolis, we 

listened to researchers discuss the distributional consequences of the economic cycle and 

of monetary policy.  In Boston, we heard from small businesses, labor leaders, and 

groups that work in underserved communities about the effects of the Fed’s policymaking 

on New England residents.  In Camden, New Jersey, we learned about the workforce 

training initiatives of a local manufacturing firm.  In Richmond, a panel of local business 

and community leaders discussed the ways the Fed’s monetary policy affects the regional 

economy.  In New York, panelists representing labor, local government, and community 

organizations offered their perspectives on the relative importance of the Fed’s dual 

mandate goals.  As I and my Fed colleagues who have participated in these events will 

attest, they have provided us with valuable perspectives on the economy that we would 

not otherwise be able to glean from aggregate economic statistics.
