here at Jackson Hole in August 2007, with a few notable exceptions, was fairly optimistic 

about the possible economic fallout from the stresses apparent in the financial system.4  

As we now know, the deterioration of liquidity and solvency within the financial 

sector continued over the next 13 months.  Accumulating strains across the financial 

system, including the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, made it clear that 

vulnerabilities had risen across the system.  As a result, policymakers took extraordinary 

measures:  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sharply cut the federal funds 

rate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other 

agencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to 

the modern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in 

the 19th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5  Still, the 

deterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing 

in early September.6

Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at https://www.stlouisfed.org/financial-crisis/full-timeline.  The failure 

of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is marked by the decision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) 

to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in government conservatorship on September 7, 2008.  Links to 

documents outlining the actions taken around this time are available on the FHFA’s website at
