good reasons to believe that commodity prices will not continue to rise at the rapid rates 

we have seen recently.  In the short run, unexpected shortfalls in the supplies of key 

commodities result in sharp price increases, as usage patterns and available supplies are 

difficult to change quickly.  Over longer periods, however, high levels of commodity 

prices curtail demand as households and firms adjust their spending and production 

patterns.  Indeed, as I noted earlier, we have already seen significant reductions in 

commodity use in the advanced economies.  Likewise, over time, high prices should elicit 

meaningful increases in supply, both as temporary factors, such as adverse weather, abate 

and as investments in productive capacity come to fruition.  Finally, because expectations 

of higher prices lead financial market participants to bid up the spot prices of 

commodities, predictable future developments bearing on the demands for and supplies 

of commodities tend already to be reflected in current prices.  For these reasons, although 

unexpected developments could certainly lead to continued volatility in global 

commodity prices, it is reasonable to expect the effects of commodity prices on overall 

inflation to be relatively moderate in the medium term. 

While supply and demand fundamentals surely account for most of the recent 

movements in commodity prices, some observers have attributed a significant portion of 

the run-up in prices to Federal Reserve policies, over and above the effects of those 

policies on U.S. economic growth.  For example, some have argued that accommodative 

U.S. monetary policy has driven down the foreign exchange value of the dollar, thereby 

boosting the dollar price of commodities.  Indeed, since February 2009, the trade-

weighted dollar has fallen by about 15 percent.  However, since February 2009, oil prices 

have risen 160 percent and nonfuel commodity prices are up by about 80 percent,
