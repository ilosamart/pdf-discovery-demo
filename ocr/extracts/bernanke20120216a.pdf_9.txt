examiners and senior bank managers to discuss examination results, and written reports 

with narratives and metrics describing the examiners’ findings.  If necessary, of course, 

examiners may require actions by the bank to remedy specific problems.   

These examinations, in combination with work we undertake between 

examinations, are critical for promoting safety and soundness while enhancing our 

understanding of the condition of individual banks and the banking system as a whole.  

We know, however, that supervision imposes costs on institutions.  In particular, we

disproportionate costs on community banks, which have smaller staffs and less-elaborate 

information systems than larger banking organizations.  Thus, we take quite seriously the 

importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of new rules. 

As I have noted, the comparative advantage of community bankers is that they 

know and work with their communities and customers in ways that may not be possible 

for larger, more distant institutions.  We tailor our examination and supervision to the 

size, complexity, risk profile, and business model of each institution.  For community 

banks in particular, our examiners are expected to take local market conditions into 

account when assessing a bank’s management and credit decisions.  The Federal
