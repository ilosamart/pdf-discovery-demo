capital markets activities be covered by local capital requirements consistent with Basel III.  But 

neither in the United States nor the European Union do the GSIB capital surcharges imposed at 

the consolidated level apply to foreign banking operations in their jurisdictions.7  So even if the 

global bank has local capital requirements for most or all of its foreign operations, the parent still 

has some flexibility as to where the additional capital buffer can be maintained.  More generally, 

our requirements for other prudential regulations applicable to foreign banking organizations 

(FBOs) are calibrated to the relative importance of the FBOs in the U.S. financial system.  Thus 

the structure of surcharges also help to create a good mechanism for balancing host country 

interests in assuring financial stability and in realizing the benefits that can come from global 

banking.   

Even with good standards, regulators in host jurisdictions will want assurance that these 

standards are being rigorously implemented and enforced.  The relative opaqueness of bank 

balance sheets makes capital, liquidity, and other common banking regulations difficult to 

monitor effectively.  This argues for complementing fairly complex regulation that seeks to track 

the often-complex activities of large banks with simpler regulations, such as the leverage ratio 

and a standardized risk-weighted capital floor.  But it also argues for existing international fora 

such as the Basel Committee and the FSB to provide effective monitoring mechanisms.  Even 

with higher standards in place, supervisors in home and host jurisdictions will still face 

challenges in assessing cross-jurisdiction vulnerabilities.  More regular sharing of information 

and assessments among home and key host jurisdictions both formally and informally should be 

high on our shared agenda.
