everyone if the recovery in the advanced economies falls short.  Likewise, large and 

persistent imbalances in current accounts represent a growing financial and economic 

risk. 

Second, the current system leads to uneven burdens of adjustment among 

countries, with those countries that allow substantial flexibility in their exchange rates 

bearing the greatest burden (for example, in having to make potentially large and rapid 

adjustments in the scale of export-oriented industries) and those that resist appreciation 

bearing the least. 

Third, countries that maintain undervalued currencies may themselves face 

important costs at the national level, including a reduced ability to use independent 

monetary policies to stabilize their economies and the risks associated with excessive or 

volatile capital inflows.  The latter can be managed to some extent with a variety of tools, 

including various forms of capital controls, but such approaches can be difficult to 

implement or lead to microeconomic distortions.  The high levels of reserves associated 

with currency undervaluation may also imply significant fiscal costs if the liabilities 

issued to sterilize reserves bear interest rates that exceed those on the reserve assets 

themselves.  Perhaps most important, the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to 

deliver higher living standards at home; thus, eventually, the benefits of shifting 

productive resources to satisfying domestic needs must outweigh the development 

benefits of continued reliance on export-led growth.
