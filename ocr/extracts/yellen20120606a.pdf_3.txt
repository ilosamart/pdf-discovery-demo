gap is likely to close only slowly.  At the same time, inflation (abstracting from the transitory 

effects of movements in oil prices) has been running near 2 percent over the past two years, and I 

expect it to remain at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (the FOMC’s) 2 percent 

objective for the foreseeable future.  As always, considerable uncertainty attends the outlook for 

both growth and inflation; events could prove either more positive or negative than what I see as 

the most likely outcome.  That said, as I will explain, I consider the balance of risks to be tilted 

toward a weaker economy.    

Starting with the labor market, conditions have gradually improved over the past year, 

albeit at an uneven pace.  Average monthly payroll gains picked up from about 145,000 in the 

second half of 2011 to 225,000 during the first quarter of this year.  However, these gains fell 

back to around 75,000 a month in April and May.  The deceleration of payroll employment from 

the first to the second quarter was probably exacerbated by some combination of seasonal 

adjustment difficulties and an unusually mild winter that likely boosted employment growth 

earlier in the year.  Payback for that earlier strength probably accounts for some of the weakness 

we’ve seen recently.  Smoothing through these fluctuations, the average pace of job creation for 

the year to date, as well as recent unemployment benefit claims data and other indicators, appear 

to be consistent with an economy expanding at only a moderate rate, close to its potential. 

Such modest growth would imply little additional progress in the near term in improving 

labor market conditions, which remain very weak.  Currently, the unemployment rate stands 

around 3 percentage points above where it was at the onset of the recession--a figure that is stark 

enough as it is, but does not even take account of the millions more who have left the labor force 

or who would have joined under more normal circumstances in the past four years.  All told, 

only about half of the collapse in private payroll employment in 2008 and 2009 has been
