want to be sure that we are aware of all the latest research on the effectiveness of the CRA and 

what the research has to say about potential regulatory improvements.  Today’s conversation is 

an opportunity not only to hear from external academic researchers, but also to have a robust 

conversation with practitioners about how this research might inform the Board’s work.  This
