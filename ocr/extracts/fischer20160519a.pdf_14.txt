2. The basic model.  MWIP is innovative and impressive.  In almost every 

analysis, it uses a small DSGE model, with variations in assumptions to deal 

with the topic in hand.  Here follows a typical three equation model, 

consisting of log-linear approximations of the non-linear equilibrium 

conditions of an underlying model that includes an intertemporal Euler 

equation, a New Keynesian Phillips curve, and an interest rate rule.13 

𝑥𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 𝑥𝑡+1 −  𝜎(𝑖̂𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1 −  �̂�𝑡
𝑛)                                              (1) 

𝜋𝑡 =  𝜅𝑥𝑡 + 𝛽𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1                                                                         (2) 

𝑖̂𝑡 = 𝑖�̅� + 𝜙𝜋(𝜋𝑡 − �̅�) + 𝜙𝑥(𝑥𝑡 − �̅�)/4                                              (3) 

where 

𝑥𝑡 is the output gap, �̂�𝑡 − �̂�𝑡
𝑛; 

�̂�𝑡
𝑛 is an exogenous variable, representing variations in the natural rate of 

output; 

𝜋𝑡 is the rate of inflation; 

𝑖̂𝑡 is the interest rate; 

𝑖�̅� is an exogenous, possibly time-varying, intercept of the Taylor Rule. 

3. Analyzing Monetary Policy without Money.  One of Woodford’s most 

interesting results is that it is often possible to study monetary policy without 

having money in the model.  In these cases, monetary policy is conducted 

using the interest rate as the monetary policy instrument.  As Woodford notes 

in Chapter 4, “A Neo-Wicksellian Framework”, a money demand equation 

                                                 
13 These are equations (1.12), (1.13), and (1.14), respectively, in chapter 4, which appear on page 246 of 

MWIP, the derivation of which is discussed on pp. 243-45.
