forcing banks to hold low-return safe assets instead of lending, net interest margins 

suffer.  The purpose of the Federal Reserve’s policy of low interest rates is to speed the 

economic recovery, which will increase loan demand and opportunities for profitable 

lending, among many other benefits, and thus, ultimately, lead to higher net interest 

margins.  In short, it is necessary to set the negative effects on net interest margins 

against the positive effects of a strengthening economic and lending environment.  

Moreover, the benefits of a stronger economy for the performance of existing assets 

should also be taken into account; as you know, delinquencies decline as the economy 

improves.  Putting all these considerations together, in the longer term the overall effect 

on bank profitability of an appropriately accommodative monetary policy is almost 

certainly positive.   

Outreach and Communication with Community Banks 

I think we would all agree that two-way communication between regulators and 

community banks is critical.  The Fed and other bank supervisors, at both the state and 

federal levels, must clearly communicate their supervisory policies and expectations to 

banks, but they also must listen to and understand banks’ concerns.  For the Federal 

Reserve in particular, community banks not only provide insights into their industry, but 

they are also an unmatched source of crucial grassroots information about developments 

in the economy as a whole, which is necessary for effective monetary policy. 

At the Federal Reserve, we pursue our dialogue with community bankers through 

many channels.  One such channel is the recently established Community Depository
