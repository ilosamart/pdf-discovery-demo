concentration of counterparty exposures, and risk management.  But, I would say in conclusion, 

capital requirements are integral to both microprudential and macroprudential regulation.  They 

are the foundation upon which much other regulation is built.

2011 Credit Markets Symposium, Charlotte, North Carolina, March; Daniel K. Tarullo (2010), "Comments on 
‘Regulating the Shadow Banking System,' " remarks delivered at the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, 
Washington, September. 
ii Two examples of these complexities are that placing a financial firm into a resolution process in one country could 
trigger cross-default clauses or induce ring-fencing of assets in other jurisdictions 
iii One such measure is “CoVaR”:  The prefix “Co” in front of the conventional abbreviation for value-at-risk is 
meant to refer to the co-movement of losses for a particular firm with those of the system as a whole.  See  Tobias 
Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2009), “CoVar.”  Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 348.   
Another is “Marginal Expected Shortfall,” which predicts how much the stock of a specific financial firm will 
decline in a day relative to an overall market decline.  See Viral V. Acharya, Lasse H. Pedersen, Thomas Philippon, 
and Matthew Richardson (2010).  “Measuring Systemic Risk”.  Working Paper, New York University Stern School 
of Business. 
iv As I have noted in prior speeches, there is a real need for a program of research into this question of the 
efficiencies of scope and scale in the financial services industry, as well as the relationship of industry structure to 
systemic risk. 
v The key problem revolves around the trigger for conversion.  A trigger that was directly or indirectly exercised at 
the discretion of regulators would not necessarily be regarded by markets as predictable, but a trigger tied to a 
market measure could lead to a variety of unintended manipulative trading opportunities – including, in a worst case, 
a so-called death spiral. 
vi In any case, it is absolutely clear that “bail-in” contingent capital – which converts at the point of non-viability of a 
firm in order to facilitate orderly resolution – would not be an acceptable substitute for common equity. 
vii By setting the threshold for these standards at firms with assets of at least $50 billion, well below the level that 
anyone would believe describes a TBTF firm, Congress has avoided the creation of a de facto list of TBTF firms.
