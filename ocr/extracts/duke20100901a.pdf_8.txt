The complexities of the secondary mortgage market have made it difficult for local 

governments and community organizations to ascertain who owns a particular property, much 

less arrange for its purchase in a timely way.  The pooling of mortgages in securities further 

complicates the process, making it difficult for municipalities to acquire one or two properties 

among many.  Several articles in our publication discuss the challenges of using NSP funds, 

particularly in a competitive environment where investors have the resources to purchase 

properties in bulk without the constraints related to neighborhood stabilization plans.   

Craig Nickersonâ€™s article, for example, describes the efforts of the National Community 

Stabilization Trust (NCST), which was established to create local capacity so that communities 

could effectively acquire, manage, rehabilitate, and sell foreclosed properties.  Despite a slow 

start, NCST now has transactional expertise, development infrastructure, asset management 

skills, land banking approaches, and the comprehensive planning necessary to effectively utilize 

NSP funds for REO acquisition.  I also commend the article by Stergios (Terry) Theologides, 

which serves as a primer on servicing arrangements, the fiduciary relationship between servicers 

and investors, and the imbedded incentives that drive servicer decisionmaking.  It is a cogent 

explanation of a complex set of relationships that are key to better understanding and negotiating 

the intricacies of REO acquisition.        

The second important lesson learned in working with communities to effectively put NSP 

dollars to work is that good data are necessary to target scarce resources.  The funds provided 

under NSP, while substantial, are not nearly sufficient to tackle the entire inventory of vacant 

and abandoned homes.  But the strategic use of these funds can help to stabilize individual 

neighborhoods.
