Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the 

challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of 

the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.8 percent 

in March, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is 

currently operating beyond full employment.  However, the level of the unemployment 

rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be 

estimated.  The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current 

level of the unemployment rate.  For example, in the February Blue Chip economic 

outlook survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 

10 respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10 

respondents.8 

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by an 

increase in labor force participation, with especially pronounced gains for individuals in 

their prime working years.9  These increases in participation have provided employers 

with a significant source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining 

inflationary pressures.  As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will 

continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain. 

                                                 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the 
level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in 
these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low 
and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in 
determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.

Market?” in the Board’s February 2018 Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of some indicators 
that can be used to assess labor market tightness; see Board of Governors (2018a, pp. 8-9).

Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for 
prime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8-10).
