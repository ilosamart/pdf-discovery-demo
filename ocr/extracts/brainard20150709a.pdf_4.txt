designed to lower their probability of “material financial distress or failure” in order “to prevent 

or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.5   

The proposed capital surcharge is the regulatory requirement that is most clearly 

calibrated to the size and complexity of an institution. Last December, the Board proposed a 

framework of risk-based capital surcharges for the eight U.S. banking organizations identified as 

global systemically important banks by the Financial Stability Board.  The capital surcharges 

under the proposal are estimated to range from 1.0 percent to 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets 

based on 2013 data. The capital surcharge would be required over and above the 7 percent 

minimum and capital conservation buffer required for all banking organizations under Basel III, 

and in addition to any countercyclical capital buffer.  

The capital surcharge is designed to build additional resilience and lessen the chances of 

an institution’s failure in proportion to the risks posed by the institution to the financial system 

and broader economy.  The surcharge is calibrated so that the expected costs to the system from 

the failure of a systemic banking institution are equal to the expected costs from the failure of a 

sizeable but not-systemic banking organization.  In other words, if the failure of a systemic 

banking institution would have five times the system-wide costs as the failure of a sizeable but 

not-systemic banking organization, the systemic banking institution would be required to hold 

enough additional capital that the probability of its failure would be one-fifth as high. The capital 

surcharge should help ensure that the senior management and the boards of the largest, most 

complex institutions take into account the risks their activities pose to the system.
