associated with a relatively early recovery from the Depression by the United Kingdom, 

in part because of some rebound in exports.  However, according to this view, the gains 

to the depreciating country were equaled or exceeded by the losses to its trading partners, 

which became less internationally competitive--hence, “beggar thy neighbor.”  Over 

time, so-called competitive depreciations became associated in the minds of historians 

with the tariff wars that followed the passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff in the United 

States.  Both types of policies were decried--and in some textbooks, still are--as having 

prolonged the Depression by disrupting trade patterns while leading to an ultimately 

fruitless and destructive battle over shrinking international markets. 

Economists still agree that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing tariff wars were highly 

counterproductive and contributed to the depth and length of the global Depression.  

However, modern research on the Depression, beginning with the seminal 1985 paper by 

Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs, has changed our view of the effects of the 

abandonment of the gold standard.6  Although it is true that leaving the gold standard and 

the resulting currency depreciation conferred a temporary competitive advantage in some 

cases, modern research shows that the primary benefit of leaving gold was that it freed 

countries to use appropriately expansionary monetary policies.  By 1935 or 1936, when 

essentially all major countries had left the gold standard and exchange rates were market-

determined, the net trade effects of the changes in currency values were certainly small.  

Yet the global economy as a whole was much stronger than it had been in 1931.  The 

reason was that, in shedding the strait jacket of the gold standard, each country became 

free to use monetary policy in a way that was more commensurate with achieving full
