financial apps that provide “free” services earn revenue by being paid for lead generation.  

Other apps may sell consumer data in ways that consumers may not be aware of.46  For

draw emergency funds as an advance on their paycheck.  

While financial innovation may hold great promise, a lot of work is needed to
