any signs of liquidity strains associated with the recent increases in spreads for high-yield 

corporate bonds, as well as for idiosyncratic events affecting particular funds in this 

segment, such as the events surrounding the abrupt closing of Third Avenue 

Managementâ€™s Focused Credit Fund last December.   

More broadly, the regulatory agencies in the United States and the Financial 

Stability Board internationally have work under way focusing on possible fire-sale risk 

associated with the growing share of less liquid bonds held in asset management 

portfolios on behalf of investors who may be counting on same-day redemption when 

valuations fall.  The recent proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 

to ensure mutual funds have ample liquidity buffers under stressed scenarios and 

undertake measures to address the risk of heavy redemptions and fire sales is notable in 

this regard.  Our surveillance will continue to undertake more granular analysis of 

liquidity resilience and associated risks. 

Across financial markets, it is difficult to disentangle the effects on liquidity of 

changes in technology and market structure and changes in broker-dealer risk-

management practices in the wake of the crisis on the one hand and enhanced regulation 

on the other.  While the leverage ratio and other Dodd-Frank Act requirements likely are 

encouraging broker-dealers to be more rigorous about risk management in allocating 

balance sheet capacity to certain trading activities, the growing presence of proprietary 

firms using algorithmic trading in many of these markets, which predated the crisis, is 

also influencing trading dynamics in important ways.14  The Request for Information
