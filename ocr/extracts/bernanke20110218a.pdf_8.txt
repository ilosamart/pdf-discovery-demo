fiscal policies, and macroprudential measures.  Finally, it should be borne in mind that 

spillovers can go both ways.  For example, resurgent demand in the emerging markets 

has contributed significantly to the sharp recent run-up in global commodity prices.  

More generally, the maintenance of undervalued currencies by some countries has 

contributed to a pattern of global spending that is unbalanced and unsustainable.  Such 

imbalances include those not only between emerging markets and advanced economies, 

but also among the emerging market economies themselves, as those countries that have 

allowed their exchange rates to be determined primarily by market forces have seen their 

competitiveness erode relative to countries that have intervened more aggressively in 

foreign exchange markets.     

Our collective challenge is to reshape the international monetary system to foster 

strong, sustainable growth and improve economic outcomes for all nations.  Working 

together, we need to clarify and strengthen the rules of the game, with an eye toward 

creating an international system that more effectively supports the simultaneous pursuit 

of internal and external balance.  To achieve a more balanced international system over 

time, countries with excessive and unsustainable trade surpluses will need to allow their 

exchange rates to better reflect market fundamentals and increase their efforts to 

substitute domestic demand for exports.  At the same time, countries with large, 

persistent trade deficits must find ways to increase national saving, including putting 

fiscal policies on a more sustainable trajectory.  In addition, to bolster our individual and 

collective ability to manage and productively invest capital inflows, we must continue to 

increase the efficiency, transparency, and resiliency of our national financial systems and 

to strengthen financial regulation and oversight.
