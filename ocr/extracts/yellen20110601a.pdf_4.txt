investors holding assets which entail exposure to greater credit risk may not fully appreciate, or 

demand proper compensation for, potential losses.  Finally, investors may seek to boost returns 

by employing additional leverage, which can amplify interest rate and credit risk as well as make 

exposures less transparent. 

 One of the lessons of the financial crisis was that the potential adverse effects of a rapid 

unwinding of financial imbalances, regardless of the causes, are significantly increased if market 

participants employ significant leverage.  In the extreme, changes in investor sentiment can lead 

to a withdrawal of liquidity, rapid declines in mark-to-market values, forced asset sales in the 

face of margin calls, and, ultimately, a rapid and disorderly self-reinforcing deleveraging.  Such 

painful outcomes are more likely when financing mechanisms are opaque, when intermediation 

occurs without an effective liquidity backstop, when assets are less liquid, and when financial 

leverage is layered on top of structural leverage.3 

These dynamics were evident during the financial crisis.  Before the crisis, market 

participants grew comfortable with borrowing collateralized by a variety of less-liquid assets, 

sometimes using structured investment vehicles (SIVs), conduits, and other off-balance-sheet 

structures.  Directly or indirectly, market participants used short-term funding that needed to be 

renewed almost continually but lacked a formal liquidity backstop (although, in some cases, such 

support was seen by market participants as implicit).  Further, much of the financing--through 

repurchase agreements (repos), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and other mechanisms--was 

collateralized by securities that already embedded significant structural leverage.   

This layering of leverage had profound consequences when sentiment changed.  Lenders 

who had financed securities, either directly in the repo market or through structured vehicles,

small changes in risk factors.
