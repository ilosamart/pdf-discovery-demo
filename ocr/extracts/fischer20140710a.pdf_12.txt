was available at an extremely low interest rate.  The term-structure was relatively steep, 

so that the requirement that the remaining two-thirds of any financing package had to be 

indexed to a five-year rate--whether real or nominal--made a substantial difference to the 

cost of housing finance.  In addition, increases in both LTV and PTI ratios were 

moderately effective.  However, increasing capital charges had very little impact in 

practice.   

There are three key lessons from this experience.  First, the Bank of Israel did not 

have good empirical estimates of the effectiveness of the different macroprudential 

measures. 19  This problem is likely to be relevant in many countries in large part because 

we have relatively little experience of the use of such measures in recent years.20  

Policymakers may thus be especially cautious in the use of measures of this type.   

Second, measures aimed at reducing the demand for housing are likely to be 

politically sensitive.21  Their use requires either very cautious and well-aimed measures 

by the regulatory authorities, and/or the use by the government of subsidies to 

compensate some of those who end up facing more difficulty in buying housing as a 

result of the imposition of macroprudential measures.  Indeed, it often appears that there 

19 Typically the impact was calculated based on an estimate of how much a measure would increase the 
effective interest rate paid by the borrower, but this calculation generally resulted in an overestimate of the 
impact of the policy change.   
20 Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert (2013) present empirical results on the use of macroprudential (sense 2) 
measures in the United States, but their results are at too high a level of aggregation to be useful in making 
decisions on the deployment of specific supervisory or regulatory measures.  The literature is growing.  For 
example, Kuttner and Shim examine the effects of actions in 57 countries since the 1980s on house prices 
and housing credit growth.  See Kenneth N. Kuttner and Ilhyock Shim (2013), “Can Non-Interest Rate 
Policies Stabilise Housing Markets?  Evidence from a Panel of 57 Economies,” Bank for International 
Settlements working paper no. 433 (Basel: BIS, November), www.bis.org/publ/work433.htm. 
21 This is a general problem but is particularly the case in the Israeli context where the bulk of the male 
population is conscripted into the armed forces for three years at a relatively low salary, and there is a 
general view that young couples deserve to be able to buy an apartment when they marry.
