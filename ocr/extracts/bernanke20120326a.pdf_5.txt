the jobs shortfall is even larger, of course, when increases in the size of the labor force 

are taken into account.  And the unemployment rate in February was still roughly 3 

percentage points above its average over the 20 years preceding the recession.  Moreover, 

a significant portion of the improvement in the labor market has reflected a decline in 

layoffs rather than an increase in hiring.   

This last observation is illustrated by the data on gross job flows (figure 7).  The 

monthly increase in payroll employment, which commands so much public attention, is a 

net change.  It equals the number of hires during the month less the number of 

separations (including layoffs, quits, and other separations).  In any given month, a large 

number of workers are being hired or are leaving their current jobs, illustrating the 

dynamism of the U.S. labor market.  For example, between 2001 and 2007, private 

employers hired nearly 5 million people, on average, each month.  Total separations, on 

average, were only slightly smaller.  Taking the difference between gross hires and 

separations, the net monthly change in payrolls during this period was, on average, less 

than 100,000 jobs per month--a small figure compared to the gross flows. 

The recent history of these flows suggests that further improvement in the labor 

market will likely need to come from a shift to a more robust pace of hiring.  As figure 7 

shows, the declines in aggregate payrolls during the recession stemmed from both a 

reduction in hiring and a large increase in layoffs.  In contrast, the increase in 

employment since the end of 2009 has been due to a significant decline in layoffs but 

only a moderate improvement in hiring.  To achieve a more rapid recovery in the job 

market, hiring rates will need to return to more normal levels.
