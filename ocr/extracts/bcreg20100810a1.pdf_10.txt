 Alternatively, the agencies could consider an approach for debt securities similar 
to that adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, under which a 
third party financial assessor would inform the agencies' understanding of risks and their 
ultimate determination of the risk-based capital requirement for individual securities.19  
One potential drawback of this approach is excessive reliance on a single third-party 
assessment of risk.  

 Regardless of the approach used, the agencies would establish strict quantitative 
and qualitative criteria to ensure that the methodology employed is consistent with safe 
and sound banking practices.   

 Question 2:  What are the advantages and disadvantages for each of these general 
approaches?  What, if any, combination of the approaches would appropriately reflect 
exposure categories and the sophistication of individual banking organizations?  What 
other approaches do commenters believe would meet the agencies’ suggested criteria for 
a credit-worthiness standard?  If increasing reliance is placed on banking organizations to 
assign risk weights for credit exposures using the types of approaches described above, 
how would the agencies ensure consistency of capital treatment for similar exposures?  
How could the use of third-party providers be implemented to ensure quality, 
transparency, and consistency?  

c. Exposure-specific options for measuring credit-worthiness 

 The broad approaches discussed above could be applied in various ways across 
the agencies risk-based capital rules as well as existing exposure categories.  While the 
range of approaches is potentially applicable to all exposure categories, the sections 
below provide a more detailed discussion of how the approaches might be implemented 
by exposure categories.   

i. Sovereign Exposures 

 The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules risk weight exposures to sovereign 
entities based on membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD).20  However, under the Basel standardized approach, a banking 
organization would assign a risk weight to a sovereign exposure based on the external 
credit rating of the sovereign by a credit rating agency.21  The current market risk rule 
and the Basel modified market risk framework also make use of ratings for sovereign 
exposures.      

 There are several alternative methodologies that could be used to risk weight 
sovereign exposures that have different implications for risk sensitivity.  One option
