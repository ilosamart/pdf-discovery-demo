investment in the production and installation of drilling equipment mitigated the blessing, 

as did the decline in U.S. oil production. 

And there have been other issues of concern to those particularly interested in 

monetary and macroeconomic policy, though probably of less explicit concern to the 

public:  The decline in estimates of r*--the neutral interest rate that neither boosts nor 

slows the economy--which is related to the fear that we are facing a prolonged period of 

secular stagnation; the associated concerns that (a) the short-term interest rate will be 

constrained by its effective lower bound a greater percentage of time in the future than in 

the past, and (b) that the U.S. economy could find itself having to contend at some point 

with negative interest rates--something that the Fed has no plans to introduce; the fear 

that very low interest rates present a threat to financial stability; and concerns that low 

rates of real wage growth are increasing inequality in the distribution of income. 

Primarily, I believe it is a remarkable, and perhaps underappreciated, achievement 

that the economy has returned to near-full employment in a relatively short time after the 

Great Recession, given the historical experience following a financial crisis.2  To be sure, 

it was a slow and difficult time for many, in part because growth in real gross domestic 

product (GDP) has been slow by historical standards.  As can be seen in table 1, part of 

the slower output growth was due to smaller increases in aggregate hours worked, 

primarily reflecting demographic factors such as the aging of the baby-boom generation.  

But, as shown in table 2, there was also a major decline in the rate of productivity 

growth--to which I will return shortly.
