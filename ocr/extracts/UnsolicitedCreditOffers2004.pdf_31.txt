appearing on the report used for prescreening are individuals’ requests for copies of their 
own reports. 

About 80 percent of the individuals in the sample had a record in their credit file of one 
or more inquiries over the past year; about 11 percent of the individuals had six or more 
inquiries. Available evidence suggests that the number of inquiries recorded in an 
individual’s credit record is largely unrelated to propensity to opt out of further 
prescreened solicitations. For example, 7.9 percent of those who had more than six 
inquiries recorded in their file over the past year opted out, compared with about 7.4 
percent of the individuals with no record of an inquiry over this period. 

LOCATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO OPT OUT 

Information in the sample data on place of residence allows examination of the 
propensity to opt out by region of the country and by state. By region (Northeast, 
Midwest, South, and West, each also with subregions), the sample data indicate little 
difference in the propensity to opt out. Individuals residing in the West have the highest 
incidence of opting out (7 percent), and those residing in the South have the lowest (5.7 
percent). Among the subregions, the West North Central and Mountain areas have the 
highest opt out rate (about 8 percent of the individuals with credit records) and the East 
South Central and West South Central areas have the lowest rate of opting out (5 percent 
of the individuals). As with the regions, the states vary in the propensity of individuals to 
opt out. Residents of Missouri and Colorado have the highest rate of opting out, while 
residents of West Virginia and Arkansas have the lowest rates.
