latest reading on the unemployment rate was 8.1 percent, and both we and most private-

sector economists were projecting only slow reductions in unemployment in the coming 

quarters.  Recent reports on payroll employment had also been somewhat disappointing.  

However, since the program was announced, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.8 

percentage point, and about 2.6 million payroll jobs have been added.  Looking forward, 

we will of course continue to monitor the incoming data.  As reflected in the latest 

Summary of Economic Projections and the October FOMC statement, the FOMC still 

expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move 

toward the 2 percent objective over the medium term.  If these views are supported by 

incoming information, the FOMC will likely begin to moderate the pace of purchases.  

However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions 

about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s economic outlook.  As 

before, the Committee will also continue to take into account its assessment of the likely 

efficacy and costs of the program.  

When, ultimately, asset purchases do slow, it will likely be because the economy 

has progressed sufficiently for the Committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies, the 

associated forward guidance, and its substantial continued holdings of securities to 

maintain progress toward maximum employment and to achieve price stability.18  In 

particular, the target for the federal funds rate is likely to remain near zero for a 

considerable time after the asset purchases end, perhaps well after the unemployment 

                                                 
18 By the logic described earlier, the Fed’s maintenance of a large balance sheet (by reinvesting principal 
paydowns and rolling over maturing securities) should continue to put downward pressure on term 
premiums and longer-term interest rates, even after purchases end.  Also, as I noted at my June press 
conference, a strong majority of the Committee now expects that there will be no sales of agency MBS 
during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run limited sales could be used 
to reduce or eliminate residual MBS holdings.  See Board of Governors (2013c).
