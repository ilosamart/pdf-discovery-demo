is difficult to monitor whether banks are intentionally or unintentionally running models that 

understate their risks.  And, of course, they are subject to the usual limitations of models that are 

based only on past experience and correlations.   

In the post-crisis period, we have continued the previous U.S. practice of using 

complementary leverage ratio and standardized risk-weighted capital requirements, though at 

higher levels and with more reliance on common equity as the preferred measure of true capital 

strength on a going concern basis.  We have added a stress test, now based on a supervisory 

model.  We, along with some other jurisdictions that are home to banks of global systemic 

importance (G-SIBs), have also applied surcharges to the leverage and risk-weighted 

requirements of such banks.  The rationale for this feature of our capital regime is that the 

potential negative externalities caused by the stress or failure of a G-SIB warrant a higher level 

of capital.3  Graduated capital surcharges have the additional policy benefit of providing these 

firms with an incentive to reduce the size and scope of their activities so as to present lesser risk 

to the financial system. 

 The U.S. banking agencies based post-crisis capital requirements on historical loss 

experiences so as to require banks to have a capital buffer that could absorb losses associated 

with a significant economic downturn and remain viable financial intermediaries in the eyes of 

customers, counterparties, and financial markets.4  But our researchers, like those at some other 

                                                 
3 As implemented in the United States, the surcharge for G-SIBs was calibrated to provide a sufficient amount of 
additional capital to sufficiently reduce the chances of a G-SIB’s failure so that the impact of its failure, discounted 
by the probability of that failure occurring, would approximately equal the impact of the failure of a large bank 
holding company that is not a G-SIB, discounted by the somewhat higher probability of its failure (because its 
capital ratio is lower without a surcharge).  For a fuller explanation of this “expected impact” approach, see Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Calibrating the G-SIB Surcharge,” white paper (Washington:
