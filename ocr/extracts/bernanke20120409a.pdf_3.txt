responsibility.  To an increasing extent, however, we have also been working to embed 

our supervisory practices within a broader macroprudential framework that focuses not 

only on the conditions of individual firms but also on the health of the financial system as 

a whole.   

Even before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we had begun to overhaul our 

approach to supervision to better achieve both microprudential and macroprudential 

goals.  In 2009, we created the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee--a 

high-level, multidisciplinary working group, drawing on skills and experience from 

throughout the Federal Reserve System--and charged it with overseeing the supervision 

of the most systemically important financial firms.  Through the coordinating committee, 

we have supplemented the traditional, firm-by-firm approach to supervision with a 

routine use of horizontal, or cross-firm, reviews to monitor industry practices, common 

trading and funding strategies, balance sheet developments, interconnectedness, and other 

factors with implications for systemic risk.  Drawing on the work of economists and 

financial market experts, the coordinating committee has also made increasing use of 

improved quantitative methods for evaluating the conditions of supervised firms as well 

as the risks they may pose to the broader financial system. 

 An important example of our strengthened, cross-firm supervisory approach is the 

recently completed second annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 

(CCAR).
