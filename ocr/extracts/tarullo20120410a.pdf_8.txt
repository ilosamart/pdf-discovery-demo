rate that compares to about 3.5 percent during the nine-quarter period from the fourth quarter of 

2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009 that spanned the financial crisis.   

 Notwithstanding the stringency of the stress test, only four of the nineteen firms fell 

below the 5 percent Tier 1 common ratio standard, or one of the other applicable ratios, even 

assuming that all proposed capital actions went forward during the stress period.  In passing, I 

might observe that we would expect that firms would, in fact, pare their distributions in the face 

of a severely deteriorating operating environment, but the fact that some firms failed to do so in 

2007 and 2008 has led our supervisors to make the conservative assumption that distributions 

would continue.  If proposed future capital distributions are not assumed -- that is, if the 

approach in the 2009 SCAP is taken -- only one firm falls below the required post-stress 

minimum capital ratios.   

Indeed, a comparison with the original 2009 stress test shows the degree to which the 19 

firms have improved their capital positions.  The actual aggregate Tier 1 common ratio of the 19 

firms at the end of the third quarter of 2011 (the beginning of the stress period) was about 10.1 

percent, nearly double the 5.3 percent aggregate ratio for the firms at the end of 2008 (the start of 

the stress period for SCAP).  Moreover, at 6.3 percent, the post-stress aggregate ratio under the 

2012 test would be higher than that actual aggregate capital ratio at the end of 2008, even 

assuming all proposed capital actions go forward during the stress period. 

As to qualitative conclusions from this year’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 

Review (CCAR), most of the 19 bank holding companies have made considerable progress in 

their internal capital planning processes.  However, there appears to be room for improvement at
