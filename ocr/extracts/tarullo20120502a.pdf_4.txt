 The consequences of this neglect were dramatic.  When questions arose about the quality 

of the assets on which the shadow banking system was based--notably, those tied to poorly 

underwritten subprime mortgages--a classic adverse feedback loop ensued.  With lenders 

increasingly unwilling to extend credit against these assets, liquidity-strained institutions found 

themselves forced to sell positions, which placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, 

thereby accelerating margin calls for leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for 

all holders of the assets.  The margin calls and booked losses would start another round in the 

adverse feedback loop.  

Meanwhile, as demonstrated by the intervention of the government when Bear Stearns 

and AIG were failing, and by the repercussions of Lehman Brothersâ€™ failure, the universe of 

financial firms that appeared too-big-to-fail during periods of stress included more than insured 

depository institutions and extended beyond the perimeter of traditional safety and soundness 

regulation.  The investments by the Treasury Department from the Troubled Asset Relief 

Program (TARP) and guarantees by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from the 

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to each of the nation's largest institutions in the fall of 

2008 revealed the government's view that, under then-prevailing circumstances, a very real threat 

to the nation's entire financial system was best addressed by shoring up the nation's largest 

financial firms.  

The Regulatory Response 

 This brief and highly stylized history is intended to recall that there were two major 

regulatory challenges revealed by the crisis.  First was the problem of too-big-to-fail financial 

firms, both those that had been inadequately regulated within the perimeter of prudential rules 

and those like the large, free-standing investment banks that lay outside that perimeter.  Second
