The FSB’s Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities (under the leadership 

of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank, here today) is an important forum and 

catalyst for this work.  In the months ahead, the committee will develop a new framework for the 

identification and assessment of financial vulnerabilities.  Their efforts will rely on transparent 

engagement with a wide range of stakeholders--including banks and nonbank financial 

institutions, the academic community, financial regulators, national authorities, and standard-

setting bodies.  This kind of broad outreach is essential.  The causes of financial crises rarely 

announce themselves ahead of time, and only a wide range of views can give us the perspective 

and understanding to address them in advance.  The right model for this work is not a small team 

of detectives--it is a search party.  

The FSB’s efforts on nonbank financial intermediation, which I discussed last week, 

reflect a similar approach.  Nonbank financing has grown since the financial crisis, and it has 

been a source of systemic risk, often involving high leverage, maturity and liquidity mismatches, 

opaque structures, and concentrated holdings of risky assets.  Nonbank financing can also lead to 

lower lending standards, bidding up the price of risky assets and sending an encouraging signal 

to credit underwriters.  These channels played a role in the recent global financial crisis, and 

more recently, new forms of interconnectedness between nonbank financial firms and the 

banking system have emerged.  In some scenarios, both domestically and internationally, such 

ties could amplify risks.  

These developments raise important issues.  Is the growth of nonbank financing altering 

existing market structures?  Are there new vulnerabilities in the financial system?  How will 

nonbank financing develop, and how should it do so?  The FSB is taking a variety of 

complementary approaches to answering these questions.
