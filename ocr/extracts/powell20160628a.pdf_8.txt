our own.  The risks to the global outlook were somewhat elevated even prior to the 

referendum, and the vote has introduced new uncertainties.  We have said that the Federal 

Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation 

with other central banks.  We are prepared to provide dollar liquidity through our existing 

swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding 

markets, which could have adverse implications for our economy.  Although financial 

conditions have tightened since the vote, markets have been functioning in an orderly 

manner.  And the U.S. financial sector is strong and resilient.  As our recent stress tests 

show, our largest financial institutions continue to build their capital and strengthen their 

balance sheets.   

It is far too early to judge the effects of the Brexit vote.  As the global outlook 

evolves, it will be important to assess the implications for the U.S. economy, and for the 

stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of 

maximum employment and price stability. 

I am often asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment.  

A big part of the answer is that, at least for the time being, the appropriate level of rates is 

simply lower than it was before the crisis.  As a result, policy is not as stimulative as it 

might appear to be.  Estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep the economy on an 

even keel if it were operating at 2 percent inflation and full employment--the “neutral 

rate” of interest--are currently around zero.  Today, the real short term interest rate is 

about negative 1-1/4 percent, so policy is actually only moderately stimulative.  I 

anticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that 

have weighed on economic growth ease.
