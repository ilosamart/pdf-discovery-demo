who funded their originations through securitizations and effectively retained none of the 

risk.  These lenders had little financial stake in whether the borrowers ultimately repaid 

the mortgages--sometimes known as having skin in the game--and thus had a reduced 

incentive to engage in careful underwriting. 

 The proposed rules outline a flexible menu of ways that securitizers can meet the 

risk-retention requirement.  The proposed rules also have provisions that affect the 

mortgage market in particular.  The rules recognize that the guarantees provided by 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lead them to retain 100 percent of the credit risk of the 

mortgages they securitize, and because this guarantee is currently backed by financial 

support from the government, the proposed rules do not require these government-

sponsored enterprises to retain additional risk.  Further, as required by the Dodd-Frank 

Act, the proposed rules exempt securitizations backed entirely by very high-quality 

mortgages--so-called qualified residential mortgages (QRMs)--from risk retention.  The 

act directed the regulators with rulemaking authority to define QRMs taking into account 

“underwriting and product features that historical loan performance data indicate result in 

a lower risk of default.”  To define QRMs, regulators conducted extensive research on the 

types of mortgages that have low credit risk, even in stressful economic environments.  

Under the proposed definition, a qualified residential mortgage must be a closed-end, 

first-lien mortgage to purchase or refinance a one- to four-family property.  Mortgage 

features cannot include negative amortization, interest-only payments, or the potential for 

large interest rate increases.  Debt-to-income ratios must be conservative, and the 

borrower’s credit history must be relatively clean.  Finally, the maximum loan-to-value
