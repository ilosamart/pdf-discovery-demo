basic financial planning suggestions and information about Federal Reserve resources that you 

might use as you develop and implement your own financial plans. 

Create a Personal Financial Plan 

Your attendance here today shows that you already recognize the importance of the first 

recommendation I will offer:  Create a personal financial plan.  Having a financial plan or 

strategy will help you to achieve your financial goals and increase your likelihood of being 

financially healthy in the long run. I stress that you are wise to make your financial decisions 

with an eye toward achieving long-term goals. This will help you become more financially 

secure and satisfied.  Living in the moment puts you at greater financial risk and leaves you with 

a more limited selection of financial products.   

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas offers a popular financial planning publication, 

Building Wealth.  In it, individuals and families seeking help to develop a plan for building 

personal wealth will find an overview of personal asset-building strategies that includes setting 

financial goals, budgeting, saving and investing, managing debt, and understanding credit reports 

and credit scores. The Dallas Fed makes Building Wealth available online in both English and 

Spanish, and has created an interactive version of the publication, making it usable as a personal 

finance education resource for schools, nonprofit community organizations, and financial 

services providers.4   

Another valuable online resource is the Federal Reserve Bank of San Franciscoâ€™s Guide 

to Financial Literacy. This free publication explains what level of financial education is 

appropriate for a variety of age groups, offers guidance for consumers making key financial 

decisions at different stages of life, and includes a compendium of financial education resources
