Table 2

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
at Selected Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks in the United States 1  

(Status of policy as of January 2012) 

Questions 1-6 ask about commercial and industrial (C&I) loans at your bank. Questions 1-3 deal with changes 
in your bank's lending policies over the past three months. Questions 4-5 deal with changes in demand for C&I 
loans over the past three months. Question 6 asks about changes in prospective demand for C&I loans at your 
bank, as indicated by the volume of recent inquiries about the availability of new credit lines or increases in 
existing lines. If your bank's lending policies have not changed over the past three months, please report them as 
unchanged even if the policies are either restrictive or accommodative relative to longer-term norms. If your 
bank's policies have tightened or eased over the past three months, please so report them regardless of how they 
stand relative to longer-term norms. Also, please report changes in enforcement of existing policies as changes 
in policies.

The ongoing fiscal and financial strains in Europe may have affected lending conditions for nonfinancial 
companies that have operations in the United States and significant exposure to European economies, as well as 
banks headquartered in Europe and their affiliates and subsidiaries. Question 7 deals with changes in your 
bank's lending policies toward both types of firms over the past three months. In addition, developments in 
Europe may have affected these firms' demand for credit from U.S. banks. Questions 8-9 deal with such changes 
in demand. 

In answering these questions, please consider your bank's C&I lending to all nonfinancial companies with 
operations in the United States and significant exposure to European economies (that is, please consider your 
bank's C&I loans both to European firms that are located in the United States and to domestic firms that conduct 
a significant portion of their business with European firms). With regard to banks, please consider your bank's 
lending, or extension of credit lines, to banks headquartered in Europe and to the affiliates and subsidiaries of 
European banks regardless of the location of those affiliates and subsidiaries.

loans or credit lines—other than those to be used to finance mergers and acquisitions—for the following types of
