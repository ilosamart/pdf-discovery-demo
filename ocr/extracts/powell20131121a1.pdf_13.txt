the largest and most systemic exposures while also reducing overall liquidity costs and 

providing relief to smaller derivatives market participants. 

It should also be noted that these margin requirements are new to the market and 

their effects cannot be fully understood before they become effective.  There is simply no 

substitute for experience.  Accordingly, the Basel Committee and IOSCO have 

established a monitoring group that will evaluate the effects of the margin requirements.  

The evaluation will focus on the consistency of the margin standards with related 

regulatory initiatives such as the implementation of the LCR and potential minimum 

haircuts on repurchase transactions.  Based on the findings of this monitoring group, the 

Basel Committee and IOSCO will jointly determine whether any modifications to the 

margin requirements are necessary or appropriate.  In this way, regulators are taking an 

experience-based approach to managing systemic risk that looks across the combined 

effect of a number of related regulatory initiatives. 

Conclusion 

The financial crisis revealed significant flaws in the structure of the OTC 

derivatives markets that are now being addressed as part of a worldwide reform effort.  

Increased central clearing and margins for noncleared derivatives are foundational 

elements of the program.  Together, these reforms can help create a system in which the 

OTC derivatives market infrastructure acts as a pillar of strength in the next crisis.  To 

achieve this goal, it is imperative that international standards such as the PFMIs and the 

margining framework for noncentrally cleared derivatives be forcefully and consistently 

implemented across the globe.
