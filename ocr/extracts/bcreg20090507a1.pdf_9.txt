In addition, firms with trading assets of $100 billion or more were asked to estimate potential 
trading-related market and counterparty credit losses under a market stress scenario provided by the 
supervisors, based on the severe market shocks that occurred in the second half of 2008. The estimated 
losses from trading-related exposures were substantial, close to $100 billion across the five firms to 
which it was applied. The primary drivers of potential stress losses were private equity holdings, other 
credit-sensitive trading positions, and possible losses stemming from counterparty credit exposures to 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading counterparties. The possible losses from counterparty credit 
exposures were measured using credit valuation adjustment methods based on stressed exposure levels 
and expected deterioration of the creditworthiness of counterparties under the more adverse scenario. 
The total loss estimate of $600 billion for the 19 BHCs is in addition to the substantial losses that 
have already been taken by these firms in the past couple of years.6 [Footnote 6. Past losses, however, are 
recognized in the starting regulatory capital levels used to calculate the SCAP capital buffer, as discussed in the 
next section of the paper. End footnote 6.] That is, the 
forward-looking losses in the SCAP do not include the losses that have already occurred since the assets were 
originated and are already reflected in the firms' balance sheets. Losses taken in the six quarters through the 
end of 2008 by these firms and firms they acquired are substantial, estimated at approximately $400 billion. 
They include charge-offs, write-downs on securities held in the trading and in the investment accounts, 
and discounts on assets acquired in acquisitions of distressed or failed financial institutions. As an 
offset, about $65 billion in these merger-related discounts are captured in the SCAP loss projections (the 
so-called purchase accounting adjustments) which reflect that a substantial part of estimated losses on 
the assets purchased were already recorded. Thus, a more comprehensive measure of losses totals at 
least $935 billion for the 19 participating BHCs in the more adverse scenario.7[Footnote 7. These losses are not full 
lifetime losses because the SCAP loss projections are for a two-year forward horizon and thus do not capture losses 
occurring beyond the end of 2010. However, given the profile of the more adverse scenario, which includes a return 
to positive real GDP growth within the two years, this horizon seems likely to capture a large portion of losses from 
positions held as of the end of 2008. The impact of some losses after 2010 is also captured in the overall SCAP 
exercise through the calculation of year-end 2010 reserves, which are calibrated to be sufficient to cover projected 
2011 losses. End footnote 7.] 

II.C. Firm-level Loss Estimates 

As discussed earlier, the SCAP loss estimates were made using considerable firm-specific data 
about the risk and likely future performance of the portfolios. Because the exercise made extensive 
use of this information, the resulting loss rates vary significantly across BHCs. Table 3 summarizes 
the results for each of the 19 BHCs that participated in the SCAP. The table reports loss amounts 
and loss rates, along with projections of resources to absorb losses, and total capital need at each 
institution. The appendix contains separate tables for each of the 19 BHCs.
