Another proposal would require the FOMC to adopt and follow a specific 

equation in setting monetary policy and to face immediate congressional hearings and 

investigation by the GAO whenever the FOMC deviates from the policy dictated by that 

equation.19  In the terminology I have used in this speech, these proposals could 

accurately be described more as restrictions on the Federal Reserve’s instrument 

independence than as measures that would increase transparency or accountability.  They 

would thus represent a departure from the modern governance structure that has come to 

characterize the Fed and leading central banks around the world.  Since the Federal 

Reserve is already very transparent about its monetary policy decisions, review by the 

GAO would not meaningfully augment communications with the public but would 

instead reflect an effort by the Congress to influence the Fed’s policy decisions.   

We should recognize that if a GAO review and, likely, a congressional hearing 

were held every time a monetary policy decision deviated from a simple equation, as has 

been proposed, the Fed would be subjected to the very sort of political pressure from 

which experience suggests central banks should be independent.  Instead, a modern 

governance framework calls for the political system to give the central bank a mandate 

along with the operational freedom to pursue that mandate, supported by transparency 

and accountability.20 

In addition, using a central bank as a source of revenue to cover the cost of a 

fiscal program is dangerous to its independence.  For example, recently some have 

proposed that the Fed be used to provide revenue to fund specific government initiatives,
