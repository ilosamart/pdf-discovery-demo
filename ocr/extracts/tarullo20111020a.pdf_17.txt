without more effective efforts to address the manifold problems affecting the housing 

market, there is a good chance that the recovery will lack strong momentum for some 

time to come.  But aggregate demand policies are still important.  For one thing, debts 

will surely be less burdensome as incomes rise.  Moreover, the confluence of housing 

debt and aggregate demand problems suggests that particular attention should be paid to

faced by the country.  With short-term rates already about as low as they can go, the 

FOMC has also taken some unconventional measures to provide additional monetary 

accommodation.  The combined effect of these monetary policies helped stabilize 

financial markets in 2009, hold deflation at bay in 2010, and support a modest recovery.  

But, in the absence of favorable developments in the coming months, there will be a 

strong case for additional measures.   

Some have argued that monetary policy should do no more, and that the political

policies by other parts of the government could produce gains in employment, 

investment, and spending.  But the absence of such policies cannot be an excuse for the 

Federal Reserve to ignore its own statutory mandate.  The Federal Reserve Act requires 

that the FOMC promote the goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  The 

statute does not qualify that mandate by saying that we should promote these goals only
