nationwide has increased about 850,000 since the end of 2009 as production has 

recovered, there are still almost 1-1/2 million fewer manufacturing jobs than just before 

the recession.   

Unfortunately, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has been generally 

decreasing since its peak in the late 1970s.  A similar trend has also been seen in Ohio, 

where manufacturing jobs have shrunk from about 25 percent of the stateâ€™s private-sector 

employment in 1990 to about 15 percent now.  So, some of the decline in manufacturing 

jobs since the recession reflects the longer-term structural downtrend of employment in 

this sector.  But labeling a part of the losses in manufacturing jobs as structural, rather 

than related to the recession, in no way diminishes how wrenching those losses have 

been.  This painful trend reflects a number of long-term challenges faced by domestic 

manufacturers, including the relative costs of labor and investment in producing 

domestically versus abroad.  However, U.S. factory workers, on average, are more 

productive than their counterparts abroad, and domestic manufacturers report that they 

are looking for more workers with these greater skills as they increase their use of 

automation and redesign their production processes.   

Current Conditions in the Labor Market 

As I noted, the national unemployment rate has declined markedly during the 

economic recovery.  But it is my judgment that the lower level of the unemployment rate 

today probably does not fully capture the extent of slack remaining in the labor market--

in other words, how far away we are from a full-employment economy.  In assessing 

labor market slack, we try to distinguish between the effects of cyclical fluctuations in the 

economy and the influences of longer-term structural changes, such as the aging of the
