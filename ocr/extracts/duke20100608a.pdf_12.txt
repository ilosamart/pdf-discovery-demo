Adequate consumer protection   

First and foremost, any new system must contain adequate protections for consumers.  In 

the aftermath of widespread abuses, consumers need to feel confident that they can satisfactorily 

shop for credit and anticipate the debt service burden of that credit over the short run and the 

long term.  Effective consumer protection, as events of the past few years underscore, are 

integral to the promotion of sound market practices, and are also a necessary precondition to the 

restoration of consumer, lender, and investor confidence to the consumer credit markets. 

Prudent underwriting   

Second, we have seen the results of underwriting based on collateral values or the ability 

to refinance.  Loans should instead be underwritten on the basis of the consumerâ€™s ability to 

repay according to the terms of the loan.  Many consumers have impaired credit coming out of 

this cycle because they were unable to pay due either to poor underwriting or loss of income.  

Consumer lenders will likely need to develop innovative ways to assess credit histories during 

this period.  And they will need to be attentive to the risk of poor performance in stressed 

economic conditions. 

Transparency   

Third, there must be transparency at all levels.  Retail products should be as transparent 

as possible, so that consumers find it easy to understand the terms and risks of their credit.  

Lenders and servicers should also make as much information as is reasonably feasible available 

to investors.  Indeed, adequate information for due diligence is likely a prerequisite to attract 

capital back to the securitization market.
