Investment.  Sequences of shocks to the FRB/US model’s three equations for 

business fixed investment--producer durables (EPD), intellectual property (EPI), and 

nonresidential structures (EPS)--are constructed such that the total increase in gross fixed 

capital investment equals 1 percent of GDP for 25 years.  Thereafter, the shocks fade at a 

moderate rate over time.  The shocks are scaled such that the split between the three 

components is about equal to their relative shares of GDP since 2001.   

Cost of capital.  Relative to its average over the period from 2000 to 2007, the 

financial cost of capital (RPD) has declined by about two percentage points, according to 

the FRB/US model database.  That should have produced a boom in investment, which 

seems not to have happened.  This shock computes the magnitude of this “missing effect” 

by simulating the effect of an increase in the financial cost of capital.  RPD affects the 

user cost of capital for the model’s four investment categories: equipment, intellectual 

property, nonresidential structures and inventories.  Those, in turn, influence target rates 

of investment, all else equal.  The shock lasts for 20 years before fading out at a moderate 

pace. 

Foreign interest rates.  The equilibrium real interest rate in (trade-weighted) 

foreign economies (FRSTAR) is assumed to decline by 1 percentage point for an 

indefinite period.  This decline has the effect of reducing both foreign long- and short-

term interest rates by a comparable amount. 

Government spending.  An increase in the level of federal expenditures on goods 

(EGFO) equal to 1 percent of GDP is sustained for 25 years and then phased out at a 

moderate pace thereafter.  All other components of government spending are held at their 

baseline levels.  The federal personal income tax rate is held at baseline for 10 years, and
