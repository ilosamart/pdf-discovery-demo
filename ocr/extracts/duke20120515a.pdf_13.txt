Additional regulatory uncertainty arises from the Dodd-Frank Act requirement for 

two important regulatory rulemakings that could significantly influence mortgage 

underwriting as well as the cost and availability of mortgage credit.  First, the CFPB is 

required to issue rules that will set requirements for establishing a borrower’s ability to 

repay a mortgage.  These rules would include a definition of a “qualified mortgage” or 

QM.  Mortgages that meet the definition would be presumed to meet the standards 

regarding the ability of the borrower to repay.  These rules are important because 

violation of the standards could subject lenders to penalties and, in some cases, impede 

their ability to collect on defaulted mortgages.  In the second rulemaking, several 

regulators, including the Federal Reserve, are charged with establishing a definition for 

“qualified residential mortgages,” or QRMs, a subset of QM that would be exempt from 

risk retention requirements in mortgage loan securitizations. 

Without commenting on the specifics of any of these individual regulatory rules 

under consideration, I think it is important to note that potentially each of them--servicing 

requirements, capital requirements, and underwriting requirements--will affect the costs 

and liabilities associated with mortgage lending and thus the attractiveness of the 

mortgage lending business.  The Federal Reserve is aware of this situation and will apply 

its best judgment to weigh the cost and availability of credit against consumer protection, 

investor clarity, and financial stability as it writes rules that are consistent with the 

statutory provisions that require those rules.  But regardless of what the final contours of 

the rules are, I think the mortgage market will benefit from having them decided so that 

business models can be set and investments calibrated.
