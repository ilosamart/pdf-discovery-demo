Payment systems also require a technical network to hold and transfer money.  In earlier 

times, the network was less technical in nature and almost exclusively designed for the logistical 

storage and transfer of physical forms of money.  Today, the main payments networks use 

centralized technology to process and safeguard the public’s electronic funds transfers.  

Regulated banking institutions provide deposit money to the public and are a main source of trust 

for these systems.  Transfers of balances on the books of these institutions are at the center of the 

public’s transactions, with the Federal Reserve Banks playing a central, supporting role in 

interbank clearing and settlement for the most critical systems.     

A great amount of resources and effort goes into the networks that make the overall 

payment system safe, efficient, and resilient.  It is fair to say that the general public places a great 

deal of trust in the components of the overall system to safeguard their money and operate as 

planned every day, and that trust is necessary for the system to work.  From the perspective of 

financial stability, if the safety and integrity of the institutions and assets at the heart of a system 

erode or the transfer operations are not dependable, then the necessary trust and confidence that 

the system requires to work may quickly cease to function as needed.

With a steady diet of news about the effect of electronic networks, personal devices, 

apps, and more on U.S. industries, many question the effect of these technologies on the payment 

system.  I think we should recognize that there can be a tension between the need for financial 

stability in the overall payment system and the need to innovate to keep up with the demands of 

modern technology and lifestyles.  However, we should also recognize that this tension is not 

necessarily troubling.  By definition innovation means doing something new, which usually 

involves taking risk in furtherance of some gain.  But at the same time, we should be vigilant in
