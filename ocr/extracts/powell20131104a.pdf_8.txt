A second point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that 

expansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar-thy-neighbor; in other 

words, they do not undermine exports from EMEs.  In recent decades, some EMEs have 

successfully pursued an export-led growth strategy, and policymakers in those economies 

have sometimes expressed concern that their exports will be unduly restrained as 

accommodative policies in the advanced economies lead their currencies to appreciate.  

However, as shown in chart 4, although EME currencies bounced back from their lows 

during the global financial crisis--when global investors fled from assets they perceived 

to be risky--for many EMEs real exchange rates have moved sideways or have even 

declined over the past two years.  Some of this weakness may reflect the foreign 

exchange market intervention and capital controls that policymakers used to staunch the 

rise in their currencies.   

But even if advanced economy monetary policies were to put upward pressure on 

EME currencies, the consequent drag on their exports must be weighed against the 

positive effects of stronger demand in the advanced economies.  According to 

simulations of the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s econometric models of the global economy, 

these two effects roughly offset each other, suggesting that accommodative monetary 

policies in the advanced economies have not reduced output and exports in the EMEs.11  

Indeed, this view seems to be supported by recent experience, as the U.S. current account 

balance has remained fairly stable since the end of the global financial crisis.   Over the 

longer run, advanced economy policy actions that strengthen global growth and global 

trade will benefit the EMEs as well.
