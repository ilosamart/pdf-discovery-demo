work toward an international monetary system characterized by more-flexible exchange 

rates and independent monetary policies.   

 The case for increased financial openness is complicated, and one where many of 

us have seen our views evolve.  As I have already noted, the challenges to opening 

domestic financial systems to international capital flows are real, and getting the 

appropriate policy frameworks in place to permit the successful intermediation of these 

flows, while crucially important, is likely to take time.  But while we should be pragmatic 

about the tools we use to manage capital flows, we should also keep in mind the long-

term benefits that financial openness promises.
