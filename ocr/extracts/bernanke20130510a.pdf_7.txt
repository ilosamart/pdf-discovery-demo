  To administer a stress test, supervisors first construct a 

hypothetical scenario that assumes a set of highly adverse economic and financial 

developments--for example, a deep recession combined with sharp declines in the prices 

of houses and other assets.  The tested firms and their supervisors then independently 

estimate firms’ projected losses, revenues, and capital under the hypothetical scenario, 

and the results are publicly disclosed.  Firms are evaluated both on their post-stress 

capital levels and on their ability to analyze their exposures and capital needs. 

Stress testing provides a number of advantages over more-standard approaches to 

assessing capital adequacy.  First, measures of capital based on stress tests are both more 

forward looking and more robust to “tail risk”--that is, to extremely adverse 

developments of the sort most likely to foster broad-based financial instability.  Second, 

because the Federal Reserve conducts stress tests simultaneously on the major institutions 

it supervises, the results can be used both for comparative analyses across firms and to 

judge the collective susceptibility of major financial institutions to certain types of 

shocks.  Indeed, comparative reviews of large financial institutions have become an 

increasingly important part of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory toolkit more generally.   

Third, the disclosure of stress-test results, which increased investor confidence during the 

crisis, can also strengthen market discipline in normal times.  The stress tests thus provide 

critical information about key financial institutions while also forcing the firms to 

improve their ability to measure and manage their risk exposures.

 The Federal Reserve’s stress-testing program is discussed in Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “Stress Testing 

Banks:  What Have We Learned?” speech delivered at “Maintaining Financial Stability:  Holding a Tiger 

by the Tail,” a financial markets conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, held in 

Stone Mountain, Ga., April 8-10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130408a.htm.  

More limited forms of stress testing were used by supervisors before 2009.
