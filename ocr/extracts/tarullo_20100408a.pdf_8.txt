additional loss.  This last task could be complicated by the large volume of commercial 

properties expected to come onto the market as a result of failures of other banks that 

concentrated their lending in the commercial real estate sector.  Loan writedowns and loan 

provisioning will also require management attention, and frequent updates of appraisals or 

evaluations may be required to support impairment analyses. 

Coping with CRE problems will not be easy.  I expect these problems to be with us for 

some time to come, with both direct and indirect consequences for many smaller banks.  

Recognizing the effect that difficult real estate conditions were having on banks’ loan quality and 

thereby their lending activities, last year the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies issued 

guidance addressing the restructuring and workout of commercial real estate loans.2  This policy 

statement set forth a framework for prudently working out commercial real estate loans and, 

importantly, included specific examples to guide examiners and bankers in evaluating these 

loans and their prospects for rehabilitation.  Because many small business loans are supported by 

commercial real estate collateral, we hope that this guidance will not only help to alleviate undue 

pressures on commercial real estate markets, but also to improve the climate for small business 

lending. 

Our guidance is not an invitation to lend and pretend.  It is a commitment that Federal 

Reserve supervisors will not take a mechanical or reflexive approach to your management of 

CRE exposures that are, or soon could be, problems.  If you believe that we are not 

implementing the terms of this guidance, please let us know and give us the details.  Only with
