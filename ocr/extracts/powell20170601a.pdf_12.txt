include the Treasury General Account, the foreign repurchase agreement (or repo) pool, 

balances held at the Fed by designated financial market utilities, and other items.   

To gain a sense of the possible long-run size of the balance sheet, the next slide 

shows simulations under three different assumptions for the ultimate level of reserve 

balances:  $100 billion, $600 billion, and $1 trillion (figure 10).22  These simulations 

show that, due to the growth of currency and other liabilities, the balance sheet will 

remain considerably above its pre-crisis levels even if reserves were to fall back to $100 

billion (the black line).  At its current growth rate, currency in circulation would reach $2 

trillion by 2022 and $2.8 trillion in 2027.  Even in the low case in which reserves decline 

to $100 billion, our balance sheet would be about $2.4 trillion in 2022 and would grow 

from there in line with currency demand.  If the long-run level of reserves is $600 billion 

in 2022, then the balance sheet would be about $2.9 trillion.23  

The appropriate long-run level of reserves will also depend on the operating 

framework the Committee chooses.  Before the crisis, reserves were scarce, and the 

Committee used open market operations to control the federal funds rate by managing 

                                                 
22 The intermediate figure of $600 billion is based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s May 2017 
surveys of primary dealers and market participants.  Following the 2017 study by Ferris, Kim, and 
Schlusche, the federal funds rate path used in the balance sheet simulations consists of the modal path 
given in the FOMC participants’ Summary of Economic Projections (SEP); see Erin E. Syron Ferris, Soo 
Jeong Kim, and Bernd Schlusche (2017), “Confidence Interval Projections of the Federal Reserve Balance 
Sheet and Income,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
January 13), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1875.  In the simulations shown here, the SEP used 
pertains to the projections submitted in conjunction with the March 2017 FOMC meeting.  All three of the 
simulated balance sheet paths shown are predicated on a 12-month reinvestment phaseout commencing in 
late 2017.  The FRB/US model is used to generate the associated paths of the 10-year Treasury yield as 
well as the paths of other financial and macroeconomic variables.  Different paths of these variables imply 
different trajectories of the balance sheet, in part by changing the implied path of currency in circulation.  
Other assumptions used in generating the simulations are like those described in Ferris, Kim, and Schlusche 
(2017).  The time of balance sheet normalization is defined as the point at which reserve balances decline to 
their assumed terminal value.  Both in Ferris, Kim, and Schlusche (2017) and in the illustration here, the 
evolution of the balance sheet is represented by the path of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market 
Account holdings. 
23 In the simulations from which these values are obtained, it is assumed that some prominent items in the 
“Other liabilities” category diminish to zero by the end of 2022.
