I would like to thank the Council on Foreign Relations for the kind invitation to 

come meet with all of you this morning.  I am looking forward to a lively discussion.  To 

get things started, I thought I could provide some background on recent monetary policy 

decisions.1   

As you all know, at our December meeting my colleagues and I on the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds 

rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.2  This increase came after seven years 

during which we kept the federal funds rate at what we call the ELB--the effective lower 

bound.  This ultra-low rate was in keeping with our congressional mandate to pursue a 

monetary policy that fosters maximum employment and price stability, which we define 

as 2 percent inflation.  Our decision in December was based on the substantial 

improvement in the labor market and the Committee’s confidence that inflation would 

return to our 2 percent goal over the medium term.  Employment growth last year 

averaged a solid 220,000 per month, and the unemployment rate declined from 

5.6 percent to 5.0 percent over the course of 2015.  Inflation ran well below our target last 

year, held down by the transitory effects of declines in crude oil prices and also in the 

prices of non-oil imports.  Prices for these goods have fallen further and for longer than 

expected.  Once these oil and import prices stop falling and level out, their effects on 

inflation will dissipate, which is why we expect that inflation will rise to 2 percent over 

the medium term, supported by a further strengthening in labor market conditions.
