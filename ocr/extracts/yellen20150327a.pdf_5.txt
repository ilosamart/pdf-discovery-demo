below the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent for a number of years, and on a 

12-month basis is currently 1/4 percent.  Some of the weakness in inflation likely reflects 

continuing slack in labor and product markets.  However, much of this weakness stems 

from the sharp decline in the price of oil and other one-time factors that, in the FOMC’s 

judgment, are likely to have only a transitory negative effect on inflation, provided that 

inflation expectations remain well anchored.   

In this regard, I take comfort from the continued stability of survey measures of 

longer-run inflation expectations.  And although market-based measures of inflation 

compensation have declined appreciably since last summer and bear close watching, I 

suspect that these declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market 

factors that I expect to prove transitory.  On balance, I therefore think it is appropriate for 

monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, fostering an environment of 

tightening labor and product markets that, together with stable inflation expectations, will 

help move inflation up to 2 percent over the medium term.   

Why Might an Increase in the Federal Funds Rate Be Warranted Later This Year?   

The Committee's decision about when to begin reducing accommodation will 

depend importantly on how economic conditions actually evolve over time.  Like most of 

my FOMC colleagues, I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect 

that conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime this 

year.  So let me spell out the reasoning that underpins this view.  

I would first note that the current stance of monetary policy is clearly providing 

considerable economic stimulus.  The near-zero setting for the federal funds rate has 

facilitated a sizable reduction in labor market slack over the past two years and appears to
