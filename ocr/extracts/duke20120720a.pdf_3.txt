central banks, whose economies and financial systems were affected by the crisis itself, 

and by the responses of other central banks to the crisis.1   

Federal Reserve Policies and Coordination with Other Central Banks  

 Although the financial crisis that emerged in the summer of 2007 initially 

manifested itself as a sharp deterioration in U.S. mortgage markets, the roots of the 

problem ran deeper.  Indeed, the consequences of a credit boom combined with excessive 

leverage, mispricing of risk, and deficiencies in risk management became increasingly 

apparent.  And given the international extent of these vulnerabilities and 

interconnections, the crisis quickly became global.  Central banks around the world 

responded forcefully.    

From the outset, the Federal Reserve vigorously used its traditional toolkit for 

managing short-term interest rates.  The Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds 

rate from 5-1/4 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to ¼ percent by the end of 2008.  

International coordination on policy rate decisions is rare, but in October 2008, the 

Federal Reserve announced a reduction in its policy rate jointly with five other major 

central banks:  the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the 

Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank.  With clear signs of simultaneous 

economic slowing in many countries, this coordinated action sent a strong positive signal 

to financial markets about policymakers’ collective intent to mitigate the effects of the 

crisis on their economies.  Although not through directly coordinated actions, other 

central banks, including those in Latin America, were also reducing policy rates.
