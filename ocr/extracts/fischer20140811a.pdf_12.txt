cyclical and structural is not always clear cut and there are real risks that cyclical slumps 

can become structural;  it may also be possible to reverse or prevent declines from 

becoming permanent through expansive macroeconomic policies.12  But three things are 

for sure: first, the rate of growth of productivity is critical to the growth of output per

especially difficult to predict; and third, it is unwise to underestimate human ingenuity.

The severity of the Great Recession and its ongoing fallout, importantly including 

its influence on public opinion, has heightened the focus on the challenge of avoiding 

another such crisis.  Indeed, financial sector reform proposals by groups such as the Basel 

Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the Group of

policymakers, acting in their own countries and in coordination with others, have enacted 

financial sector regulatory reforms on a scale and scope not seen since the Great
