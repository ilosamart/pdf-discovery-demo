In response to this critique, one might instead seek to focus the attention of 

monetary policymakers on broader measures of private-sector leverage that are outside 

the reach of traditional financial regulation.  For example, Borio and Drehmann 

document that the ratio of credit to the private nonfinancial sector relative to gross 

domestic product (GDP), once suitably detrended, has substantial predictive power for 

financial crises, so perhaps it might make sense for monetary policy to condition on this 

kind of broad credit-to-GDP ratio.10  However, if one goes this route, another 

measurement challenge arises:  How, if at all, does monetary policy influence the 

evolution of the ratio?  Without an answer to this question, it is hard to say how much 

one would want to alter the stance of policy when, say, the ratio is abnormally high 

relative to trend.  And the measurement problem is likely to be a difficult one, given that 

the credit-to-GDP ratio is a slow-moving variable:  Unlike with asset prices, there is no 

scope for doing an event-study analysis of the effect of a change in policy on the item of 

interest.11 

Risk Premiums in the Bond Market 

Motivated in part by these observations, I would like to spend the rest of this talk 

exploring an alternative, albeit potentially complementary, approach to the problem.  

Rather than focusing primarily on some measure of intermediary leverage as an input into 

the monetary policy framework, my suggestion is to also look at estimates of risk 

premiums in the bond market.  Thus, at a broad thematic level, I am taking a capital-

                                                 
10 See Borio and Drehmann (2009).  But here, too, one might argue that macroprudential tools that reach 
beyond the banking sector to target broad measures of household leverage might be more direct, if such 
tools were available.  An example would be limits on the loan-to-value ratios of all mortgage loans, 
irrespective of whether they reside on bank balance sheets.    
11 A further difficulty lies in the real-time estimation of the underlying trend in the credit-to-GDP ratio and, 
hence, in the gap relative to trend.  See Edge and Meisenzahl (2011).
