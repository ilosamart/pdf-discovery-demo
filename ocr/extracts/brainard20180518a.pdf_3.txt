a neighborhood of opportunity--a neighborhood  that is racially integrated and has a strong 

middle class, strong family structures, more social capital, and better schools--the more likely 

that a child will do better than their parents economically in adulthood and navigating a path of 

upward mobility.3   

As I have noted previously, these disparities matter for growth and prosperity.  If there 

are large disparities in opportunity, such that enterprise, exertion, and investments reap lower 

returns in some communities than others, then families and small businesses in these 

communities will invest less in the future, and potential growth will fall short.4  Although there 

are important implications at the national level for growth and prosperity, to the extent that the 

roots of the disparities in opportunity and mobility lie in local communities, an important part of 

the solution is likely to be investments in those communities.5 

The Community Reinvestment Act 

That one powerful insight--the importance of investment in communities--lies at the heart 

of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).  The CRA is one of the principal tools the Congress 

has provided for improving investment and development in lower-income communities.  

Implementing this law effectively is one of the important responsibilities of the banking agencies 

in promoting strong outcomes locally that reverberate nationally.  So let me turn to the role of the 

CRA in supporting local efforts to strengthen low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and

inequality is associated with lower long-term growth and with lower income growth. See, for example, Heather
