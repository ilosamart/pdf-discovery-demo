   Note: High-yield (HY) share is the ratio of speculative-grade issuance to total rated corporate bond issuance. Excess returns are calculated as the difference between the log return on the Barclays US HY Index and the
Barclays US Treasury Intermediate Index. Excess returns are calculated between   and   + 2 and shown alongside the HY share at time   on an inverted scale, so that the negative correlation appears positive.
   Source: Bloomberg for excess returns. Staff calculations from Mergent Fixed Income Securities Database, Thomson Financial, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation for HY share.
