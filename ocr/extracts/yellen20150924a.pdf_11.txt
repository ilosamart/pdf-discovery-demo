from full employment.  In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 

objective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially 

zero.  Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to 

2 percent over the next two or three years.  I will now turn to the determinants of inflation 

and the factors that underlie this expectation.   

Inflation Dynamics 

Models used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between 

changes in food and energy prices--which enter into total inflation--and movements in the 

prices of other goods and services--that is, core inflation.  This decomposition is useful 

because food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often 

depend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological 

or political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case 

of food prices).  As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total 

inflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.16  Of course, food and 

energy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s 

inflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices.   

What, then, determines core inflation?  Recalling figure 1, core inflation tends to 

fluctuate around a longer-term trend that now is essentially stable.  Let me first focus on 

these fluctuations before turning to the trend.  Economic theory suggests, and empirical 

analysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the 

                                                 
16 Several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation 
and thereby better discern its medium-term direction.  For example, one procedure removes the 
components of the total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the 
average price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a 
given period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate.  In practice, simply using 
core inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these 
alternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012).
