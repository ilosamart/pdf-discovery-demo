the Dodd-Frank requirement for stress testing at large banks, but more generally in the Federal 

Reserve's establishment of a formal annual capital planning requirement for these firms. 

The development and implementation of these three threads of capital reform are at 

different stages, so it may be useful to review where each stands.  As to the first--improving the 

traditional, individual-firm approach to capital regulation--Basel 2.5 and Basel III are important 

steps forward, both internationally and domestically.  In addition, the so-called “Collins 

amendment” in Dodd-Frank requires that banking organizations maintain capital at levels no 

lower than those set by “generally applicable” requirements, which include a standardized 

approach to risk-weighting.  In practice, the Collins amendment provides a safeguard against 

declines in minimum capital requirements in a capital regime based on internal modeling. 

The Basel Committee completed work on Basel 2.5 and Basel III in 2009 and 2010, 

respectively.  Implementation of these two frameworks into national legislation or regulations is 

underway in the jurisdictions represented on the committee.1    

Two issues concerning implementation in the United States bear mentioning.  First, while 

U.S. bank regulatory agencies have published a proposed regulation for the new market risk 

capital requirements, we did not include the trading book securitization and resecuritization 

portions of Basel 2.5, which are supposed to take effect in 2011.  The complication here, and 

with part of Basel III implementation, lies in the use of agency credit ratings.  Dodd-Frank 

requires the removal of agency credit ratings from all regulations throughout the government.  

Thus, the banking agencies have had to develop substitutes for agency ratings in each of the 

quite different contexts in which they are used within the capital standards.  This has not been the 

easiest of tasks, but I believe we are now close to convergence on the approaches we will take in
