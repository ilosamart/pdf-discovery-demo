Since 2009, large banks have added more than $800 billion in common equity 

capital, giving them a much thicker cushion to deal with losses.  Banks have gotten much 

better at assessing and managing their risks, effectively tracking commitments across 

their organizations, anticipating capital needs, and planning for different scenarios. 

The stress tests of the future—5 and 10 years from now—will need to continue to 

ensure that banks remain able, even in a severe downturn, to provide the credit that 

households and businesses depend on.  As financial institutions and the financial system 

evolve, stress testing will need to keep up.  When the next episode of financial instability 

presents itself, it may do so in a messy and unexpected way.  Banks will need to be ready 

not just for expected risks, but for unexpected ones.  Thus, the tests will need to vary 

from year to year, and to explore even quite unlikely scenarios. 

If the stress tests do not evolve, they risk becoming a compliance exercise, 

breeding complacency from both supervisors and banks.  We might also, inadvertently, 

encourage the development of a banking system where, over time, all banks would look 

much alike rather than the banking system we want and need, one with diverse 

institutions with different business models.  We simply can’t let these things happen. 

The purpose of today’s gathering is to help us think about how to ensure the tests 

continue to foster a dynamic banking system, financial stability, and a healthy and 

growing economy.  We have invited a wide range participants—fellow regulators, 

bankers, analysts, academics, and community groups—with diverse perspectives.  

Because we do not claim a monopoly on knowledge or wisdom, we have invited many 

who have disagreed with us in the past.  I strongly believe that diverse perspectives and 

healthy debate will sharpen our thinking and lead us to better answers.
