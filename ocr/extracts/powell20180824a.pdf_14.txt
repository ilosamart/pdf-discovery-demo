decade of regulatory reforms and private-sector advances have greatly increased the 

strength and resilience of the financial system, with the aim of reducing the likelihood 

that the inevitable financial shocks will become crises.    

The Current Situation  

Let me conclude by returning to the matter of navigating between the two risks I 

identified--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too 

slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.  Readers of the minutes of FOMC 

meetings and other communications will know that our discussions focus keenly on the 

relative salience of these risks.  The diversity of views on the FOMC is one of the great 

virtues of our system.  Despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a 

long institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy 

stance.   

I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach 

to taking seriously both of these risks.  While the unemployment rate is below the 

Committee’s estimate of the longer-run natural rate, estimates of this rate are quite 

uncertain.  The same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate.  We therefore refer to 

many indicators when judging the degree of slack in the economy or the degree of 

accommodation in the current policy stance.  We are also aware that, over time, inflation 

has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization.    

While inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear sign 

of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of 

overheating.  This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from 

the ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually
