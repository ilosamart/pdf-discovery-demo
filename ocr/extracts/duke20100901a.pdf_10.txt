Data-based decisionmaking is not as easy as it sounds.  In fact, the third lesson we have 

learned is that we need to use technology to create better decisionmaking tools to assist 

communities.  Claudia Colton, Michael Schramm, and April Hirsh describe Case Western 

University’s work to support community organizations by providing critical data and information 

to help them determine which properties are priorities for acquisition and rehabilitation, keep 

abreast of current property conditions, and monitor issues as they arise.  This means keeping up-

to-date records of foreclosures, sheriff’s sales, and the REO status of properties, as well as 

gathering information on vacancies and tax delinquencies that can serve as a proxy for 

identifying properties that may be falling into delinquency.  These researchers are also using 

technology to develop tools to help communities strategically invest in areas with significant 

needs, but also great potential.  Moreover, they recognize the need for tools to help community 

organizations monitor the ongoing conditions in their neighborhoods so that they can anticipate 

and plan for bumps along the road to recovery. 

The partnership between Case Western and its Cleveland community partners is a fine 

example of the fourth lesson we have learned from this crisis:  the need to collaborate in new 

ways in order to develop a comprehensive approach to neighborhood stabilization efforts.  

Researchers from Case Western are part of a Neighborhood Stabilization Team that meets 

monthly to exchange information on the status of particular properties and discuss intervention 

strategies.  The conference publication is replete with examples of local collaborations that have 

successfully addressed neighborhood stabilization issues through partnerships between federal, 

state, and local governments, community organizations, lenders, servicers, universities, 

foundations, and others.  Moreover, the most promising initiatives that you will be hearing about 

over the next two days take a comprehensive view of community development.
