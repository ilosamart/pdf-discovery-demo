In a recent update to their work--cowritten with another Federal Reserve 

colleague, Kathryn Holston--Laubach and Williams report that, for the United States as 

well as other advanced economies, estimates of the natural rate have fallen since the late 

1990s, with particularly large declines following the global financial crisis.5  Their 

results--summarized in figure 3--support the informal assessment that chronically low 

interest rates could well be, at least in part, the result of very low natural interest rates and 

not just a consequence of the cyclical state of the economy. 

Now, to our second big question:  Having concluded that the natural rate appears 

to have fallen, how concerned should we be, if at all?  We should be concerned because a 

low natural interest rate can have major economic significance.  Let me start elaborating 

on this point by making two simple observations:  First, nothing dictates that the natural 

rate of interest should be positive; indeed, the natural rate has no effective lower bound.  

Second, there is an effective lower bound for nominal interest rates (and, consequently, 

for the actual real rate).  Why?  Because currency is a government obligation that pays a 

nominal interest rate of zero and, instead of buying government bills or bonds at a 

negative interest rate, one can always hold currency.6   

To see why these two simple observations can be so consequential, we need only 

go back to the work of another great economist from the past.  In John Maynard Keynesâ€™s

6 It has turned out in practice that nominal interest rates can dip (and have dipped) into negative territory.  
In part, that is because anyone who wants to hold a substantial amount of wealth in currency will have to 
pay for storage, safeguarding, and insurance of their currency holdings.  This fact means that the lower 
bound on the nominal interest rate is below zero to an extent that depends on the full costs of holding 
wealth in the form of currency.  In addition, investors appear to be willing to pay for the safety and 
liquidity of certain government securities.  Hence, the term we now use in the Federal Reserve is not the 
zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, but rather the effective lower bound, which may well be less 
than zero.  By how much?  We do not know, but probably not that far from zero.  The lowest nominal 
policy rate among the central banks with negative rates today can be found in Denmark and Switzerland--
currently negative 0.75 percent.
