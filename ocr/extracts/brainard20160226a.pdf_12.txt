that policymakers recognize the challenge and will work to address it.  Reducing 

uncertainty about the direction of policy and addressing concerns about policies working 

at cross-purposes can boost the confidence of businesses and households.  With 

intensified transmission effects in the vicinity of the zero lower bound, there is a risk that 

uncoordinated policy on its own could have the effect of shifting demand across borders 

rather than addressing the underlying weakness in global demand.  The difficult start to 

the year should be a prompt for greater policy coherence and clarity.  This might be a 

good time for policymakers to reaffirm their commitment to work toward the common 

goal of strengthening global demand. 

Similarly, with anemic global demand and interest rates near zero, in some 

economies there is scope for monetary policy to be more effective with fiscal policy 

working in the same direction. With potential growth and nominal borrowing rates both 

low, public investment that increases potential in the longer run and demand in the 

shorter run could make an important contribution.  A joint determination by policymakers 

across major economies to better deploy policy tools to provide support for global 

demand could be beneficial.
