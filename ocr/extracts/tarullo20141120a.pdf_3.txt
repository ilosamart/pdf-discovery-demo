in the United States.1  The Basel Committee’s recently announced final Net Stable Funding 

Ratio (NSFR) is another significant milestone in building out a program of liquidity regulation.  

Today I would like to take stock of the progress that has been made.  I will first describe 

the role of liquidity regulation, including how it relates to those other dimensions of regulation I 

mentioned a moment ago.  Next, I will review the specific liquidity regulatory and supervisory 

measures that have been put in place or are in the process of development.  In concluding, I will 

offer an interim appraisal of our approach to liquidity regulation and identify some of the issues 

that remain.   

The Role of Liquidity Regulation 

 Liquidity vulnerabilities are, of course, inherent to most forms of financial 

intermediation.  The canonical case is that of maturity transformation by a very conventional 

bank, which takes demand deposits and uses the funds to make loans that are repaid only over 

time.  Should an unusual number of depositors want to withdraw their funds, for whatever 

reason, the bank may not have sufficient cash on hand to meet those demands.  And, because the 

value of most of the bank’s loans will be difficult for outsiders to determine, they can be sold to 

generate more cash only at a significant discount and probably not as quickly as the bank’s 

liquidity needs might dictate.  If depositors other than those initially seeking to withdraw funds 

hear that the bank may have difficulty meeting the demand, they may be motivated to join the 

withdrawal line before the bank runs out of cash entirely or, even worse, becomes insolvent.  

This, of course, leads to a bank run.
