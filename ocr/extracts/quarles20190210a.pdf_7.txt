implementation of that recommendation globally.  Finally, when enough time has passed for the 

enacted policies to have had measurable effects, we study those effects. 

For much of the post-crisis period, our focus was on developing policy recommendations 

to address vulnerabilities made apparent by the crisis.  Now, however, with nearly all of the post-

crisis reform agenda complete, the FSB needs to put more of our resources into identifying new 

vulnerabilities in a financial sector that continues to evolve and to studying the effects of the 

many reforms that have been enacted.  Let me start by discussing vulnerability assessment. 

The reforms that have been implemented over the past decade have changed the financial 

system for the better.  However, that does not mean we are immune from future financial crises.  

It means that we have boosted the financial systemâ€™s resilience to some of the types of shocks 

and vulnerabilities that precipitated the crisis.  To be sure, some of these measures, like higher 

bank capital and liquidity requirements, after effective against a wide range of shocks.  However, 

we cannot be complacent and assume that we are safe from all shocks.  As a result, the FSB has 

decided to undertake a review of its framework for assessing vulnerabilities to ensure that we are 

at the cutting edge of financial stability vulnerability assessment. 

This work will be undertaken by our committee charged with assessing vulnerabilities 

under the leadership of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of the Dutch National Bank (De 

Nederlandsche Bank).  This should be a framework that starts from first principles and benefits 

from substantial dialogue with nonbanks as well as banks, regulators, and other relevant official 

bodies.  There is a lot that we can draw on.  The crisis led to an explosion of work in this area 

aimed at improving the ability of authorities to identify financial vulnerabilities in order to be 

able to take appropriate action in a timely fashion.  I trust that the framework will harness the 

strength of the broad and diverse membership of the FSB, that it will be forward looking, and
