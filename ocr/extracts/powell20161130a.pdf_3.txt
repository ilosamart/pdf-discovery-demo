statement contained four sentences and noted that the policy action was being announced 

immediately “so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the Committee’s purposes.”4  The 

Committee took additional steps to enhance transparency over the next two decades by 

putting its target for the federal funds rate into the statement (July 1995); releasing 

statements after every meeting rather than only after meetings at which the Committee 

had changed its policy (May 1999); including voting information along with an 

explanation of dissents in the statement (March 2002); adding the first explicit forward-

guidance language to the statement--the “considerable period” language (August 2003); 

and accelerating the release of the minutes after an FOMC meeting (December 2004).5 

The pace of change accelerated notably after Ben Bernanke became Chairman in 

2006.  At that time, the Fed was said to be a bit of a communications laggard compared 

with some other central banks.  Chairman Bernanke’s agenda would move the FOMC to 

the forefront of transparency and accountability in modern central banking. 

In October 2007, after extensive discussions and internal trial runs, the FOMC 

published its first Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which built on the 

macroeconomic forecasts from the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  

Since then, SEP projections have been expanded to include longer-run values for real 

gross domestic product growth, the unemployment rate, headline PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) price inflation, and the federal funds rate; assessments of
