Another important element in identifying financial-sector vulnerabilities is the 

continued vigilance to the financial risks that might emerge in parts of the financial sector 

for which data are very scarce or that have developed more recently and are thus less well 

understood.  The regulatory community has been working hard to fill these knowledge 

gaps.  For example, in response to the need to improve the monitoring of leverage, 

particularly outside of the traditional banking system, the Federal Reserve instituted in 

2010 a quarterly survey on dealer financing terms (the Senior Credit Officer Opinion 

Survey on Dealer Financing Terms).4  This survey collects qualitative information on the 

leverage that dealers provide to financial market participants in the repo and OTC 

derivatives markets.  This information complements the data on counterparty credit 

exposures that supervisors collect on a confidential basis from large, complex financial 

institutions and higher-frequency data on liquidity profiles.  In addition, the Board staff is 

working in the context of the flow of funds accounts to develop measures of reliance by 

nonfinancial businesses on nonbank, volatile sources of funds--that is, the shadow 

banking sector.  Such measures would permit us to track this source of risk through the 

business cycle. 

Cyclical vulnerabilities seem relatively quiescent at present.  Still, such 

vulnerabilities could easily emerge, especially once the economy starts to expand more 

robustly.  Regulators need to look ahead and be ready to respond.  A number of 

macroprudential policy tools could, in principle, be used to address heightened cyclical 

vulnerabilities--some of which have been used in other countries and others that have 

been proposed but not yet tried.  Examples of tools that have been used in other countries
