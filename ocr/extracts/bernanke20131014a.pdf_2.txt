It is a pleasure to offer a few remarks at this conference marking the 20th 

anniversary of the Bank of Mexico’s independence.  In August 1993, Mexico’s congress 

approved changes to the country’s constitution that granted policy autonomy to the Bank 

of Mexico and made price stability its primary mandate.  Over the past two decades, 

these actions, along with a number of other constructive steps taken by Mexican 

policymakers, have paid substantial dividends in terms of improved economic 

performance.  

At the time that the Mexican congress changed the status and mandate of the 

central bank, the nation’s economy had been suffering periodic bouts of economic 

instability for many years.  The 1970s through the mid-1990s in particular were marked 

by episodes of high inflation, boom-and-bust cycles, and financial crises.  Indeed, shortly 

after the new Bank of Mexico law went into effect in April 1994, the Mexican economy 

entered the throes of the so-called peso crisis.  However, the changes to the monetary 

policy framework, along with greater fiscal discipline and the adoption of a more flexible 

exchange rate, soon bore fruit.  Notably, inflation fell to single-digit levels by the early 

2000s.  And in 2001 the Bank of Mexico formally adopted an inflation-targeting regime, 

which--outside of some temporary fluctuations--has succeeded in keeping inflation at 

around 4 percent. 

Importantly, the improved monetary policy framework, together with other 

reforms, has thus far helped reduce Mexico’s susceptibility to financial crises.  When the 

recent financial crisis in the United States and other advanced economies threatened to 

spill over to Mexico, the inflation credibility enjoyed by the Bank of Mexico allowed it to 

counter economic weakness by easing monetary conditions, even though headline
