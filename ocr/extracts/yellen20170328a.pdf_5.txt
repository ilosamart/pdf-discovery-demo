particularly communities of color.  Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of 

adults in low- and moderate-income communities who had dropped out of high school 

was 23.5 percent, which is more than double the 10.9 percent rate in higher-income 

communities during that period.7   

 When students from low- and moderate-income families do complete high 

school, they are less likely to pursue a college degree.  And when they do attend college, 

those students are less likely to graduate.8  Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack 

of money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities.9  As a result, the 

proportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015 

who had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higher-

income communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10   

This educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less 

education experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings.  In 

December 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a 

bachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent.  However, the rate was nearly double,

2011 through 2015; see note 5. 
8 Following a cohort of high school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high 
socioeconomic-status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent completed a bachelor’s 
degree.  Among students from a low socioeconomic-status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and 
14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree.  Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’ 
education.  See National Center for Education Statistics (2015), “Postsecondary Attainment:  Differences 
by Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington:  NCES),

9 Many people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to 
work, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education 
difficult.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic Well-
Being of U.S. Families in 2015 (Washington:  Board of Governors, May),
