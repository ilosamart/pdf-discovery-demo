to full employment without it.22  These policymakers argued that a strengthening of the 

language in the Committee’s post-meeting statement about how long they expected the 

federal funds rate to remain exceptionally low would be appropriate.  They judged that 

this response would influence expectations and thus longer-term interest rates, and would 

help the public understand the Committee’s intentions.23 

The change that was proposed, and eventually adopted, replaced the phrase that 

characterized how long the Committee expected the federal funds rate would remain 

low--“for an extended period”--with “at least through mid-2013.”  As shown in figure 4, 

this subtle but important change in language in the FOMC’s post-meeting statement 

induced a decline in interest rates across the term structure.  

How was the decision to change the forward-guidance language reached?  

Ultimately, the decision required the adept leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke, 

lengthy deliberations of Board members and Reserve Bank presidents, and staff briefings 

and forecasts.  The decision was a joint product, reflecting the experience of 

policymakers and the implicit or explicit models or views of the world they had brought 

with them to the FOMC table, statistical models, an understanding of historical episodes 

that offered instructive and relevant parallels, and other information gleaned from the 

outside world. 

                                                 
22 At the time of the August meeting, total PCE price inflation on a 12-month basis was running above the 

Committee’s 2 percent objective, boosted by transitory factors that were expected to dissipate; the staff 

forecast was for inflation to slow to 1.5 percent in 2012. 
23 A few policymakers believed that recent economic developments justified a more substantial move, but 

they were willing to accept the stronger forward-guidance language as a useful step.  However, a few other 

policymakers preferred to leave the statement unchanged, citing a variety of reasons, including that 

weakness in the real economy largely reflected nonmonetary factors; that the economic situation had 

improved since the Committee had undertaken its second large-scale asset purchase program in November 

2010, and no additional monetary accommodation was appropriate; and that the reference to 2013 might be 

misinterpreted as suggesting that monetary policy was no longer contingent on how the economic outlook 

evolved.
