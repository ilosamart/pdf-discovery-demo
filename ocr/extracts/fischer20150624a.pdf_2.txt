 
It’s a pleasure to take part in the Riksbank Macroprudential Conference and I thank the 

organizers for inviting me to participate in the conference, and particularly in this panel on stress 

testing. 

Stress testing has become a cornerstone of a new approach to regulation and supervision 

of the largest financial institutions in the United States.  The Federal Reserve’s first supervisory 

stress test was the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, known as the SCAP.  Conducted in 

2009 during the depths of the financial crisis, the SCAP marked the first time the U.S. bank 

regulatory agencies had conducted a supervisory stress test simultaneously across the largest 

banking firms.  The results clearly demonstrated the value of simultaneous, forward-looking 

supervisory assessments of capital adequacy under stressed conditions.  The SCAP was also a 

key contributor to the relatively rapid restoration of the financial health of the U.S. banking 

system. 

The Fed’s approach to stress testing of the largest and most systemic financial institutions 

has evolved since the SCAP, but several key elements persist to this day.1  These elements 

include, first, supervisory stress scenarios applicable to all firms; second, defined consequences 

for firms deemed to be insufficiently capitalized; and third, public disclosure of the results.  

The Fed has subsequently conducted five stress test exercises that built on the success of 

SCAP, while making some important improvements to the stress test processes.  The first key 

innovation was the development of supervisory models and processes that allow the Fed to 

evaluate independently whether banks are sufficiently resilient to continue to lend to consumers 

and to businesses under adverse economic and financial conditions.  This innovation took place 

                                                           
1 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to conduct a supervisory stress test for bank holding companies with $50 
billion or more in total consolidated assets, and for nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for Fed supervision.
