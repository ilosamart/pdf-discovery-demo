information can improve the competitiveness of markets to the benefit of all buyers, 
whether they engage in extensive shopping themselves or not. 

Probably few consumer products better illustrate the potential benefits of price and 
product advertising than credit cards. Credit cards likely are not among the products 
consumers enjoy shopping for; rather, in most cases, they are probably closer to the other 
end of this spectrum. But, credit cards are relatively simple products that can be 
compared fairly easily across brands. They have few major differentiating dimensions 
and pricing appears to be the information of greatest interest among potential users.21 

These characteristics suggest the usefulness both of price lists and of disclosures for 
simplifying comparisons, and the Congress has already included provisions in the Truth 
in Lending Act to provide statutory requirements in each area.22 

PRESCREENING AND SHOPPING 

Prescreened solicitations based on CRA records provide price and product information to 
the marketplace in vast quantities tailored and provided directly to consumers who might 
use the products. Consumers receive billions of tailored prescreened solicitations yearly. 

For credit cards, each prescreened solicitation contains pricing information in a tabular 
form in a type size and format that is easy to read and consistent across providers. In this 
way, credit card solicitations are much different from the advertising typical for many 
products, which focuses on brand awareness or on product features other than price. The 
pricing information in prescreened solicitations is tailored to the risk profile of the 
consumer receiving the solicitation. If a consumer’s profile changes over time for the 
better, the next set of prescreened offerings should reflect the change through an offering 
at a lower price. Because of this tailored pricing information, prescreened solicitations 
for credit cards can supplement, and even take the place of, a large amount of consumer 
shopping for this product, lowering the potential burden to consumers of this volume of 
unattractive shopping. This possible reduction in shopping costs, along with the 
widespread dissemination of pricing and product information contained in prescreened 
offers, may help to make markets for credit cards more competitive.

22 The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988 amended the Truth in Lending Act to 
require the Board to semiannually survey credit-card rates and terms at 150 financial institutions, including 
the 25 largest issuers, and to provide the results to the Congress and the public (see Truth in Lending Act, 
section 136; and “Survey of Credit Card Plans,” www.federalreserve.gov/pubs.shop/survey.htm). The Fair 
Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act also required that solicitations mailed to consumers or applications 
to open a credit card or charge card account provide several disclosures, including the annual percentage 
rate or rates on the account in a tabular format (see Truth in Lending Act, section 122; and Regulation Z, 12 
C.F.R. 226.5a(a)(2)(i) and appendix G).
