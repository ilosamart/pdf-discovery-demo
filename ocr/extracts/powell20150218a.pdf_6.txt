the world agreed in 2009 that standardized derivatives should be cleared through central 

counterparties (CCPs), and that noncentrally cleared derivatives should be subject to 

minimum margin requirements.   

Central clearing holds the promise of enhancing financial stability through the 

netting of counterparty risks, creating greater transparency, and applying stronger and 

more consistent risk-management practices.  But this reform program will only succeed if 

CCPs, in which counterparty credit risks are concentrated, are strong enough to withstand 

severe but plausible stress scenarios, including, for example, the failure of multiple 

clearing members.  Achieving this degree of resiliency will require robust liquidity risk-

management practices, including the maintenance of substantial buffers of liquid 

resources that can quickly be tapped.  In addition, adequate loss absorption capacity is 

essential, including through substantial initial margin requirements and default funds.  A 

framework for such requirements has been agreed upon at the international level through 

the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.7  Vigorous implementation at the 

national level is essential.  There is also a need for greater transparency for clearing 

members and the public regarding the risk-management practices of CCPs, for 

heightened stress testing, for consideration of “skin-in-the-game” requirements, and for 

credible recovery and resolution plans.  A great deal of work remains to be done to 

finalize and implement these additional reforms in all of the important CCPs around the 

world.
