cessation of reinvestments of principal payments on existing securities holdings being

When the economy eventually returns to full employment and 2 percent inflation, 

the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will depend on the level of the neutral rate, 

which is expected to move up only modestly in coming years from its current low level.14  

On the one hand, if progress on employment and inflation occurs more quickly than I 

anticipate, foreign risks recede, and the fiscal impulse rises, the neutral rate might rise 

more rapidly.  On the other hand, global economic conditions may somewhat offset the 

effect on the neutral rate.  With weak domestic demand abroad, further tightening of 

financial conditions through the exchange rate could lead to some spillover of demand 

across borders, weighing on U.S. exports, investment, and manufacturing activity and 

potentially constraining the neutral rate.   

Finally, how strongly monetary policy should react to signs of further progress 

toward full employment and 2 percent inflation naturally depends on the balance of risks.  

Given the recent improvement in unemployment and inflation and the possibility of 

increased fiscal stimulus, risks in the domestic economy are closer to being balanced than 

they have been for some time.  While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy 

and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to 

full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained 

period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward 

                                                 
14 Of course, the neutral rate is not directly observable, and we will only be able to gauge its level by 
observing the momentum of economic activity and the extent to which the momentum is putting upward 
pressure on resource constraints and inflation.  The median FOMC participant’s estimate of the longer-run 
real neutral rate in the December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections was 1 percent.  The median 
projected level of the real neutral rate at the end of 2019 in the December 2016 New York Federal Reserve 
Bank’s Survey of Market Participants was also 1 percent.
