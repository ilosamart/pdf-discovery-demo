that are not mutually consistent; for example, if each CCP’s plans involve liquidating Treasuries, 

is it realistic to believe that every CCP could do so simultaneously? 

Authorities in both the United States and Europe have made progress in conducting 

supervisory stress tests of CCPs.  In the United States, the CFTC conducted a useful set of tests 

of five major CCPs last year.11  The tests analyzed each individual institution’s ability to 

withstand the credit risks emanating from the default of one or more clearing members.  This 

was innovative and necessary work.  It would be useful to build on it by adding tests that focus 

on liquidity risks across CCPs and their largest common clearing members.  Such an exercise 

could focus on the robustness of the system as a whole rather than individual CCPs.  The 

European Securities and Markets Authority is already expanding its supervisory stress testing 

exercise to incorporate liquidity risk.  A similar exercise here in the United States should be 

seriously considered.    


Ensuring Efficiency 

The industry collectively needs to ensure that the liquidity flows involved in central 

clearing are handled efficiently and in a way that minimizes potential disruption.  As I noted, 

there was some concern about the size of margin calls following Brexit, and certain CCPs have 

taken measures to address this.  For example, LCH has subsequently made changes to its 

intraday margining procedures in an effort to reduce liquidity pressures on its clearing members, 

allowing them to offset losses on their client accounts with gains on the house account.12

12 LCH has also moved forward by one hour the timing of the last intraday margin call and made procedural changes 
that will speed up the processing of the call, which should also help with payment flows.
