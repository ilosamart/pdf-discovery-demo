requirements.  Increased capital requirements for trading activities and securitization 

exposures have already been agreed.  A consultative paper issued late last year advances 

additional capital proposals, including improvements in the quality of capital used to 

satisfy minimum capital rules, with a particular emphasis on the importance of common 

equity, and a first set of measures designed to reduce the traditional pro-cyclicality of 

capital requirements.1  Additional work on capital requirements for market risk is also 

under way.  Finally, the bank regulatory agencies are implementing strengthened 

guidance on liquidity risk management and weighing proposals for quantitative liquidity 

requirements.   

To a considerable extent, these changes strengthen rules that existed prior to the 

crisis and thus build on existing approaches, even as they underscore the problems with 

the pre-crisis regulatory regime.  Several potential regulatory devices with a more direct 

systemic focus have also garnered substantial interest, both here and abroad.  Prominent 

among them are proposals to (1) impose special taxes or capital charges on firms based 

on their systemic importance, (2) require systemically important firms to issue or 

maintain contingent capital instruments that would convert to common equity in periods 

of stress, and (3) reduce pro-cyclical tendencies by establishing special capital buffers 

that would be built up in boom times and drawn down as conditions deteriorate.  Each of 

these ideas has substantial appeal, but, as has become clear, each also presents 

considerable challenges in the transition from a good idea to a fully elaborated regulatory 

mechanism.
