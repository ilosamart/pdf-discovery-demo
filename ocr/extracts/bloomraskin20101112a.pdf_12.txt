 Preliminarily, we have directed certain firms to complete thorough self-

assessments of the policies and procedures they use for determining whether to foreclose 

on a residential mortgage loan, and, in those cases where foreclosure is authorized, an 

examination of the processes they used to comply with relevant federal and state laws.  

We have directed these firms not just to address their stated policies and procedures, but 

to assess how they actually work in practice.  At the same time, examiners from the 

banking agencies will be on-site to review individual loan files, evaluate controls over the 

selection and management of third-party service providers, and carefully test the 

assertions that the institutions make in their self-assessments.  Institutions will be directed 

to correct any deficiencies that they discover in their self-assessments or that come to 

light in the on-site examination process. 

 As a general matter, the Federal Reserve reviews the compliance procedures of 

the banking organizations that we supervise as part of the examination process.  

However, federal examiners typically are not experts in the application of each state’s 

laws, especially in an area as complex as mortgage foreclosure procedures.  So, federal 

examiners need to coordinate with their state examiner counterparts who should have a 

stronger understanding of their state foreclosure laws.  For federally chartered 

institutions, the Federal Reserve requires that the banks we supervise have adequate 

compliance risk management programs that are being followed.   

 Given the potential ramifications for consumers, the housing market, and the 

economy as a whole, I believe it’s fair to say that every relevant arm of the federal 

government is taking the underlying dynamics of the mortgage foreclosure crisis very 

seriously.  I also hold out hope that the multi-state work engaged in by the 50 state
