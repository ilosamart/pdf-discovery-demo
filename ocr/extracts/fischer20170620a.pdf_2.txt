It is often said that real estate is at the center of almost every financial crisis.  That 

is not quite accurate, for financial crises can, and do, occur without a real estate crisis.  

But it is true that there is a strong link between financial crises and difficulties in the real 

estate sector.1   In their research about financial crises, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff 

document that the six major historical episodes of banking crises in advanced economies 

since the 1970s were all associated with a housing bust.2  Plus, the drop in house prices in 

a bust is often bigger following credit-fueled housing booms, and recessions associated 

with housing busts are two to three times more severe than other recessions.3  And, 

perhaps most significantly, real estate was at the center of the most recent crisis. 

In addition to its role in financial stability, or instability, housing is also a sector 

that draws on and faces heavy government intervention, even in economies that generally 

rely on market mechanisms.  Coming out of the financial crisis, many jurisdictions are 

undergoing housing finance reforms, and enacting policies to prevent the next crisis.  

Today I would like to focus on where we now stand on the role of housing and real estate 

in financial crises, and what we should be doing about that situation.  We shall discuss 

primarily the situation in the United States, and to a much lesser extent, that in other 

countries.

3 See Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2009).  Cerutti, Dagher, and Dellâ€™Arricia (2015) find that the 
probability of a credit and house price boom being followed within three years by a recession is between 59 
and 67 percent, depending on the precise definition of a boom episode.
