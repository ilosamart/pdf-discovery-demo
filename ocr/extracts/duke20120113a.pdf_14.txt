Regulatory Burden and Mortgage Lending 

 I’ve focused most of my remarks today on policy ideas the Federal Reserve has the 

authority to pursue in order to reduce regulatory burden.  One area that imposes especially heavy 

costs of regulatory burden on community banks, but for which the Federal Reserve no longer has 

rule-writing authority, is mortgage lending. 

 Community banks have long been a source of funding for mortgages that didn’t fit the 

underwriting criteria to qualify for purchase by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  

These loans typically are held on balance sheet rather than securitized.  Consequently, 

community banks retain 100 percent of the credit risk of these loans and have no incentive to 

make loans without regard to the consumer’s ability to pay.  But because community banks hold 

the loans on balance sheet, they may charge higher rates than those for prime GSE loans or 

include balloon payments to account for the liquidity and interest rate risk of holding the loans in 

portfolio.  Further, community banks with small portfolios do not realize economies-of-scale so 

their costs are higher.  And keeping up with regulatory change can be difficult, especially for 

banks that rely on purchased software and for loan officers who do not specialize in mortgage 

lending, but rather make the occasional mortgage loan to satisfy a customer need. 

 Traditional community lending is totally different than sub-prime lending.  But it is 

difficult to make that distinction if regulatory requirements use the interest rate on the loan as a 

proxy to identify sub-prime loans.  No one can argue with the need for stronger regulation to 

prevent the lending abuses that led to the current foreclosure crisis.  However, I think it would 

also be unfortunate if the laws and regulations put in place to require other lenders to adopt the
