instead concentrate their holdings in securities that are less liquid and whose market 

prices are more volatile, including agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), 

collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), asset-backed securities and corporate bonds.  

We argue that this pattern is an important clue to the business of banking more generally.   

Second, while we follow previous work in assuming that the safety of bank 

liabilities is an important part of what makes them special, we depart from much of the 

rest of the literature by downplaying the vulnerability of bank deposits to runs.  Indeed, 

we emphasize precisely the opposite aspect of deposit finance:  Relative to other forms of 

private-money creation that occur in the shadow-banking sector--notably, short-term 

collateralized claims such as broker-dealer repurchase agreements (repos)--bank deposits 

are noteworthy because, in the modern institutional environment, they are highly sticky 

and not prone to run at the first sign of trouble. 

In its simplest terms, our story is as follows:  There are different private 

technologies for creating safe money-like claims.  The “banking” technology involves 

meaningful amounts of capital as well as deposit insurance and thus leads to deposits that 

are both safe and relatively stable.  The “shadow banking” technology uses less capital 

and manufactures safety by, instead, giving repo investors collateral and the right to seize 

the collateral on a moment’s notice.  So shadow banking money is much more run prone 

than bank money.  Given its relatively stable nature, the banking model is better suited to 

investing in assets that are illiquid and subject to interim price volatility--that is, to fire-

sale risk.  These assets can be loans that involve significant amounts of monitoring, or 

they can be securities that require less monitoring. What is essential is the synergy 

between issuing stable types of money claims and investing in assets that have some
