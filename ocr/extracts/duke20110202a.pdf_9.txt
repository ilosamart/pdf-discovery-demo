short-term interest rate lever was effectively at zero, we moved beyond traditional 

monetary policy to purchase longer-term assets and push down longer-term interest rates.  

In November 2008, the Fed began purchasing large volumes of longer-term, U.S. 

government debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, eventually increasing the 

commitment to more than $1.7 trillion before completing the purchases in March 2010.  

Those purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates generally and 

helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long-term Treasury rates, which 

had widened during the financial crisis.   

Reducing longer-term rates influences the economy in much the same way as 

lowering the expected path of short-term rates.  For instance, the decline in longer-term 

rates lowers the cost and increases the availability of capital and credit, which in turn 

encourages business expansion.  In the most recent episode, another important result of 

lower rates has been a reduction in debt service burdens from existing debt.  Households 

in particular have significantly reduced mortgage payments through refinancing.  And 

numerous small business owners have told me that they could not have survived the 

downturn without low rates.   

In November 2010, recognizing that progress toward the achievement of our dual 

mandate was disappointingly slow, the Fed decided to put additional downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities with a stated 

objective to purchase $600 billion by the end of June 2011.   

So far, I have talked about what the Federal Reserve has done during the time I 

have been there.  But I havenâ€™t really told you what the Fed is or what it has been like to 

be a policymaker there.
