just as important to community banks as it is to larger banks, as both tend to devote about one-

quarter of their on-balance-sheet loan portfolios to home loans.  Moreover, the share of first-lien 

mortgages as a percent of loans held in portfolio has increased substantially since 2008 at 

institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.   

Call Report data suggest that only a small fraction of community banks engage in the 

origination of mortgages for sale, securitization, or mortgage servicing.  Since the financial 

crisis, however, measures of profitability at banks with such activities have significantly 

exceeded those at community banks not engaged in these business lines.  Comparing community 

banks that reported any income from sales, securitization, and servicing of mortgages in the 

second quarter of 2012 to those without such income reveals that those with such income had a 

34 basis point advantage in terms of return on assets, that is, 1.26 percent compared to 0.92 

percent.  The differences in return on equity were similarly significant -- 11.14 percent compared 

to 8.61 percent.  

With net interest margins compressing and regulatory costs increasing, many community 

banks are struggling right now to generate income.  As I said earlier, the addition of mortgage 

origination capacity and competition would seem likely to reduce rates and ease conditions for 

borrowers.  And the recent entry of new banks into the market indicates that barriers to entry are 

not prohibitive.  So it seems to me that appropriate policy should encourage community banks to 

expand their mortgage lending rather than discourage them from doing so. 

Are there any indications that community bank lending poses the same risks as subprime 

lending that shared many of the same characteristics? 

 I think I have made a reasonable case that community banks are important to the 

mortgage market and that mortgage lending can be, in turn, an important source of profits for
