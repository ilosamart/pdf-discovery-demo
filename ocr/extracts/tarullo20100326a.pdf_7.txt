had been taking place among supervisors and academics for some time.  Not surprisingly, 

against the backdrop of the crisis, the SCAP experience elaborated and confirmed 

principles that had been advocated internally by some supervisors, but that had not been 

broadly incorporated into the practice of regulatory agencies. 

 First, whether conducted by banks or supervisors, stress tests must consider 

severe but plausible scenarios, including low probability events with potentially highly 

adverse effects.  In the period leading up to the crisis--characterized by strong profits, 

excess liquidity, and low credit losses--too many banks and regulators were skeptical of 

the possibility of a rapid and severe deterioration such as ultimately occurred in the U.S. 

housing, mortgage,  and short-term funding markets.  If the crisis taught us anything, it is 

that we must test to the tail, not to the mode.  A related point is that a stress test will be 

most useful if applied to the full range of credit and trading exposures. 

 Second, good management-information systems are critical to the ability of firms 

to manage their risks.  Assessing risk exposures across an entire organization is essential 

to understanding the potential effect of correlated risk exposures that may reside in 

distinct business lines as well as different legal entities and regulatory jurisdictions.  Yet 

during the SCAP, many of the banks were unable to quickly and consistently consolidate 

risk exposures across products, business lines, legal entities, and geographies.  It does 

little good to run a stress test, even one using a sophisticated quantitative model, if it does 

not effectively capture all relevant exposures because the bankâ€™s information systems are 

poorly managed or integrated.  

 Third, the SCAP highlighted the importance of having multiple inputs into the 

risk-assessment process.  It was critical to have, and use, the best available data.  But it
