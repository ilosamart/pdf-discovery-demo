The CRA has not only made more credit available in lower-income areas, but it 

has also helped to create a valuable community and economic development 

infrastructure.  Revising the regulations will require careful consideration in order to 

strengthen that infrastructure.  All of the agencies share the stated purpose of revising the 

regulations, which is to promote more, not less, CRA activity in underserved areas, as the 

Comptroller stated in recent testimony.2  Properly balancing the goals of simplifying and 

clarifying the regulations, with the goal of promoting more CRA activity through 

stronger local community engagement, will require careful consideration.  

I want to emphasize the Board’s commitment to regulatory revisions that 

strengthen the CRA’s purpose, which is to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs 

of the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods.  In that regard, there are a few principles that will guide our work.   

First, we should update the area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA 

activities while retaining the core focus on place.  I look forward to hearing your 

suggestions about how we can broaden our evaluation of banks’ CRA performances to 

take into account the technological advances that have made it possible for banks to serve 

customers remotely, while retaining the focus on local credit needs that vary from place 

to place.  The Federal Reserve’s research, surveys, and outreach point to an economy that 

is very strong on an aggregate level but significantly more varied at the community level, 

with many neighborhoods still struggling.   

Second, the CRA regulations should be tailored to banks of different sizes and 

business models.  Currently, the evaluation methods are tailored to banks of different
