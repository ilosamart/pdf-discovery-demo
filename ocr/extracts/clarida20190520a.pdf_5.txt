respondents.8 

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a 

pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working 

years.9  These increases in participation have provided employers with a significant 

source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures.  

As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight 

labor market remains uncertain. 

The strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that 

have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.  For example, African 

Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than 

whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as 

the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to 

these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11  Likewise, 

although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they 

are for their more-educated counterparts, these gaps appear to narrow as the labor market

Market?” in the Board’s February 2018 Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of some indicators 
that can be used to assess labor market tightness; see Board of Governors (2018a, pp. 8-9).

Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for 
prime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8-10).

ethnicity have evolved over time. 
11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and 
ethnicity in a strong labor market.  The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and 
for employment-to-population ratios.
