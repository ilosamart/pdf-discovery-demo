of Wachovia.35  The result is that the concentration at the top of the U.S. financial services 

industry is even greater than before the crisis.  Allowing the acquisition I have hypothesized here 

could buy some immediate stabilization, but at the cost of arguably greater moral hazard and 

risks to financial stability over the medium term.  The orderly liquidation authority for 

systemically important institutions created by Dodd-Frank may provide a third alternative, but 

even if implemented successfully and as intended, the new Title II would be most effective in 

containing moral hazard by ensuring that shareholders and management of the failed firm bear 

heavy costs.  It would not necessarily prevent all the damage to the financial system and the 

broader economy that would attend failure of a large financial firm.    

A third kind of issue arises specifically because of the transaction-driven nature of the 

Bank Holding Company Act merger review provisions.  Some of these issues are procedural or 

practical in nature.  For example, in evaluating the impact of a proposed acquisition on financial 

stability, should a firm get “credit” for recent or planned actions to reduce its systemic footprint 

through sales of subsidiaries or other assets?  This would be an analogue to the divestitures that 

are often required as a condition of merger approvals by the antitrust agencies.  If a similar idea 

were implemented in the financial stability context, should the package of asset acquisitions and 

reductions be negotiated beforehand with supervisors and, if so, would that package itself have to 

be subject to Board approval? 

Other issues presented by the focus on specific transactions go deeper.  Suppose a large 

regional bank and a broker-dealer proposed to merge.  Standing alone, that transaction might 

well look to increase risks to financial stability, not only because of the initial combined size of 

the firms, but because the broker-dealer operation would presumably grow when affiliated with a 

larger commercial bank, since the merged firm could offer a greater range of services to clients.
