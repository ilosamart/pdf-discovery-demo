Recent Developments and the Baseline Outlook 

Readings on the U.S. economy since the turn of the year have been somewhat 

mixed.  On the one hand, many indicators have been quite favorable.  The labor market 

has added an average of almost 230,000 jobs a month over the past three months.  In 

addition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the 

workforce as the prospects for finding jobs have improved, and the employment-to-

population ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point.  Consumer spending 

appears to be expanding at a moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved 

household balance sheets, and the ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines 

in oil prices over the past few years.  The housing market continues its gradual recovery, 

and fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity

indicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster.  In addition,

resulted in large-scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and 

employment in industries that support energy production.   

On balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this 

year, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset
