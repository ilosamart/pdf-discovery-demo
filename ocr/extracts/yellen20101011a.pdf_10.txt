Systemic risk surveillance will demand Herculean efforts by the regulatory 

agencies and the Office of Financial Research created by the new legislation.  I see 

parallels between the way we take the pulse of the economy when considering monetary 

policy decisions and the way we should monitor and evaluate systemic risk when 

formulating macroprudential policies.  In assessing the economy, we collect and analyze 

a myriad of data.  In practice, though, we regard certain metrics as most critical, such as 

gross domestic product, employment and unemployment, and inflation.  Similarly, in risk 

surveillance, we will gather an array of data on risk spreads, credit flows and volumes, 

asset prices, debt and leverage, markets, and institutions, including detailed, often 

proprietary, microdata on balance sheets and data from such markets as those for over-

the-counter derivatives and repos.  Nonetheless, surveillance is likely to concentrate on 

key factors in the buildup of systemic risk such as the ones I identified:  the accumulation 

of credit and funding risk on the balance sheets of systemically important institutions and 

throughout the financial system, the correlation of risk among financial market 

participants, and the extent of counterparty exposures. 

Of course, we must also keep a close eye on broad credit and asset market 

conditions.  One strand of surveillance will involve watching variations of risk and term 

spreads of bonds and other securities relative to historical norms.  Narrow risk spreads 

and risk premiums may be a harbinger of excessive risk-taking by investors.  Another 

strand will focus more directly on measuring credit flows and exposures to credit risk.  If 

overall credit growth is extraordinarily rapid, it may be a sign that financial institutions 

are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets.  Because of financial system 

complexity, leverage is impossible to measure perfectly.  Still, real-time indicators of the
