primary responsibility for understanding the risks associated with participating in a CCP, 

including their potential exposures in the event of a default.  This will require the CCP to 

provide relevant and even firm-specific information to facilitate the members’ analysis.  

Clearing members and their clients, regulators, and the broader public require 

transparency so that they can assess the adequacy of a CCP’s risk management and its 

overall risk profile. 

Promoting the Stability of Central Counterparty Members 

So far, I have focused on CCPs.  Now I would like to turn to the critical role 

played by clearing members of those CCPs.  A CCP ultimately draws its strength and 

resilience from that of its members.  And it is not a one-way street, since strong CCPs 

enable clearing members and their clients to significantly reduce their exposure to 

counterparty credit risk.  Effective risk management by both a CCP and its clearing 

members need to work in concert.  

As a general matter, enhanced capital and liquidity requirements have 

substantially improved the overall risk position of the banks that constitute many of the 

major clearing members.  For example, Tier 1 common equity capital ratios at the largest 

U.S. banks have nearly doubled since 2007.9  In addition, new requirements address the 

specific interactions that banks have with CCPs and derivatives markets in order to 

promote both the use of central clearing and strong CCP risk management. 

Under Basel III, capital requirements for bank exposures to a CCP are sensitive to 

the risk management standards applied by the CCP.  These requirements acknowledge

December of 2007 to 11.3 percent in September of 2013.  For more information, see the FR Y-9C
