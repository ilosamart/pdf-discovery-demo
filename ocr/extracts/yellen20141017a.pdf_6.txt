inflation, the average income of the top 5 percent of households grew by 38 percent from 

1989 to 2013, as we can see in figure 2.  By comparison, the average real income of the 

other 95 percent of households grew less than 10 percent.  Income inequality narrowed 

slightly during the Great Recession, as income fell more for the top than for others, but 

resumed widening in the recovery, and by 2013 it had nearly returned to the pre-recession 

peak.8  

The distribution of wealth is even more unequal than that of income, and the SCF 

shows that wealth inequality has increased more than income inequality since 1989.  As 

shown in figure 3, the wealthiest 5 percent of American households held 54 percent of all 

wealth reported in the 1989 survey.  Their share rose to 61 percent in 2010 and reached 

63 percent in 2013.  By contrast, the rest of those in the top half of the wealth 

distribution--families that in 2013 had a net worth between $81,000 and $1.9 million--

held 43 percent of wealth in 1989 and only 36 percent in 2013. 

The lower half of households by wealth held just 3 percent of wealth in 1989 and 

only 1 percent in 2013.  To put that in perspective, figure 4 shows that the average net 

worth of the lower half of the distribution, representing 62 million households, was 

$11,000 in 2013.9  About one-fourth of these families reported zero wealth or negative 

net worth, and a significant fraction of those said they were “underwater” on their home 

mortgages, owing more than the value of the home.10  This $11,000 average is 50 percent 

                                                 
8 Largely because of losses in income from financial holdings, the share of total income received by the top 

5 percent of households fell 3 percentage points from 2007 to 2010, with the next 45 percent and lower half 

of households each gaining about half of that share.  Some of the nominal income losses for households 

below the top 5 percent were offset by larger-than-normal transfer payments during the recession.  
9 All SCF income and wealth data prior to the 2013 survey are adjusted for inflation by expressing the 

values in 2013 dollars. 
10 In the 2013 SCF, 17 percent of all families reporting zero or negative net worth also reported they were 

underwater on their home mortgages.
