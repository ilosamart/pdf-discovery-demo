ratio of debt to GDP will be roughly stable at around 75 percent through about 2020.6  

After that, under current policy, health-care costs and, to a much lesser extent, pension 

costs will produce a sharp, sustained increase in the ratio of debt to GDP.   

Fiscal Sustainability and Monetary Policy 

The authors review empirical evidence of sovereign borrowing costs for 

20 advanced economies.  They join others in finding a statistically significant relationship 

between sovereign debt levels and borrowing costs.7  They also find nonlinear increases 

in borrowing costs beginning at debt-to-GDP ratios of around 80 percent.  But the 

nonlinearities they find are driven to a great extent by the experience of smaller euro-

zone nations that, of course, borrow in euros.  The United States borrows in its own 

currency--the world’s primary reserve currency.  That difference is crucial for investors, 

along with the fact that the United States economy remains the world’s largest and most 

productive.  The United Kingdom and Japan are also high-debt countries that borrow in 

their own currencies; neither shows any detectable rate increase, let alone a nonlinear 

one.  These countries present a serious problem for the authors’ case. 

Of course, the United States is not exempt from concerns about the potential long-

term effects of an unsustainable fiscal path.  There is almost certainly a level of debt at 

which the United States would be at risk of an interest rate spike.  However, we should
