big-to-fail problem could be mitigated if smaller, dynamic firms seized market share from less 

nimble incumbents.  This is no pipe dream in 2010.  Many old relationships between firms and 

clients were uprooted during the crisis.  Customers--institutional and retail--are seeking new 

ways of doing business and new firms with which to transact.   

The financial services industry is ripe for a healthy dose of creative destruction.  But, this 

won’t happen if policy divides firms that are too-big-to-fail from those that are not.  It won’t 

happen if select incumbents have permanent funding advantages.  And, it won’t happen if policy 

preferences deter would-be competitors from taking on the big guys.  Policy for all firms must be 

anchored, not left adrift, for competition to take root.      

Competition is undermined when a privileged class of financial firms has the implicit 

support of the government.  No firm ought to be entitled to favored consideration by regulators 

or government policy.  No rating agency.  No mortgage finance entity.  No dealer or underwriter.  

And no bank.  The tempting top-down approach to level the playing field is to bully or co-opt 

our largest, most interconnected firms.  In my view, however, robust competition from the 

bottom-up is the better way forward.   

Third, stronger capital and liquidity buffers, more effective boards of directors, and more 

rigorous risk-management practices are important safeguards.  And, here, there has been some 

substantial progress.  But additionally, firms should have the burden of persuasion to 

demonstrate that they can fail without need for extraordinary government support.  Simplifying 

corporate forms and structures so firms can quickly be unwound, particularly across borders, 

would be a welcome development.      

In a global economy with integrated financial markets, big is not bad.  But, greater 

dispersion of assets and liabilities demands unprecedented international cooperation.  U.S.
