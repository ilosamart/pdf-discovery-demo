regulatory innovation in Dodd-Frank was regulatory tiering--the creation of different classes of 

banking organizations, based dominantly though not exclusively on asset size, to which different 

regulations were to apply.  Underlying this tiering was the principle that progressively more 

stringent regulation should apply to the different classes of banks based on their relative 

importance to the financial system, and thus the harm that could be expected to the system if they 

failed.  As with supervision, an important consideration in regulatory tiering is to weigh the 

compliance cost of a particular rule against the safety and soundness benefits to be gained by that 

rule with respect to specific groups of banks.  Of particular significance in performing this 

assessment for community banks is, as I mentioned earlier, the fact that their smaller scale means 

that they have a more limited base of activities across which to amortize certain fixed 

compliance costs.  

There are two complementary ways to implement a tiered approach to prudential 

regulation.  One is to apply specific regulations only to those classes of banking organizations 

whose activities and scale require those measures.  The other is to tailor the application of 

generally applicable measures based on the size or other salient characteristics of banking 

organizations.  When regulatory agencies adopt regulations under their general prudential 

authority, they usually have a choice as between these approaches.  When the agencies are 

implementing statutory mandates, their discretion to exclude or tailor may be constrained in 

some respects.   

In implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and in modifying our regulations under general 

prudential authorities, we have tried to include appropriate tiering in accordance with the 

considerations I mentioned a few moments ago.  But over the last few years there emerged a
