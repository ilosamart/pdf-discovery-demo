       Note:  1. For recessions prior to 1990, the total amount of easing is the difference between the maximum and the minimum monthly average of the effective federal funds rate in a period extending from six months prior to the start of the recession to six months after it ends.  For the last three recessions, the 
periods of continuous reductions in the intended federal funds rate are June 1990 to September 1992, December 2000 to January 2002, and August 2007 to 
December 2008.  2. Difference between the federal funds rate (less the 12-month percent change in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price 
index) and its real equilibrium value (R*) as estimated by Laubach and Williams (2007).  Figures in table are computed using updated R* estimates from the 
Laubach-Williams model, available at www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john-williams.  3. Civilian unemployment rate less Congressional Budget 
Office estimate of the long-run natural rate of unemployment.  4. Four-quarter percent change in the overall chain-weighted PCE price index.
