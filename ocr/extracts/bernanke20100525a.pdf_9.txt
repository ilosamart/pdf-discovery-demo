the 1970s and early 1980s prompted a reexamination of monetary policies and central 

bank practices.  Since that time, we have observed the confluence of two global trends:  

the widespread adoption of improved monetary policy practices and the virtual 

elimination of high inflation rates.  The improved policy practices prominently include a 

broad strengthening of central bank independence, increased transparency on the part of 

monetary policy committees, and the affirmation of price stability as a mandated goal for 

monetary policy.  Inflation targeting, in which the government sets a numerical target for 

inflation but assigns responsibility for achieving that target to the central bank, has 

become a widely used framework embodying these principles, but other similar monetary 

frameworks have also proved effective. 

In recent years, the number of central banks with a relatively high degree of 

independence has steadily increased, and the experience of some major central banks 

testifies to the importance of that independence.  The Bank of England, one of the oldest 

central banks in the world, was essentially an agent of the British Treasury for a 

substantial part of the 20th century.  When the government announced on May 6, 1997, 

that the Bank of England would be reborn as an independent central bank, U.K. Treasury 

bond yields fell sharply at longer maturities, likely reflecting a substantial decline in 

investors’ inflation expectations and their perceptions of inflation risk.  Moreover, several 

studies have shown that U.K. inflation expectations exhibited significantly greater 

stability in the years following independence.7  

Prior to the creation of the European Central Bank (ECB) in June 1998, 

independence was seen as such a crucial element that it was enshrined in the Maastricht
