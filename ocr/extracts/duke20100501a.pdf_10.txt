  Third, find out the facts. It just so happens that the Federal Reserve’s website has a 

wealth of information on financial products for consumers, and I encourage you to use it.  

Fourth, get into the practice of identifying your sources of information and ensuring that they are 

reliable.  Cultivate a network of trusted advisors, beginning with CCCS of Philadelphia, and be 

sure you seek advice and second opinions before making big financial decisions.  Finally, save 

for yourself before saving for others because taking care of you is taking care of others.  Most 

importantly, take pride in your achievement and be confident in your ability to use what you 

have learned.  You can do this. 

Again, I want to thank you for inviting me here today.  It has been a delight to share in 

this celebration of your success, and I wish you all a bright, healthy, and financially secure 

future.
