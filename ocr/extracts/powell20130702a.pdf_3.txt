debt-to-GDP ratio has increased to around 75 percent.  It is projected to remain near this 

level for the remainder of the decade under current federal budget policies.  This high 

level of federal government debt leaves U.S. policymakers with less “fiscal space” than 

may be required to deal with expected increases in retirement and health-care costs, or 

with unanticipated economic shocks.   

Over the last few years, the fiscal authorities have cut federal spending and raised 

taxes, and our Congressional Budget Office estimates that these fiscal headwinds will 

reduce real GDP growth by about 1.5 percentage points this year from what it otherwise 

would have been.  Nevertheless, as a nation, we have not yet addressed in a fundamental 

way our longer-term budget challenges, particularly those associated with federal health-

care programs.  So I have no doubt that fiscal policy issues will retain an important and 

highly contentious place on the political agenda for many years here in the United States, 

as in Europe. 

I will turn for a moment to monetary policy.  The Congress has tasked the Federal 

Reserve with conducting monetary policy to foster stable prices and full employment.   

Today, inflation is well below our 2 percent longer-term objective, as measured by prices 

for personal consumption expenditures.  And although the unemployment rate has 

declined notably since its peak in 2010, it remains well above our estimate of a longer-

run, more normal level.   I expect that inflation will return gradually to our 2 percent 

objective, and that we will continue to make progress in reducing unemployment.  In the 

meantime, the case for continued support for our economy from monetary policy remains 

strong.
