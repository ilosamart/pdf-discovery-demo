international standards have been implemented at CCPs around the world can the risk 

reduction promised by the global clearing mandate be fully realized. 

Further Challenges Facing Central Clearing  

The task is far from complete.  We must consider how central clearing and CCPs 

fit into the rest of the financial system.  From this systemwide perspective, central 

clearing raises a number of important issues that should be kept in mind as its use 

increases.  I will now consider several of those issues and associated challenges in some 

detail.   

A number of commentators have argued that the move to central clearing will 

further concentrate risk in the financial system.  There is some truth in that assertion.  

Moving a significant share of the $700 trillion OTC derivatives market to central clearing 

will concentrate risk at CCPs.  But the intent is not simply to concentrate risk, but also to 

reduce it--through netting of positions, greater transparency, better and more uniform 

risk-management practices, and more comprehensive regulation.  This strategy places a 

heavy burden on CCPs, market participants, and regulators alike to build a strong market 

and regulatory infrastructure and to get it right the first time.   

It has also been frequently observed that central clearing simplifies and makes the 

financial system more transparent.  That, too, has an element of truth to it, but letâ€™s take a 

closer look.  Charts similar to the ones shown in figure 1 are frequently offered to 

illustrate the point that, as a CCP becomes a buyer to every seller and a seller to every 

buyer, it causes risks to be netted and simplifies the network of counterparties.  The 

dizzying and opaque constellation of exposures that exists in a purely bilateral market, 

illustrated in the chart on the left, is replaced by a neat hub-and-spoke network that is
