may find it more difficult to structure a loan in a way that matches a borrower’s needs or credit 

situation.  This can result in a lessening of credit availability and economic activity.  Attention to 

a bank’s practices in making its relationship lending decisions, and on the performance of the 

loans that have been made, may be supervisory time better spent.  

A similar observation can be made with respect to consumer compliance supervision of 

community banks, for which the Federal Reserve implemented a new examination program in 

January 2014.21  While we have traditionally applied a risk-focused approach to consumer 

compliance examinations, the new program more explicitly links examination intensity to the 

individual community bank’s risk profile.  Here again, the scale of community banks is directly 

relevant to supervisory choices.  Community banks do not have large, standardized systems for 

dealing with many customers across a far-flung geographic footprint.  They do have much more 

direct contact between customers and bank management.  The new program calls for examiners 

to spend less time on low-risk compliance issues at community banks.  In addition, we revised 

our consumer compliance examination frequency policy to lengthen the time between on-site 

consumer compliance and Community Reinvestment Act examinations for many community 

banks with less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets. 

A second implication of supervisory tiering is that supervision must not inadvertently 

undo the decisions made through regulatory tiering.  This point raises the oft-cited concern about 

“supervisory trickle down,” whereby supervisory expectations—or even regulatory 

requirements—formulated for larger banks are de facto applied in part to community banks.  The 

concern has been particularly acute in the context of capital stress testing, though it is by no
