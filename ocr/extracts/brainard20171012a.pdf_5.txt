Bernanke proposes a framework that avoids this undesirable possibility by 

implementing a temporary price-level targeting framework only in periods where 

conventional policy is constrained by the lower bound.  Bernanke’s proposal thus has the 

advantage of maintaining standard practice in normal times while proposing a makeup 

policy in periods when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound and inflation is 

below target.   His proposed temporary price-level target would delay the liftoff of the 

policy rate from the lower bound until the average inflation over the entire lower bound 

episode has reached 2 percent and full employment is achieved.  This type of policy, 

which would result in temporary overshooting of the inflation target in order to make up 

for the previous period of undershooting, is designed to, in Bernanke’s words, “calibrate 

the vigor of the policy response . . . to the severity of the episode.”   

 The Normalization Bias 

The proposed temporary price-level targeting policy is designed to address what I 

see as one of the key challenges facing policymakers.  Following deep recessions of the 

type we experienced in 2008-09, there appears to be an important premium on 

“normalization.”  This was apparent in 2010, for instance, when there was substantial 

pressure among Group of Twenty officials to commit to timelines and targets for 

reducing fiscal support and to articulate exit principles for monetary policy.10  This 

inclination proved premature, as was evident from the subsequent intensification of the 

euro-area crisis.  

                                                 
10 The 2010 G-20 Toronto communiqué indicated that advanced economies “committed to fiscal plans that 
will at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016.”  The 
document is available on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website at
