they are concerned that the loan would be classified as a TDR and remain classified even after 

performance under the modified terms is demonstrated. 

Asset classifications 

 Taking this a step further, now might be a good time to review the definitions and usages of 

asset classifications.  Right now, the definition of a substandard loan encompasses a broad range 

of assets, many of which will never sustain a loss.  Yet our classification and bank rating system 

gives the same weight to all loans in the same classification bucket, regardless of loss potential.  

As a result, when a bank starts to approach a level of classification that it believes would cause 

examiners to downgrade its CAMELS7 rating, the bank stops making loans that it believes will 

be classified even if there is no concern about actual losses from the loans. 

 There was an interagency proposal issued in 20058 that would have established a two-step 

process for classifying commercial loans.  The first step would be to evaluate the loan (the 

probability of default) and the second step involved estimating the potential loss (the loss given 

default).  Many larger banks already use this approach in their own internal loan classification 

systems.  On the other hand, many commenters at the time, including those from both small and 

large banks, objected to the proposal for a variety of reasons and the agencies decided to table it 

for the time being.  Still, as I went back and reviewed the proposal, it struck me that some form 

of such guidance could be helpful in responding to the complaint that I hear over and over that 

loan classifications often ignore the loss protection provided by guarantors or collateral.  And I 

think it might allow more accurate measurement of credit risk in all loan portfolios, not just 

                                                            
7 To assess the bank's performance and summarize its overall condition, examiners use the Uniform Financial 
Institutions Rating System (UFIRS), which is commonly referred to as the CAMELS rating system. The acronym 
CAMELS is derived from six key areas of examination focus: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management and 
board oversight, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk.
