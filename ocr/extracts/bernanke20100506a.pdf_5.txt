success.  The release of detailed information enhanced the credibility of the exercise by 

giving outside analysts the ability to assess the findings, which helped restore investor 

confidence in the banking system.  In a demonstration of greater confidence, nearly all of 

the SCAP firms that were judged to need additional capital were able to raise that capital 

in the public markets through new issues or by voluntary conversions of preferred to 

common shares.  And most of the 19 institutions have repaid the government capital that 

had been injected during the crisis.  In all, the assessed firms have added more than 

$200 billion in common equity during the past year, including the $75 billion they added 

to meet the required SCAP capital buffer.  Despite sizable new issuance of common 

equity relative to overall market capitalization, share prices for the SCAP firms have 

generally increased.  Along with access to equity markets, banksâ€™ access to debt markets 

and interbank and short-term funding markets also improved following the evaluations. 

Importantly, the assessment program focused not just on levels of capital, but also 

on the composition of capital.  Long-standing Federal Reserve policy holds that common 

equity should be the dominant component of Tier 1 capital because it provides permanent 

loss absorption capacity and increased flexibility around the timing and amount of 

dividends and other distributions.  At the end of last year, nearly all of the 19 firms had 

substantially higher Tier 1 common measures than a year earlier; specifically, the average 

ratio of Tier 1 common to risk-weighted assets rose from 6.7 percent to 8.5 percent. 

Of course, we continue to monitor credit losses and earnings at the SCAP 

institutions and to compare those outcomes with the supervisory estimates made a year 

ago under the more adverse scenario.  It is not possible to say precisely at this point 

whether the assessed banks are performing better or worse than estimated, as the figures
