the economy dissipate to the degree envisioned in participants’ estimates of the longer-

run normal level of the real federal funds rate.  Because overall growth has been quite 

moderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy, 

some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand 

close to zero.16  If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as 

would be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity 

growth remains anemic, then the appropriate setting for R* in the Taylor rule would 

arguably be zero, yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate, as shown by the 

long-dashed red line.  These considerations illustrate that there is now no obvious “right” 

setting for R* because we do not know how rapidly the forces restraining the economy 

will abate, and there is a significant risk that it could be very slow.  When the economy 

has been hit with unusually persistent shocks, the Taylor rule, for this reason, provides a 

problematic benchmark.   

Simple policy rules also typically neglect information with potentially important 

implications for the economic outlook because they focus only on where conditions are 

today.  For example, simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy, trends 

affecting global growth, structural developments influencing the supply of credit, and 

overall financial conditions.  One special factor at the moment pertains to the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet.  The downward pressure on longer-term interest rates that the 

Fed’s asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over time--a development that amounts
