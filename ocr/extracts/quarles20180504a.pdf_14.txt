And on the liabilities side of banks’ books, we will be keeping our eye on both the 

volume and the composition of deposits, as there are reasons why banks may take steps, 

over time, to hold onto certain types of deposits more than others.  In particular, retail 

deposits may be especially desired by banks going forward because they receive the most 

favorable treatment under the LCR and also tend to be relatively low cost.   

Retail deposits have grown quite a bit since the crisis, especially in light of the 

prolonged period of broad-based low interest rates and accommodative monetary policy, 

limiting the need for banks to compete for this most stable form of deposits.  However, 

the combination of rising interest rates and the Fed’s shrinking balance sheet, together 

with banks’ ongoing need to meet the LCR, may alter these competitive dynamics.   

Of course, importantly, deposits will not necessarily decline one-for-one with 

reserve balances as the Fed’s balance sheet shrinks.  The overall effects of the decline in 

the Fed’s balance sheet will depend both on who ultimately ends up holding the securities 

in place of the Fed and on the full range of portfolio adjustments that other economic 

agents ultimately make as a result.14   

We will also be monitoring movements in interest rates.  In part, we will be 

tracking how the yields and spreads on the various assets that banks use to meet their 

LCR requirements evolve.  For example, to the extent that some banks will wish to keep 

meeting a significant portion of their LCR requirements with reserves, the reduction in 

the Fed’s balance sheet and the associated drop in aggregate reserves could eventually 

result in some upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate and on yields of
