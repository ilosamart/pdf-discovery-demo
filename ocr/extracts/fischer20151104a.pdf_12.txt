meeting, participants saw inflation as very low this year but expected it to pick up notably 

next year and rise further in 2017.16   

Although the presence of low inflation makes the traditional inflationary bias less 

of an immediate concern, actions that would compromise monetary policy independence 

would still be dangerous.  The anchoring of inflation expectations has been a hard-fought 

product of the disinflation of the 1980s and subsequent Federal Reserve policy.  Today, 

even with low inflation, the balance of evidence suggests that survey-based measures of 

longer-term inflation expectations have likely remained fairly steady and consistent with 

our objective.  The anchoring of these expectations is due in great part, I suspect, to the 

continued credibility of the Fed’s independence from political interference, along with 

the adoption of the explicit inflation target of 2 percent. 

To put this point clearly, the concern over the effects of political interference in 

monetary policy remains as valid in practice when inflation is too low as when inflation 

is too high.  That is primarily because political horizons are typically shorter than those 

that need to be taken into account in making monetary policy decisions.   

Recently, there have been proposals to restrict monetary policy independence.  

One proposal, labeled “Audit the Fed,” would subject the Federal Reserve’s conduct of 

monetary policy to unlimited congressional policy audits.17  (Financial audits are already 

conducted regularly.)18
