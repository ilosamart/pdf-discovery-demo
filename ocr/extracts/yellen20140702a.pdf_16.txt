These effects have contributed to balance sheet repair among households, improved 

financial conditions among businesses, and hence a strengthening in the health of the

have been accompanied by the increased safety of the financial sector associated with the 

macroprudential efforts I have outlined.  Overall, nonfinancial credit growth remains 

moderate, while leverage in the financial system, on balance, is much reduced.  Reliance 

on short-term wholesale funding is also significantly lower than immediately before the 

crisis, although important structural vulnerabilities remain in short-term funding markets.   

Taking all of these factors into consideration, I do not presently see a need for 

monetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and 

maximum employment, in order to address financial stability concerns.  That said, I do 

see pockets of increased risk-taking across the financial system, and an acceleration or 

broadening of these concerns could necessitate a more robust macroprudential approach.  

For example, corporate bond spreads, as well as indicators of expected volatility in some 

asset markets, have fallen to low levels, suggesting that some investors may 

underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward.  In addition, terms 

and conditions in the leveraged-loan market, which provides credit to lower-rated 

companies, have eased significantly, reportedly as a result of a “reach for yield” in the 

face of persistently low interest rates.  The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller 

of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued guidance 

regarding leveraged lending practices in early 2013 and followed up on this guidance late 

last year.  To date, we do not see a systemic threat from leveraged lending, since broad
