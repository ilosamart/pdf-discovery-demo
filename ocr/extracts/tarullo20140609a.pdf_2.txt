It is a pleasure to be back among law professors here at the Association of American Law 

Schools (AALS) Midyear Meeting.  Let me begin by applauding the organizers for encouraging 

collaboration between corporate and financial law scholars.  Indeed, it is striking how much of 

the insightful legal scholarship that followed the financial crisis has come from corporate law 

scholars.  On reflection, this outcome is not really surprising.  After all, much corporate law 

scholarship revolves around incentive structures, agency costs, and asymmetric information 

flows--all matters of great relevance to financial regulation.  Furthermore, legislatures and courts 

have a long history of debating, and sometimes adopting, special corporate law and governance 

rules for financial institutions.   

 In my remarks this afternoon I will try to further the collaboration between corporate and 

financial law scholarship by suggesting how the nature of finance and financial regulation affects 

corporate governance and why, in turn, special corporate governance measures are needed as 

part of an effective prudential regulatory system.  In making the latter argument, I will review 

some of the measures, both longstanding and more recent, that illustrate the point and then 

suggest some additional steps that might complement existing prudential regulations.  Finally, I 

will offer some more tentative thoughts on the possible implication of this analysis for corporate 

law fiduciary duties.  A theme running through these remarks will be the centrality of risk--its 

assessment, assumption, and allocation--in understanding the relationship between corporate 

governance and financial regulation. 

Financial Firms and Corporate Governance 

 There are at least three significant ways in which the nature of financial activities and 

regulation affect the operation of key mechanisms of corporate governance.1
