After World War II and as recently as the early 1970s, political pressures likely 

influenced Federal Reserve decisionmaking in a way which helped cause excessive 

inflation and related bouts of economic weakness.  In 1977, as what came to be called the 

Great Inflation neared its peak, the Congress passed legislation that spelled out the goals 

for monetary policy--maximum employment and stable prices--but left it to the Fed to 

precisely define those goals and the means by which they would be achieved.15  To 

preserve the Fed’s independence in implementing policy to reach these goals, the 

Congress exempted monetary policy from the GAO investigations it was then authorizing 

for other Fed operations. 

This independence has served the nation well.  Over the 20 years or so prior to the 

crisis, the Federal Reserve was able to maintain low and stable inflation, and recessions 

were brief and mild.16  That is not to say that the Fed got everything just right during this 

period.  But it seems to me that any pre-crisis shortcomings were in regulation and 

supervision by the Fed and other agencies, rather than in monetary policy.   

And there are other costs from subjecting monetary policy to GAO investigations.  

Frequent GAO investigations would likely inhibit the debate and flow of information and 

ideas at FOMC meetings among staff and policymakers, which would lead to poorer 

decisions.  Market participants would have to wonder whether the FOMC would react to 

GAO criticism, and they could lose confidence in the Fed’s independence, reducing its 

credibility.
