FOMC took a major step to explain this thinking last January when it issued for the first 

time a “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.”3  This statement provides a 

concise description of the FOMC’s objectives in conducting monetary policy and the 

approach the Committee considers appropriate to achieve them.  I will present my views 

on the implications of this statement for monetary policy in current circumstances.  I will 

then discuss several approaches the FOMC has recently considered to enhance its 

communications to make its policy more effective in this challenging situation.  Let me 

emphasize that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily represent 

those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.  

The Case for Central Bank Transparency 

To fully appreciate the recent revolution in central bank communication and its 

implications for current policy, it is useful to recall that for decades, the conventional 

wisdom was that secrecy about the central bank’s goals and actions actually makes 

monetary policy more effective.  In 1977, when I started my first job at the Federal 

Reserve Board as a staff economist in the Division of International Finance, it was an 

article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the 

best policy:  Central banks, as a rule, did not discuss these decisions, let alone their future 

policy intentions.  While the Federal Reserve is required by the Congress to promote

of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” press release, January 25, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm.  I should note that this statement 
grew out of discussions within the FOMC that date back to the early 1990s.  For a proposal from 2003 by 
the then Governor Bernanke, see Ben S. Bernanke (2003), “Panel Discussion,” speech delivered at the 28th

has evolved over the years; for a snapshot of its state in early 2006, see Janet L. Yellen (2006), “Enhancing 
Fed Credibility,” speech delivered at the Annual Washington Policy Conference Sponsored by the National 
Association for Business Economics, Washington, March 13,
