Today I will discuss “too big to fail” and the ongoing work since the financial crisis to 

end it.

  More than three years into this effort, there have been sweeping reforms to the 

regulation of large financial organizations in the United States and around the world.  Substantial 

proportions of the new rules are designed to end the practice of bailing out such firms with 

taxpayer money.  The too-big-to-fail reform project is massive in scope.  In my view, it holds 

real promise. But the project will take years to complete. Success is not assured.  

In the meantime, some urge the adoption of more intrusive reforms, such as a return to 

Glass-Steagall-style activity limits, more stringent limits on size or systemic footprint, or a 

requirement that the largest institutions break up into much smaller pieces.  I believe that public 

discussion and evaluation of these ideas is important.  At a minimum, we need to thoroughly 

understand these alternatives in case the existing reform project falters. 

It is worth noting that too big to fail is not simply about size.  A big institution is “too 

big” when there is an expectation that government will do whatever it takes to rescue that 

institution from failure, thus bestowing an effective risk premium subsidy.  Reforms to end too 

big to fail must address the causes of this expectation.   

In broad terms, these reforms seek to eliminate the expectation of bailouts in two ways--

by significantly reducing the likelihood of systemic firm failures, and by greatly limiting the 

costs to society of such failures.  When failures are unusual and the costs of such a failure are 

modest, the expectation at the heart of too big to fail will be substantially eliminated.  My focus 

today is principally on the second of these two aspects of reform--containing the costs and 

systemic risks from failures, a goal being advanced by work to create a credible resolution 

authority.
