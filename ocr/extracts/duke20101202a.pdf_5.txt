a shift in the composition of cardholders in bank portfolios toward more creditworthy 

borrowers as charged-off accounts were replaced with new accounts underwritten using 

stricter criteria.  The bottom line is that accelerated payment rates on existing balances do 

not seem to have contributed importantly to the drop in credit card debt outstanding over 

the past couple of years. 

Finally, consumers have been charging less on their credit cards.  According to 

industry statistics, the amount of money charged on credit cards for purchases or cash 

advances fell around 10 percent between the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 

2010.  This slowdown in new charges could be the result of a variety of factors.  The 

significant overall drop in consumption during the recession no doubt cut into the 

demand for credit, as households simply opted to spend less than in the past.  When they 

did spend, they may have been less willing to borrow to fund consumption given their 

experiences during the financial crisis, expectations for weaker economic conditions, and 

continued uncertainty about job prospects.  Indeed, consumer preferences toward debt do 

appear to have shifted.  Preliminary data from the 2007-09 Panel Survey of Consumer 

Finances (SCF) show a modest increase--from 35 percent in 2007 to more than 40 

percent in 2009--in the share of households that believed that buying things on credit was 

a “bad idea.”  Further, those households whose views about buying on credit became 

more negative between 2007 and 2009 reported reducing their charges substantially more 

than other households.  Consumers also appear to be seeking less new credit:  

Applications for new credit accounts, as recorded in data from the national credit 

bureaus, remain significantly lower than were observed for most of the past decade.
