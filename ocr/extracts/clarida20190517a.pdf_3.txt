unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent 

objective.  We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming 

years.  Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved significantly since 

before the Global Financial Crisis.  The review will afford us the opportunity to evaluate 

the new policy tools and enhanced communication practices the Federal Reserve 

deployed in response to the crisis and the recession that followed it. 

Our monetary policy review will have several components.  Listening sessions—

such as today’s—give us an opportunity to hear from the people and communities 

affected by monetary policy.  Next month, we are holding a System research conference 

at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with academic experts and panelists from 

outside the Fed.  Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal 

Open Market Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary 

policy, beginning around the middle of the year.  We expect to make our conclusions 

public in the first half of 2020. 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict 

our ultimate findings.  What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary 

policy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and 

sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
