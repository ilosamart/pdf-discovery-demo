 The annual meeting at Jackson Hole always provides a valuable opportunity to 

reflect on the economic and financial developments of the preceding year, and recently 

we have had a great deal on which to reflect.  A year ago, in my remarks to this 

conference, I reviewed the response of the global policy community to the financial 

crisis.1

 Notwithstanding some important steps forward, however, as we return once again 

to Jackson Hole I think we would all agree that, for much of the world, the task of 

economic recovery and repair remains far from complete.  In many countries, including 

the United States and most other advanced industrial nations, growth during the past year 

has been too slow and joblessness remains too high.  Financial conditions are generally 

much improved, but bank credit remains tight; moreover, much of the work of 

implementing financial reform lies ahead of us.  Managing fiscal deficits and debt is a 

daunting challenge for many countries, and imbalances in global trade and current 

accounts remain a persistent problem. 

  On the whole, when the eruption of the Panic of 2008 threatened the very 

foundations of the global economy, the world rose to the challenge, with a remarkable 

degree of international cooperation, despite very difficult conditions and compressed time 

frames.  And when last we gathered here, there were strong indications that the sharp 

contraction of the global economy of late 2008 and early 2009 had ended.  Most 

economies were growing again, and international trade was once again expanding. 

 This list of concerns makes clear that a return to strong and stable economic 

growth will require appropriate and effective responses from economic policymakers 

across a wide spectrum, as well as from leaders in the private sector.  Central bankers
