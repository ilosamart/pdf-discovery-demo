for employment and income have likely deterred many potential homebuyers from 

committing to mortgage payments that might be difficult to make if they lose their jobs.   

Housing has played a central role in magnifying the recession and delaying the 

recovery.  In Los Angeles, there is huge demand for information on foreclosure recovery 

from organizations that serve families going through the process of losing their homes.  

Residents here want financial institutions and recipients of grants from the Neighborhood 

Stabilization Program to understand the most effective ways to use funds from that 

program to acquire, rehabilitate, and repurpose real estate owned by financial institutions 

and vacant properties.  We have seen much interest by financial institutions, nonprofit 

housing providers and advocates, local government, and academics in understanding new 

approaches to REO disposition and financing mechanisms.     

 Turning to the business sector, credit conditions for many small firms have not 

improved in this recovery.  In 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 

organized a statewide small business task force that meets twice per year to assess 

barriers and opportunities for credit-worthy small businesses in California.  Last year, it 

held a conference to help identify ways that the Community Development Financial 

Institutions (CDFI) Fund can work with community banks to serve the needs of small 

businesses that may not qualify for bank loans and to identify additional bank sources of 

capital for small business borrowers that have needs that exceed CDFI lending capacity.  

The San Francisco Fed also served as a technical resource for an initiative to help street 

vendors--which comprise 30 percent of the small businesses in the central city area and 

East Los Angeles--to access business development services, city certification, and 

microfinance capital.
