we do need effective, collaborative monitoring mechanisms administered by the supervisors 

themselves and reported to the public.  So, for example, the Federal Reserve has suggested that 

the Basel Committee go beyond the important function of reviewing legal implementation and 

also monitor how capital standards are applied within banks.  While a variety of methods could 

be used, we are particularly interested in establishing international validation teams to verify 

methodologies used at individual banks on such matters as the risk-weighting of trading assets. 

Even as the Basel Committee should monitor compliance with the standards it 

establishes, it must not lose sight of the importance of supervisory cooperation in pursuit of the 

shared goal of a stable international financial system.  The focus on rules and standards over the 

last few years has been both understandable and necessary, but the Basel Committee should not 

be purely a negotiating forum.  The activities of the Basel Committee in the 1970s and early 

1980s were largely informal, involving the sharing of supervisory perspectives and, perhaps 

more importantly, the establishment of relationships that could be drawn upon when cross-border 

supervisory problems arose.  I regret that these functions have been substantially attenuated over 

the years.  With the increased membership and expanded scope of activities, a return to early 

practice is not feasible.  But other ways must be found to foster the common goals of committee 

members in promoting safe and sound financial systems. 

The overlapping, sometimes competing, activities of all the international committees and 

arrangements is, like the recent emphasis on rules, completely understandable in light of the 

number of new and urgent issues to be tackled.  Similarly, the involvement of political officials 

through the G-20 was imperative to galvanize the legislative and regulatory processes of 

participating countries to undertake the breadth of needed reforms.  But as we move toward 

administering these new standards and arrangements, we must rationalize the often confusing
