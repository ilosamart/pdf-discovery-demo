of the financial sector for which data are scarce or that have developed more recently and 

are thus less well understood.  This work complements and is closely coordinated with 

our efforts, mentioned earlier, to supervise systemically important banking organizations 

from a macroprudential perspective.  For example, based on public data, we develop and 

monitor measures of systemic importance that reflect firms’ interconnectedness and their 

provision of critical services.  

  Unfortunately, data on the shadow banking sector, by its nature, can be more 

difficult to obtain.  Thus, we have to be more creative to monitor risk in this important 

area.  We look at broad indicators of risk to the financial system, such as measures of risk 

premiums, asset valuations, and market functioning.  We try to gauge the risk of runs by 

looking at indicators of leverage (both on and off balance sheet) and tracking short-term 

wholesale funding markets, especially for evidence of maturity mismatches between 

assets and liabilities.  We are also developing new sources of information to improve the 

monitoring of leverage.  For example, in 2010, we began a quarterly survey on dealer 

financing (the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms) that 

collects information on the leverage that dealers provide to financial market participants 

in the repo and over-the-counter derivatives markets.

  In addition, we are working with 

other agencies to create a comprehensive set of regulatory data on hedge funds and 

private equity firms. 

  Broader economic developments can also create risks to financial stability.  To 

assess such risks, we regularly monitor a number of metrics, including, for example, the 

leverage of the nonfinancial sector.  In addition, we use data from the flow of funds
