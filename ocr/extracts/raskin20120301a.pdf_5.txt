8.3 percent.  As you might expect, the slow recovery in the labor market has been 

mirrored in only a modest recovery in households’ wage and salary income.  Moreover, 

the gradual recovery in business activity has depressed households’ returns on their 

financial assets, and the value of many homes is still depressed.  This unusual weakness 

in household income and wealth, coupled with impaired access to credit, has attenuated 

the normal recovery in consumer demand that typically occurs during an economic 

upturn.  

Early last year, consumer price inflation was boosted by sharp run-ups in the 

prices of food and energy, which also worked to dampen household spending.  In 

addition, the Japanese tsunami last March disrupted supplies of various inputs to the 

production of motor vehicles and boosted vehicle prices for a time.  Indeed, inflation, as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, moved up from an 

annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in 2010 to 3-1/2 percent in the first half of last year.  

However, as the effects of the price shocks waned, this overall measure of consumer 

prices retraced the run-up, moving back down to an annual rate of 1-3/4 percent in the 

second half of the year.  The moderation in consumer price inflation continued in 

January, but gasoline prices have been rising again of late, which will likely push up 

overall inflation in coming months.  Whether the increase in gasoline prices, and energy 

prices more broadly, turns into a persistent inflation problem depends critically on the 

evolution of inflation expectations.  Last year, as actual inflation accelerated and 

decelerated, survey measures and financial market indicators of inflation expectations 

remained relatively stable, which limited the influence of the price shocks we saw a year
