opportunity to channel this capital to customers, in part by devising new and complex mortgage 

products.  The resulting availability of funds and reduced interest rates boosted asset prices, 

particularly in the housing sector, and market participants assumed housing prices would 

continue to rise.   

Moreover, the lower returns on conventional assets, including Treasury securities, fueled 

the demand for financial products with higher returns and fostered the buildup of leverage and 

risk.  To some extent, this “reach for yield” may have been driven by a failure on the part of 

investors to recognize that the underlying equilibrium real interest rate had fallen, which implied 

that maintaining a given return on investment could only be achieved by accepting greater risk.  

At the same time, financial innovation created assets that seemed to improve the risk-return 

tradeoff, albeit in very complicated and opaque structures.  The supply of these assets, which 

proved to be far riskier than understood at the time, was augmented by lax lending standards and 

inadequate supervision.  The overall result was inflated asset prices, excess household debt, and 

a severe but underappreciated buildup of risk in the financial system to which the regulatory 

framework was ill-equipped to respond.  In effect, we failed to heed the advice we so often gave 

to other countries--to be especially vigilant about the safety and soundness of the financial 

system when facing large capital inflows.   

Thus, in my view, global imbalances contributed to important macroeconomic and 

financial vulnerabilities and, hence, to the emergence of the global financial crisis.  Looking 

ahead, a more sustainable and balanced global economy in which the pattern of current account 

deficits and surpluses is more clearly determined by the efficient allocation of capital across 

borders is necessary to reduce the risks of future crises.  Achieving better balance will require 

lasting shifts in spending, production, saving, and borrowing around the world.
