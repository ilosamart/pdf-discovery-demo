Good evening.  My discussion tonight will focus on a key transmission channel in 

an open economy--the exchange rate.1  The exchange rate is a primary focus of central 

bankers in small open economies as well as a prime concern of the broader public in 

those economies--and, to a lesser extent, in even the largest of economies.  When I was 

governor of the Bank of Israel prior to joining the Federal Reserve, my markets screen 

was continuously open at a chart of the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar.  

For small open economies, the exchange rate may well matter as much for output and 

inflation as do interest rates.2 

Given that the U.S. economy is much less open than Israel’s, it is not surprising 

that fluctuations in the dollar typically receive somewhat less attention here in the United 

States.  Indeed, much of the focus on dollar fluctuations in the recent research literature is 

on transmission to foreign economies, including through balance sheet channels, as in the 

Bank for International Settlements paper (Hofmann, Shim, and Shin, forthcoming) that 

will be presented tomorrow.  Nevertheless, the exchange value of the dollar also plays a 

significant role in the U.S. economy, a role that has increased over time given growing 

global trade and financial linkages.  My remarks will focus on the consequences of the 

dollar’s ascent since last summer for U.S. output and inflation--and thus for monetary 

policy.

2 At times, starting in the 1990s, several central banks--most prominently, the Bank of Canada--have used a 
monetary conditions index, generally a weighted average of changes in a short-term interest rate and a 
multilateral exchange rate from some baseline, as a policy indicator.
