households will likely aim for something lower than before the financial crisis:  

Households are probably working toward lower, more-manageable debt service 

obligations; the heightened uncertainty in the recession may have raised the desired level 

of financial buffers; and, to the extent that households saw the negative shocks to house 

prices and income as permanent, they are reducing their spending and thus their demand 

for new borrowing.  While the process of household deleveraging has affected the 

spending and borrowing of many households, there is no doubt that the process has been 

more acute for those that have experienced unemployment, underemployment, or slower 

wage gains.   

To make matters worse, there is also some evidence to suggest that the factors 

that contributed to the rise in inequality and the stagnation of wages in the bottom half of 

the income distribution, such as technological change that favors those with a college 

education and globalization, are still at play in the recovery--and perhaps may have 

accelerated.11  About two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in middle-wage 

occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs--

but these occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of subsequent job growth.12  

In contrast, the decline in lower-wage occupations--such as retail sales, food service, and

it now stands at 15 percent, significantly higher than the average over the past three decades.  See Carmen
