transparency, will complement regulatory oversight.  Finally, numerous steps, both 

prescribed in the legislation and taken independently by regulators, will work to make our 

financial system more resilient to shocks.  Examples include rules that will strengthen 

key financial utilities, toughen bank capital and liquidity standards, and require that more 

derivatives instruments be standardized and traded on exchanges rather than over the 

counter. 

Economic engineering is effective only in combination with good economic 

management.  For its part, the Federal Reserve has revamped its supervisory operations 

to provide more effective and comprehensive oversight.  In particular, we are taking an 

approach that is both more multi-disciplinary--making greater use of the Federal 

Reserveâ€™s wide expertise in macroeconomics, finance, and other fields to complement the 

work of bank supervisors; and more macroprudential--that is, focused on risks to the 

system as a whole as well as those to individual institutions.  Together, better design of 

private- and public-sector frameworks for managing risk, better monitoring and 

supervision, and a more resilient financial system do not by any means guarantee that 

financial crises will not recur, but they should both reduce the risk of crises and mitigate 

the effects of any that do happen. 

  In short, the financial crisis did not discredit the usefulness of economic research 

and analysis by any means; indeed, both older and more recent ideas drawn from 

economic research have proved invaluable to policymakers attempting to diagnose and 

respond to the financial crisis.  However, the crisis has raised some important questions 

that are already occupying researchers and should continue to do so.  As I have discussed 

today, more work is needed on the behavior of economic agents in times of profound
