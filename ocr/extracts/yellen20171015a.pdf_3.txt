openings and the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs, also point to strength.   

Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly 

earnings through September, was encouraging.  On balance, wage gains appear moderate, 

and the pace seems broadly consistent with a tightening labor market once we account for 

the disappointing productivity growth in recent years.   

I expect the labor market to strengthen further as economic growth continues.  

The hurricanes will likely result in some hit to GDP growth in the third quarter but a 

rebound thereafter, and smoothing through those movements, Iâ€™m expecting growth that 

continues to exceed potential in the second half of the year.  The latest projections from 

FOMC participants have a median of 2-1/2 percent GDP growth this year.  Growth of 

consumer spending has been supported by the ongoing job gains and relatively high 

levels of household wealth and consumer sentiment.  Business investment has 

strengthened this year following surprising weakness in 2016.  The faster gains partly 

reflect an upturn in investment in the energy sector as oil prices have firmed.   But the 

gains have been broader than that, and some measures of business sentiment remain quite 

strong.  Exports also have risen this year, as growth abroad has solidified and the 

exchange value of the dollar has declined somewhat.  My fellow FOMC participants and 

I perceive that risks to global growth have receded somewhat and expect growth to 

continue to improve over the near term. 

The biggest surprise in the U.S. economy this year has been inflation.  Earlier this 

year, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE) reached 2 percent, and core PCE inflation reached 1.9 percent.  These readings
