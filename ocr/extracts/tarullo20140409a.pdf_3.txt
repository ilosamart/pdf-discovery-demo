4. Economic mobility across generations is not particularly high in the United 
States, and it has not been increasing over time.   

After detailing these trends, I will turn briefly to both the role and the limits of monetary 

policy in countering them.1 

Structural Challenges for the American Economy 

Lagging productivity growth 

Over the long term, the pace at which our standards of living increase depends on 

the growth of labor productivity--that is, the increase in the amount of economic value 

that a worker can generate during each hour on the job.  Unfortunately, the data on 

productivity growth in recent years have been disappointing.  Although output per hour in 

the nonfarm business sector rose about 2-3/4 percent per year from the end of World 

War II through 1971, productivity has risen just 1-1/2 percent per year since then, 

excluding a brief burst of rapid growth that occurred roughly between 1996 and 2004.   

Just as it took economists a long time to identify the sources of the surge in 

productivity that began nearly two decades ago, they are only now beginning to grapple 

with the more recent slowdown.  Some have argued that the burst of productivity growth 

that began in the mid-1990s was the anomaly, and that the more pedestrian pace of 

growth over the past decade represents a return to the norm.2  In this view, the long 

period of rapid productivity growth that ended in the 1970s grew out of the technological
