in 1959, the first female faculty member of Brown University.  Among those women 

fortunate to attend Pembroke in this era of dramatic change was me.  I enrolled at Brown 

fully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates 

in the Class of 1967.   

By the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work lives was under way.  In the 

period after World War II, many women had not expected that they would spend as much 

of their adult lives working as turned out to be the case.  By contrast, in the 1970s young 

women more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their 

lives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment 

and taking courses and college majors that better equipped them for careers as opposed to 

just jobs.   

In surveys of young people about their expectations of their futures, young 

women during this era increasingly placed an emphasis on career success.11  Susan 

Graber Slusky of the Class of 1971 said in her oral history that she chose Pembroke for 

Brown’s excellence in chemistry and physics, because she was already planning the 

career she went on to have as a researcher.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is also the period 

in which many all-male colleges admitted women or combined their women’s and men’s 

undergraduate schools, as Brown did when it merged Pembroke and Brown College 

in 1971. 

These changes in attitudes and expectations were supported by other changes 

under way in society.  Workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the 

Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the
