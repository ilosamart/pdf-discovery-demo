companies with at least $50 billion in assets prudential standards that “are more stringent” than 

generally applicable standards and that “increase in stringency” based on a variety of factors 

related to the systemic importance of these institutions.

  These standards must cover capital, 

liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, and concentration limits; the Federal Reserve 

may add other standards as it finds appropriate.

  Section 165 also establishes requirements for 

the establishment of a risk committee and for stress testing, but these are applicable in at least 

some respects to all bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in assets.   

 In implementing the section 165 requirement of increasing stringency for enhanced 

prudential standards applicable to banking organizations of increasing systemic importance, the 

Federal Reserve has essentially created several categories within the universe of banking 

organizations with $50 billion or more in assets.  All firms in this universe will be subject to the 

basic enhanced standards, including supervisory stress tests, capital plan submissions, resolution 

plan requirements, single counterparty credit limits, and a modified form of the Liquidity 

Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement that was part of Basel III.  Firms with at least $250 billion in 

assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign assets are also subject to the advanced approach 

risk-based capital requirements of Basel II, the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, the full 

LCR requirement, and the countercyclical capital buffer provision of Basel III.

  The eight U.S. 

firms designated as global systemically important banks will be additionally subject to risk-based 

capital surcharges, the enhanced Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, tighter single 

counterparty credit limits, and a long-term debt requirement designed to support the

 Section 165 of Dodd-Frank also requires that these special prudential standards apply to any nonbank financial 

company designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. 
5
 Dodd-Frank also uses the $50 billion threshold in other parts of the law, such as to define the universe of firms that 

must pay the Federal Reserve for the cost of examination and supervision, and that are subject to ex post 

assessments in the event that taxpayers were to bear any loss as a result of the resolution of a firm under Title II of 

the law. 
6
 The $250 billion/$10 billion threshold does not appear in Dodd-Frank.  It was a pre-existing regulatory category 

created to identify the firms subject to the so-called advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements of Basel II.
