To wrap up, let me emphasize that what matters is the overall stance of policy, not 

the pace of asset purchases.  In all likelihood, policy will remain highly accommodative 

for quite a while longer--as long as needed to support an economy that still struggles to 

shake off the lingering effects of the financial crisis. 

Thank you.
