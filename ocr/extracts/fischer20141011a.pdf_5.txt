weighed on global growth, which needs to be taken into account in the setting of U.S. 

monetary policy. 

Returning to spillovers from the United States, in the second part of the lecture, I 

will address prospective outcomes and possible risks associated with the normalization of 

our policies.  In determining the pace at which our monetary accommodation is removed, 

we will, as always, be paying close attention to the path of the rest of the global economy 

and its significant consequences for U.S. economic prospects.  

In the third part, toward the end of the lecture, I will discuss the responsibilities of 

the Fed in the world economy.  Like other national central banks, we must answer first to 

our own citizens and taxpayers.  But, because of our size, developments in the U.S. 

economy will always affect foreign economies.  And, since the U.S. dollar is the most 

widely used currency in the world, our interests in ensuring a well-functioning financial 

system inevitably have an international dimension.  

I. International Transmission of Monetary Policies 

The recognition that a change in interest rates in one nation can spill over to other 

countries dates back at least to the 18th-century writings of David Hume on the 

international effect of changes in the money supply.4  The standard models incorporating 

the international transmission of monetary policy were developed in Per Jacobssonâ€™s 

tenure at the IMF--the pioneering research in the early 1960s by IMF staffer Marcus 

Fleming and Robert Mundell, which extended standard macroeconomic models to the 

analysis of an open international economy--work that we know now as the Mundell-

Fleming model.
