these effects requires information about the behavior of those actors that may not be observable 

either to a firm or to us.   

Notwithstanding these and other practical challenges, many of the suggestions we 

received have focused on important potential risks that bear further inquiry by regulators.  Hence 

we will be undertaking a research program to pursue these ideas in order to better understand the 

quantitative consequences of new risks and business activities, potential amplification channels 

such as fire sales by which stress could migrate from the large banks to the rest of the financial 

system, and important dynamics between capital and liquidity positions.  At a minimum, this 

research should inform scenario design and the overall regulatory and financial stability 

functions of the Board.  And at least some of the ideas might eventually be translated into 

features of the stress testing regime.  Over the medium term we view three related areas as the 

highest priorities: funding shocks, liquidity shocks, and spillovers from the default of common 

counterparties.   

Funding shocks 

Funding stresses are a natural starting point. As banks incur losses and their capital base 

erodes, some of their creditors will demand additional compensation and bank funding costs will 

increase.  This kind of “direct” funding shock is really microprudential because the resulting 

losses depend largely on the bank’s own decisions about its capital base, asset risk, and reliance 

on short-term wholesale funding.  As such, it should be more straightforward to integrate direct 

funding shocks into our main stress testing framework than to integrate systemwide effects, and 

we will consider whether, and how, to do so in the relatively near term. 

In a “systemic” funding shock, by contrast, each bank’s cost of funds depends on the 

capital position of the system as a whole.  By taking the overall solvency of the system into
