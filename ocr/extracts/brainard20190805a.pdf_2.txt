Our payment system is a vital part of America’s infrastructure that touches everyone. The 

choices we make about our payment infrastructure today will affect all Americans many years 

into the future. Today I am excited to announce the Federal Reserve will invest in a new service 

to help ensure that real-time payments are available to everyone. The Federal Reserve will 

develop the FedNow ServiceSM, a real-time payment and settlement service for the future.2

permit banks of every size in every community across the country to provide real-time payments 

to their customers.

infrastructure, the funds would be available immediately—to pay utility bills or split the rent 

with roommates, or for small business owners to pay their suppliers. Immediate access to funds 

could be especially important for households on fixed incomes or living paycheck to paycheck, 

when waiting days for the funds to be available to pay a bill can mean overdraft fees or late fees 

that can compound. Similarly, getting immediate access to funds from a sale in order to pay for
