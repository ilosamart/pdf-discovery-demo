Importantly, in noting these facts, I intend no criticism of emerging markets; growth in 

those economies has conferred substantial economic benefits both within those countries 

and globally, and in any case, the consumption of raw materials relative to population in 

emerging-market countries remains substantially lower than in the United States and 

other advanced economies.  Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the tremendous growth in 

emerging market economies has considerably increased global demand for commodities 

in recent years. 

 Against this backdrop of extremely robust growth in demand, the supply of many 

commodities has lagged behind.  For example, world oil production has increased less 

than 1 percent per year since 2004, compared with nearly 2 percent per year in the prior 

decade.  In part, the slower increase in the supply of oil reflected disappointing rates of 

production in countries that are not part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 

Countries (OPEC).  However, OPEC has not shown much willingness to ramp up 

production, either.  Most recently, OPEC production fell 1.3 million barrels per day from 

January to April of this year, reflecting the disruption to Libyan supplies and the lack of 

any significant offset from other OPEC producers.  Indeed, OPEC’s production of oil 

today remains about 3 million barrels per day below the peak level of mid-2008.  With 

the demand for oil rising rapidly and the supply of crude stagnant, increases in oil prices 

are hardly a puzzle. 

Production shortfalls have plagued many other commodities as well.  Agricultural 

output has been hard hit by a spate of bad weather around the globe.  For example, last 

summer’s drought in Russia severely reduced that country’s wheat crop.  In the United 

States, high temperatures significantly impaired the U.S. corn crop last fall, and dry
