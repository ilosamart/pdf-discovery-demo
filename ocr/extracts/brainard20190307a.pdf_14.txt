disruptions.  That shift will be under way naturally, albeit slowly, as these securities 

mature and are replaced by Treasury securities.18 

For the portion of our portfolio in Treasury securities, the Federal Reserve 

currently holds no Treasury bills, and our portfolio has a much longer weighted-average 

maturity than the current stock of Treasury securities outstanding in the market or than 

our pre-crisis portfolio, which was more heavily weighted toward short-dated securities 

than the holdings of the public.  When the Federal Reserve System begins once again 

purchasing Treasury securities, we will need to decide what maturities to purchase.  

Given how far out of step the Systemâ€™s current portfolio is from common benchmarks, 

however, it might make sense to weight those purchases more heavily toward Treasury 

bills and other shorter-dated Treasury securities for a time.  Further into the future, there 

may be good reasons to shift toward greater holdings of shorter-term securities to provide 

greater flexibility.  However, I want to emphasize that I do not expect this issue to be 

addressed for some time. 

Conclusion 

The most likely path for the economy appears to have softened against a backdrop 

of greater downside risks.  Our goal now is to safeguard the progress we have made on 

full employment and target inflation.  Prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting.  

And with balance sheet normalization now well advanced, it will soon be time to wind 

down our asset redemptions.

help accomplish the Treasury-securities-only goal.  In this eventuality, there would be considerable 
advance notice, with an aim to minimizing any market disruptions.
