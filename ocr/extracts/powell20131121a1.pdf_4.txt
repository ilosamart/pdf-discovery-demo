The Group of Twenty governments responded by committing that all standardized 

derivatives would be moved to central clearing and that derivatives that are not centrally 

cleared would be subject to margin requirements.2  Progress has been made on both of 

these fronts.  Since credit default swaps clearing was introduced in 2009, the notional 

value of cleared credit derivatives has grown to more than $6 trillion.  The notional value 

of interest rate swaps that are centrally cleared has more than doubled since 2009 and 

now stands at more than $400 trillion.3  These amounts will surely increase further in the 

coming years.  And international standards on margin requirements for derivatives that 

are not centrally cleared have recently been finalized.4  I would like to briefly discuss 

how these reform efforts are intended to reduce systemic risks and offer my views on 

how to ensure that they are effectively implemented. 

The Enhanced Role of Central Counterparties in OTC Derivatives Markets  

By design, central clearing offers important advantages over a bilateral market 

structure in which no participant can know the full extent of its counterparties’ risk 

exposures.  The hub-and-spoke structure of central clearing enables the netting of gains 

and losses across multiple market participants, which has the potential to significantly 

reduce each participant’s aggregate counterparty risk exposure.  Central clearing can also
