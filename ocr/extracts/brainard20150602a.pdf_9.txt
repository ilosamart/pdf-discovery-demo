Despite the deflationary pressures from abroad, the recent data have provided 

some reassurance that inflation in the United States is starting to firm.  Oil prices have 

now retraced part of their decline from the middle of last year through January, and 

monthly changes in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices have increased 

from the very low levels reached around the turn of the year.   

In the face of the long period of weak overall inflation, it is reassuring that 

survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations appear to have remained 

stable.  In addition, market-based measures of inflation expectations have moved up 

somewhat in the past few months after several months of decreases that appeared to have 

been associated with oil price declines and heightened anxiety about global deflationary 

pressures.  Even so, most indicators of the underlying trend in PCE inflation, such as the 

12-month change in core PCE prices or the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s 12-month 

trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, are around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, noticeably below the 

FOMC’s 2 percent target.   

Second, I will also want to see further improvement in the labor market with solid 

further employment growth and further evidence of a narrowing of resource utilization 

gaps based on various indicators, including the unemployment rate, the labor force 

participation rate, the percentage of employees who are working part time for economic 

reasons, and faster wage growth. 

The robust pace of labor market improvement was perhaps the brightest part of 

the data picture over 2014.  As we have advanced into 2015, the pace of job gains has 

slowed.  Average monthly nonfarm payroll employment gains in the past three months 

were a little under 200,000, down from last year’s pace of 260,000.  Even so, job gains
