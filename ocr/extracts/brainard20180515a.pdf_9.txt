significant operational impacts.  The industry is making steady progress and some projects could 

be live in some form this year. 

Many of the use cases focus on the areas of post-trade clearing and settlement of 

securities transactions, cross-border payments solutions, and trade finance.  The common thread 

running through these use cases is the presence of operational “pain points” that generate 

inefficiencies and delays for users.  For example, post-trade reconciliation of securities 

transactions can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that involves numerous 

parties, operational steps, and message flows across the counterparties and their various agents 

involved in the transactions.  Distributed ledger technology has the potential to provide 

synchronized, real-time views for those counterparties and agents that can speed up the process 

and reduce errors. 

For cross-border transactions, the process for sending payments via the existing 

correspondent banking network can add time and money.  Distributed ledger technology could 

potentially lower the costs and time it takes funds to reach the recipient through more direct 

connections, reducing the number of intermediaries required to effect the transaction.   

The financial industry has been working on versions of distributed ledger technology that 

help address a number of concerns, including the loose governance around the maintenance, 

security, and reliability of the technology for cryptocurrencies.  Most projects are organized 

either as partnerships between technology and financial services firms or through consortia of 

technology firms, financial firms, and other interested parties.  To some degree, these alliances 

may provide prototype governance arrangements for future technology deployments in financial 

services.  In addition, there are exchanges and clearinghouses that are actively exploring the use 

of distributed ledger technology, which represent the more traditional model of multilateral
