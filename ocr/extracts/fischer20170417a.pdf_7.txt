recently, questions have been added to the surveys to identify uncertainty about 

reinvestment policy for each individual survey respondent and not just the dispersion of 

beliefs about the expected change across respondents. 

Starting with the market participant survey, as I noted earlier, one informational 

constraint that complicated the Fed’s understanding of market dynamics around the taper 

tantrum was the possible divergence of beliefs between the primary dealers, who were 

surveyed, and the market at large.  The differences between the expectations of the 

primary dealers and those of the panel for the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, shown in 

figure 2, provide some support for the view that the primary dealers’ views may well 

have differed from those of a wider range of market participants, but it would have been 

preferable to have a poll of market participants rather than forecasters.  Not long after the 

taper tantrum, in January 2014, the Desk began its separate Survey of Market 

Participants.  The survey panel currently consists of 30 so-called buy-side firms, 

including hedge funds and asset managers.     

Turning now to measures of individual uncertainty, in the April 2013 primary 

dealer survey, just prior to the taper tantrum, dealers were mostly questioned on their 

point estimates regarding the timing and conditions under which tapering would 

commence.  Respondents were asked to provide their expectation for the monthly pace of 

asset purchases after each of several upcoming policy meetings.  They were also asked to 

provide point estimates, or estimates of single particular values, for the quarter and year 

during which they expected asset purchases in Treasury and agency mortgage-backed 

securities to be completed.  While these questions did provide some notion of the 

variation in beliefs across respondents, they did not provide much information on how
