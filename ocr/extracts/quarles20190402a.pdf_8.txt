will draw extensively on academic advisors during all phases of the work we are undertaking.  I 

also encourage other experts in this field to look closely to the consultative document that will be 

coming from the study next year.  We welcome the input as we undertake the study of this 

signature issue from the crisis.  

 The task of this project, like the task of the FSB itself, is to foster insight on the road 

ahead.  The work of the FSB reflects the fact that, in a global financial system, we cannot see and 

address emerging problems alone.  Working as allies and colleagues, we have bound up most of 

the wounds from the last financial crisis.  To avoid reopening them--and returning to a 

fragmented international regime--we will have to recommit to collaboration, embrace insight 

where it emerges, and follow evidence where it leads.  With broad engagement, rigorous 

vigilance, and committed analysis, the risks ahead of us can be less dangerous than the ones we 

left behind.
