to make the longer-term loans their customers need.  If funding becomes scarce, banks 

become less willing to extend credit.  To maintain the flow of credit, the Federal Reserve 

has made clear that it will provide short-term credit to sound depository institutions as 

needed.  The lending program, known as discount window borrowing or primary credit, 

is provided at an above-market rate so that banks use the facility only as a backup source 

of funds. 

In theory, it is the higher rate that keeps banks from using the discount window as 

a regular source of funds.  In practice, bankers are quite suspicious that borrowing from 

the Federal Reserve will bring additional regulatory scrutiny.  In my banking days, I 

always described it as being like borrowing from my father.  I was always sure that at 

some point I would have to answer uncomfortable questions.  And since bank borrowing 

in normal times is rare, markets would likely view any such borrowing as a sign of 

weakness.  While the Fed doesn’t release individual borrower information, it does publish 

the total amount of outstanding loans weekly.  The sudden appearance of new discount 

window lending would likely send market participants scurrying to identify the borrower, 

and it would at a minimum lead to rumors about who was borrowing and why.  The 

resulting negative view of the discount window is known as stigma.  When uncertainty 

about the health of individual institutions or the industry as a whole increases, stigma 

intensifies as the market tries to identify the weaker players.  The dilemma facing the Fed 

is that when discount window borrowing is most needed to keep credit flowing, it is most 

stigmatized.   

The discount window is the Fed’s main tool for distributing money to the banking 

system in emergencies when bank-to-bank lending isn’t functioning, which is precisely
