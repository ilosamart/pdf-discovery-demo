increasingly being affected by the cybersecurity threats that banks face.  Recently, distributed 

denial-of-service attacks have caused temporary disruptions of some web services.  In 

September, the websites of several large banks were rendered inaccessible for several hours from 

attacks now attributed to possible foreign state-sponsored hackers.  One of the greatest threats 

facing not just banks but many businesses and government agencies is hacking--and the possible 

theft of proprietary data and personal information about customers. 

This cybersecurity threat is increasing at a time when more and more bank customers 

depend on electronic and mobile banking.  Workers are using their own laptops and smart 

phones or working remotely from home computers, and this increases the entry points to the 

systems that need to be protected.  In addition, customers and vendors are linking their systems, 

enhancing efficiency, but also creating more opportunities for potential intrusions. 

But even beyond the potential theft of data and disruption of service, cyberattacks can 

represent significant reputational risk because they have the potential to create dissatisfaction 

among many customers or, even more chilling, total loss of consumer confidence. 

Cooperative work between government and industry is underway.  Through the 

Department of the Treasury, many of the affected institutions have requested and received 

technical assistance from the Department of Homeland Security, which has been helpful in 

mitigating the attacks.  Some institutions are researching new technologies for defense against 

cyberattacks through their Internet service providers or security vendors, and others are 

reviewing their incident response processes to better manage recovery time and communications 

among information technology, employees, vendors, media, and customers.
