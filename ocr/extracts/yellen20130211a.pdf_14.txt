large--hardly surprising given the collapse in these sectors in 2008 and 2009--but 

manufacturing and other cyclically sensitive industries were hit hard as well, and 

employment in these industries has likewise recovered slowly.  Moreover, if skills 

mismatch in the labor market has led to an excess supply of workers in some sectors and 

a shortage of workers in others, then we would expect to see an atypical amount of 

variation in the balance between job openings and unemployment across sectors.  Based 

on this insight, researchers Ed Lazear and Jim Spletzer constructed quantitative measures 

of mismatch across industries and occupations.13  They found that their mismatch indexes 

were indeed elevated at the end of the Great Recession, as exhibit 8 shows.  But these 

measures have fallen over the course of the recovery to near pre-recession levels.  In 

addition, widespread mismatch between job vacancies and workers across different 

sectors might be expected to cause wage rates to rise relatively quickly in sectors with 

many job openings and relatively slowly in sectors with an excess supply of available 

workers.  But work by Jesse Rothstein fails to uncover evidence of such a pattern.14  

This and related research suggests to me, first, that a broad-based cyclical 

shortage of demand is the main cause of today’s elevated unemployment rate, and, 

second, that whatever problems there may be today with labor market functioning are 

likely to be substantially resolved as the broader economy improves and bolsters the 

demand for labor.
