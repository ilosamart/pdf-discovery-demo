possible.  And thus, the title of my talk today is “Sustaining Maximum Employment and 

Price Stability.”   

Midway through the second quarter of 2019, the U.S. economy is in a good place.  

Over the past four quarters, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged 

3.2 percent, which compares with an average growth rate of 2.3 percent since the 

recovery began in the summer of 2009.  By most estimates, fiscal policy played an 

important role in boosting growth in 2018, and I expect that fiscal policies will continue 

to support growth in 2019.  Over the same four quarters, the unemployment rate has 

averaged 3.8 percent, and the most recent reading, at 3.6 percent, is near its lowest level 

in 50 years.  Moreover, average monthly job gains have continued to outpace the 

increases needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.  Wages have been 

rising broadly in line with productivity and prices and thus, at present, do not signal 

rising cost-push pressure.  Notwithstanding strong growth and low unemployment, U.S. 

inflation remains muted—currently, it is somewhat below our 2 percent longer-run 

objective for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price deflator—and inflation 

expectations, according to a variety of measures, continue to be stable.   

As we look ahead, in our March Summary of Economic Projections, the median 

projection of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants was for GDP growth 

of around 2 percent as the modal, or most likely, outcome over the next three years, for 

PCE inflation to rise to 2 percent, and for the unemployment rate to edge up to 

3.9 percent by 2021.
