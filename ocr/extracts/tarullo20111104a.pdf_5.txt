weighted assets in order to meet any target earlier than at the time specified in the Basel III 

transition schedule.  However, because this issue is complicated somewhat both by certain 

expectations stated in Basel III and by the relationship of Basel III implementation to the Federal 

Reserve’s requirement for annual capital planning by certain large bank holding companies, I 

think it may be useful to provide some further details on our expectations.   

In the first place, the Federal Reserve will require bank holding companies that are 

subject to our proposed capital plan rule (generally companies with $50 billion or more in total 

assets) to take affirmative steps to improve capital ratios, such as external capital raises, when 

those steps would be needed to meet each Basel III transition target on time. 

 Next, I would remind everyone of a statement made by the Governors and Heads of 

Supervision (GHOS)--the oversight body of the Basel Committee--in announcing agreement on 

Basel III in September 2010.  The GHOS said that banks should “maintain prudent earnings 

retention policies” so as to meet both the new minimum equity standard and the conservation 

buffer “as soon as reasonably possible.”2  In the spirit of that statement, we will expect large 

bank holding companies that have not yet met the fully phased-in Basel III requirements 

(including any expected G-SIB capital surcharge) to improve their capital ratios steadily during 

the transition period through prudent earnings retention policies, even if they already meet any 

applicable intermediate targets.  In practical terms, we will monitor their progress through our 

review of the capital plans that we require large bank holding companies to submit annually.  

That is, we will be comfortable with proposed capital distributions only when we are convinced 

they are consistent with a bank holding company readily and without difficulty meeting the new
