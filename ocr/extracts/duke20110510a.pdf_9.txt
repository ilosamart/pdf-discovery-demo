Monetary Policy Report to the Congress in July 2010.8  Already, a few of the meeting 

participants’ recommendations have become a policy reality for the small business credit 

market. 

Participants in the nationwide meetings recommended improving access for CDFI 

loan funds to participate as guaranteed lenders in the SBA 7(a) program in order to 

increase the availability of credit to the underserved markets that depend on CDFIs.  

Later, the Small Business Administration (SBA) rolled out two pilot programs aimed at 

increasing the number of loans in these communities.  The Community Advantage 

program will increase the number of lower-dollar loans in underserved communities by 

allowing CDFIs, and other mission-focused lenders, to originate SBA 7(a) loans up to 

$250,000.  Also, the Small Loan Advantage program is structured to encourage larger, 

existing SBA lenders to make lower-dollar loans, which often benefit businesses in 

underserved markets.9  

Meeting participants also expressed support for additional low-cost, long-term 

capital for CDFIs.  Such capital would allow CDFIs to price loans to reflect their risk and 

still offer an affordable rate to small businesses that may not qualify under conventional 

bank standards and products.  One participant recommended that policymakers consider 

capital models for CDFIs that further leverage private dollars and create innovative 

incentives for the private sector to partner with experienced CDFI fund managers with 

strong risk-management capacity.  Soon, as part of the Small Business Jobs Act, the U.S. 

Treasury will provide up to $1 billion annually in federal guarantees for the next three
