only a muted market reaction.15  Perhaps in part, that is because the market participant 

survey actually revealed a considerable amount of weight, though not the majority, on an 

announcement occurring this year.  Or it is also possible that the diffuse expectations on 

timing prior to the release of the minutes were a factor in tamping down market volatility 

as market participants adjust their expectations.16   

My tentative conclusion from market responses to the limited amount of 

discussion of the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet that has taken place so 

far is that we appear less likely to face major market disturbances now than we did in the 

case of the taper tantrum.  But, of course, as we continue to discuss and eventually 

implement policies to reduce our balance sheet, we will have to continue to monitor 

market developments and expectations carefully.  

I would like to conclude by briefly discussing two issues.  First, a question:  Can 

the Fed be too predictable?  And, second, I will add a short comment on the SEP, the 

quarterly Summary of Economic Projections of the participants in the FOMC.   

With regard to whether the Fed can be too predictable, it is hard to argue that 

predictability in our reaction to economic data could be anything but positive.  To 

reference the beginning of my talk, clarity about the Fed’s reaction function allows 

markets to anticipate Fed actions and smoothly adjust along with the path of policy.   

But there is a circumstance where it might be reasonable to argue that the Fed 

could be too predictable--in particular, if the path of policy is not appropriately

afternoon down 3 to 4 basis points.  
16 Of note, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley’s comments on March 31, 
mentioning “sometime later this year or sometime in 2018” (as quoted in Spicer (2017), paragraph 2)) for 
the timing of a reinvestment policy change, may also have been a factor behind the muted market reaction 
to the March FOMC minutes.
