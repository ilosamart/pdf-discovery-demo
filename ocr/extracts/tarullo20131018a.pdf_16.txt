require this special mechanism.  Stronger capital and liquidity requirements that improve going-

concern resiliency will remain crucial to a reform agenda directed at containing the too-big-to-

fail problem.  The objectives of preventing failure and of reducing systemic costs in the event 

failure nonetheless occurs are complementary, rather than alternative, policy aims.   

  The most important systemic vulnerabilities that have not been subject to sufficient 

regulatory reforms are those created in short-term wholesale funding markets.  In the recent 

financial crisis, severe repercussions were felt throughout the financial system as short-term 

wholesale lending against all but the very safest collateral froze up.  Although short-term 

wholesale funding levels at major U.S. and foreign banking firms are lower than they were at the 

outset of the crisis, major global banks remain significant users.  High levels of such funding 

increase the probability of severe funding problems at, and thus the failure of, major financial 

firms.  They also complicate the orderly resolution of major financial firms in the event of 

failure.12  Indeed, precisely because an effective orderly resolution mechanism provides for 

continued funding of certain short-term creditors to staunch potentially calamitous runs, that type 

of funding will not be subject to the increased market discipline resulting from the creation of a 

credible resolution process.  This fact only strengthens the case for measures to limit the 

potential of short-term wholesale funding to be an accelerant of systemic problems. 

Conclusion 

 As I stated at the outset, I believe that creation of the orderly liquidation authority in 

Title II of Dodd-Frank, the work of the FDIC in developing that authority, the international 

consensus on the need for similar authority in relevant jurisdictions, and the continuing dialogue
