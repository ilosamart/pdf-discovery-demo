the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removed the remaining barriers to affiliation between investment 

banks and commercial banks in the United States, Basel capital requirements applied at a 

consolidated level to the activities of an investment bank or broker-dealer only if it did affiliate 

with a commercial bank.  Thus, the five large “free-standing” U.S. investment banks were 

generally not subject to full application of Basel capital standards.   

During the crisis, the ill-advised nature of this regulatory state of affairs became apparent.  

The decline in value of many mortgage-backed securities and the consequent market uncertainty 

as to the true value of that entire class of securities raised questions about the solvency of major 

broker-dealers.  Because the dealers were so highly leveraged and dependent on short-term 

financing, the uncertainty also led to serious liquidity strains, first at Bear Stearns and Lehman 

Brothers and eventually at most dealers--domestic and foreign owned.  Bear Stearns and Merrill 

Lynch were acquired by existing bank holding companies after coming close to failure.  Lehman 

Brothers went bankrupt.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies.   

Through its Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Federal Reserve provided substantial 

liquidity to the broker-dealer affiliates of the bank holding companies, as well as to the primary 

dealer subsidiaries of foreign banks.  At the same time, the shift in strategy of many foreign 

banks toward using their U.S. branches to raise dollars in short-term markets for lending around 

the world created another set of vulnerabilities that resulted in substantial and, relative to total 

assets, disproportionate use of the Federal Reserve’s discount window by foreign bank branches.   

The experience of the crisis made clear, first, that the perimeter of prudential regulation 

around U.S. financial institutions needed to be expanded.  As noted a moment ago, this had 

occurred de facto during the crisis.  The Dodd-Frank Act has given a legal foundation for this 

change, first by mandating that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will remain subject to
