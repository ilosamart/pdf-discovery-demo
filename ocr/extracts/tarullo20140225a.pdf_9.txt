and employment associated with bouts of serious financial instability gives ample 

justification.  Of course, this preliminary observation underscores the fact that the 

identification of systemic risks, especially those based on the putative emergence of asset 

bubbles, is not a straightforward exercise.  The eventual impact of the bursting of the pre-

crisis housing bubble on financial stability went famously underdiagnosed by 

policymakers and many private analysts.  But there would be considerable economic 

downside in reacting with policy measures each time a case could be made that a bubble 

was developing.  That is, there is ample opportunity for both Type 1 and Type 2 errors.  

As the metrics for assessing systemic risks continue to improve, this problem may be 

alleviated, but I suspect it will never be eliminated. 

We are paying close attention to the macroprudential risks posed by the low 

interest rate environment, particularly given the possibility that interest rates may remain 

historically low for some time even after the FOMC begins to increase its target for the 

federal funds rate.  The Federal Reserve has, as a result of a number of organizational 

changes made since the crisis, a more focused structure for monitoring potential risks to 

financial stability and using the information we glean from this monitoring to shape our 

supervisory and regulatory actions.  One prominent change has been the reorientation of 

our supervision of large bank holding companies through the creation of the Large 

Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, or LISCC, to specifically incorporate 

systemic risk considerations.  Another has been the creation of the Office of Financial 

Stability Policy and Research, which is charged with monitoring financial risks, 

analyzing the implications for financial stability, and identifying macroprudential policies 

for mitigating detected risks.
