particularly those associated with housing booms and busts--have often been associated 

with many years of subsequent weak performance.  While this result allows for many 

interpretations, one possibility is that financial crises, or the deep recessions that typically 

accompany them, may reduce an economy’s potential growth rate, at least for a time. 

The accumulating evidence does appear consistent with the financial crisis and 

the associated recession having reduced the potential growth rate of our economy 

somewhat during the past few years.  In particular, slower growth of potential output 

would help explain why the unemployment rate has declined in the face of the relatively 

modest output gains we have seen during the recovery.  Output normally has to increase 

at about its longer-term trend just to create enough jobs to absorb new entrants to the 

labor market, and faster-than-trend growth is usually needed to reduce unemployment.  

So the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at 

about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been 

lower than the roughly 2-1/2 percent rate that appeared to be in place before the crisis.3

3 That said, GDP growth in excess of potential is probably not the whole explanation for the decline in 
unemployment.  Some of the decline in unemployment during the recovery could also reflect a reversal of 
the especially large increases that occurred during the deepest part of the recession, when firms appeared to 
cut their workforces by greater numbers than would normally be associated with the decline in GDP.  (For 
a discussion, see Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Recent Developments in the Labor Market,” speech delivered at 
the National Association for Business Economics 28th Annual Economic Policy Conference, Arlington, 
Va., March 26,   www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120326a.htm.)  A reduction in the 
number of people receiving extended or emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have 
contributed to the decline in unemployment as well.
