firms also are holding high levels of liquid assets, so net leverage is not elevated.  Firms 

have also lengthened their maturity profiles, and interest coverage ratios are high.  As the 

next slide shows, Greenwood and Hanson’s measure of the share of high-yield debt in 

overall issuance is at a relatively low level.12  And this debt is now held more by 

unlevered investors.  Overall, I do not see leveraged finance markets as posing undue 

financial stability risks.  And if risk-taking does not threaten financial stability, it is not 

the Fed’s job to stop people from losing (or making) money. 

As I said, a mixed picture.  Low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking and 

higher leverage in some sectors and have weighed on profitability in others, but the areas 

where there are signs of excess are isolated. 

Conclusion 

To sum up, low interest rates have supported economic activity and gradually 

brought us back to full employment and 2 percent inflation.  Better regulation and risk 

management have so far minimized the tradeoffs between our macroeconomic objectives, 

on the one hand, and financial stability, on the other.  Still, a period of low rates for a 

long time could present significant challenges for monetary policy.  It could also put 

pressure on the business models of some financial institutions.  Ultimately, the only way 

to get sustainably higher interest rates is to improve the broader environment for growth, 

by adopting policies designed to increase productivity and potential output over the long 

term--policies that are mainly outside the scope of our work at the Federal Reserve.13
