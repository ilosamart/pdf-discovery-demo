(figure 5).  Unusually large leveraged buyouts were common.  Banks entered into very 

large, long duration commitments to fund deals that faced significant regulatory and other 

requirements before they could close.  Estimates vary, but when the crisis emerged and 

liquidity in these markets evaporated, large dealers were left holding roughly $350 billion 

in loans and commitments in their pipelines that they could not sell, and these positions 

remained on banks’ balance sheets for a time.  As loan values declined an unprecedented 

40 percent (figure 6), there were significant mark-to-market losses on these assets, which 

may have contributed to doubts about the condition of institutions at the core of the 

system.  Subsequent default rates were not outsized by historical standards, and recovery 

rates were in line with past averages (figure 7).  Of course, the Fed’s monetary policy 

eased financial conditions across the economy and enabled the refinancing of many of 

these loans at lower rates and with issuer-friendly terms. 

Because leveraged loans were generally not held in investment structures that 

used short-term, confidence-sensitive funding, these investments were not a principal 

focal point of runs such as those that plagued MBS funding structures.  CLOs were the 

largest institutional investors in leveraged loans, holding over 50 percent of loans 

outstanding.  These structures are funded with stable capital, with both equity and debt 

tranches committed for several years--a longer duration than that of the underlying loans.   

This picture of the pre-crisis leveraged lending market is one of a sharp decline in 

underwriting standards and a breakdown of risk management, resulting in a large risk 

buildup involving many of the G-SIBs--something the Fed and other regulators want to 

avoid.  Leveraged loans may not have been a material cause of the crisis, and leveraged 

lending alone would likely not have threatened the overall health of the large institutions.
