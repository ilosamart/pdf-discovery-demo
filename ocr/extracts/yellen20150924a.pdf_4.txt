there was no stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return--a 

conclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation.   

Today many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s 

and 1970s--its high level and lack of a stable anchor--reflected a combination of factors, 

including chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and 

food price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in 

actual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation.  Together, 

these various factors caused inflation--actual and expected--to ratchet higher over time.  

Ultimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what 

happened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve 

was insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the 

shocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances.  

In late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy 

to reduce inflation.  In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic 

downturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less 

than 4 percent from 1983 to 1990.  Inflation came down further following the 1990-91 

recession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many 

years.  Since the recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced 

inflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting 

the gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery.  

Examining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long-term trend reveals another 

important change in inflation dynamics.  With the caveat that these results are based on a 

specific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid-
