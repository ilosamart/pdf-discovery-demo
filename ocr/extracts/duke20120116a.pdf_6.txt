We had to make many difficult decisions in the darkest days of the crisis.  For me, 

the decisions were made a bit less difficult by several factors.  First and foremost was the 

calm, decisive leadership by Chairman Bernanke, whose lifelong study of economics and 

economic history provided unique preparation for his own role in history.  Almost as 

important were the hundreds of Fed economists, lawyers, bank supervisors, and market 

specialists who worked around the clock to craft creative solutions to every financial 

market challenge.  I will never know how many hours it took to develop and implement 

all of the programs they presented in a series of emergency Board meetings.  I do know 

that they responded to every question and strived to mitigate every risk that was 

identified.  And while the strain was evident in their tired eyes, the collegiality and 

intellectual rigor that I have come to know as a hallmark of the Federal Reserve never 

wavered.  Finally, for me, it was the image of all those small businesses that depended on 

credit to run their businesses.   

The Fed provided credit to banks large and small.  In addition, through other 

programs, we supported the market for securities backed by loans to households and 

businesses, including loans for business equipment, inventory, insurance payments, 

business credit cards, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.  To be 

sure, lenders reacted to uncertain economic conditions and weaker borrowers by 

tightening credit standards.  But with liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve, loans to 

borrowers who met the tighter standards continued to flow.  The U.S. economy still faces 

challenges, but I am convinced that the forceful actions of the Federal Reserve in 2008 

helped prevent what clearly would have been a far worse scenario.
