proposed capital surcharges for systemically important firms will be another important step 

forward.  But these reforms are primarily directed at the consolidated level, with little attention 

to vulnerabilities posed by internationally active banks in host markets.  The risks associated 

with large intra-group funding flows have remained largely unaddressed.  Managing 

international regulatory initiatives also has become more difficult, as the number of complex 

items on the agenda has increased.  And despite continued work by the Financial Stability Board, 

challenges to cross-border resolution are likely to remain significant.  For the foreseeable future, 

then, our regulatory system must recognize that while internationally active banks live globally, 

they may well die locally.  

Quite apart from the need to act pragmatically under the circumstances, it is not clear that 

we should aim toward extensive harmonization of national regulatory practices related to foreign 

banking organizations.  The nature and extent of foreign banking activities vary substantially 

across national markets, suggesting that regulatory responses might best vary as well.  For 

instance, the importance of the U.S. dollar in many international transactions can motivate 

foreign banks to use their U.S. operations to raise dollar funding for their international 

operations, potentially creating vulnerabilities.  Such a model is unlikely to prevail in most other 

host financial markets around the world. 

Indeed, in response to financial stability risks highlighted during the crisis, ongoing 

challenges associated with the resolution of large cross-border firms, and the limitations of the 

international reform agenda, several national authorities have already introduced their own 

policies to fortify the resources of internationally active banks within their geographic 

boundaries.  Regulators in the United Kingdom, for example, have recently increased 

requirements for liquidity to cover local operations of domestic and foreign banks, set stricter
