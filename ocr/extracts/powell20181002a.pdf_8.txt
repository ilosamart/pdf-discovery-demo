Fortunately, things changed.  The estimates of both B and C fall in value as the 

estimation sample shifts forward in time.  In the most recent samples, the Phillips curve is 

nearly flat, with B very near zero, and C is about 0.25, meaning that roughly one fourth of 

any rise or fall in inflation carries forward.  These results give numerical form to what we 

see in the right-hand panel of figure 3, covering the recent period:  Large and persistent 

moves in the unemployment gap were associated with, at most, modest transitory moves 

in inflation.   

What Led to the Changes in the Phillips curve? 

These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, 

which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation.  To 

provide a sound basis for monetary policy, it is important to understand what happened 

and why, so we can avoid a return to the bad old days of the 1970s.  Like many, I believe 

better monetary policy has played a central role.9    

To understand the mechanism, let us ask how central banks could, presumably 

inadvertently, amplify and extend the duration of inflationâ€™s response to labor market 

tightness.  To do so, the central bank could persistently ease the stance of monetary 

policy in response to an uptick in inflation.  No responsible central banker today would 

intentionally do this, but much research suggests that during the Great Inflation, 

misunderstandings about how the economy worked led the Fed effectively to behave in 

this manner.10  Some policymakers may have believed the misguided notion that 

                                                 
9 The account I present of the role of anchored expectations in stabilizing the economy and favorably 
altering Phillips curve dynamics echoes a long-held view at the Fed.  See Bernanke (2007) and Yellen 
(2015).  Kiley (2015) reviews the recent research literature on this topic.  Blanchard (2016) presents a very 
similar perspective.  
10 To be clear, during the periods of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, the FOMC was generally 
raising the federal funds rate, but with inflation rising, the real federal funds rate was rising much more 
slowly or even falling.  In this sense, the effective stance of policy was tightening slowly or was easing.
