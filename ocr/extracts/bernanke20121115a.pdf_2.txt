Good afternoon.  I’d like to thank John Bryant and Operation HOPE for inviting 

me to speak today.  I’d also like to congratulate Operation HOPE and the Ebenezer 

Baptist Church on the grand opening of the HOPE Financial Dignity Center, which holds 

the promise of becoming a tremendous resource for the people of Atlanta and sits next to 

Martin Luther King’s home church.  Dr. King’s legacy to our society is strong and 

enduring, and the new center is very much in the spirit of his work.    

The past few years have been difficult for many Americans and their 

communities.  At the Federal Reserve, we understand the depth of the problem and the 

need for action, and we will continue to use the policy tools that we have to help support 

economic recovery.  We also know that the burdens of a weak economy and the benefits 

of economic growth often are not equally shared, and that, to be truly effective, 

policymakers must take into account how their decisions affect the least advantaged, not 

just the economy as a whole. 

My remarks today will focus on an important part of our economy, the housing 

sector.  Housing and housing finance played a central role in touching off the financial 

crisis and the associated recession, and the ensuing wave of foreclosures wreaked great 

damage on communities across the country.  As I will discuss, for the first time in a 

number of years, the housing sector is improving, adding to growth and jobs.  But the 

housing revival still faces significant obstacles, and the benefits of that revival remain 

quite uneven.  Strengthening and broadening the housing recovery remain a critical 

challenge for policymakers, lenders, and community leaders.  The degree to which that 

challenge is met will help determine the strength and sustainability of the economic 

recovery and the extent to which its benefits are broadly felt.
