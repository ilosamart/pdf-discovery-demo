the inherent fallibility of the tools in a world of regulatory arbitrage; because the scope of 

our regulatory authority does not extend equally to all parts of the financial system; and 

because risk-taking naturally tends to be structured in a nontransparent way that can 

make it hard to recognize.  In some cases, regulatory tools may also be difficult to adjust 

on a timely basis--if, for example, doing so requires extended interagency negotiation. 

Second, while monetary policy may not be quite the right tool for the job, it has 

one important advantage relative to supervision and regulation--namely that it gets in all 

of the cracks.  The one thing that a commercial bank, a broker-dealer, an offshore hedge 

fund, and a special purpose ABCP vehicle have in common is that they all face the same 

set of market interest rates.  To the extent that market rates exert an influence on risk 

appetite, or on the incentives to engage in maturity transformation, changes in rates may 

reach into corners of the market that supervision and regulation cannot.

Third, in response to concerns about numbers of instruments, we have seen in 

recent years that the monetary policy toolkit consists of more than just a single 

instrument.  We can do more than adjust the federal funds rate.  By changing the 

composition of our asset holdings, as in our recently completed maturity extension 

program (MEP), we can influence not just the expected path of short rates, but also term 

premiums and the shape of the yield curve.  Once we move away from the zero lower 

bound, this second instrument might continue to be helpful, not simply in providing 

accommodation, but also as a complement to other efforts on the financial stability front. 

To see why, recall the central role that maturity transformation--the funding of 

long-term assets with short-term, run-prone liabilities--can play in propagating systemic

 A similar argument is made by Borio and Drehmann (2009), who write: “But in sophisticated and open 

financial systems, in which the scope for regulatory arbitrage is high, the interest rate has the merit of 

setting the universal price of leverage.  It reaches parts that other instruments cannot reach.”
