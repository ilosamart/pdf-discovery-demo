Such low rates of resource utilization are typically accompanied by falling 

inflation.  And, indeed, as shown in figure 2, measures of inflation for personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE) have declined significantly since 2008.  For the total 

PCE inflation rate, the underlying trend is obscured to some extent by large swings in 

energy prices.  However, the downward trend is clearly evident from the evolution of 

core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy.  The 12-month 

change in core PCE prices dropped from about 2-1/2 percent in mid-2008 to around 

1-1/2 percent in 2009 and declined further to less than 1 percent by late 2010.2   

As inflation has trended downward, measures of underlying inflation have fallen 

somewhat below the levels of about 2 percent or a bit less that most Committee 

participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with the FOMCâ€™s dual mandate.  

In particular, a modest positive rate of inflation over time allows for a slightly higher 

average level of nominal interest rates, thereby creating more scope for the FOMC to 

respond to adverse shocks.  A modest positive inflation rate also reduces the risk that 

such shocks could result in deflation, which can be associated with poor macroeconomic 

performance.   

Of course, if incoming information last autumn had been pointing to greater 

momentum in the prospects for economic growth or to a rapid escalation in inflation, then 

the case for further monetary policy easing might have seemed less pressing.  However, 

such was not the case.  The Federal Reserve publishes a Summary of Economic 

                                                 
2 This downward trend in inflation has not been confined to any specific sectors of the economy, such as 
housing.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas constructs a trimmed-mean rate of PCE 
inflation by removing the tails of the distribution of monthly price changes for disaggregated spending 
categories.  That measure of underlying inflation has also declined fairly steadily since mid-2008 and 
dipped slightly below 1 percent last autumn.  Moreover, diffusion indexes of price changes--which subtract 
the percentage of items in the consumption basket with price increases from the percentage of items with 
price decreases--also fell noticeably over this period, providing further evidence that the decline in inflation 
has been widespread across many categories of consumer spending.
