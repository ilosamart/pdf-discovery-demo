nearly always the case, labor shortages in discrete skilled job categories may be placing 

some upward pressures on wages for those jobs (though, judging by such aggregate data 

as we have, not by as much as one might have thought based on the widespread anecdotal 

reports of skilled labor shortages).   

But one sees only the earliest signs of a much-needed, broader wage recovery.  

Compensation increases have been running at the historically low level of just over 

2 percent annual rates since the onset of the Great Recession, with concomitantly lower 

real wage gains.  The reasons for the lag in wage gains in the context of continuing 

moderate growth are not totally clear.  Nominal wage rigidity on the downside may have 

played a role to the extent that employers were reluctant to cut nominal wages even in the 

period from late 2008 to early 2009, when they were eliminating jobs in staggering 

numbers.  The secular labor market factors mentioned earlier are also likely relevant.   

There is, of course, also a debate around the question of how much of current 

unemployment--particularly long-term unemployment--is structural and thus how much 

slack still exists in labor markets.  Last week Chair Yellen explained why substantial 

slack very likely remains.  I would add to her explanation only the observation that, in the 

face of some uncertainty as to how best to measure slack, we are well advised to proceed 

pragmatically.  We should remain attentive to evidence that labor markets have actually 

tightened to the point that there is demonstrable inflationary pressure that would place at 

risk maintenance of the FOMCâ€™s stated inflation target (which, of course, we are 

currently not meeting on the downside).  But we should not rush to act preemptively in 

anticipation of such pressures based on arguments about the potential increase in 

structural unemployment in recent years.
