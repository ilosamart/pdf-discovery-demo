For derivatives, there is interest in the potential for digital ledger protocols to 

enable self-execution and possibly self-enforcement of contractual clauses, in the context 

of “smart contracts.”  

As we engage with industry and stakeholders to assess the potential applications 

of digital ledger and related technologies in the payment, clearing, and settlement arena, 

we will be guided by the principles of efficiency, safety and integrity, and financial 

stability. 

Efficiency  

Many are excited about the potential for these new technologies to reduce costs 

and frictions, such as those associated with collateral management and custodial services, 

reduce settlement risk, enhance security, increase transparency, and offer new services.  

But there are also concerns about the costs and risks from the early adoption of rapidly 

evolving and uncertain technologies and technological hurdles in integrating new 

technologies into legacy systems and achieving interoperability across different ledgers 

and networks.  There are questions about the need for substantial new investments to 

obtain capabilities like real-time processing where these capabilities already exist at some 

of the industry’s core infrastructures.  There are also cautions that realizing the full 

potential of distributed ledger technologies could take many years. 

Much of the case for adopting distributed ledger technologies revolves around 

achieving greater efficiency and reducing time and risks to post-trade clearing and 

settlement.  But first, important technological challenges will need to be addressed to 

permit widespread adoption and migration away from legacy systems and networks.  

These include the need for standardization, the development of protocols that will permit
