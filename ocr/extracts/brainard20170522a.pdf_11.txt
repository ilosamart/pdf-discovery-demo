African American and Hispanic homeowners households are more likely to lose their 

jobs in a recession and are also more likely to live in neighborhoods with concentrated 

job loss led to even larger house price declines and more foreclosures among these 

households.27  Indeed, there are many low-income neighborhoods in which many 

homeowners remain “underwater” on their mortgages even today.  

Community development organizations are putting this more nuanced view of 

asset building into practice and thereby increasing opportunities for individuals to make 

smart investments in their future.  Better Family Life, a community group I visited in 

North St. Louis, provides would-be homebuyers with education and counseling on how to 

manage the costs of homeownership, tools to navigate real estate markets, and 

information on lending.28  There is ample research demonstrating that housing counseling 

makes a notable improvement in the likelihood that asset building through 

homeownership will pay off for first-time buyers in low- to moderate-income 

communities.29 

Similarly, under the right circumstances, education can be a critical investment in 

the future and a path to opportunity, leading to higher wages and improved financial 

outcomes.  Over the past several decades, the earnings premium for those with a college 

degree relative to those with a high school education has risen substantially, making 

higher education, on average, even more valuable.30
