quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates.  These rates remain low, and my 

colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong 

economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans. 

As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial 

crisis--a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and, 

for some, their hopes and dreams.  In addition to holding interest rates low to support the 

recovery, we have taken many steps to make the financial system safer.  In particular, we 

are holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and 

liquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take.  I am 

confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the 

financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.  We continue 

to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is 

both effective and efficient. 

Thank you.  I am happy to take your questions.
