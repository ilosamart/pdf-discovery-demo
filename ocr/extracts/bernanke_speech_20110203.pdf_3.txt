inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as Europe’s debt problems roiled 

global financial markets.   

More recently, however, we have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining 

recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold.  Notably, we learned 

last week that households increased their spending in the fourth quarter, in real terms, at 

an annual rate of more than 4 percent.  Although a significant portion of this pickup 

reflected strong sales of motor vehicles, the recent gains in consumer spending look to

software grew robustly over most of last year, as firms replaced aging equipment and as 

the demand for their products and services expanded.  In contrast, in the housing sector, 

the overhang of vacant and foreclosed homes continues to weigh heavily on both home 

prices and residential construction.  Overall, however, improving household and business 

confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and more-supportive financial conditions, 

including an apparent increase in the willingness of banks to make loans, seems likely to 

lead to a more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year. 

While indicators of spending and production have, on balance, been encouraging, 

the job market has improved only slowly.  Following the loss of about 8-1/2 million jobs 

in 2008 and 2009, private-sector employment showed gains in 2010.  However, these 

gains were barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other 

new entrants to the labor force and, therefore, not enough to significantly reduce the 

overall unemployment rate.  Recent data do provide some grounds for optimism on the 

employment front; for example, initial claims for unemployment insurance have 

generally been trending down, and indicators of job openings and firms’ hiring plans
