close to mandate-consistent levels for inflation and unemployment, the risks that 

monetary policy must balance are now more symmetric and less skewed to the downside.  

Raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the economic expansion while 

moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and inflation expectations down the 

road that could be costly to reverse.   

As I calibrate, in the months ahead, the pace and ultimate destination for 

monetary policy adjustments that will best allow the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate 

objectives, it will be important to me to evaluate a wide range of economic and financial 

market indicators to complement the predictions yielded by model-based scenarios.  As I 

look ahead, if strong growth and robust employment gains were to continue into 2019 

and be accompanied by a material rise in actual and expected inflation, that circumstance 

would indicate to me that additional policy normalization might well be required beyond 

what I currently expect.  By contrast, if strong growth and employment gains were to 

continue and be accompanied by stable inflation, inflation expectations, and expectations 

for Fed policy, that situation, to me, would argue against raising short-term interest rates 

by more than I currently expect.  

Conclusion 

In closing, with the economy operating as close as it has in a decade to the 

Federal Reserveâ€™s dual-mandate objectives of price stability and maximum employment, 

I believe monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at 

sustaining growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation 

at or close to the 2 percent objective.  Even after our most recent policy decision to raise 

the range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, monetary policy remains
