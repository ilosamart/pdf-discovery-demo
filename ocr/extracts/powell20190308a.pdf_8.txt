Committee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions . . . about the likely path 

of rates.”6  If the Committee remains largely out of the business of explicit forward 

guidance, we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that 

sometimes surrounds the dots.  

As readers of the FOMC minutes will know, at our last meeting in January there 

was an impromptu discussion among some participants of general concerns about the 

dots.  My own view is that, if properly understood, the dot plot can be a constructive 

element of comprehensive policy communication.  Let me follow my two predecessors as 

Chair in attempting to advance that proper understanding.   

Each participant’s dots reflect that participant’s view of the policy that would be 

appropriate in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely.  As someone who has filled 

out an SEP projection 27 times over the last seven years, I can say that there are times 

when I feel that something like the “most likely” scenario I write down is, indeed, 

reasonably likely to happen.  At other times, when uncertainty around the outlook is 

unusually high, I dutifully write down what I see as the appropriate funds rate path in the 

most likely scenario, but I do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted, 

for what is “most likely” may not be particularly likely.  Very different scenarios may be 

similarly likely.  Further, at times downside risks may deserve significant weight in 

policy deliberations.  In short, as Chairman Bernanke explained, the SEP projections are 

merely “inputs” to policy that do not convey “the risks, the uncertainties, all the things 

that inform our collective judgment.”7
