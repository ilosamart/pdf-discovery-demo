flow of loans to creditworthy borrowers.  The linkages that connect community banks, 

the communities they serve, and their bank supervisors, are especially interwoven and 

essential.   

Now I am happy to report that our bank and, for the most part, our customers 

pulled through that crisis in the early 1990s.  And I continued to lend to many of those 

same customers for another 15 years.  I am pleased to see that you have chosen as the 

theme for this conference “Solutions for the Changing Environment” as it indicates 

confidence that you too will continue to thrive and support your communities.  For it is 

critical that you do so:  Our economy needs strong community banks that are able to meet 

the financial needs of their communities and their customers. 

In my remarks today, I intend to focus on your role as lenders.  First, I will 

discuss commercial real estate, the loan category that for most community banks is 

causing the most stress and receiving the most attention.  Then I would like to talk about 

credit availability for small businesses, a key customer segment for community banks.   

Finally, I will offer some thoughts about the role of supervisors in encouraging the flow 

of loans to creditworthy borrowers.  Throughout the discussion, I will focus on recent 

loan guidance issued by the Federal Reserve along with our fellow banking regulators 

and the steps we at the Fed are taking to ensure that the policies we set in Washington 

make it into the field to the examiners you see in your banks.   

Before I begin, I would like to make one point of clarification: When I reference 

community bank statistics, I will refer to the segment of banks with less than $10 billion 

in total assets.
