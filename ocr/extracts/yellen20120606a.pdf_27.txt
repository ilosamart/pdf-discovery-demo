Behavior of Inflation and Unemployment  
 

• Does the stability of inflation in the face of high 
unemployment mean that unemployment is 
structural, not cyclical?   

• Simple Phillips curve model predicts downward 
pressure on inflation from labor market slack.  

• But cross country evidence shows that once 
inflation is low, it is less responsive to slack.   

• This nonlinearity may reflect downward 
nominal wage rigidity.
