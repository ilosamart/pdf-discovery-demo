their employer.  Today, the ACH operates with important roles for the private sector and the Fed, 

is available nationwide, and constitutes a vital piece of infrastructure supporting earlier access to 

funds and reliable settlement of payments.5   

Moving to 24/7 Real-Time Settlement 

Today, our payment system is again at a crossroads.  There is a growing gap between the 

transaction capabilities we need and expect in the digital economy--fast, convenient, and 

accessible to all--and the underlying settlement capabilities.    

Consumers and businesses increasingly expect to complete transactions with a simple 

keystroke, swipe, or tap.  If I want to split a restaurant tab with my friends, I can use an app on 

my smartphone.  But my friends have to be signed up for the same app to receive the payment, 

and they may have to wait for confirmation that the funds have moved from the app into their 

bank accounts before they can use the funds outside the app.  Similarly, if I want to make a 

purchase from a vendor online, all I have to do is upload my payment information and touch a 

screen to complete the purchase immediately.  But that payment in turn may not be immediately 

available to the seller.   

While we are seeing a growing demand for payments to be as instantaneous as the apps 

on our smartphones, in reality, under the hood, these payments currently rely on a patchwork of 

systems that can result in inefficiencies and delays, as well as uneven access.  To meet the 

expectations of our 24/7 app economy, there is a growing demand for broadly and nationally 

accessible faster payments that make funds available immediately.  Faster payments would allow

payments, totaling $145.3 trillion in value. See www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/2016-payments-
