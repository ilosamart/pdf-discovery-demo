Because the main way in which a stronger dollar affects U.S. output is through 

causing real exports to decline, I will begin by focusing on the factors determining the 

export response.  Broadly speaking, an appreciation of the dollar reduces U.S. exports 

because it causes the relative price of U.S. goods to rise in foreign markets; for example, 

the price in yen of a U.S.-made pair of jeans will rise.  To gauge the quantitative effects 

on exports, the thick blue line in figure 2 shows the response of U.S. real exports to a 

10 percent dollar appreciation that is derived from a large econometric model of U.S. 

trade maintained by the Federal Reserve Board staff.4  Real exports fall about 3 percent 

after a year and more than 7 percent after three years.5  The gradual response of exports 

reflects that it takes some time for households and firms in foreign countries to substitute 

away from the now more expensive U.S.-made goods.   

A stronger dollar makes foreign goods cheaper for U.S. consumers and hence 

boosts U.S. real imports.  Nevertheless, an extensive literature has found that the degree 

of pass-through of exchange rate changes to U.S. import prices is low, as foreign 

exporters prefer to keep the dollar price of the goods they sell in the U.S. market 

relatively constant.  For example, a typical estimate is that an appreciation of the dollar of 

10 percent causes U.S. non-oil import prices to fall only about 3 percent after a year and 

only slightly more thereafter.6  The low exchange rate pass-through helps account for the 

more modest estimated response of U.S. real imports to a 10 percent exchange rate 

                                                   
4 The results presented here are taken from the staff’s U.S. International Transactions (USIT) model of the 
U.S. external sector.  A forthcoming article in the Federal Reserve Board’s International Finance 
Discussion Papers, or IFDP, Notes series will provide further detail on the structure and estimation of the 
trade block of the USIT model that is used in these computations.  
5 It may be useful to note that exports in 2014 amounted to about 13-1/2 percent of GDP and imports to 
16-1/2 percent of gross domestic product.   
6 These estimates are consistent with recent analysis by Gopinath (2015) and Bussière, Delle Chiaie, and 
Peltonen (2014).
