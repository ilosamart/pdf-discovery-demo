That aside, the Fed’s ability to act as lender of last resort to insured depository 

institutions was not significantly impeded by the Dodd-Frank Act.   

The Shadow Banking System 

During a crisis, liquidity pressures can materialize in the shadow banking sector--

that is, the set of nonbanks that use a range of markets and instruments to provide 

financing to borrowers.  At the time of their initial difficulties, both Bear Stearns and 

Lehman Brothers were in the shadow banking system.   

To help improve the resiliency of this sector, a few new regulations have been 

introduced, including the final rule on risk retention in securitization issued jointly by the 

Federal Reserve and five other agencies in October 2014 and the new money market fund 

rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2014.  Other 

provisions implemented since the crisis that should help address risks in the nonbank 

segment of the credit system include the central clearing requirement for standardized 

over-the-counter derivatives and margin requirements for uncleared swaps, as well as 

disclosure requirements that provide investors with standardized loan-level information 

for securitizations backed by certain assets, including residential and commercial 

mortgages.4  More recently, the SEC has also proposed rules to modernize data reporting 

by investment companies and advisers, as well as to enhance liquidity risk management 

and disclosure by open-end mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve can, if needed in an emergency, and with the 

approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, lend through a broad-based facility, including 

                                                 
4 The SEC’s rule on disclosure requirements for certain securitizations was adopted by the SEC in August 
2014.  The intent of these rules is to make it easier for investors to review and access the information they 
need to make informed investment decisions, including independently conducting due diligence so as to 
better assess the credit risk of asset-backed securities.
