Figure 9 shows that access to quality early childhood education has improved since the 

1990s, but it remains limited--41 percent of children were enrolled in state or federally 

supported programs in 2013.  Gains in enrollment have stalled since 2010, as has growth 

in funding, in both cases because of budget cuts related to the Great Recession.  These 

cuts have reduced per-pupil spending in state-funded programs by 12 percent after 

inflation, and access to such programs, most of which are limited to lower-income 

families, varies considerably from state to state and within states, since local funding is 

often important.25  In 2010, the United States ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in 

the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education.26 

Similarly, the quality and the funding levels of public education at the primary 

and secondary levels vary widely, and this unevenness limits public education’s 

equalizing effect.  The United States is one of the few advanced economies in which 

public education spending is often lower for students in lower-income households than 

for students in higher-income households.27  Some countries strive for more or less equal 

funding, and others actually require higher funding in schools serving students from

25 The share of four-year-olds in state-funded pre-K programs increased from 14 percent in 2002 to 27 

percent in 2010 but has been 28 percent since.  Head Start enrollments have been fairly steady since 2005.  

Forty-one percent of four-year-olds were enrolled in federally funded Head Start or state-funded pre-K 

education programs in 2013.  See National Institute for Early Education Research (2013), The State of
