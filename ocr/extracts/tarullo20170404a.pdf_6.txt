analysis and experience.  But partisan divisions prevented this from happening.  And the novelty 

of many of the forms of regulations adopted by financial regulators, either in implementing the 

Dodd-Frank Act or under existing authorities, almost assures that some recalibration and 

reconsiderations will be warranted on the basis of experience.   

 So there are clearly some changes that can be made without endangering financial 

stability.  Foremost among these are the various bank size thresholds established in the Dodd-

Frank Act or in agency regulations for the application of stricter prudential requirements.  For 

example, as I have said for several years now, we have found that the $50 billion in assets 

threshold established in the Dodd-Frank Act for banks to be “systemically important,” and thus 

subject to a range of stricter regulations, was set too low.  Similarly, the $10 billion asset 

threshold for banks to conduct their own required stress tests seems too low.  And the fact that 

community banks are subject at all to some of the Dodd-Frank Act rules seems unnecessary to 

protect safety and soundness, and quite burdensome on the very limited compliance capabilities 

of these small banks. 

 Beyond the thresholds issue, though, are there statutory provisions or regulations whose 

substance could be adjusted to better match economic or compliance costs with financial stability 

benefits?  Again, it would be very surprising if this did not prove to be the case over time.  It 

would also be surprising if we did not find areas in which rules needed to be strengthened in 

order to achieve financial stability goals, particularly as financial markets change.  Generally, I 

think it is a bit early to judge the balance of costs and benefits of many of the new rules.  Some 

are not yet fully implemented.  Firms are still in the process of adjusting to the new rules.  And it 

is still somewhat difficult to determine, for example, what should be considered “normal” levels 

of liquidity or lending, insofar as the pre-crisis period was one in which high levels of both
