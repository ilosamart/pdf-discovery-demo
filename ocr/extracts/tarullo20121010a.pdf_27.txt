promulgated under Dodd-Frank.  They could also include action by FSOC member agencies, 

such as the bank regulatory agencies imposing restrictions on regulated financial institutions’ 

ability to sponsor, borrow from, invest in, or provide credit to money market funds that do not 

have structural protections.  From my perspective, at least, each of the options open to the FSOC 

and the rest of its constituent agencies is decidedly a second-best alternative as compared to a 

change in SEC rules to remove the fixed net asset value exception, to require a capital buffer that 

would staunch or buffer runs, or measures of similar effect.  And, when I say second-best here, I 

mean to include the funds themselves.  The protective tools available to the rest of us do not fit 

the problem precisely and thus will not regulate at the least cost to the funds while still 

mitigating financial risk.  But that is the legal situation we all confront.  My hope, of course, is 

that recent indications that other SEC commissioners are now willing to move forward with 

reforms will lead to the SEC adopting first-best measures in the near-term. 

The money market fund example is a noteworthy case study in substantial part because of 

the interesting institutional issues it raises.  More generally, though, the capacity of private 

financial market actors to create what are, at least in normal times, considered cash equivalents 

raises broader financial stability questions.  Specifically, there may be a need for new 

macroprudential instruments, such as comprehensive authority to impose margins on all cash-

like instruments, regardless of whether a firm creating those instruments is a regulated entity 

such as a bank holding company.  Such possibilities obviously carry significant consequences, 

not just for the liquidity available to the financial system, but also for values such as the 

concentration of governmental authority.  This is a topic on which much further thought is 

needed.
