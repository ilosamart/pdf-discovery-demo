monetary policy accommodation currently in place. 

Although the recovery of the labor market from the deep recession following the 

financial crisis was frustratingly slow for quite a long time, progress has been more rapid 

of late.  The unemployment rate has fallen markedly over the past few years and now 

stands at 5.5 percent, down from 10 percent at its peak.  Payroll gains have averaged 

275,000 per month over the past year, well above the pace needed to sustain further 

declines in the unemployment rate.  Of course, we still have some way to go to reach our 

maximum employment goal.  The unemployment rate has not yet declined to the 5.0 to 

5.2 percent range that most FOMC participants now consider to be normal in the longer 

run.  Involuntary part-time employment remains high by historical standards.  Labor 

force participation is still somewhat lower than I would expect after accounting for 

demographic trends.1  And wage growth continues to be quite subdued.  But I think we 

can all agree that the recovery in the labor market has been substantial. 

I am cautiously optimistic that, in the context of moderate growth in aggregate 

output and spending, labor market conditions are likely to improve further in coming
