sector involved a high degree of maturity transformation and leverage.  Illiquid loans to 

households and businesses were securitized, and the tranches of the securitizations with 

the highest credit ratings were funded by very short-term debt, such as asset-backed 

commercial paper and repurchase agreements (repos).  The short-term funding was in

inflicted serious damage on the broader economy. 

Securities broker-dealers play a central role in many aspects of shadow banking as 

facilitators of market-based intermediation.  To finance their own and their clientsâ€™ 

securities holdings, broker-dealers tend to rely on short-term collateralized funding, often 

in the form of repo agreements with highly risk-averse lenders.  The crisis revealed that 

this funding is potentially quite fragile if lenders have limited capacity to analyze the 

collateral or counterparty risks associated with short-term secured lending, but rather look 

at these transactions as nearly risk free.  As questions emerged about the nature and value 

of collateral, worried lenders either greatly increased margin requirements or, more 

commonly, pulled back entirely.  Borrowers unable to meet margin calls and finance their
