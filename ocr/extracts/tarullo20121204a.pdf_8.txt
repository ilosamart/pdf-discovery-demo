induced by the distortion arising from the implicit government guarantee.  In practice, 

both scale economies and market failure may play a role.   

Although the moral hazard associated with TBTF funding is a significant issue, it 

is also reasonably discrete and susceptible to countervailing policy measures such as 

capital requirements and credible resolution mechanisms.  Some strands of finance 

research suggest more profound implications for certain configurations of financial 

industry structure.  For example, numerous papers suggest that the very large balance 

sheets of very large financial firms tend to be highly correlated, such that a shock to 

certain asset classes is likely to reverberate quickly on the balance sheets of most large 

firms as fire sales and subsequent mark-to-market effects affect even stronger firms.7  If 

this conclusion is valid, then the apparent economies associated with very large balance 

sheets may be transitory or, more precisely, contingent on the absence of serious shocks 

to certain asset classes. 

It is precisely at this intersection between questions of industry structure and of 

the behavior of financial markets that a joint venture between IO and finance is most 

important.  As I noted earlier, such an effort could not only help fill out an assessment of 

the social benefits associated with the size and industry structure of financial firms, but it 

could also lend insight into the kinds of measures that may be most effective in 

containing systemic risk.
