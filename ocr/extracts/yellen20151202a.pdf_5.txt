By contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes 

household spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently 

represents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of 

3 percent this year, significantly faster than real GDP.  Household spending growth has 

been particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong.  

Job growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers 

with more to spend on other goods and services.  These same factors likely have 

contributed to consumer confidence that is more upbeat this year than last year.  Increases 

in home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt, 

have pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer spending.  

Finally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMCâ€™s 

accommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially 

relevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.2 

Other components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have 

also advanced this year.  The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported 

further gains in the housing sector.  Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending 

have been faster so far in 2015 than last year, although the level of new residential 

construction still remains fairly low.  And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where 

lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in outlays for new structures, business 

investment spending has posted moderate gains. 

 On balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and 

over the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market closer to the
