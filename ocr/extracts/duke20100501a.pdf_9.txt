lessons in practical mathematics.11  And more states are now requiring financial education for 

boys and girls as part of the mandatory curriculum. 

More important than the actual math is the increasing complexity of financial services, 

products, and instruments.  In a world where decisionmaking involves not just making a choice 

between two types of savings instruments or investment products, but dozens, the issue is less 

about being able to do the math and more about being able to decipher the terms and conditions 

of financial instruments.  Being able to find good information and reliable advice is a key 

component of good outcomes.  This is an area where I am pleased to say the Federal Reserve can 

be of some assistance.  At the Federal Reserve, we have responsibility for designing many 

consumer disclosures, and we have made great strides recently to make those disclosures more 

understandable.  In addition, we have written rules banning many of the confusing practices in 

financial services that could not be adequately explained in disclosures.  We also provide helpful 

tools and information on our website, www.federalreserve.gov.  I hope you remember to take 

advantage of our resources whenever you need information concerning credit and savings 

products, financial planning, and investment decisions.   

Conclusion 

A conversation about women and the money myths that surround us could go on for 

hours. But on your day of celebration, I would rather remind you of some things that you learned 

over the last few months that will help you remain resilient in tough economic times. First, plan 

ahead.  Think not only of your short-term goals, but plan for your medium-term needs and your 

long-term dreams.  Second, take control of your budget and review it often.
