Good afternoon.  I want to thank all of you for participating in today’s discussion 

about the financing needs of small businesses. I particularly want to thank Karen Mills, 

the Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator, for her remarks and our 

distinguished panelists for helping us to better understand the dynamics of small business 

lending in these difficult economic times.  I would also like to thank everyone who 

participated in the more than 40 regional meetings that led up to today’s conference and 

to thank the Reserve Banks for their sponsorship and organization of those meetings.  

They brought together small businesses, lenders, technical assistance providers, bank 

examiners and others involved in small business credit to help identify barriers to small 

business credit access and to suggest potential solutions.   

As many of you know, I came to the Federal Reserve after many years as a 

community banker.  Quite a number of those years were spent lending to the small 

businesses that were the backbone of my local economy.  That experience gives me a 

deep appreciation for the importance of credit to economic growth and the particular 

importance of small business lending to job creation in local communities.  So, as you 

might imagine, the recent decline in availability of credit to small businesses concerns 

me.  It also concerns my colleagues across the Federal Reserve System.   

When the mortgage crisis first broke a few years ago, we were able to build a 

body of data and an understanding of relevant issues through a series of meetings 

convened by the Federal Reserve Banks across the country on topics such as foreclosure 

or neighborhood stabilization.  As we started hearing more about problems encountered 

by small businesses in accessing credit, we again tapped the broad footprint of the 

Reserve Bank system and the web of local contacts they have developed to help us better
