economies have been given increased power in setting the policies of the International 

Monetary Fund.  These forums should be used by advanced economies and emerging 

economies alike to meet their respective responsibilities to the global economy in a spirit

framework must take into account that activities such as the adaptation of advanced 

technologies and the harnessing economies of scale are often critical to economic growth 

and depend on a host of institutional conditions, such as an educated workforce, to be 

fully effective.

importance of disciplined fiscal policies, the benefits of open trade, the need to encourage 

private capital formation while undertaking necessary public investments, the high
