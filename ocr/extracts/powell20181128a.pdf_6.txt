for financial distress, in a framework that lays out solutions in advance during good 

times.   

The New Approach to Financial Stability 

This new approach can be divided into three parts.  First, build up the strength and 

resilience of the financial system.  Second, develop and apply a broad framework for 

monitoring financial stability on an ongoing basis.  And third, explain the new approach 

as transparently as possible, so that the public and its representatives in Congress can 

provide oversight and hold us accountable for this work.  Although I’ll focus mainly on 

the stability efforts of the Federal Reserve, a number of federal regulatory agencies have 

responsibilities in this area.  All of these agencies are represented on the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary and 

which provides a forum for interagency cooperation in responding to emerging risks.   

Building Resilience of the Financial System 

After 10 years of concentrated effort in the public and private sectors, the system 

is now much stronger, with greater capacity to function effectively in stressful times.  In 

the banking system, we have implemented a post-crisis regulatory framework based on 

robust capital and liquidity requirements, a strong stress-testing regime, and mandatory 

living wills for the largest firms.  As a result, banks now have much more high quality 

capital than before (figure 1).  The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after a 

severe global recession, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above regulatory 

minimums, and above the levels those banks held in good times before the crisis.4  The
