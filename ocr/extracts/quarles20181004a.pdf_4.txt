Not All Community Banks Are the Same 

Turning to the topic of today’s speech, it occurs to me that we often speak of 

community banks as though they are all pretty much the same.  But, in reality, there is 

considerable heterogeneity within the group of firms that are commonly considered to be 

community banks.3  One important dimension of diversity is size, which can range 

anywhere from less than $100 million in assets to around $10 billion in assets.  As noted 

by Chairman Powell when he spoke at this conference two years ago, looking at 

community banks as a monolithic group masks some important differences between the 

smallest and largest community banking organizations.4  For example, essentially all of 

the decline in the number of community banking organizations over the past two decades 

has taken place among those with assets less than $100 million.  And these smallest 

banking organizations have consistently had a lower average rate of return on assets than 

their larger peers.   

                                                 
3 For the purpose of my remarks today, “community bank” means a bank or thrift with less than $10 billion 
in assets (in constant 2005 dollars).  I exclude from this definition any bank or thrift that has less than 
$10 billion in assets but is part of a larger organization with more than $10 billion in total banking assets. 
“Urban community bank” is one that derives more than half of its deposits from offices located in one or 
more metropolitan statistical areas, and “rural community bank” derives at least half of its deposits from 
nonmetro areas.  Using the more nuanced Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) definition of a 
community bank, which takes into account both size and activities, would have very little effect on the 
trends that I will be discussing.  The FDIC definition can be found in Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (2012), “Defining the Community Bank,” in FDIC Community Banking Study (Washington:  
FDIC, December), https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI-1.pdf.
