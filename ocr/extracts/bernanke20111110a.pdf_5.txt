 Like other central banks around the world, one way in which we have put 

downward pressure on longer-term interest rates is by purchasing high-quality, longer-

term securities in the open market--specifically, in our case, U.S. government securities 

and federally backed mortgage securities.  It is important to understand that this type of 

activity isn’t the same as government spending.  We will sell the securities back into the 

market or simply allow them to mature as part of the process of tightening monetary

we hold.  In fact, the Federal Reserve’s securities purchases and other actions during and 

after the crisis have had the side effect of reducing the federal budget deficit.  Last year 

and the year before, we returned a total of $125 billion of those earnings to the U.S. 

Treasury, and payments to the Treasury in the current year will be substantial as well. 

 In addition to our monetary policy role, the Federal Reserve shares responsibility 

with other government agencies for regulating and supervising banks, protecting 

consumers in their financial dealings, and fostering financial stability.  We’re working 

with the other agencies to significantly increase the financial reserves that banks--

especially the largest banks that can put the financial system at risk--must hold against 

possible losses.  The Fed and the other agencies also are toughening the restrictions on 

the kinds of financial transactions that banks can undertake and working to ensure that 

bankers’ compensation packages do not give them incentives to take excessive risks.  We 

are requiring banks to compensate and assist foreclosed-upon homeowners who were 

unfairly treated.  And, importantly, we are working to increase the resilience of the 

financial system as a whole against financial and economic shocks that may occur in the 

future.  We are also collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to
