do—complement the predictions from macro models and market prices (figure 6).15  Yes, 

the Fed’s job would be (much) easier if the real world of 2019 satisfied the requirements 

to run Friedman’s k-percent policy rule, but it does not and has not for at least 50 years, 

and our policy framework must and does reflect this reality. 

This reality includes the fact that the U.S. economy is in a very good place.  The 

unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, real wages are rising in line with productivity, 

inflationary pressures are muted, and expected inflation is stable.  Moreover, the federal 

funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer-run neutral level, and the 

unemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u*.  Plugging these estimates into 

a 1993 Taylor rule produces a federal funds rate very close to our current target range for 

the policy rate.16  So with the economy operating at or very close to the Fed’s dual-

mandate objectives and with the policy rate in the range of FOMC participants’ estimates 

of neutral, we can, I believe, afford to be data dependent—in both senses of the term as I 

have discussed—as we assess what, if any, further adjustments in our policy stance might 

be required to maintain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price 

stability. 



                                                 
15 It is important to note that the range of model estimates that is shown in the shaded portion of figure 6 is 
not a confidence interval.  If parameter uncertainty in the estimates was allowed for, the range would be 
wider still.  Yield curve data can also be used to compute estimates of the neutral rate of interest, as in 
Bauer and Rudebusch (2019). 
16 Figure 7 summarizes the overall pattern displayed over time of various model-based estimates of r*.  
Recent r* estimates from the models considered, as well as their confidence intervals, are shown in figure 
8.  The sources for both figures are given at the bottom of figure 8.
