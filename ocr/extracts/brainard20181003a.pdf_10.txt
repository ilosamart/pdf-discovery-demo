As technological change continues to drive payments innovation, we continue to focus on 

the same basic objective that motivated our initial engagement in the payment system a century 

ago:  promoting a safe, efficient, and accessible payment system that serves the interests of all 

Americans.  The Fed has the unique ability to provide the infrastructure to reliably settle 

obligations between banks using balances at the central bank.  As such, we have a responsibility 

to serve the broad public interest by providing a flexible and robust payment infrastructure on 

which the private sector can innovate.  We look forward to hearing from you on the important 

choices before us as we work to safeguard the integrity and efficiency of our payment system.
