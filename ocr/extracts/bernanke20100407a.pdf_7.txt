through our regular short-term lending facility, known as the discount window, and 

auctioned fixed quantities of discount window credit.  We also expanded access to our 

short-term lending to many securities firms, whose normal funding sources had been 

disrupted by the crisis.  And we worked closely with the Treasury to develop programs 

that successfully ended the run on the money market mutual funds.   

The Federal Reserve also acted to help restore normal functioning in key financial 

markets.  We established a backstop commercial paper facility to help address severe 

strains in the commercial paper market, on which many firms rely to finance their 

operations.  To improve the availability of credit more broadly, we created a facility to 

support the issuance of securities backed by a range of assets including small business 

loans, auto loans, credit card receivables, student loans, and commercial real estate.  

Additionally, after heavy foreign demand for dollar funding began to disrupt money 

markets and squeeze credit availability in the United States, we established cooperative 

programs with 14 foreign central banks to allow them to provide sufficient dollar funding 

to help calm markets in their own jurisdictions.  Importantly, these programs--most of 

which have been deemed no longer necessary and shut down--not only helped stabilize 

financial conditions and restart the flow of credit to American families and businesses, 

they did so at no financial cost to taxpayers and with no credit losses. 

Beyond its actions to help stabilize the financial system, the Federal Reserve also 

responded to the deepening recession with an aggressive monetary policy, in both 

conventional and less conventional forms.  We lowered interest rates sharply, including, 

in October 2008, an unprecedented coordinated rate cut with five other major central 

banks.  For the past 15 months, we have maintained our target short-term interest rate
