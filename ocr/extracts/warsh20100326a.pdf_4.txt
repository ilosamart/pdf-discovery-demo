central bank of accountability.  To the contrary, institutional credibility demands transparency so 

that the Fed’s performance of its responsibilities can be judged on the merits.  

But, the call for central bank independence can be misunderstood, its defense 

misconstrued, its threats dismissed, and the consequences of its breach underestimated.  In the
