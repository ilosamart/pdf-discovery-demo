Market adjustments since May have been larger than would be justified by any 

reasonable reassessment of the path of policy.  In particular, the reaction of the forward 

and futures markets for short-term rates appears out of keeping with my assessment of the 

Committee’s intentions, given its forecasts.  The June SEP shows that 15 of 19 

participants see the first rate increase happening in 2015 or 2016.  The path of rates will 

ultimately depend on the path of the economy, and the Committee has said that the first 

rate increase will not happen until a considerable time has elapsed after asset purchases 

have been concluded.  Thus, to the extent the market is pricing in an increase in the 

federal funds rate in 2014, that implies a stronger economic performance than is forecast 

either by most FOMC participants or by private forecasters.  

We have made significant strides in communication in recent years.  The 

unemployment and inflation thresholds I discussed earlier, as well as the communication 

around asset purchases, are all designed to improve public understanding of the 

Committee’s intentions.  But communications are bound to be imperfect, and changes in 

the outlook can still lead to adjustments in asset prices.  Thus, some volatility is 

unavoidable, and indeed is a necessary part of the process by which markets and the 

economy adjust to incoming information.   

The Path Ahead for Monetary Policy 

Last week, the Chairman provided greater clarity about the path of asset 

purchases.  Specifically, the Chairman noted that, if incoming data are broadly consistent 

with the Committee’s sense of the economic outlook, the Committee currently anticipates 

that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year.  If 

the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with the Committee’s current expectations
