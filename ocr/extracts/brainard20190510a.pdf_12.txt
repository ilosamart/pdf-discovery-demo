nonfinancial reasons as well, such as protection against unwanted moves and the freedom 

to make alterations and investments in the home.20   

However, the financial crisis brought into focus that there are also risks associated 

with homeownership.  Home equity—defined as the difference between the house value 

and the mortgage balance—for an average middle-income household peaked at $90,200 

in late 2005, then declined by almost two-thirds through 2011 (figure 9).  By the end of 

2018, after several years of rising house prices, the home equity of the average middle-

income family was still below the pre-recession peak and not much above the value in 

1989.  

 Middle-income households saw such steep declines in their average home equity 

during the Great Recession because they had taken on a high level of mortgage debt 

relative to their house values.21  This high leverage amplified the effect of the fall in 

house prices on their wealth.  Moreover, the homeownership rates of middle-income 

households also declined during the recession, so they did not benefit as much from the 

subsequent rebound in house prices since 2013 as did higher-income families.   

The recent decline in homeownership rates does not appear to reflect a change in 

attitudes toward homeownership, as recent surveys show that the desire to own a home 

remains strong.22  Instead, it appears house prices are rising faster than income for many

households say they would “buy” if they were going to move.  See Fannie Mae’s March 2019 Data
