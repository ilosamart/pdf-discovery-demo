normal times but would convert to equity upon the triggering event.  The other is a requirement 

that all instruments qualifying as Tier 2 regulatory capital convert to common equity under 

specified circumstances, such as a determination that the firm would otherwise be on the brink of 

insolvency. 

The market discipline effects of both variants could be considerable, since holders of 

certain kinds of capital instruments would know that their debt-like interests in the firm would be 

lost if the firm's financial situation deteriorated.  However, there are also significant questions 

about the feasibility of both.  The specification of the trigger is critical.  If supervisors can trigger 

the conversion, investors cannot be certain as to when the government will exercise the trigger.  

That uncertainty would make it difficult to price a convertible capital instrument and diminish 

investors’ willingness to hold it.  Tying the trigger to the capital level of the firm runs headlong 

into the serious problem that capital has traditionally been a lagging indicator of the health of a 

firm.  Using a market-based trigger could invite trading against the trigger, which, in extreme 

cases, could lead to a so-called death spiral for the firm's stock.   

Despite the work that has been done on contingent proposals, it is not yet clear if there is 

a viable form of contingent capital that would increase market discipline and provide additional 

equity capital in times of stress without raising the price of the convertible debt close to common 

equity levels.  The appeal of the concept is such as to make further work very worthwhile but, for 

the moment at least, there is no proposal ready for implementation. 

Before closing the discussion of mechanisms to increase market discipline, I want to add 

a complementary thought to my earlier observation that these mechanisms are designed to ensure 

that investors and counterparties suffer losses.  If we are committed to achieving this end--as I 

believe we should be--we also need to provide market participants with the information needed
