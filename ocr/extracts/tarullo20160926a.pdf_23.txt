approach, a bank could also adjust its planned capital distributions after receiving the stress test 

results to avoid having its baseline capital distribution projections fall into the buffer. 

We have already taken a number of steps to respond to these requests.  We currently 

publish descriptions of all models used in the stress test, including the key risk drivers and 

scenario variables for each key modeling area.  We host an annual conference about modelling 

practices.  We disclose a description of the most material changes to stress test models before 

each stress test.  We are considering further steps, such as disclosing descriptions of changes 

well in advance of the stress test, and phasing in the most material model changes over two 

years, so as to smooth somewhat the effects of the changes on projected losses or revenues.  

Finally, and a bit more tentatively, we are assessing the feasibility of publishing data that 

represent typical bank portfolios of loans and securities with the losses we would project for 

those portfolios under various stress scenarios.  This kind of information could also help the 

public trace how changes in risk drivers alter loss projections. 

Having said all this, let me now say that we do not intend to publish the full computer 

code in the supervisory model that is used to project revenues and losses.  Full disclosure would 

permit firms to game the system--that is, to optimize portfolio characteristics based on the 

parameters of the model and take risks in areas not well-captured by the stress test just to 

minimize the estimated stress losses.  In part for this reason, full disclosure could promote a 

“model monoculture” in which both supervisors and firms use the same models to evaluate risks.  

A critical part of the DFAST/CCAR process is that firms use their own models to assess their 

risks.  We do not want them simply to copy the supervisory model and thereby increase the 

vulnerability of the financial system to the inevitable blind spots in even the best models.
