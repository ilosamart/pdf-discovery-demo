two different features can create vulnerability to runs and fire-sale risk.  The first 

involves funding of volatile assets with high leverage that includes short-term, confidence 

sensitive debt.  These structures were widely used before the crisis in the funding of 

MBS.  The second involves “liquidity transformation,” in which the investment structure 

provides investors daily liquidity, but the underlying assets are far less liquid and prone 

to becoming quite illiquid in times of stress.  Either or both of these features can be 

replicated in the derivatives or securities lending markets, which provide less visibility to 

market participants and supervisors.  Financial markets evolve constantly in response to 

market conditions, financial engineering, and regulation.  It will be important to keep up 

with trends in these markets that may give rise to this threat. 

Third, if left unaddressed, is it likely that conditions will risk meaningful damage to 

the real economy when the credit cycle turns? 

A positive answer on either of the first two questions should raise red flags for 

supervisors.  Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the answers to these questions were 

negative.  One might still try to make the case for supervisory intervention into the credit 

markets to avoid the risk of meaningful damage to the economy down the road.  History 

shows that excesses that occur at the height of a credit boom can result in substantial 

losses not just to financial firms and market investors, but also to households and 

businesses, when that boom turns to bust.15
