Dodd-Frank Act empowers the U.S. government to put a failing systemic banking institution into 

a governmental resolution procedure as an alternative to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code.10 

The resolution planning process provides regulators with an important tool to address too 

big to fail.  And we have set the bar realistically high, reflecting lessons from the crisis in the 

requirements that large banking institutions must meet to ensure their plans and preparations are 

not deemed to be deficient by the regulators.11  

Earlier this month, the eight U.S. systemic banking institutions submitted their most 

recent resolution plans, which are currently under review.  Each of the submissions must provide 

detailed work plans in several specific areas that have been found to be critical for orderly 

resolution.   

First, an orderly resolution requires that the large, complex firms simplify and rationalize 

their structures to align their legal entities with business lines and reduce the web of 

interdependencies among them to ensure separability along business lines.  As the crisis made 

clear, the tangled web of thousands of interconnected legal entities that were allowed to 

proliferate in the run up to the crisis stymied orderly wind down and contributed to uncertainty 

and contagion.   

Second, the largest, most complex banking organizations must demonstrate operational 

capabilities for resolution preparedness.12 These capabilities include maintaining an ongoing, 

comprehensive understanding of the obligations and exposures associated with payment,

covered company under the Bankruptcy code.”
