accompanied by capital outflows from many EMEs.  

Against this backdrop and the concerns it raises, the reaction in financial markets 

to the FOMC’s decisions to increase the target range for the federal funds rate following 

its December 2016 and March 2017 meetings--by a cumulative total of 50 basis

continued to decline to below historical norms, and global stock prices have risen.  The 

dollar has depreciated since mid-December, especially against EMEs, and the EMEs have 

experienced capital inflows. 

In my view, this favorable reaction partly reflects a view by market participants 

that the rate hikes are a signal of the FOMC’s confidence in the underlying prospects for 

the U.S. economy that in turn has increased confidence in the global outlook:  A strong

positive market reaction is that foreign output expansions appear more entrenched, and 

downside risks to those economies noticeably smaller than in recent years.  In Europe, 

unemployment has fallen steadily; inflation and inflation expectations are moving toward 

central bank targets; and, while Brexit entails many unknowns, so far it has not resulted 

in significant financial market disruptions.  China’s economy also appears to be on a

The IMF staff has taken these developments into account in the April 2017 World 

Economic Outlook (WEO) and forecasts that world GDP growth will be noticeably 

higher over the next two years than in 2016--a slight upward revision relative to the
