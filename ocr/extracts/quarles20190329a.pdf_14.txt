Conclusion 

In the United States, we have built a substantially safer financial system by 

focusing on using structural tools that confer through-the-cycle resilience.  With that 

construction work largely behind us, attention naturally turns to the set of time-varying 

financial regulations--particularly the CCyB. 

The overall capital framework in the United States has been designed to ensure 

high capital levels without having to activate the CCyB, with the implication being that 

the bar for activation would be a high one; but, as a result, much of the time there would 

not be any buffer to reduce if conditions were to precipitously deteriorate.  The United 

Kingdom’s approach to setting the CCyB also relies on having a high overall level of 

capital during normal times, but, by “swapping” some portion of static capital for CCyB 

in reaching that high capital level during normal times, and thus making some of that 

capital part of a releasable buffer, U.K. policymakers have built in more flexibility to 

move buffers down in times of stress.  Other countries provide additional “data points” in 

terms of possible ways of approaching the CCyB. 

With the CCyB in active use around the world, I am confident that the academic 

and policy communities will learn a great deal about how best to use this new tool to 

build a more resilient financial system.
