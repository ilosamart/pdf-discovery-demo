Conclusion 

This morning I have reviewed the outlook, the Federal Reserveâ€™s response, and its 

policy options for the future should the recovery falter or inflation decline further. 

In sum, the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed somewhat in 

recent months, in part because of slower-than-expected growth in consumer spending, as 

well as continued weakness in residential and nonresidential construction.  Despite this 

recent slowing, however, it is reasonable to expect some pickup in growth in 2011 and in 

subsequent years.  Broad financial conditions, including monetary policy, are supportive 

of growth, and banks appear to have become somewhat more willing to lend.  

Importantly, households may have made more progress than we had earlier thought in 

repairing their balance sheets, allowing them more flexibility to increase their spending 

as conditions improve.  And as the expansion strengthens, firms should become more 

willing to hire.  Inflation should remain subdued for some time, with low risks of either a 

significant increase or decrease from current levels. 

Although what I have just described is, I believe, the most plausible outcome, 

macroeconomic projections are inherently uncertain, and the economy remains 

vulnerable to unexpected developments.  The Federal Reserve is already supporting the 

economic recovery by maintaining an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy, 

using multiple tools.  Should further action prove necessary, policy options are available 

to provide additional stimulus.  Any deployment of these options requires a careful 

comparison of benefit and cost.  However, the Committee will certainly use its tools as 

needed to maintain price stability--avoiding excessive inflation or further disinflation--

and to promote the continuation of the economic recovery.
