environment, a turnaround in CRE is likely to lag the improvement in overall economic activity.  

However, compared with the situation in the early 1990s, the problems in this sector now appear 

to be due largely to poor business fundamentals rather than widespread overbuilding, suggesting 

that the performance of the CRE sector will gradually begin to improve as the economy 

continues to strengthen. 

The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies issued a policy statement covering 

commercial real estate loans and loan workouts in October 2009--one of a series of actions taken 

to support sound bank lending.2  This guidance urges both lenders and bank examiners to take a 

balanced approach in assessing borrowers’ debt servicing capacity and to make realistic 

assessments of collateral values. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve has taken steps with bankers and examiners to reinforce 

the expectations outlined in the interagency policy statement.  For example, in January, Federal 

Reserve staff instituted an examiner training initiative that will underscore the importance of 

sound lending practices with Federal Reserve and state examiners across the United States.  

Additionally, we have developed an interagency training program specifically for examiners 

reviewing CRE loans as part of the interagency Shared National Credit Program, which covers 

large syndicated loans, including the largest commercial real estate loans in the nation.  

We are working hard to track the progress and effectiveness of this guidance and are 

exploring the feasibility of more formal statistical approaches for measuring and evaluating its 

effectiveness.  Preliminary analysis of recent data offers some encouragement that CRE 

refinancing and workouts are beginning to take place.  Notably, the volume of restructured 

troubled loans increased by almost 32 percent during the fourth quarter of 2009, the quarter in
