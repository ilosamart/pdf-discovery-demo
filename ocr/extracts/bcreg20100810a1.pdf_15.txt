 Require that banks apply the aforementioned “gross-up” treatment under which a 
bank must maintain capital against its securitization exposure, as well as against all 
more senior exposures that the bank’s exposure supports in the structure.  The 
grossed-up exposure would then be assigned to the risk weight appropriate to the 
underlying securitized exposures.  

 Differentiate the credit risk of the “grossed-up” securitization exposure based on 
financial and structural parameters of the underlying or reference pool of 
instruments, as well as the exposure itself.  For example, risk weights could be 
assigned based on the securitization transaction’s overcollateralization ratio, 
interest coverage ratio, or priority in the cash flow waterfall. 

 Assign the most senior securitization exposure in a transaction a risk weight based 
on the underlying exposure type and the aggregate amount of subordination that 
provides credit enhancement to the exposure.  For example, the greater the amount 
of subordination, the lower the risk weight to which the senior exposure would be 
assigned.  However, this approach would only apply to the senior-most tranche 
and would not distinguish between exposures with significant credit support and 
those where the support had been reduced or eliminated by losses.   

 Adopt the Basel Committee’s approach to calculating capital requirements for 
securitization exposures that is based on the level of subordination and the type of 
underlying exposures in the Revisions Document.  The approach would use a 
“concentration ratio” to set the minimum risk-based capital requirements for 
securitization positions.  The concentration ratio is equal to the sum of the notional 
amounts of all the tranches divided by the sum of the notional amounts of the 
tranches junior to or pari passu with the tranche in which the position is held 
including that tranche itself.  The capital requirement is 8 percent of the weighted-
average risk weight that would be applied to the underlying securitized exposures 
multiplied by the concentration ratio. If the concentration ratio is 12.5 or higher, 
the position would be deducted from capital.  Under this approach, the capital 
requirement would be no less than that which would result from a direct exposure 
to the underlying assets.   

 Design a risk-weighting approach based on a supervisory formula.  Building on the 
capital requirements of the underlying exposures, the agencies could recognize 
multiple sources of risk related to securitizations and impose provisions that limit 
some forms of arbitrage.  Under the advanced approaches rules, for example, 
banking organizations are allowed to use the supervisory formula approach (SFA) 
to calculate minimum regulatory capital requirements for certain securitization 
exposures.32  This approach uses exposure-specific inputs, including the capital 
requirement of the underlying exposures as if held directly by the banking 
organization.  The inputs required for calculating the capital requirement of the
