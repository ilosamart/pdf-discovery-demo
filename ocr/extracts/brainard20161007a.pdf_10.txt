associated with evolving financial technologies has raised questions about the 

applicability of existing licenses and their adequacy to new business models.  For 

instance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore recently issued a consultation paper that 

proposes an activity-based payments framework as a way to address the introduction of 

non-traditional payment providers.2  The United States has seen several noteworthy 

recent developments, including the New York State Department of Financial Servicesâ€™ 

BitLicense, a distributed ledger company, securing Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

approval for participation in the National Settlement Service, and, most recently, 

discussion by the OCC of a limited-purpose charter. 

Ongoing Engagement  

Because of the notable potential of distributed ledger technology, financial 

authorities, both domestic and international, will follow these developments with keen 

interest.  At the Federal Reserve, we expect to publish a research paper later this year that 

summarizes some of the key findings from our industry engagement so far.  Going 

forward, we will continue to deepen our engagement with a range of financial 

institutions, technologists, multi-stakeholder consortia, and academic experts to refine our 

understanding of the new technologies, along with their possibilities and limitations, with 

a particular focus on our responsibilities for the payments system, as well as our 

oversight of financial market intermediaries.  We will also continue to discuss these 

issues with other central banks and authorities around the world.  We will work together
