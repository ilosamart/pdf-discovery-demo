first half of the year.  One data point does not make a trend, but an improvement in 

business investment will be important if the pickup in productivity growth that we have 

seen in recent quarters is to be sustained.   

As for the economic outlook, in the most recent Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP) released in September, participants had a median projection for real 

GDP growth of 3.1 percent in 2018 and 2-1/2 percent in 2019.  The unemployment rate 

was expected to decline to 3-1/2 percent next year.  And, for total PCE inflation, the 

median projection remains near 2 percent. 

With a robust labor market and inflation at or close to our 2 percent inflation goal 

and based on the baseline economic outlook for 2019 I have just laid out, I believe 

monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining 

growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with our inflation objective.  At 

this stage of the interest rate cycle, I believe it will be especially important to monitor a 

wide range of data as we continually assess and calibrate whether the path for the policy 

rate is consistent with meeting our dual-mandate objectives on a sustained basis. 

Data Dependence of Monetary Policy:  What It Means and Why It Is Important  

Economic research suggests that monetary policy should be “data dependent.”3 

And, indeed, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, often 

describe their policies in this way.  I would now like to discuss how I think about two
