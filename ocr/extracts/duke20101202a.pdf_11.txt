In December 2008, the Federal Reserve issued rules that introduced new 

consumer protections and revised the disclosures that consumers receive in connection 

with their credit card accounts.  Then, in May 2009, the Congress enacted the Credit Card 

Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (Credit CARD) Act, which contained 

additional provisions regarding credit cards and gift cards.  Collectively, these rules have 

comprehensively overhauled the regulatory regime that applies to credit cards.   

In large part, these reforms developed in response to concerns about the growing 

complexity of the products offered to consumers and concerns that consumers could not 

accurately assess the costs associated with their credit cards.  To address these concerns, 

the Federal Reserve used extensive consumer testing to develop new disclosures to be 

provided with credit card solicitations and in periodic statements.  These disclosures 

highlight key account terms and attempt to improve consumersâ€™ understanding of the 

costs associated with using their cards.  The resulting disclosure requirements establish a 

new baseline for transparency in the credit card industry.  In addition, the new rules ban 

certain practices that increase the cost of credit in ways that cannot easily be disclosed to 

consumers, such as double-cycle billing.  The new rules also generally prohibit card 

issuers from increasing interest rates applied to existing balances and require issuers to 

provide adequate notice of higher rates to be applied to future balances.   

It is too early to draw conclusions about the ultimate impact of these changes 

because many of the new requirements have been in effect only since earlier this year.  

For example, card issuers appear to have changed their credit card pricing and 

underwriting models as their ability to use penalty pricing has been reduced.  And some 

of the reduction in new account solicitations may also be due in part to the regulatory
