meetings is to articulate that perspective and perhaps persuade their colleagues to revise 

their own perspectives--or vice versa. 

A member of a committee may well have valuable economic information not 

known by their colleagues until he or she relays it.  This point has been brought home to 

me by Reserve Bank presidents’ accounts of recent economic developments in their 

Districts.  These narratives shed light on the real-world developments that lie behind the 

recorded economic data.  They also help shape my interpretation of what part of 

incoming data may be an important signal and what part may reflect transitory factors or 

mismeasurement.   

The information underlying a policy decision is, therefore, crucially shaped by a 

committee system.  Committees can aggregate a large volume of diverse information 

about current and expected future economic conditions.  The information includes 

anecdotes and impressions gleaned from business and other contacts, which can provide 

insights that are not recorded in current data releases. 

In practice, it is likely that the information obtained and processed by the 

Committee will leave the FOMC less inclined to follow a benchmark rule.  For example, 

the Committee’s discussions might point up factors that have not yet affected real 

economic activity and inflation.  Such factors would not lead to an immediate change in 

the prescription for the federal funds rate obtained from a rule like the Taylor rule, as this 

prescription is a function of current values of the output gap and inflation.  The 

Committee might nevertheless wish to adjust the federal funds rate immediately because 

the newly unearthed factors are likely to affect output and inflation in coming months.
