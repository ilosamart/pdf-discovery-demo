Importance of Robust Interest Rate Risk Management at All Banking Organizations  

Because of the potential complexity of interest rate risk exposures at individual 

institutions, supervisors have, for many years, pointed out the need for bankers to use sound 

practices for managing these exposures.  Employing sound practices becomes even more critical 

in light of the current uncertainties surrounding the timing and impacts of changes in interest 

rates.  It was concern about the risks to banks from interest rate changes that led the supervisors 

to issue the recent advisory on interest rate risk management.  That advisory reminded 

institutions of guidance dating back to mid-1990s.  Other speakers at this symposium will no 

doubt summarize and expand upon the guidance discussed in that advisory, but the key 

principles of risk management apply to interest rate risk, as they do to the management of other 

risks.  These principles articulate the need for (1) appropriate corporate governance, including 

actively engaged boards of directors and senior managers; (2) adequate policies, procedures, and 

limits to guide the institution’s interest rate risk management process; (3) robust interest rate risk 

measurement and reporting systems that focus heavily on stress testing of both alternative 

interest rate scenarios and the effect of key behavioral assumptions on the results of such tests; 

and (4) strong internal controls structured to ensure the integrity of all elements of the interest 

rate risk management process.  

As the recent crisis has emphasized, senior managers must actively engage in the 

measurement and assessment of risk exposures.  Given today’s technology, even some small 

banks are using reasonably sophisticated measurement techniques to assess the impact of 

different interest rate scenarios on the different types of interest rate risk that these institutions 

are exposed to.  These risks include basic re-pricing mismatches that are most sensitive to 

changes in the level of rates; exposures to different yield curve shifts, twists, and slopes; basis 

risks, which arise from re-pricing differences in instruments with similar maturities; and the risks
