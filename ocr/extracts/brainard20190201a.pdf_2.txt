Thank you all for participating in our Research Symposium on the Community 

Reinvestment Act (CRA).  I am happy to have an opportunity to learn from your extensive 

experience and expertise.1    

At the Federal Reserve, we value the CRA as a critical tool for providing support to low- 

and moderate income (LMI) families and their communities.  And we are interested in 

strengthening the CRA as it encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities 

they are chartered to serve.  Today’s research forum is one part of an extensive outreach effort 

we are undertaking to gather the best ideas for improving implementation of the Community 

Reinvestment Act.   

Over the past four months alone, all 12 of our Reserve Banks have hosted roundtables in 

locations around the country, from San Francisco to Boston, and from Rapid City to Puerto Rico.  

The purpose is to hear ideas on improving the CRA regulations from the bankers and community 

groups that have a stake in the CRA’s success.  In addition, we held two roundtables at the 

Federal Reserve Board earlier this week to gather perspectives from national organizations 

focused on policy topics, such as housing, small business lending, and consumer credit.2   

We have also consulted with our advisory councils to gather their thoughts on CRA 

reform.  We have asked our large and community bank advisory councils, the Federal Advisory 

Council and the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, about their experiences 

with the CRA and suggestions for improvements.  We have also sought community perspectives.
