are run by local governments--such as education for grades kindergarten through 12, road 

maintenance, and property tax relief.1  

Assistance from the federal government--mainly through the stimulus grants 

included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the 

additional Medicaid and education grants provided last summer--has relieved some of the 

fiscal pressure on states and localities.  In addition, many of them have tapped financial 

reserves--or “rainy day” funds--and pursued asset sales and other one-time actions to 

satisfy balanced budget requirements.  Nonetheless, many governments have laid off or 

furloughed workers, frozen salaries, and cut other operating expenses.  Job cuts have 

been especially pronounced at the local level, where payrolls have fallen roughly 

350,000, or more than 2 percent, over the past 2-1/2 years; nearly half of the loss of local 

jobs has been in education. 

  In addition, state and local governments have cut their capital expenditures.  To 

be sure, construction of highways and transportation facilities has been well maintained 

over the past couple of years, partly because of the infrastructure grants and the Build 

America Bond program provided under the ARRA.  But outlays for the construction of 

schools to serve students in grades kindergarten through 12 now stand about 30 percent 

below their pre-recession level.  One might ask why states and localities are choosing to 

reduce capital expenditures, as these expenditures provide employment and economic 

benefits while typically not being subject to balanced budget requirements.  One reason is 

that some projects are funded at least partially out of operating budgets and thus must 

compete with Medicaid and other high-priority programs for scarce dollars.  Another is
