not address reputational risk.  Likewise, the Basel capital frameworks exclude reputational risks 

from regulatory capital requirements.

Accordingly, the current approach to managing reputational risk is largely reactive rather 

than proactive.  Banks and examiners tend to focus their energies on handling the threats to their 

reputations that have already surfaced.  This is not risk management; it is crisis management--a 

reactive approach aimed at limiting the damage.  Instead, we should think about a supervisory 

approach that incentivizes bank managers to sufficiently contemplate, quantify if necessary, and 

control the factors that affect the level of such risks before they fully emerge in an unmitigated 

form. 

The way that the Federal Reserve supervises banking organizations may help identify 

risks sooner.  For all banking organizations, the supervisory program here does not simply rely 

on an annual onsite examination.  The Federal Reserve supplements its regular examination 

activities with a program of continuous monitoring between examinations.  One of the key 

objectives of this program is to identify emerging risks and communicate with other regulators 

and the banks an updated risk assessment and supervisory strategy based on these risks.   

When we contemplate a supervisory approach that illuminates reputational risk, we might 

be able to more fully uncover the interconnection of risks that certain activities could impose on 

investors, creditors, counterparties, and taxpayers.  In this approach, we would first and foremost 

need to encourage banks to assess the potential riskiness of particular operations, investments, 

products, and decisions to their reputations and, ultimately, to their enterprise value.  As 

supervisors, one objective as we work with financial institutions to extract such information

 Pillar 2 of the Basel II capital framework, however, does note that internationally active banks are expected to hold 

sufficient capital to address all significant risks, including reputational risk, as part of their internal capital adequacy 

assessment processes.
