discipline was lacking, and financial institutions were allowed to take on high levels of 

leverage.  This leverage was facilitated by short-term wholesale borrowing, owing in part 

to market-based vehicles, such as money market mutual funds and asset-backed 

commercial paper programs that allowed the rapid expansion of liquidity transformation 

outside of the regulated depository sector.  Finally, a self-reinforcing loop developed, in 

which all of the factors I have just cited intensified as investors sought ways to gain 

exposure to the rising prices of assets linked to housing and the financial sector.  As a 

result, securitization and the development of complex derivatives products distributed 

risk across institutions in ways that were opaque and ultimately destabilizing. 

In response, policymakers around the world have put in place measures to limit a 

future buildup of similar vulnerabilities.  The United States, through coordinated 

regulatory action and legislation, moved very rapidly to begin reforming our financial 

system, and the speed with which our banking system returned to health provides 

evidence of the effectiveness of that strategy.  Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts 

through bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial 

Stability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty has contributed to the development of 

standards that promote financial stability around the world, thereby supporting global 

growth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adverse developments abroad.   

                                                 
phrase as memorable as the madness of crowds, is provided by Robert J. Shiller (2016), Irrational 

Exuberance, 3rd ed. (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press).  The notion that economic stability can 

generate a buildup of imbalances that subsequently contributes to instability is presented in Hyman P. 

Minsky (1974), “The Modeling of Financial Instability:  An Introduction,” in Modeling and Simulation, 

Vol. 5, Part 1, proceedings of the Fifth Annual Pittsburgh Conference (Pittsburgh:  Instrument Society of 

America), pp. 267-72, http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/467.  A related discussion of how 

financial excesses often precede downturns (and even panics) is provided in Charles P. Kindleberger and 

Robert Z. Aliber (2005), Manias, Panics, and Crashes:  A History of Financial Crises, 5th ed. (Hoboken,
