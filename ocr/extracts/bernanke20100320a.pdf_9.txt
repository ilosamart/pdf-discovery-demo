We are always looking for opportunities to interact with and learn from 

community bankers.  Events like this one are an important venue for exchanging ideas, as 

I’ve mentioned, but there are many others.  For example, community bankers sit on our 

Federal Advisory Council, which meets with the Board of Governors for three mornings 

each year to discuss developments in the economy and in the banking industry.  We meet

Council, which brings together thrifts, saving banks, and a variety of other depository 

institutions, most of them smaller, from around the country.  In addition, community 

bankers sit on the boards and the advisory councils of the Fed’s 12 regional Reserve 

Banks and 24 Reserve Bank branches.  Both the Board and the Reserve Banks organize

development organizations, and other stakeholders to discuss barriers to and 

opportunities for extending credit to small businesses.

Federal Reserve System.  This supervision is guided by the Board, but conducted day-to-

day by the Reserve Banks and their examiners, many of whom have lived and worked
