 According to recent surveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent 

Businesses (NFIB), financing conditions continued to be ranked as the top business concern by 

only a modest fraction (less than 5 percent) of small businesses; in contrast, about one-third of 

respondents cited poor sales as their most important problem.  Commercial bank responses to the 

SLOOS continue to indicate reduced demand for loans from small businesses.  Similarly, a poll 

conducted by the Independent Community Bankers of America on January 8 revealed that a lack 

of loan demand was the factor most frequently cited by member institutions as constraining small 

business lending.

me to be somewhat optimistic that we may begin to see an increase in bank loans later this year.   

First, economic conditions, the most important determinant in the demand for, and availability 

of, small business lending, have improved considerably since the early and middle part of last 

year.  In particular, spending by businesses and households appears to have gained some 

momentum.  However, unemployment remains high, and concerns about the pace of job creation 

this year may restrain the consumer spending that is essential to overall business confidence.  

Encouragingly, financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth, 

with notable declines in many risk spreads, some resumption of securitization activity, and a 

rebound of equity prices since their market low in early 2009.   

 While financing conditions certainly remain tight for many small businesses, conditions 

would be considerably worse were it not for the action taken by the Federal Reserve and other 

government agencies in response to the financial crisis.  Beginning in September 2007, the 

Federal Reserve sharply reduced its target for the federal funds rate, which influences interest
