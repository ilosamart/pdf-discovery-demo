Fifth is the organization of the international system for financial regulation.  The issues 

here are in some sense familiar from pre-crisis days:  To what degree can host countries 

responsibly rely on home jurisdiction consolidated regulation and supervision of large and 

internationally active financial institutions?  How should international cooperative efforts to set 

minimum prudential standards be brought together with domestic legal processes for financial 

regulation?  These familiar questions have taken on new significance in light of the post-crisis 

emphasis on the financial system as a whole, including the varieties of shadow banking.  So too

the question of how much international harmonization is ultimately desirable.  The creation of 

the FSB, and greater emphasis on international standards in the International Organization of 

Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors have 

substantially changed the relevant international organization chart from the days when only the 

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision produced such standards.  

Pedagogy 

Having not taught financial regulation since the interesting months of the fall 2008 

semester, I am probably at a comparative disadvantage to most of this audience in reflecting on 

the new pedagogy of financial regulation.  However, that will not stop me from making a couple

liability side of the balance sheets of financial institutions.  Traditional banking law casebooks 

gave some treatment to deposits and deposit insurance, which provided a good point in a course 

to engage students on the subject of moral hazard.  But the whole concept of runnable liabilities--

whether uninsured deposits, repo, commercial paper, or other forms--was left largely untouched,
