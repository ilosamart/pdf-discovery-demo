year period since World War II.  The productivity slowdown has been worldwide, and 

has been seen in countries that were not as strongly affected by the crisis, so U.S. specific 

factors are probably not the main cause.6   

Increasing productivity is necessary if living standards are to continue to rise over 

generations.  So two important questions arise:  Why has productivity growth been so 

slow?  And what does the future look like? 

We have tentative answers to the first question.  Labor productivity is a function 

of three things.  The first two are the skills of the labor force, and the tools they have, 

particularly equipment, software and the like.  These are inputs to production and are 

driven by private and public investment.  The third determinant is called “total factor 

productivity,” or TFP, which refers to the ability of firms to produce more efficiently 

given the first two inputs.  For example, as businesses learned how to incorporate 

advances in information technology into their production processes, there was a surge of 

productivity growth from roughly 1995 to 2005.   

The weak performance of productivity since the crisis appears to stem mainly 

from weak business investment and low TFP growth.  Weak business investment has 

resulted from weak demand and uncertainty about the pace of the recovery.  TFP is 

equally important and has generally accounted for most of the variation in productivity 

over time, but is less well understood and so more difficult to forecast.   

The second question--what will happen with productivity going forward--is the 

subject of intense debate.  The range of forecasts is wide, and the historical record
