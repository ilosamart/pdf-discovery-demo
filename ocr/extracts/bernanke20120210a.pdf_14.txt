each of which have between 2,000 and 3,000 units.  As I noted, not all REO properties 

are appropriate for rental, but many do appear to be physically adequate and potentially 

attractive to tenants.  The number of properties suitable for rental is bound to increase, as 

the number of properties currently in the foreclosure process is more than four times the 

number of properties in the REO inventory. 

Other options can help with foreclosed houses that have low value and are in poor 

condition, homes that are not likely to be dealt with adequately through the private 

market.  For example, land banks could handle some of these properties.  Land banks are 

typically governmental entities that have the ability to purchase and sell real estate, clear 

titles, and accept donated properties.  Properties may be rehabilitated as rental or owner-

occupied housing or, in extreme cases, demolished, depending on the needs of individual 

markets.  While land banks are a promising option, only some states have passed 

legislation to establish land banks, and most existing land banks lack the resources to 

keep pace with the number of low-value properties in the current inventory.  It is, of 

course, critical that local governments pursuing land banking, or similar strategies, have 

staff members with the appropriate skills as well as adequate oversight to ensure that 

public funds are employed efficiently.  

REO-to-rental programs, land banks, and other neighborhood stabilization efforts 

are just a few examples of the approaches that policymakers could consider to help 

facilitate the adjustment of the housing market.

 Other potential approaches include loan modification programs, principal reduction protocols, and the 

use of short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.  Such approaches are discussed in Board of Governors, 

“The U.S. Housing Market” (see note 1).
