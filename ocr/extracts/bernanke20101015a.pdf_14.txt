reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 25 basis points almost two 

years ago, in December 2008.  Further policy accommodation is certainly possible even 

with the overnight interest rate at zero, but nonconventional policies have costs and 

limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether and how aggressively they 

should be used.  

For example, a means of providing additional monetary stimulus, if warranted, 

would be to expand the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.5  Empirical 

evidence suggests that our previous program of securities purchases was successful in 

bringing down longer-term interest rates and thereby supporting the economic recovery.6  

A similar program conducted by the Bank of England also appears to have had benefits. 

However, possible costs must be weighed against the potential benefits of 

nonconventional policies.  One disadvantage of asset purchases relative to conventional 

monetary policy is that we have much less experience in judging the economic effects of 

this policy instrument, which makes it challenging to determine the appropriate quantity 

and pace of purchases and to communicate this policy response to the public.  These 

factors have dictated that the FOMC proceed with some caution in deciding whether to 

engage in further purchases of longer-term securities.  

Another concern associated with additional securities purchases is that substantial 

further expansion of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed’s ability 

to execute a smooth exit from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time.  Even if 

unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might lead to an undesired increase in 

inflation expectations, to a level above the Committee’s inflation objective.  To address
