properties.  And, as with any new technology, things may go wrong.  We will need 

a thorough analysis of how DLT fits into current legal frameworks and what gaps 

need to be filled by contractual agreements or new laws and regulations.  A robust 

legal basis that provides certainty across relevant jurisdictions is essential for 

building strong governance, risk management, and operations. 

 Digital Currencies Issued by Central Banks to the General Public 

 My last topic is the potential use of DLT or other technologies by central 

banks to issue a digital currency to the general public.   In a sense, the idea of a 

digital currency is merely a 21st century analog of paper currency.  While this is a 

fascinating idea, there are significant policy issues that need to be analyzed.7 

First, there are meaningful technical challenges.  We should have serious 

reservations about our ability to keep a generally circulating digital currency safe 

and secure over the long run.  A digital currency issued by a central bank would be 

a global target for cyber attacks, cyber counterfeiting, and cyber theft.  The threats 

could significantly exceed historical experience with paper currency.   

A digital currency would also be a prime target as a potential vehicle for 

global criminal activities, including money laundering.  Central banks could face 

difficult trade-offs between strengthening security and enabling illegal activity.  

                                                           
7  Several of these and additional issues relating to the issuance of digital currencies by central banks are touched on 
briefly in Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure, “Digital Currencies” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for 
International Settlements, November 2015), www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d137.pdf.
