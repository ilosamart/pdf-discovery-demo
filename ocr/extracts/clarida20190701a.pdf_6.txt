these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11  Likewise, 

although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they 

are for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market 

strengthens.12  And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for 

less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 

Scope of the Review 

In the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the 

responsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of 

maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”14  Our 

review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that 

inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the 

congressional mandate.   

Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on 

Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.15  First adopted in January 2012, the 

                                                 
11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and 
ethnicity in a strong labor market.  The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and 
for employment-to-population ratios. 
12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.  
However, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened.  The box “Employment 
Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report 
examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10–12).  See also Weingarden 
(2017). 
13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be 
calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The 
Economic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data. 
14 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is 
commonly known as the “dual mandate.”  The reason is that an economy in which people who want to 
work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad 
measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed 
for interest rates to settle at moderate levels.  For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007).  Quoted text from the 
Federal Reserve Act is in 12 U.S.C. § 225a (2000),
