education in the workforce raise the nationâ€™s productive capacity and result in more 

sustainable increases in output and living standards.  The higher productivity and 

workforce levels engendered by these policies would likely increase investment 

opportunities and raise expectations of future income growth, sustainably boosting the 

levels of investment and consumption and, as a result, the longer-run neutral rate.  Such 

policies are more likely to be sustainable because the boost to GDP that they provide 

continues to accumulate over time, limiting increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio and 

preserving fiscal space. 

In addition, the effects of fiscal policy depend importantly on the relative strength 

of the broader global economy.  In recent years, major foreign economies have been 

contending with a deficiency of domestic demand.  At a time when the U.S. economy has 

made important progress on employment and inflation, in both Europe and Japan output 

or inflation, or both, remain well below desired levels.  As a result, forecasters expect 

short-term yields in these economies to remain near zero for years to come.  Moreover, 

growth in many emerging market economies, including importantly China, has slowed in 

recent years, and financial conditions in some emerging economies appear fragile.  

Against the backdrop of deficient demand abroad, if more expansionary fiscal policy here 

at home raises expectations of a growing divergence between the United States and other 

economies, upward pressure on the exchange rate will likely result, as we have seen 

recently with the renewed increase in the dollar.  The result could be cross-border 

spillovers from the increase in U.S. domestic demand, reducing the effect on U.S. real 

activity and inflation and potentially contributing to external imbalances.  In the past few 

years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S.
