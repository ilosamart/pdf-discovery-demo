taken to limit it.8  First, regulatory and supervisory reforms, such as higher capital and 

liquidity standards or restriction on certain activities, can directly limit risk-taking.  

Second, through the use of appropriate carrots and sticks, regulators can enlist the private 

sector in monitoring risk-taking.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive 

Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, the descendant of the bank stress tests of 

2009, requires not only that large financial institutions have sufficient capital to weather 

extreme shocks, but also that they demonstrate that their internal risk-management 

systems are effective.9  In addition, the results of the stress-test portion of CCAR are 

publicly disclosed, providing investors and analysts information they need to assess 

banks’ financial strength. 

Of course, market discipline can only limit moral hazard to the extent that debt 

and equity holders believe that, in the event of distress, they will bear costs.  In the crisis, 

the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a failing SIFI left 

policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or allowing a potentially 

destabilizing collapse.  The Dodd-Frank Act, under the orderly liquidation authority in 

Title II, created an alternative resolution mechanism for SIFIs that takes into account both 

the need, for moral hazard reasons, to impose costs on the creditors of failing firms and 

the need to protect financial stability; the FDIC, with the cooperation of the Federal 

Reserve, has been hard at work fleshing out this authority.10  A credible resolution
