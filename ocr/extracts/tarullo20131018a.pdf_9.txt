to fail.5  The aim of the single-point-of-entry approach is to stabilize the failed firm quickly, in 

order to mitigate the negative impact on the U.S. financial system, and to do so without 

supporting the firm’s equity holders and other capital liabilities holders or exposing U.S. 

taxpayers to losses.  The single-point-of-entry approach offers the best potential for the orderly 

resolution of a systemic financial firm under Title II, in part because of its potential to mitigate 

run risks and credibly impose losses on parent holding company creditors and, thereby, to 

enhance market discipline. 

 In the United States, the top-tier parent company of a large banking firm generally is not 

an operating company but a holding company, whose primary purpose is to raise capital and 

direct the operations of its subsidiaries.  Its assets largely consist of cash, liquid securities, and 

equity and debt interests in its subsidiaries.  This common organizational feature of U.S. banking 

firms facilitates the single-point-of-entry approach because the liabilities of the top-tier holding 

company are structurally subordinated to the customer obligations and other direct liabilities at 

the firm’s operating subsidiaries.  Accordingly, under the single-point-of-entry approach, the 

equity and debt at the holding company level can form a buffer that must first be exhausted 

before any customer or creditor of a subsidiary suffers losses.  The existence of this buffer 

should help give the customers and creditors of a U.S. banking firm greater clarity regarding 

their potential loss exposure in failure.  The presumption that holding company capital liabilities 

would be required in the first instance to absorb losses in a systemic financial firm will be critical 

in maintaining the confidence, and limiting the run potential, of customers, liquidity providers, 

and other creditors at the operating subsidiary level. 

                                                 
5 It is worth noting that the Resolution Project at the Hoover Institution, which produced the proposal for a special 
Bankruptcy Code Chapter 14 cited in footnote 3, is now at work on a variant of its proposal that builds specifically 
on the single-point-of-entry approach.
