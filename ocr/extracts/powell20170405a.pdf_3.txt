have been distributed across races.1  You, as MDIs, are committed to understanding and 

serving these diverse communities.  I know that, for example, your small business loans 

to minority business owners make a difference in the employment rates of minority 

communities.  I thank you for that work, and we will continue to work closely with you 

to better understand the employment dynamics of underserved and minority 

communities.   

Second, the Fed is unique as a research institution.  We have many economists on 

staff and therefore have the ability to engage in wide-ranging research that may be useful 

to your firms and communities.  Specific to MDIs, we commissioned two new research 

papers for this conference to better understand trends in the MDI banking field.  In 

addition, we have two new research papers on MDIs out of the Chicago Fed, one that 

explores MDI primary markets, and one that looks at MDI small business lending. 

Tomorrow you’ll have an opportunity to hear about and discuss this new research, which 

will be finalized later this year.   

Third, we have a great deal of expertise in community banks, which I know most 

of you are.  Of the 829 state member banks that the Federal Reserve directly supervises, 

97 percent are community banks.  Therefore, we spend a good deal of time thinking 

about the issues facing community banks and how to help them be competitive in today’s 

economy.  I recognize that as MDIs you share many of the same issues as other 

community banks, and also some issues that are unique to your sector.  We want to work 

with you to better understand those issues and to help you, where possible, to better serve 

your communities.
