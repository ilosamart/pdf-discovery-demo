context of a resolution plan could affect day-to-day operations during normal times and might 

reduce efficiency by preventing firms from realizing economies of scope, resulting in increased 

costs of financial services for households and businesses.   

Both these examples suggest how regulators might, in certain instances, be required to 

make trade-offs between systemic risk and efficiency considerations.  An additional concern 

would arise if some countries made the trade-off by limiting the size or configuration of their 

financial firms for systemic risk reasons at the cost of realizing genuine economies of scope or 

scale, while other countries did not.  In this case, firms from the first group of countries might 

well be at a competitive disadvantage in the provision of certain cross-border activities.  The 

existence of international agreements such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisionâ€™s 

capital surcharge on systemically important institutions should allay this concern but, depending 

on national choices associated with systemic risk mitigation, might not eliminate it.   

But I am getting ahead of things here.  Returning to my starting point, I reiterate that the 

importance of this research agenda lies precisely in determining how significant these trade-offs 

might be.  The events of the past few years make brutally clear the potential for societal damage 

associated with systemic risk.  Considerable work has already been done by academics and 

policymakers to develop systemic risk metrics, and thus to lay the groundwork for sound 

macroprudential regulatory measures.  As we and our counterparts in other countries move 

forward with the implementation of these measures, a complementary stream of work on scale 

and scope would substantially enhance these efforts.   

I recognize that studying scale and scope economies in large financial conglomerates 

presents some practical challenges.  The small number of very large and diversified financial 

firms, the difficulties delineating specific activities of interest, and the problems in measuring
