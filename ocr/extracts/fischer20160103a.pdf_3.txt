rate that would prevail in the long-run once all of the shocks affecting the economy die 

down.2 In terms of the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy, it is the real 

interest rate at which the economy would settle at full employment and with inflation at 

2 percent--provided the economy is not at the ZLB.  

Recent interest in estimates of r* has been strengthened by the secular stagnation 

hypothesis, forcefully put forward by Larry Summers in a number of papers, in which the 

value of r* plays a central role.3 Research that was motivated in part by attempts that 

began some time ago to specify the constant term in standard versions of the Taylor rule 

has shown a declining trend in estimates of r*.  That finding has become more firmly 

established since the start of the Great Recession and the global financial crisis.4

A variety of models and statistical approaches suggest that the current level of 

short-run r* may be close to zero.  Moreover, the level of short-run r* seems likely to rise 

only gradually to a longer-run level that is still quite low by historical standards.  For 

example, the median long-run real federal funds rate reported in the Federal Reserve’s 

Summary of Economic Projections prepared in connection with the December 2015

meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee has been revised down about

1/2 percentage point over the past three years to a level of 1-1/2 percent.5 As shown in 

the figure, a decline in the value of r* seems consistent with the decline in the level of 

longer-term real rates observed in the United States and other countries.

Laubach and Williams (2003) framework. An international perspective on medium-to-long-run real 
interest rates is provided by U.S. Executive Office of the President (2015).  Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and 
Hall (2014) discuss the long-lived effects of financial crises on economic performance. See also Hamilton 
and others (2015).
