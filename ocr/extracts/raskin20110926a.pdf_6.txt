would have happened to U.S. employment if monetary policy had failed to respond 

forcefully to the financial crisis and economic downturn?  Economic models--the Fed’s 

and others--suggest that if the federal funds rate target had been held at a fixed level of 5 

percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 until now, rather than being reduced to its actual 

target range of 0 to 1/4 percent,

 then the unemployment rate would be several percentage 

points higher than it is today.  In other words, by following our actual policy of keeping 

the target funds rate at its effective lower bound since late 2008, the Federal Reserve 

saved millions of jobs that would otherwise have been lost.  Of course, substantial 

uncertainty surrounds various specific estimates, but there should be no doubt that the 

FOMC’s forceful actions helped mitigate the consequences of the crisis and thereby 

spared American families and businesses from even greater pain. 

Unconventional Monetary Policy Actions 

Given the magnitude of the global financial crisis and its aftermath, the Federal 

Reserve clearly needed to provide additional monetary accommodation beyond simply 

keeping short-term interest rates close to zero.  Consequently, like a number of other 

major central banks around the world, the FOMC has been deploying unconventional 

policy tools to promote the economic recovery.   

In particular, we have provided conditional forward guidance about the likely 

future path of the federal funds rate, and we have engaged in balance sheet operations 

that involve changes in the size and composition of our securities holdings.  Broadly 

speaking, these policy tools affect the economy through channels that are similar--though 

not identical--to those of conventional monetary policy.  I’ll now spend a few minutes

 The simulation described here assumes, as is common in the literature, that the policy follows its 

historically typical behavior once the assumed counterfactual path for the federal funds rate ends.
