Along with other data, the SCF shows that most students and their families are 

having a harder time affording college.  College costs have risen much faster than income 

for the large majority of households since 2001 and have become especially burdensome 

for households in the bottom half of the earnings distribution. 

Rising college costs, the greater numbers of students pursuing higher education, 

and the recent trends in income and wealth have led to a dramatic increase in student loan 

debt.  Outstanding student loan debt quadrupled from $260 billion in 2004 to $1.1 trillion 

this year.  Sorting families by wealth, the SCF shows that the relative burden of education 

debt has long been higher for families with lower net worth, and that this disparity has 

grown much wider in the past couple decades.  Figure 10 shows that from 1995 to 2013, 

outstanding education debt grew from 26 percent of average yearly income for the lower 

half of households to 58 percent of income.34  The education debt burden was lower and 

grew a little less sharply for the next 45 percent of families and was much lower and 

grew not at all for the top 5 percent.35 

Higher education has been and remains a potent source of economic opportunity 

in America, but I fear the large and growing burden of paying for it may make it harder 

for many young people to take advantage of the opportunity higher education offers.  

Opportunities to Build Wealth through Business Ownership 

For many people, the opportunity to build a business has long been an important 

part of the American dream.  In addition to housing and financial assets, the SCF shows 

                                                 
15 percent.  See Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz (2014), “Do the Benefits of College Still Outweigh the 

Costs?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance, vol. 20 (3),

34 Education debt in the SCF reflects the total amount of debt outstanding at the time of the survey. 
35 Education debt-to-income ratio is calculated based on what SCF respondents reported as their usual 

income.  Numbers are for families with education debt.
