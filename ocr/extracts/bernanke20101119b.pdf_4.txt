second quarter of 2010.1  To provide additional monetary accommodation, several central 

banks--among them the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Bank of 

Japan--purchased significant quantities of financial assets, including government debt, 

mortgage-backed securities, or covered bonds, depending on the central bank.  Asset 

purchases seem to have been effective in easing financial conditions; for example, the 

evidence suggests that such purchases significantly lowered longer-term interest rates in 

both the United States and the United Kingdom.2

   Although the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system and provide 

monetary accommodation helped set the stage for recovery, economic growth rates in the 

advanced economies have been relatively weak.  Of course, the economic outlook varies 

importantly by country and region, and the policy responses to these developments 

among central banks have differed accordingly.  In the United States, we have seen a 

slowing of the pace of expansion since earlier this year.  The unemployment rate has 

remained close to 10 percent since mid-2009, with a substantial fraction of the 

unemployed out of work for six months or longer.  Moreover, inflation has been 

declining and is currently quite low, with measures of underlying inflation running close 

to 1 percent.  Although we project that economic growth will pick up and unemployment 

decline somewhat in the coming year, progress thus far has been disappointingly slow.   


 In this environment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that 

additional monetary policy accommodation was needed to support the economic recovery 

and help ensure that inflation, over time, is at desired levels.  Accordingly, the FOMC 

                                                           
1 Recent work at the Bank of Canada (see He, 2010) suggests that the bank’s forward guidance may have 
pushed back expectations of when policy accommodation would be withdrawn.  For a differing view, see 
Chehal and Trehan (2009).
