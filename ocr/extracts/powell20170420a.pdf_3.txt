financial system to good health and address the many structural weaknesses that had become 

apparent.   

Today, the first of those tasks is well along.  We have gone eight years without a 

subsequent recession--one of the longest recoveries on record.  Employment is now almost 7 

million jobs higher than its pre-crisis peak, with all of the net gains coming from the private 

sector.  And with unemployment at 4.5 percent, we are at or close to full employment.  

 But all is not well.  Although job growth has been strong, gross domestic product has 

increased only about 2 percent annually since the crisis, held down by the weakest sustained 

period of labor productivity growth since World War II.  Labor productivity--the increase in 

output per hour--has increased only ½ percent per year since 2011, about a quarter of its post-war 

average.  The productivity slowdown has profound implications for our national well-being.  

This slowdown is a worldwide phenomenon, so it is likely that there are global forces at work.  

The slowdown has been associated with weak investment and a decline in output gains from 

technological innovation.   

We need a national focus on increasing the sustainable growth rate of our economy.5  

That means investing in our workforce to give them the skills and aptitudes they need to compete 

in the global economy.  It means policies that reward work, and policies that support investment 

and research.  For the most part, these policies are not in the purview of the Federal Reserve.   

 What about the second goal?  As with the economy, we have made great progress toward 

our goals.  Today, our financial system is without a doubt far stronger than it was before the 

crisis.  The largest financial institutions now hold much higher levels of higher-quality capital.
