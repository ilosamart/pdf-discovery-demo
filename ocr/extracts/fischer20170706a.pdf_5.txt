Innovation 

Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated.  

Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low-hanging fruit on the productivity 

tree and, in particular, that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course.4  

Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year.  

These observers believe that innovation yields better tools, such as 3-D printers and 

genetic sequencing equipment, which themselves enable further technological advances.5  

For what it is worth, I believe the early signs of self-driving cars, the emergence of 

disease treatments based on genetics, and the falling costs for conventional and 

alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate, both in IT as 

well as in other parts of the economy.  One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull 

while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations; it took decades before the full 

benefits of the steam engine, electrification, and computers were seen.6 

One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development 

(R&D), and here the recent record is mixed.  As shown in figure 3, R&D spending in the 

United States softened during the Great Recession.  R&D funded by U.S. businesses has 

since recovered.  However, government-funded R&D as a share of gross domestic 

product is at the lowest level in recent history.  A great deal of the “R” in overall R&D is 

                                                 
4 Gordon (2014, p. 25) enumerates the inventions of the information age--the personal computer, the 
Internet, mobile phones, and so on--and notes that for innovation to continue at such a pace, “the 
achievements of the past 40 years set a hurdle that is dauntingly high.” 
5 Mokyr (2014, p. 83) considers advances in research methods and tools and concludes that “the indirect 
effects of science on productivity through the tools it provides scientific research may dwarf the direct 
effects in the long run.” 
6 David (1990) cautions that the effect of general-purpose technologies, such as electricity and electronic 
computing, can take decades to fully unfold.  Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) consider the process followed 
by firms in leveraging innovations in IT equipment and emphasize the role of complementary investment in 
intangible assets like business reorganization.
