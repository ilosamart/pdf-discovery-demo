regulation refers primarily to the rules that firms must follow.  Regulation starts with 

laws passed by Congress which are the basis for specific and detailed rules written by the 

Fed and other agencies.  Supervision, on the other hand, involves monitoring and

how they manage risks, and their corporate governance, to make sure they are complying 

with laws and regulations and operating in a safe and sound manner.
