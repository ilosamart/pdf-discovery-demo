strains on many businesses and households have been severe.  This consequence is 

starkly evident in the recent pattern of loan delinquency rates.  Delinquency rates have 

been slow to return to their pre-recession levels, with some of these measures, such as 

those associated with certain categories of real estate loans, staying still quite elevated 

today.  Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve’s data show that after contracting for 

several quarters, lending by smaller domestic banks generally resumed expanding around 

the middle of last year.  Although measures of community banks’ profitability have risen 

from their recession lows, pressures on the banks’ profitability and credit quality remain 

as a result of the lingering weak macroeconomic fundamentals, especially the stubbornly 

high amount of unemployment. 

In that regard, although the pace of employment growth has picked up in recent 

months and the unemployment rate has fallen some, the labor market remains quite weak.  

At the end of 2011, more than 13 million Americans were out of work.  An additional 8 

million workers were classified as “part time for economic reasons” because their hours 

had been cut back or they were unable to find a full-time job.  In addition, about 2-1/2 

million Americans were classified as “marginally attached” to the labor force because 

even though they wanted to get a job, they had not searched for one in the past four 

weeks.  And almost half of that group--nearly 1 million individuals--had given up 

searching for employment altogether because they did not believe any jobs were available 

to them.  The unemployed, the underemployed, the marginally attached, and the 

discouraged can speak powerfully to the slow pace of the recovery.    

The economic data in this regard correspond to what I have seen firsthand since 

being at the Federal Reserve.  I have traveled to once-robust cities in the Midwest and in
