Among the questions posed by the organizers of this 50
th

 Annual Conference on Bank 

Structure and Competition is how the “regulatory-supervisory framework has fundamentally 

changed.”   I think one answer is that the aims and scope of prudential regulation have been 

fundamentally redefined since the financial crisis.  Most significantly, a concern with financial 

stability and an increased emphasis on macroprudential regulation have informed major changes 

in both banking law and supervision.  This salutary shift in perspective has important 

implications for prudential regulation.  One is that prudential regulation must deal with threats to 

financial stability whether or not those threats emanate from traditional banking organizations.  

Hence the need to broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank 

financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors.  

A second implication—to which I will devote most of my remarks this morning—is that 

the aims of prudential regulation for traditional banking organizations should vary according to 

the size, scope, and range of activities of the organizations.  By specifying these aims with more 

precision, we can shape both a more effective regulatory system and a more efficient one.  That 

is, once we have specified the regulatory aims for a particular type of financial institution, we 

can more effectively rationalize and, as appropriate, differentiate the rules and requirements to be 

applied to each kind of institution.   

The Legacy of a Unitary Approach to Bank Regulation 

 When I was teaching banking law prior to my appointment to the Board of Governors, I 

noticed an interesting disconnect in the best casebooks in the field.  An introductory chapter on 

the history and purposes of bank regulation revealed a complicated set of issues concerning 

changes in the structure and activities of banks, which, among other things, suggested that the 

rationales for regulating banks might vary depending on the size, business model, and affiliations
