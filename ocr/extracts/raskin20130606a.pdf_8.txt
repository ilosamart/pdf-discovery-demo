There is significant justification for both higher levels, and higher quality, of capital.  In 

particular, we have seen that highly capitalized banks are more likely to maintain their lending 

activity through good times and bad, as evidenced during the recent crisis, a trend that helps their 

customers and the overall economy.

  A framework requiring higher quality and quantity of 

capital should be established post-haste.  At the same time, however, for community banks in 

particular, more and better capital should be achieved without significantly increasing the 

complexity of capital calculations.  It is not only possible and desirable, but also necessary, to 

ensure that our capital requirements for community banks remain relatively simple and effective.  

Otherwise, we risk drowning banks in a capital adequacy system that is so complex that it both 

misses the mark of addressing meaningful emerging risks and piles regulatory costs on banks 

with no public benefit.  I should note here that the proposed Basel III rules include complex 

models-based approaches for internationally-active banks and for banks with significant trading 

activities.  These models-based approaches are clearly inappropriate for, and will not apply to, 

community banks. 

Risk-Weighted Assets 

To step back, the first framework for risk-based capital was implemented in the United 

States in 1989 and entailed assigning assets to one of four defined risk-weighting categories: zero 

percent, 20 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent, with a higher percentage signifying higher 

inherent risk.

  This had the advantage of making the framework more risk-sensitive than the 

simpler, one-size-fits-all, leverage-based approach that I will discuss later.  As a result, a 

Treasury security and an unsecured loan to a start-up business were no longer treated identically

 Note that the number of risk weight buckets would increase under the Basel III notices of proposed rulemaking 

(77 Fed. Reg. 52791 and 77 Fed. Reg. 52887), but would still remain relatively small.
