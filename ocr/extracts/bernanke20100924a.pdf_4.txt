economic frameworks in real time--for example, in the private sector, the management of 

complex financial institutions or, in the public sector, the day-to-day supervision of those 

institutions.   

As you may have already guessed, my terminology is intended to invoke a loose 

analogy with science and engineering.  Underpinning any practical scientific or 

engineering endeavor, such as a moon shot, a heart transplant, or the construction of a 

skyscraper are:  first, fundamental scientific knowledge; second, principles of design and 

engineering, derived from experience and the application of fundamental knowledge; and 

third, the management of the particular endeavor, often including the coordination of the 

efforts of many people in a complex enterprise while dealing with myriad uncertainties.  

Success in any practical undertaking requires all three components.  For example, the 

fight to control AIDS requires scientific knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of 

the disease (the scientific component), the development of medical technologies and 

public health strategies (the engineering applications), and the implementation of those 

technologies and strategies in specific communities and for individual patients (the 

management aspect).  Twenty years ago, AIDS mortality rates mostly reflected gaps in 

scientific understanding and in the design of drugs and treatment technologies; today, the 

problem is more likely to be a lack of funding or trained personnel to carry out programs 

or to apply treatments. 

With that taxonomy in hand, I would argue that the recent financial crisis was 

more a failure of economic engineering and economic management than of what I have 

called economic science.  The economic engineering problems were reflected in a 

number of structural weaknesses in our financial system.  In the private sector, these
