What was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what 

was then called the Women’s College, the large majority of whom got married, raised 

families, and did not pursue careers.  The fact that many women left work upon marriage 

reflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures.  

The occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely 

circumscribed.  Most women lacked significant education--only 54 percent of girls aged 

5 to 19 were enrolled in school in 1890.4  And women with little education mostly toiled 

as piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often 

unsafe.  Educated women, like those who attended Brown’s Women’s College, were 

scarce.  Fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of 

higher education, and just one-third of those were women.5  Such women did not have to 

perform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained.  Edna McDonald was 

a graduate of the Class of 1919, and in her oral history, she summed up the opportunities 

for her and her classmates:  “Let’s be frank,” she said. “What choices did women have?  

Teaching.  You could teach.  You could be a lab technician.  Or you could go into office 

work and be a secretary.  Those were the only real choices.”  Margery Chittenden 

Leonard graduated from Pembroke in 1929 and went on to earn a J.D. as the only woman 

in her class at Boston University--after two others withdrew.  And with that law degree, 

her first job was as a secretary, and she continued to struggle to find work as a lawyer.  In 

her oral history, Doris Madeline Hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity
