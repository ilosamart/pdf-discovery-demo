Doubtless, investment in education and training has been a key source of the remarkable 

economic gains that the South has achieved over the past 50 years or so.  

I am confident that, in light of this experience, your efforts to improve education 

and workforce skills will continue.  As you do that, please keep in mind that formal K-12 

and post-secondary education, as important as they are, do not alone build better 

workforces.  Research increasingly has shown the importance for both individuals and 

the economy as a whole of both early childhood education as well as efforts to promote 

the lifelong acquisition of skills.  The payoffs of early childhood programs can be 

especially high.7  For instance, investment in preschool programs for disadvantaged 

children has been shown to increase high school graduation rates.  Because high school 

graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely to need to use public 

health programs, such investments can pay off even from the narrow perspective of state 

budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to the individuals themselves 

are much greater.8

Additionally, in a dynamic economy in which job requirements are constantly 

changing, individuals already in the workforce need opportunities to improve their skills 

throughout their lives.  There are many ways to provide such opportunities.  For example, 

community colleges and vocational schools play essential roles in training and retraining 

workers, especially if they do so in close collaboration with private employers, and they
