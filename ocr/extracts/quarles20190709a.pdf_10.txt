additional details about the scenario design features that underpins each year's scenarios, 

and a range of other enhancements. 

Some argue that the greater transparency and disclosure promoted by recent 

changes and proposed changes to stress testing amounts to providing banks with the 

answers to the tests.2  This both overstates the extent of disclosure involved and 

misunderstands what we are trying to accomplish in stress testing—goals that haven’t 

changed since the spring of 2009.   

If the goal were only to conduct a test that was difficult to pass—like the 

qualifying exams for some of the more esoteric and restrictive high-IQ societies—then 

trying to explain principles, scenario design, and how models work would be 

inappropriate.  If the measure of success for the Fed in administering a stress test was 

simply how many banks failed, then greater transparency would indeed be a mistake.  But 

that is not the purpose of stress testing, and it never has been. 

The vitally important goal is to improve and sustain good risk management and 

capital planning at the individual institutions we supervise and to promote the stability of 

the financial system.  Like a teacher, we don’t want banks to fail, we want them to learn. 

In this case, we want them to learn good risk management in the context of forward-

looking capital planning.  This will provide the public with more information about the 

capital planning of major banks, and about how the Federal Reserve views good capital 

planning and risk management, bolstering our credibility.
