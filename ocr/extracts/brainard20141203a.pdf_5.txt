bottlenecks that could impede orderly adjustments.  Finally, when there is a close brush 

with specific risk events, we closely study the behavior of markets and institutions for 

insights into possible structural vulnerabilities that might be revealed and assess possible 

policy actions. 

Second pillar:  Macroprudential policy 

The ultimate objective of our surveillance is to build resilience of firms and 

markets and to counter risks early enough to prevent disruptions to financial stability that 

could damage the real economy.  While the macroprudential toolkit is larger than it was 

pre-crisis, there is a substantial amount of work remaining to implement some of these 

tools.  In particular, as I will discuss in more detail, the ability of the available tools to 

counteract time-varying risks has yet to be tested in the U.S.  

First, the Federal Reserve is well along in promulgating an important system of 

new, through-the-cycle safeguards that together should deliver much greater structural 

resilience and make excessive risk-taking costly for the large, complex institutions that 

pose the greatest risks to the financial system.  Second, the Federal Reserve is assessing 

the kinds of broad time-varying regulatory tools that might further buttress resilience 

during periods in which risks associated with rapid credit expansion are building.  Third, 

the Federal Reserve is exploring tools that can be varied over the cycle to target specific 

activities, recognizing that we will have limited authorities relative to some foreign 

financial regulators in operating on the borrowing side and outside the regulatory 

perimeter of the banking system.  Letâ€™s take each in turn. 

Tool One:  Structural resilience 

We are relatively far advanced, and compare favorably to other jurisdictions, in 

implementing a framework of rules and supervision that compels large, complex financial
