More generally, small business owners surveyed by the NFIB indicate that they 

currently expect business conditions to improve in the near future.  In fact, the net 

percentage of small business respondents who expected business conditions to improve 

six months from now climbed in February to its highest level in several years (figure 4).  

Even with some backtracking in March, this barometer of business conditions remains at 

a level not seen since mid-2007.   

Other survey data collected by the NFIB are also consistent with more-favorable 

conditions for small businesses.  The percentages of small business respondents who 

believe it is a good time to expand, and who plan to make capital expenditures over the 

next three to six months, have recently risen to levels not seen since mid-2007. 

The Bankers’ Perspective on Lending to Small Businesses 

Mirroring small business respondents views with respect to credit conditions are 

bankers’ views on credit standards and their terms of credit.  To consider the bankers’ 

perspective, I will draw on two other Federal Reserve surveys:  the Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) and the Survey of Terms of 

Business Lending (STBL).  With regard to credit standards, we found that about 

5 percent of banks, on net, reported in January that they had eased their bank’s lending 

standards on commercial and industrial loans to small firms in the fourth quarter of last 

year (figure 5).7  A similar net fraction of banks reported having eased standards in the 

previous survey.  This finding is consistent with small business owners’ perceptions that 

credit conditions have eased somewhat.
