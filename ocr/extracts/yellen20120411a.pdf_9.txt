defense and nondefense purchases are expected to decline over the next several years 

under the spending caps put in place last year.   

A third factor weighing on the outlook is the sluggish pace of economic growth 

abroad.  Strains in global financial markets have eased somewhat since late last year, an 

improvement that reflects in part policy actions taken by European authorities.  

Nonetheless, risk premiums on sovereign debt and other securities are still elevated in 

many European countries, while European banks continue to face pressure to shrink their 

balance sheets, and concerns about the outlook for the region remain.  A further 

slowdown in economic activity in Europe and in other foreign economies would inhibit 

U.S. export growth.   

For these reasons, I anticipate that the U.S. economy will continue to recover only 

gradually and that labor market slack will remain substantial for a number of years to 

come.   

One consideration that further complicates this outlook is the inconsistency 

between recent movements in economic growth and employment:  Unemployment has 

declined significantly over the past year even though growth appears to have been only 

moderate.  This unanticipated decline in the unemployment rate presents something of a 

puzzle, and it creates uncertainties for the outlook and policy.     

To illustrate this puzzle, figure 5 plots changes in the unemployment rate against 

real GDP growth--a simple portrayal of the relationship known as Okunâ€™s law.  It is 

evident from the figure that 2011 is something of an outlier, with the drop in the 

unemployment rate last year much larger than would seem consistent with real GDP 

growth below 2 percent.  One possibility, highlighted by Chairman Bernanke in a recent
