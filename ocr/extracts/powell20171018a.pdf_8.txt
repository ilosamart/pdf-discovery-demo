payment system.  About five years ago, we launched our payment system improvement 

initiative, which committed the Federal Reserve to working with the full range of 

payments system stakeholders to achieve a faster, more secure payment system.  We saw 

that technology was transforming the nature of commerce and end-user expectations for 

payment services.  We saw some players coming to market with innovative product 

offerings, but it was a fragmented approach.  Meanwhile, other countries were advancing 

on initiatives to improve the speed and safety of their payment systems, creating a gap 

between the U.S. payment system and those abroad.   

While the Federal Reserve does not have plenary authority over payment systems, 

as is the case in some other countries, we have often played an important role as a leader 

and catalyst for change.  It was in this role that we issued a call to action asking 

stakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future—

focusing on speed, security, efficiency, international payments, and collaboration.5  I 

believe a collaborative approach ensures that change is designed by those whose 

commitment and expertise are needed to improve the payment system. 

Stakeholders – including banks, fintech companies, consumer groups, regulators, 

and others -- answered our call to action, signing up for two task forces convened by the 

Federal Reserve.  More than 300 stakeholders joined the Faster Payments Task Force, 

and around 200 joined the Secure Payments Task Force.  Let me first touch upon the 

Faster Payments Task Force, which has recently completed its work.6
