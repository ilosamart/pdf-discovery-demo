activities in response to the incentives created by regulations calibrated with credit and funding 

risks in mind.  Our stress test and CCAR exercises should ensure that the largest banks will not 

maintain distributions of capital to their shareholders in the face of rising financial stress, as they 

did in 2007 and 2008, which left them more vulnerable to the crisis. 

There are surely refinements that can be made to the regulatory regime that has emerged, 

particularly--though not exclusively--with respect to smaller banks that pose neither systemic nor 

macroprudential risks.  And, as I have suggested, there is surely a healthy debate to be had as to 

whether additional strengthening of resiliency measures is appropriate for the largest institutions.  

But I do not think there is a sound economic case for generally weakening the regulatory 

requirements applicable to the largest banks.  And I certainly do not think the taxpayers should 

bear the risk that would be entailed by any such weakening.
