in the lobby there were donuts with sprinkles and coffee, and the donuts came from the bakery 

next to the bank, which meant they were exceedingly special.   

Years later, I learned that this bank was swallowed up by a larger competitor.  But what 

was important about this bank, and why it remains so vivid in my memory, is that it was part of 

the fabric of our community.  Our bank not only bought the local donuts, it sponsored the local 

Little League team, had a table at the summer sidewalk sale, made the hand fans for the Fourth 

of July parade, gave money to the local hospital’s candy stripers, and surely did hundreds of 

other things invisible to me but nonetheless sewn into the tapestry of the lives of our community.  

Community Banking Today 

Lest this sound only like nostalgia for small-town America, let’s remember that the vast 

majority of American banks today are still very much like this one in scale, and have deep roots 

in their communities.

  For the most part, these banks did not engage in subprime lending, nor 

did they otherwise contribute to the financial crisis.  These banks provide their towns with 

sustainable and affordable credit, and have employees on hand to provide families with good 

advice about how to save for cars, houses, new businesses, and education. 

This large segment of financial institutions is a necessary and critical part of our 

country’s financial landscape.  And it is returning to strength.  While revenue is not fully back to 

pre-crisis levels, the community banking sector is solidly profitable.  Asset quality has improved 

and appears to have stabilized and capital ratios have been strengthened and remain, on average, 

higher than those of larger banks.

 According to Call Report data, as of March 31, 2013, 98 percent of the 6,017 insured commercial banks in the 

United States had total assets of $10 billion or less, which is the threshold that the Federal Reserve typically uses to 

define community banks.  And the vast majority of these (91 percent of all insured commercial banks) are much 

smaller as of that date, with less than $1 billion in total assets.
