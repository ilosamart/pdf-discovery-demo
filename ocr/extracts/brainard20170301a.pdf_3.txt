Near-term risks to the United States from abroad appear to have diminished.  

Recoveries are gaining traction in China, Europe, and Japan in part reflecting greater 

confidence in their respective policy environments.  The improvement in the global risk 

outlook was also helped by the continued economic progress and the gradual pace of 

monetary policy adjustment in the United States last year. 

In recent quarters, market participants appear more confident that China has the 

will and capacity to maintain its exchange rate regime, while achieving its growth targets, 

although there is a tension with high credit growth that will eventually need to be 

addressed.  Early last year, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which had 

averaged nearly 8 percent over the previous five years, was only a little above an annual 

rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, according to official data, and many observers 

believe that actual growth was weaker.  Relatively large discrete declines in the renminbi 

against the dollar and a surge in private-sector investment outflows led to considerable 

volatility in foreign exchange markets and financial markets more broadly.  

In response, Chinese authorities boosted the supply of credit, ramped up fiscal 

stimulus, initiated new communications regarding the exchange rate, and clamped down 

on capital outflows.  These actions appear to have stabilized growth and calmed fears of 

financial instability stemming from a sudden large devaluation in the renminbi.  GDP 

growth rebounded to an average annual pace of over 7 percent in the final three quarters 

of the year.  The exchange value of the renminbi has remained relatively constant against 

the central bank’s designated basket of currencies, and it has depreciated against the 

dollar at a more gradual pace.  Capital outflows, while still significant, have moderated.
