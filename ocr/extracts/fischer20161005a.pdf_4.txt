monetary policy should be to pursue price stability, a modern interpretation of Wicksell’s 

rule would suggest that the central bank should raise the interest rate if inflation is above 

target and reduce the interest rate if inflation is below target.3  When inflation stabilized, 

the central bank would know that the interest rate was at its natural level.  In principle, 

this method could be extended to a reaction function that included both an inflation and a 

maximum-employment objective for the central bank, as is the case for the Federal 

Reserve. 

But there is another way of measuring the natural rate of interest.  Instead of 

backing out the value of the natural rate of interest by following Wicksell’s rule-based 

approach, one could try to estimate the natural rate directly with the help of an economic 

model.  One prominent example of this approach is the work of my Federal Reserve 

colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams.4   

Laubach and Williams estimated the natural rate in a small-scale Keynesian 

model where inflation responds to the gap between actual and potential gross domestic 

product (GDP) and economic activity is determined by a simple equation that links 

deviations of actual from potential GDP to the gap between actual and natural interest 

rates.  In their model, as in Wicksell’s framework, inflation generally will rise if the 

interest rate is low relative to the natural rate and fall if the interest rate is high relative to 

the natural rate.  Their empirical results point to the growth rate of potential GDP as an 

important determinant of the natural rate of interest, a topic that I will discuss shortly. 

                                                 
3 Wicksell’s proposed rule was based on the price level rather than inflation:  “So long as prices remain 
unaltered the banks’ rate of interest is to be raised; and if prices fall, the rate of interest is to be lowered; 
and the rate of interest is henceforth to be maintained at its new level until a further movement of prices 
calls for a further change in one direction or the other” (Wicksell, 1936, p. 189).
