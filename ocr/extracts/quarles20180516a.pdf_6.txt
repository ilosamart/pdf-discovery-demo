As the home regulator to U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (G-

SIBs), we and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have used the living wills 

process to set the expectation that a firm appropriately balance prepositioned and centrally 

managed resources.2  This expectation is based on the premise that the optimal balance will 

depend on factors such as the firm’s structure and the host jurisdictions in which the firm 

operates.  As such, the Board and the FDIC have asked U.S. G-SIBs to analyze and anticipate 

capital and liquidity resources needed to ensure the continued operation of material entities in 

resolution.  Regarding capital, the positioning of a U.S. G-SIB’s internal total loss absorbing 

capacity (TLAC) should reflect a balance of certainty--prepositioning internal TLAC directly at 

material entities--and flexibility--holding recapitalization resources at the parent, known as 

contributable resources--to meet unanticipated losses at material entities.3   

Regarding liquidity, the Board and FDIC expect a U.S. G-SIB to appropriately estimate 

and maintain sufficient liquidity for material entities, an expectation known as Resolution 

Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning, or RLAP.4  RLAP expectations are intended to be designed 

so that liquidity is not “double counted” among home and host jurisdictions, to provide 

transparency into the location of liquidity across the firm’s material entities, and to ensure that 

liquidity can flow where needed with minimal potential disruption.  The RLAP approach is 

                                                           
2  Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires a large firm to 
submit an annual resolution plan, or living will, that describes the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly 
resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company.  If the Federal 
Reserve and the FDIC determine that a firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly 
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the agencies, acting jointly, may impose more stringent prudential 
requirements on the firm until it remediates identified deficiencies.
