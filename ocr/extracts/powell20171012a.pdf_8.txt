But the rising amount of debt by itself does not tell us whether this debt is 

excessive and how vulnerable EME corporates are to global monetary and market shocks.  

For that assessment we need to drill down deeper into the health of the corporate sector.  

In a recent study, Beltran and coauthors undertake such an analysis using a common 

metric of debt service capacity--the interest coverage ratio, or ICR, which is the ratio of 

earnings to interest expense.8  All else being equal, this ratio is lower for firms that are 

less profitable, more leveraged, and have a higher cost of borrowing.  Using firm-level 

data, the authors classify the debt of those firms with an ICR of less than 2 as “debt-at-

risk.”9  They find, as shown by the black line in slide 8, that this measure of risky EME 

corporate debt has almost tripled since 2011 to about 30 percent of GDP.  But this share 

is still considerably lower than the 46 percent of GDP debt-at-risk in East Asia on the eve 

of the Asian crisis (the horizontal dashed black line in the chart).  For China, though, the 

debt-at-risk now exceeds what we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis.  Outside of 

China (the dashed blue line), EME debt-at-risk, at about 10 percent of GDP, seems much 

more manageable.  However, as can be seen by the blue portions of the bars in slide 9, 

debt-at-risk in a number of EMEs, including South Korea, India, Turkey, and Brazil 

exceeds that average level.   

How will EME corporate debt fare going forward as global normalization 

proceeds?  The results of the study I just discussed imply that a 1 percentage point 

increase in EME corporate borrowing costs by itself would not be so problematic, at least 

                                                 
8 See Beltran, Garud, and Rosenblum (2017).  Other studies that have recently investigated EME corporate 
vulnerabilities include Alfaro, Chari and Panizza (2017); International Monetary Fund (2014, 2016a); and 
Chow (2015).   
9 An ICR of 2 or less is often associated with increased likelihood of distress.  For example, just before the 
Asian financial crisis, firms in Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand had an average ICR of 2 (see 
Pomerleano, 1998).
