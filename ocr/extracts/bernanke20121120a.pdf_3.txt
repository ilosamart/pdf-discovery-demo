Moreover, many other features of the jobs market, including the historically high level of 

long-term unemployment, the large number of people working part time because they 

have not been able to find full-time jobs, and the decline in labor force participation, 

reinforce the conclusion that we have some way to go before the labor market can be 

deemed healthy again. 

Meanwhile, inflation has generally remained subdued.  As is often the case, 

inflation has been pushed up and down in recent years by fluctuations in the price of 

crude oil and other globally traded commodities, including the increase in farm prices 

brought on by this summer’s drought.  But with longer-term inflation expectations 

remaining stable, the ebbs and flows in commodity prices have had only transitory effects 

on inflation.  Indeed, since the recovery began about three years ago, consumer price 

inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has 

averaged almost exactly 2 percent, which is the FOMC’s longer-run objective for 

inflation.1  Because ongoing slack in labor and product markets should continue to 

restrain wage and price increases, and with the public’s inflation expectations continuing 

to be well anchored,  inflation over the next few years is likely to remain close to or a 

little below the Committee’s objective. 

As background for our monetary policy decisionmaking, we at the Federal 

Reserve have spent a good deal of effort attempting to understand the reasons why the 

economic recovery has not been stronger.  Studies of previous financial crises provide 

one helpful place to start.2  This literature has found that severe financial crises--

                                                 
1 Inflation excluding food and energy has averaged a little less, about 1-1/2 percent, over this period.
