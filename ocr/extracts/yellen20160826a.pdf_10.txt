Two of the Fed’s most important new tools--our authority to pay interest on 

excess reserves and our asset purchases--interacted importantly.  Without IOER 

authority, the Federal Reserve would have been reluctant to buy as many assets as it did 

because of the longer-run implications for controlling the stance of monetary policy.  

While we were buying assets aggressively to help bring the U.S. economy out of a severe 

recession, we also had to keep in mind whether and how we would be able to remove 

monetary policy accommodation when appropriate.  That issue was particularly relevant 

because we fund our asset purchases through the creation of reserves, and those 

additional reserves would have made it ever more difficult for the pre-crisis toolkit to 

raise short-term interest rates when needed.  

The FOMC considered removing accommodation by first reducing our asset 

holdings (including through asset sales) and raising the federal funds rate only after our 

balance sheet had contracted substantially.  But we decided against this approach because 

our ability to predict the effects of changes in the balance sheet on the economy is less 

than that associated with changes in the federal funds rate.  Excessive inflationary 

pressures could arise if assets were sold too slowly.  Conversely, financial markets and 

the economy could potentially be destabilized if assets were sold too aggressively.  

Indeed, the so-called taper tantrum of 2013 illustrates the difficulty of predicting financial 

market reactions to announcements about the balance sheet.  Given the uncertainty and 

potential costs associated with large-scale asset sales, the FOMC instead decided to begin 

                                                 
have helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David
