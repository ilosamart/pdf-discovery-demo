financial system even when there is some uncertainty regarding the probability of a 

particular risk being realized.  For example, the scenario might include a sharp drop in 

house prices if analysis suggested—but did not confirm—that there was overheating in 

the housing market, and if supervisors judged that large banks had correlated exposures 

to the housing sector.  That is, the stress tests provide for resiliency in the event the risk 

comes to pass, without necessarily requiring other measures to restrict directly the 

lending or other activity lying behind the risk.   

A macroprudential perspective also counsels against injecting more procyclicality 

into the financial system by, for example, simply assuming a standard deterioration in 

economic conditions from whatever the baseline projections might be.  Such an approach 

would overlook the tendency of systemic risk to build during strong, prolonged 

expansions, when underwriting standards decline, rising asset prices make secured 

lending seem safer, and defaults wane.  The approach we are instead taking is that, under 

such conditions, our severely adverse scenario would assume a level of unemployment 

during the stress period comparable to that observed in past severe recessions, not simply 

an increase in unemployment comparable to the increase observed during those 

recessions.

  Thus, the scenario’s unemployment rate would feature a larger and sharper 

rise in the unemployment rate as economic expansions proceed. 

Finally, stress tests must be modified so as to avoid incentivizing firms to 

correlate their asset holdings or adopt correlated hedging strategies.  This potential
