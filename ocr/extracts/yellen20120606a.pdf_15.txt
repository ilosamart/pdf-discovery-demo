follow a balanced approach to promoting our dual mandate, and so I will refer to it as the 

“balanced-approach” rule.15 

To show the prescriptions these rules would have called for at the April FOMC meeting, I 

start with an illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the projections for unemployment, 

inflation, and the federal funds rate that FOMC participants reported in April.16  I then employ 

the dynamics of one of the Federal Reserve’s economic models, the FRB/US model, to solve for 

the joint paths of these three variables if the short-term interest rate had instead been set 

according to the Taylor (1993) rule or the balanced-approach rule, subject, in both cases, to the 

zero lower bound constraint on the federal funds rate.  The dashed red line in figure 10 shows the 

resulting path for the federal funds rate under Taylor (1993) and the solid blue line with open 

circles illustrates the corresponding path using the balanced-approach rule.17  In both 

simulations, the private sector fully understands that monetary policy follows the particular rule 

in force.18  Figure 10 shows that the Taylor rule calls for monetary policy to tighten immediately, 

while the balanced-approach rule prescribes raising the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 

                                                            
15 The balanced-approach rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 1.0Yt.  In this expression, R is the federal funds 
rate, π is the percent change in the headline personal consumption expenditures price index from four quarters 
earlier, and Y is the output gap.  In a recent speech, I dubbed this rule “Taylor (1999),” as John Taylor described the 
rule in a paper published that year.  Since Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--Taylor (1993)--I 
now refer to the later rule as the “balanced-approach rule.” 
16 The baseline paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the Committee’s 
projections through 2014 and thereafter gradually converge to values consistent with participants’ long-run 
projections.  Similarly, the baseline path for the federal funds rate stays near zero through late 2014 and then rises 
steadily back to the long-run value expected by most participants.  While these assumptions are consistent with 
recent FOMC statements, both the assumed date of liftoff and the longer-run pace of tightening are merely 
illustrative and are not based on any internal FOMC deliberations.  For further details on the construction of the 
baseline, see Yellen, “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” in note 2.   
17 Because both rules respond to the output gap, the projections for the unemployment rate need to be converted into 
a path for the output gap.  The output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.3(5.6-Ut), where 
2.3 is the estimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating 
inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU. 
18 In the simulations, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is assumed to evolve in accordance with the exit strategy 
principles that the FOMC agreed upon at the June 2011 meeting.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (2011), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 21-22, 2011,” press release, July 12,
