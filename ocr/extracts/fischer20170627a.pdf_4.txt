valuation pressures.3  Briefly, leverage, across a range of institutions, is a key amplifier of 

solvency shocks, leading to a greater chance of a credit crunch or fire sale.  Liquidity and 

maturity mismatches can generate run risk, leading to fire sales and contagion.  Finally, 

elevated valuation pressures, especially when combined with high leverage, can lead to 

excessive credit growth.  When asset prices are appreciating rapidly and expected to 

continue to do so, borrowers and lenders are more willing to accept higher degrees of risk 

and leverage.   

Using a range of indicators, we assess these cyclical vulnerabilities relative to past 

experience.  That is, we evaluate where the current levels of these indicators stand 

compared with their historical values, to identify whether they point to a low, average, or 

high level of vulnerabilities.  While we try to rely on quantitative indicators, in the end, 

this evaluation requires some degree of judgment.  We also closely monitor potential 

structural vulnerabilities, such as funding models and institutions that provide critical 

plumbing services to the system.  Because these structural vulnerabilities are less 

amenable to traditional quantitative monitoring, their identification and assessment 

follow a less formal process.  I will leave that discussion to another time.  

As mentioned, complementary to the vulnerabilities-oriented approach is an 

approach that focuses on institutions.  If the financial system is overleveraged, that 

vulnerability has to be evident at particular institutions.  An institutions-oriented 

framework can help us keep track of sector- or institution-specific structural 

vulnerabilities that may be masked by our overall assessment and provides additional
