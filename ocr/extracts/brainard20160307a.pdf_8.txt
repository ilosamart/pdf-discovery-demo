Liquidity 

 In addition to raising uncertainty around the outlook, the recent financial market 

volatility has underscored the importance of ongoing attention to the resilience of market 

liquidity.  Although it is fair to say that the recent uptick in volatility has in part reduced 

earlier concerns about prolonged low volatility and associated reach-for-yield behavior, it 

has placed added focus on the resilience of liquidity, particularly in markets, such as the 

market for corporate bonds, that may be prone to gapping between liquidity demand and 

supply in stressed conditions.   

The Federal Reserve’s surveillance of liquidity conditions in financial markets has 

broadened and deepened considerably since the “taper tantrum” in mid-2013 and the 

events of October 2014 in the Treasury market.  The analysis so far suggests a few 

preliminary observations.  While it does not appear that day-to-day liquidity has declined 

notably, some characteristics of liquidity provision are changing.  Broadly, traditional 

price-based measures of liquidity such as bid-asked spreads and the price effect of a 

given trade size generally remain in line with pre-crisis norms in most markets.  In 

contrast, both anecdotes from market participants and the declining size of trades in some 

markets suggest it may have become more expensive to conduct, and may take more time 

to implement, large trades.9 

Moreover, there may be some deterioration in the resilience of liquidity at times 

of stress, along with a greater incidence of outsized intraday price movements.  Relatedly, 

liquidity appears to be more segmented based on the characteristics of the securities 

                                                 
move lower in coming months as these relatively large monthly increases drop out of the 12-month 
window.
