fourths of Uber drivers say that the greater control over their work schedules that Uber 

allows has made their lives better.12 

However, there are likely many workers who would prefer regular full-time 

traditional work to contingent work, particularly if much of the power in determining 

hours worked in alternative work arrangements belongs to the employer.  Technological 

advances have enabled firms to use just-in-time strategies for their employees, making 

them in effect on-call workers.  This is a rising trend in industries such as retail and food 

preparation.  Several recent articles describe the challenges faced by these just-in-time 

workers, who must conform their hours to the daily and even hourly ebbs and flows of 

business, often not knowing whether they will have work on a given day until they call in 

that morning to inquire.13  These arrangements can leave workers scrambling to patch 

together child care, elder care, and transportation to meet the often unpredictable 

demands of their workplace, while making it difficult to engage in regularly scheduled 

activities to enhance their income and opportunities, such as a second job or career 

training.  While such workers often are not given full-time work, they often must make 

themselves available to work full-time hours.  According to one survey, 71 percent of 

retail workers in New York stated that their hours fluctuated from week to week, while 

half said their employers could change their hours at will.14  It is also notable that the 

increase in contingent work over the past decade has coincided with an increase of 

one-third in the share of employees working part time but who would prefer to work full 

time from 3 percent prior to the Great Recession to close to 4 percent today.
