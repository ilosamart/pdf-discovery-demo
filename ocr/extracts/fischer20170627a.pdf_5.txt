ways to understand how distress at a particular institution or class of institutions may spill 

over to the wider financial system.   

Regardless of whether we are looking at vulnerabilities or institutions, a key 

feature of this monitoring framework is its forward-looking nature.  For example, 

evidence suggests that periods of elevated risk appetite are frequently accompanied by a 

rise in leverage at financial intermediaries.4  This evidence implies that elevated asset 

valuation pressures today may be indicative of rising vulnerabilities tomorrow.5 

Of course, while a framework provides a disciplined way to evaluate financial 

stability, we constantly evaluate the framework so that we can identify new risks and 

vulnerabilities, which may arise as the financial system evolves--for example, in response 

to market-driven innovation or regulatory reform.  Federal Reserve staff research helps us 

understand and evaluate the evolving, dynamic financial system.  

Before turning to the assessment of the current state of U.S. financial stability, let 

me discuss how we communicate our views on this matter.  The Federal Reserve, unlike 

many other central banks, does not publish a financial stability report.  The United States 

already has two congressionally mandated financial stability reports, one authored by the 

independent Office of Financial Research and a separate report published by the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council that represents the views of the range of financial 

regulators, including the Federal Reserve.  Additional views of Federal Reserve officials 

can be reflected in a range of other venues, including, notably, the Board’s semiannual 

Monetary Policy Report, the Board’s annual report, and speeches, such as this one.
