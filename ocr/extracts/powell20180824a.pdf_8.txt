on imprecise--and, as it turns out, overly optimistic--real-time estimates of the natural 

rate of unemployment.6     

Figure 3 compares the CBO’s current view of the natural rate of unemployment in 

that era with an estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as 

policymakers perceived it in real time.  From 1965 to the early 1980s, this real-time 

estimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it.  The unemployment rate 

over this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary 

documents reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even 

further above u* (figure 4, top panel).7  With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, 

except for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to 

inflation’s rise (figure 4, lower panel).    

It is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise 

estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations.  The 

Great Inflation did, however, prompt an “expectations revolution” in macroeconomic 

thinking, with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers:  

Anchoring longer-term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other 

monetary policy goals.8 

When longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, unanticipated 

developments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return 

fairly promptly to the desired value.  This is the key insight at the heart of the widespread 

                                                 
6 See, for example, Burns (1979), Orphanides and Williams (2013), and the sources therein.  Romer and 

Romer (2002) and Sargent (2002) debate additional factors that may have played a role.  There is no 

dispute, however, that policymakers did misperceive the natural unemployment rate, and Orphanides and 

Williams show that misperception of the natural rate of unemployment alone would have been sufficient on 

its own to generate outcomes like the Great Inflation.
