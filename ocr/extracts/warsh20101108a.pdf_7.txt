The Conduct of Monetary Policy 

The Federal Reserve is not a repair shop for broken fiscal, trade, or regulatory policies.  

Given what ails us, additional monetary policy measures are, at best, poor substitutes for more 

powerful pro-growth policies.  The Fed can lose its hard-earned credibility--and monetary policy 

can lose its considerable sway--if its policies overpromise or underdeliver.  We should be leery 

of drawing inapt lessons from the crisis to the current policy conjuncture.  Lender-of-last-resort 

authority cannot readily be converted into fighter-of-first resort power. 

Monetary policy can surely have great influence--most notably by establishing stable 

prices and appropriate financial conditions--on the real economy.  By my way of thinking, the 

risk-reward ratio for Fed action peaks in times of crisis when it has a full toolbox and markets are 

functioning poorly.  But when non-traditional tools are needed to loosen policy and markets are 

functioning more or less normally--even with output and employment below trend--the risk-

reward ratio for policy action is decidedly less favorable.  In my view, these risks increase with 

the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  As a result, we cannot and should not be as 

aggressive as conventional policy rules--cultivated in more benign environments--might judge 

appropriate. 

Last week, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

engaged in this debate.  The FOMC announced its intent to expand the Fed’s balance sheet by 

purchasing an additional $75 billion of long-term Treasury securities per month through the 

second quarter of 2011.  The FOMC did not make an unconditional or open-ended commitment.   

And I consider the FOMC’s action as necessarily limited, circumscribed, and subject to regular 

review.  Policies should be altered if certain objectives are satisfied, purported benefits 

disappoint, or potential risks threaten to materialize.
