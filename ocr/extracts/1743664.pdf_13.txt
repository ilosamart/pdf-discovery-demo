monetary policy will have to be reactive to the international scene. 

If exchange rates become more stable or if improved and coordinated 

central bank intervention can achieve greater stability, then the 

monetary policy can obviously be less concerned with the inter­

national changes. But if exchange rates and the international 

balance of payments relationships of the United States are adverse 

in the coming months, there could be implications for monetary 

policies with possible action to offset some of these difficulties.

Well, I have reviewed with you the possibilities of the 

growth of the economy for 1976, and the items which seem to me to 

be hampering or potentially interfering with the recovery. But 

perhaps I have not been clear enough so here is my blueprint for 

a better U.S. economy in 1976. In my opinion, we need the following 

actions:

First, a tax reform measure to stimulate business 

investment.

Secondly, legislation just extending the tax re­

ductions of the past six to twelve months into the re­

maining part of 1976; any further reductions should be 

matched by spending cuts.

Third, a parsimonious budget and expenditure level 

for the Federal Government with a blueprint of reduced 

Government spending wherever possible and declining 

employment ceilings on the Federal establishment.
