develop if, for instance, only certain prudentially regulated firms must incorporate such a 

charge into their borrowing or lending activities.   

As we make more progress in reorienting the regulation of large financial firms 

toward more macroprudential objectives, we will need to watch carefully for such 

leakage of financial transactions.  This concern returns us to the larger project of 

macroprudential regulation, which implicates a more complicated set of issues around 

legal authorities and institutional capacities for prudential regulation of markets, as well 

as firms.  But it would be preferable to confront these issues now, before too much of this 

migration has occurred, than to wait until the problem manifests itself in growing 

systemic risk. 

Conclusion 

The five propositions I have laid out this afternoon are generally intended to 

outline the contours of a macroprudential approach to the regulation and supervision of 

large financial institutions, not to identify or elaborate specific policies.  But I will close 

by saying that specific policies to counteract the structural vulnerabilities created by 

short-term wholesale funding are a priority, not just for the stability of our large 

prudentially regulated institutions, but for the financial system as a whole.  A 

macroprudential reorientation of our bank regulatory policies will require a range of 

continuing work on resiliency, on other structural measures, and on the effective blending 

of macroprudential with traditional microprudential regulatory and supervisory policies.  

But, even as we make more progress in these areas, our efforts will not be complete 

without measures addressing what I have termed an accelerant of systemic problems.
