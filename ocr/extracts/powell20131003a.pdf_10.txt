capital rules that apply to community banks.  And the CFPB has shown an openness to input 

from the industry and from other regulators in crafting its regulations. 

In our role as a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has been refining our examination 

programs and recently launched an initiative to review our consumer compliance supervision 

program for community banks.  While Federal Reserve consumer compliance examiners have 

traditionally applied a risk-driven approach to supervision, we recognized the need to provide 

more specific guidance to our examiners.  Under the updated program, our consumer compliance 

examiners will base the examination intensity more explicitly on the individual bank’s risk 

profile, including its consumer compliance culture and how effectively it identifies and manages 

consumer compliance risk.  We plan to launch this new consumer compliance supervision 

program for community banks in 2014.  We will begin training for our examiners and outreach 

to our member community banks later this year. 

While this conference has presented much valuable research of direct relevance to 

community bankers, I’d like to recommend a few areas where further work could be of value.  

First, it would be interesting to explore the effects of risk-retention policies on community banks.  

To what extent do community banks currently retain a percentage of their loans, and how do 

small banks compare to money-center banks when it comes to utilizing the secondary markets 

for loans?  Would risk-retention policies be a non-issue for community banks, or would some 

banks be seriously constrained by such policies?  Even if such policies do not constrain 

community bank activities, would new reporting requirements related to such policies increase 

the reporting burden faced by small banks?
