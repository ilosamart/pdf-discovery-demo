I appreciate the opportunity to speak at a conference with the important theme of 

economic measurement.  In many spheres of human endeavor, from science to business 

to education to economic policy, good decisions depend on good measurement.  More 

subtly, what we decide to measure, or are able to measure, has important effects on the 

choices we make, since it is natural to focus on those objectives for which we can best 

estimate and document the effects of our decisions.  One great pioneer in this subject 

area, of course, is Simon Kuznets, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his work 

on economic measurement, including the national income accounts.  Over the years many 

economists have built on his work to further improve our ability to quantify aspects of 

economic activity and thus to improve economic policymaking and our understanding of 

how the economy works.  The remarkably broad and ambitious research program of this 

conference and the impressive expertise that has been assembled illustrate the continued 

vitality of this field.  Evolving technologies that allow economists to gather new types of 

data and to manipulate millions of data points are just one factor among several that are 

likely to transform the field in coming years. 

As we think about new directions for economic measurement, we might start by 

reminding ourselves of the purpose of economics.  Textbooks describe economics as the 

study of the allocation of scarce resources.  That definition may indeed be the “what,” but 

it certainly is not the “why.”  The ultimate purpose of economics, of course, is to 

understand and promote the enhancement of well-being.  Economic measurement 

accordingly must encompass measures of well-being and its determinants. 

In the tradition of national income accounting, economic policymakers have 

typically focused on variables such as income, wealth, and consumption.  The Federal
