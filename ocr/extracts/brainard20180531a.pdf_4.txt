environment with a strengthening dollar, rising energy prices, and the possibility of rising 

rates raises the risks of capital flow reversals in some emerging markets that have seen 

increased borrowing from abroad.  Although stresses have been contained to a few 

vulnerable countries so far, the risk of a broader pullback bears watching.  In addition, 

uncertainty over trade clouds the horizon.  An escalation in measures and 

countermeasures--although an outside risk--could prove disruptive at home and abroad. 

Sustaining Full Employment 

Here at home, the labor market is strong.  So far this year, payroll gains have 

averaged 200,000 per month, sufficient to put further downward pressure on 

unemployment.  Indeed, the unemployment rate moved down to 3.9 percent in April 

following six consecutive months at 4.1 percent.  The unemployment rate for African 

Americans dropped in April to 6.6 percent, which is the lowest level recorded since this 

series began in 1972 but still high relative to other groups.   

It is difficult to know how much slack remains.  Aprilâ€™s 3.9 percent 

unemployment rate was the lowest reading since December 2000.  If the unemployment 

rate falls another couple of tenths--which seems likely, based on recent trends--it will be 

at its lowest level since 1969.  Although the late 1960s marked the beginning of what is 

now called the Great Inflation, it is worth keeping in mind that there have been important 

shifts in the labor market since that time.  For example, educational attainment is much 

higher today than it was in the 1960s, and college degree holders tend to have much 

lower unemployment rates, on average, than those with a high school degree or less.4

compared with 15 percent in the late 1960s, and the share with less than a high school degree has fallen 
from around 40 percent to around 7 percent today.  The unemployment rates of college-educated adults are
