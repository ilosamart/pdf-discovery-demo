that U.S. monetary policy normalization has been and should continue to be gradual, as 

long as the U.S. economy evolves roughly as expected.   

Since the start of normalization in December 2015, the federal funds rate has risen 

to about 1-1/4 percent from its effective lower bound (slide 10).  The median projections 

of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants (the blue dots) have it rising to 

2.9 percent by the end of 2020, fairly close to what is regarded by the median participant 

as its long-run value and significantly below its average value in the years prior to the 

GFC.  As reflected in the FOMC’s recent communications, the shrinkage of the Fed’s 

balance sheet is also expected to proceed quite gradually, with slowly phased-in increases 

in caps on the monthly reductions in the Federal Reserve’s security holdings.   

The expectation of gradual policy normalization should reduce the likelihood of 

outsized movements in interest rates.  Indeed, even if we add, say, a 50 basis point term 

premium to the expected long-run federal funds rate, this value would still leave long-

term U.S. interest rates (shown in slide 11) well below their pre-GFC averages.  As long 

as global financial conditions normalize in an orderly fashion, EMEs should have 

sufficient time to adjust.  And, as we saw earlier, interest rate changes of this magnitude 

should not lead to generalized corporate distress in EMEs, although undoubtedly some 

corporates are more exposed and could experience difficulties.   

Market Response 

All that said, market movements can be noisy, which brings me to what I believe 

is the most uncertain element--the potentially volatile behavior of markets even in an 

environment of relatively contained EME vulnerabilities and of gradual and clearly 

communicated advanced-economy monetary policies.
