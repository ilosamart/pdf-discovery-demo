I am also a bit of a techno-enthusiast.  We are in the early stages of a more 

widespread application of a wave of new technologies, such as 5G communications, AI 

(artificial intelligence) and machine learning, and 3-D printing.  It might be that the 

productivity gains associated with these and other new technologies are embodied in new 

capital equipment and will only now start to become apparent as the investment drought 

of recent years comes to an end.  A tighter economy could also create incentives for firms 

to revamp their production methods to save on scarce labor resources. 

To summarize, the economy has been doing very well.  Whether this performance 

is sustained will be importantly determined by whether growth is supported by increases 

in the economy’s potential.  I am hopeful that potential growth, and particularly 

productivity, could accelerate from its relatively anemic pace of late, sustaining growth 

without overheating the economy.  The more the economy’s potential growth increases, 

the more gradual we can be in our removal of monetary policy accommodation.  Thus, an 

assessment of the pace of potential growth will be an important input into what I view as 

the appropriate path of policy to achieve our objectives of maximum sustainable 

employment and price stability.    

The Difficulty in Identifying Potential 

The tricky thing, as I pointed out earlier, is that potential output is unobserved and 

can only be inferred from the behavior of other measured economic indicators.  

Traditionally, as taught in Econ 101, inflation provides a signal on whether the economy 

is operating above or below its potential level.  If inflation moves up in a sustained 

manner, not just because of temporary shocks, then the economy is likely operating 

above its productive capacity, as firms have the leeway to raise prices given the strength
