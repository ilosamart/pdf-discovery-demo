Relevant capital regulation tools include a higher amount and quality of capital, 

such as is required under Basel III; leverage ratios, particularly the supplementary 

leverage ratio, if regulators increase it; the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer, which 

is designed to build resilience and lean against credit-fueled asset bubbles in a 

countercyclical manner; and capital surcharges.   

Supervisory stress testing and capital planning are related regulatory capital-

focused tools. They not only increase resilience, but, by including assumed asset bubbles 

in their scenarios, they can also focus attention on specific assets, causing banking firms 

to build capital against unexpected losses in those assets. By focusing management 

attention on the downside risk posed by certain assets, and by increasing the share of 

capital in the funding mix, they can also lean against bank lending that supports inflated 

asset values. 

 In addition, higher “sector-specific” risk weights and capital charges, applied to 

specific assets such as mortgages, potentially could be a more targeted way of addressing 

particular asset bubbles; however, these more targeted capital tools require an early 

understanding of the particular asset class that may be involved in a potential bubble. 

Whether financial regulators would be capable of spotting such specific asset bubbles 

early, and then of acting in a timely enough way to address such bubbles is, in my view, 

unlikely. 


Liquidity Regulation  

A second class of policies that addresses asset bubbles and their consequences is liquidity 

regulation. An example is the new Basel III liquidity coverage ratio. As I discussed
