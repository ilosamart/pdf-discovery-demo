FDIC or a bankruptcy judge for conversion into equity should the firm fail.  Note that this 

requirement is intended to prepare for the possibility that the firm fails despite all the measures 

we have taken to strengthen resiliency.  Having identifiable instruments for conversion that 

would survive the loss of most or all of the firm’s equity is necessary for a private 

recapitalization of the firm to be successful.   

A second step is to determine if we can develop metrics that would reflect a firm’s 

particular vulnerabilities to funding shocks, liquidity shocks, and fire sale dynamics in their 

needed capital as part of the annual stress test.17  These measures would directly take into 

account macroprudential concerns of financial system stability.  They might well counsel 

increased capital requirements for some of the largest banks. 

A third step is to take another look at the capital and liquidity positions of large U.S. 

branches of some foreign banks.  As has become apparent, the actual consolidated capital 

positions of some such banks can be difficult for us to discern when the bank uses internal 

models to compute its required regulatory capital.  It is critical to ensure that large U.S. branches 

of foreign banks do not create financial instability in the United States if their parents’ global 

positions come under stress. 

Although I have been focusing mostly on the risks to financial stability posed by the 

largest financial firms, I would not want to leave a discussion of future work without offering 

another reminder that they are not the only source of vulnerabilities.  The kinds of “shadow 

banking” that grew up around the private-label mortgage backed securities markets have largely 

disappeared, but other forms of runnable liabilities remain outside prudentially regulated 

institutions.  There is also good reason to believe that new forms of shadow banking will develop
