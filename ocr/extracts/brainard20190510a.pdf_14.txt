keep prices high.27  Often put in place in areas with single-family homes to block the 

development of affordable, multifamily housing, these policies also have contributed to 

the persistence of racially segregated neighborhoods.  The challenge is to increase 

accessibility to workforce and affordable housing in ways that address legacy 

disparities.28   

Skills, education, and student debt 

Manufacturing and the skilled trades have provided an important pathway to the 

middle class for many workers, enabling them to own their homes, educate their children, 

and retire securely.  Today, though, many face uncertainties associated with the decline in 

manufacturing jobs, the erosion of employee benefits, and reduced bargaining power.  

Increasingly, the onus is on individuals to ensure that their skills are marketable and up-

to-date in a highly competitive global marketplace with growing automation.  

Juan Salgado, the chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago and our closing 

keynote speaker, has emphasized the role of community colleges in offering affordable, 

quality education and training.29  Students can begin with a certificate program in 

advanced manufacturing and continue either to a bachelor’s degree in engineering at a 

nearby public university or to the workplace, acquiring marketable skills likely at lower 

cost than if they had started at a four-year college.  Similar programs around the country 

help provide accessible pathways to the middle class.

around 15 percent of cities in 2013 and doubled housing costs in about 6 percent of cities.  See Edward
