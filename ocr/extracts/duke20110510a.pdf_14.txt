in the private sector should focus on innovative ideas that can address the changing 

conditions of our communities.  As the nature of problems change, we all need to be 

flexible and modify our responses. 

Remember Professor Hargadon and his theory about innovation?  Well, he also 

stated that “social network theory divides the world into nodes and ties. You are a node 

with ties to other people you know.  The people you know have ties to each other…. If 

you can talk to a wide range of people, you are broadening your entire world, the more 

people you know, the more likely you are to be successful and happy.  This has been 

proven.… The more you share and talk to new people about your ideas, the more likely 

you are to be innovative.”14  I would like to take this final moment to encourage you to 

please make the most of your opportunities to share with your colleagues here this week, 

and to continue to push the envelope on innovation.  And I hope the Federal Reserve 

System continues to be a node of innovation with ties to each of you. 

Thank you.
