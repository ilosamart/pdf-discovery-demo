that longer-term inflation expectations in the United States appear to have remained 

generally stable since the late 1990s (chart 6).  The source of that stability is open to 

debate, but the fact that the Fed has kept inflation relatively low and stable for three 

decades must be an important part of the explanation.  Expectations that are not stable, 

but instead follow actual inflation up or down, would allow inflation to drift persistently.  

In the recent period, movements in inflation have tended to be transitory.  For example, 

one might have expected the Great Recession to generate a downward wage-price spiral, 

but this did not occur.  Thus, the stability of inflation expectations has prevented inflation 

from falling further below our objective than occurred, and it has enabled the Federal 

Open Market Committee to look through some upward inflation shocks without 

compromising price stability.5   

We should however be cautious in our assessment that inflation expectations are 

remaining stable.  One reason is that measures of inflation compensation in the market 

for Treasury securities have moved down somewhat since last summer (chart 7).  But 

these movements can be hard to interpret, as at times they may reflect factors other than 

inflation expectations, such as changes in demand for the unparalleled liquidity of 

nominal Treasury securities. 

In announcing its July interest rate decision, the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) said: 

In determining how long to maintain this target range, the 

Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--

toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 

inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of 

                                                 
5 It is noteworthy that in several inflation-targeting economies, the ten year expected inflation rate has 

settled precisely at the target inflation rate.
