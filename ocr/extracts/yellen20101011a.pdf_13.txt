For that reason, we need a flexible approach that combines science and art, and 

judgmentally weighs information from all indicators.

attention in policy circles, and among investors and the public, on looming systemic 

risks.  The detailed financial stability reports published by the International Monetary 

Fund and a number of central banks are intended to serve this purpose.9  And the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council created under the Dodd-Frank Act is charged with 

preparing such a report once a year.  

Admittedly, most such reports failed to identify the mechanisms behind the recent 

crisis.  And even when vulnerabilities were identified and warning bells sounded, they 

were often greeted with yawns, as anyone who remembers the phrase “irrational 

exuberance” can testify.  Those who sounded the alarms were seen as killjoys who 

refused to join the party.  Words are important, but clearly they are not enough.  We need 

strong policies to back them up.  We need macroprudential policymakers ready to take
