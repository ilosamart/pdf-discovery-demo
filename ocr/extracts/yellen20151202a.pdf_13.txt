Empirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low 

comes from both academic research and Federal Reserve staff analysis.  Figure 1 

employs four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the 

“natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9  The measures 

of the natural rate shown in this figure represent the real short-term interest rate that 

would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to 

changes in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown 

to promote full employment.10  The shaded blue band represents the range of the 

estimates of the natural real rate at each point in time.  This analysis suggests that the 

natural real rate fell sharply with the onset of the crisis and has recovered only partially.  

These findings are broadly consistent with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach 

and John Williams, shown in figure 2.11   

                                                   
9 Note that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one 
would add a measure of expected inflation.  The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and described in Kiley 
(2013); (2) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described 
in Del Negro and others (2013); (3) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board 
based on Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the 
Federal Reserve Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2013 [rev. 2014]). 
10 The concept of the natural rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to 
raise nor to lower” (1936 [1898], p. 102) commodity prices.  Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be 
equal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions.  The recent 
academic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as the real interest rate that would prevail 
in the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages.  In simple models, this interest rate 
would result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has 
been found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers 
face important tradeoffs in such settings.  Importantly, the natural rate varies over time.  For example, it 
generally rises with expected productivity growth and with “preference shocks” that capture households’ 
desire to consume today rather than save.  For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural 
rate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others 
(2015).  By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural 
rate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate 
supply and demand have abated.  These two approaches to the measurement of the natural real rate are 
different but have important similarities.  Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move 
together in response to shocks to productivity growth and preferences so long as those shocks were very 
persistent.
