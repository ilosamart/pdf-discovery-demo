More generally, the Federal Reserve has invested substantial resources in developing 

technological tools for examiners to improve the efficiency of both off-site and on-site 

supervisory activities.  These tools should lead to greater consistency and more efficient, 

effective, and risk-focused examinations as they assist staff in tailoring the scope of 

examinations to the activities and risks at individual banks.  The automation of various parts of 

the community bank examination process can also save examiners and bank management time, 

as a bank can submit requested pre-examination information electronically rather than mailing 

paper copies to a Federal Reserve Bank.   

These observations relate to another issue that I might note in passing.  As you know, 

there have been questions raised as to whether the level of required reporting is itself a regulatory 

burden that might be mitigated for small banks.  The banking agencies are considering these 

issues under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.  I do think 

there may be some opportunities to streamline the content or frequency of reporting for smaller 

banks.  However, I would observe that many of the efficiency improvements that I have 

previously described were dependent on the data collected each quarter in Call Reports.  For 

example, the availability of this data was a factor in raising the threshold for eligibility for the 

18-month examination cycle from $250 million to $500 million.  Similarly, the regular Call 

Report data for subsidiary banks buttress the case for increasing the threshold for application of 

the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.  Thus, there may be some tradeoffs among 

various possible simplifying supervisory measures. 

Conclusion 

As I noted in my speech six months ago, the old unitary approach to prudential oversight 

has in practical terms been supplanted by various statutory, regulatory, and supervisory
