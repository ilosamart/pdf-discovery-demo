Reserve Board staff calculations, of the cumulative reduction of the term premium on 10-year 

Treasury securities from the three balance sheet programs.  These results suggest that our 

portfolio actions are currently keeping 10-year Treasury yields roughly 60 basis points lower 

than they otherwise would be.11  Other evidence suggests that this downward pressure has had 

favorable spillover effects on other financial markets, leading to lower long-term borrowing 

costs for households and firms, higher equity valuations, and other improvements in financial 

conditions that in turn have supported consumption, investment, and net exports.  Because the 

term premium effect depends on both the Federal Reserve’s current and expected future asset 

holdings, most of this effect--without further actions--will likely wane over the next few years as

11 The estimates shown in figure 9 employ the methodology discussed by Li and Wei, “Term Structure Modeling 
with Supply Factors,” in note 10.  These calculations require an assumption for market participants’ expectations for 
the future path of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio at different points in time, both in the past and going forward; 
accordingly, the estimates are somewhat sensitive to alternative assumptions for market expectations.  In estimating 
the current and future effect of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings on term premiums, market participants are 
assumed to have expectations consistent with the illustrative baseline discussed in note 16 and the exit principles 
outlined by the FOMC in June 2011 (see note 18).  In particular, investors are assumed to expect that the overall size 
and composition of the portfolio will remain roughly constant from the end of 2012:Q2 through late 2014 because 
principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s security holdings will be reinvested until a few months prior to the 
liftoff of the federal funds rate assumed in the illustrative baseline.  At that point, the portfolio is assumed to begin to 
contract through redemptions and, after the assumed liftoff of the federal funds rate, through sales of mortgage-
backed securities that bring the Federal Reserve’s holdings of such securities to zero over a three-to-five-year 
period.  As a result, the size of the portfolio returns to normal within a few years after liftoff.
