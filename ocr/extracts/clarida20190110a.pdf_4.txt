still have some further room to rise, as the prime-age participation rate is still a couple of 

percentage points below the levels that prevailed in the late 1990s, when the labor market 

was last this strong.    

Price stability, of course, is the other leg of our dual mandate, and PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) inflation over the past 12 months has been running close to 

our 2 percent objective.  That said, and notwithstanding strong economic growth and a 

low unemployment rate, inflation has surprised to the downside recently, and it is not yet 

clear that inflation has moved back to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.   

Because expectations of future inflation are such an important determinant of 

actual inflation, central banks are as much in the business of anchoring inflation 

expectations as they are of managing actual inflation.  Longer-run inflation expectations, 

based on straight readings of inflation compensation from TIPS (Treasury Inflation-

Protected Securities), have drifted downward, although, when adjusted for term 

premiums and liquidity, they remain near 2 percent.  The University of Michigan Surveys 

of Consumersâ€™ measure of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years has been broadly 

stable but has edged down over the past few years and is now at the very lower end of the 

range that has prevailed historically.  Inflation expectations of professional forecasters 

have remained stable and consistent with our 2 percent objective. 

At each future FOMC meeting, as I consider what, if any, adjustment to our 

policy stance is warranted to achieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives, I will 

closely monitor the incoming data on inflation expectations as well as actual inflation, 

among the broad range of real and financial indicators that I consult.  To me, it is
