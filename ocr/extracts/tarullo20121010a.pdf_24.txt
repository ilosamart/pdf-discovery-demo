Clayton Act Section 7 creates an anomalous regulatory feature.  It means that the current 

structure for financial stability regulation permits substantial increases in systemic risk by an 

institution, so long as it is generated from internal growth.  To the extent that a growing systemic 

footprint increases perceptions of at least some residual too-big-to-fail quality in such a firm, 

notwithstanding the panoply of measures in Dodd-Frank and our regulations, there may be 

funding advantages for the firm, which reinforces the impulse to grow.  There is, then, a case to 

be made for specifying an upper bound. 

In these circumstances, however, with the potentially important consequences of such an 

upper bound and of the need to balance different interests and social goals, it would be most 

appropriate for Congress to legislate on the subject.  If it chooses to do so, there would be merit 

in its adopting a simpler policy instrument, rather than relying on indirect, incomplete policy 

measures such as administrative calculation of potentially complex financial stability footprints.  

The idea along these lines that seems to have the most promise would limit the non-deposit 

liabilities of financial firms to a specified percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, as 

calculated on a lagged, averaged basis.  In addition to the virtue of simplicity, this approach has 

the advantage of tying the limitation on growth of financial firms to the growth of the national 

economy and its capacity to absorb losses, as well as to the extent of a firm’s dependence on 

funding from sources other than the stable base of deposits.  While Section 622 of Dodd-Frank 

contains a financial sector concentration limit, it is based on a somewhat awkward and 

potentially shifting metric of the aggregated consolidated liabilities of all “financial companies.” 

Of course, the difficult question would be the applicable percentage of GDP.  The answer 

would depend on a judgment as to how much of an impact the economy could absorb.  It would 

also entail a judgment as to how large and complex a firm needs to be in order to achieve
