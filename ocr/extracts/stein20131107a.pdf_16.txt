government or agency securities.  In this sense, there is a close relationship between the 

FSB minimum-haircut proposal and the specific variant of the capital-surcharge idea that 

I mentioned a moment ago.  Both have the potential to act as a restraint on those SFTs 

that are intermediated by regulated broker-dealer firms, but both are vulnerable to an 

evolution of the business away from this intermediated mode.  The minimum margin 

levels in the FSB proposal are also quite small, so it is unclear how much of an effect, if 

any, they will have on market behavior.  For example, the minimums for long-term 

corporate bonds, securitized products, and equities are 2 percent, 4 percent, and 4 percent, 

respectively. 

Conclusions 

 Let me wrap up.  My aim here has been to survey the landscape—to give a sense 

of the possible tools that can be used to address the fire-sales problem in SFTs—without 

making any particularly pointed recommendations.  I would guess that a sensible path 

forward might involve drawing on some mix of the latter set of instruments that I 

discussed: namely, capital surcharges, modifications to the liquidity regulation 

framework, and universal margin requirements.  As we go down this path, conceptual 

purity may have to be sacrificed in some places to deliver pragmatic and institutionally 

feasible results.  It is unlikely that we will find singular and completely satisfactory fixes. 

 With this observation in mind, I would be remiss if I did not remind you of 

another, highly complementary area where reform is necessary: the money market fund 

sector.  Money funds are among the most significant repo lenders to broker-dealer firms, 

and an important source of fire-sale risk comes from the fragility of the current money 

fund model.  This fragility stems in part from their capital structures—the fact that they
