time to develop and justify a more activist monetary policy.  The degree to which the 

gold standard actually constrained U.S. monetary policy during the early 1930s is 

debated; but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly 

expansionary policies that were needed.

  The same can be said for the real bills 

doctrine, which apparently led policymakers to conclude, on the basis of low nominal 

interest rates and low borrowings from the Fed, that monetary policy was appropriately 

supportive and that further actions would be fruitless.

  Historians have also noted the 

prevalence at the time of yet another counterproductive doctrine:  the so-called 

liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function.

  It may be 

that the Federal Reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the 

lack of an intellectual framework for understanding what was happening and what needed 

to be done. 

The Fed’s inadequate policy frameworks ultimately collapsed under the weight of 

economic failures, new ideas, and political developments.  The international gold 

standard was abandoned during the 1930s.  The real bills doctrine likewise lost prestige 

after the disaster of the 1930s; for example, the Banking Act of 1935 instructed the 

Federal Reserve to use open market operations with consideration of “the general credit 

situation of the country,” not just to focus narrowly on short-term liquidity needs.

  The 

Congress also expanded the Fed’s ability to provide credit through the discount window,

 Wicker (1965), Temin (1989), and Eichengreen (1992) suggest that U.S. policymakers felt constrained 

by the gold standard.  In contrast, Hsieh and Romer (2006), as well as Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz 

(2002), focus on the short-lived monetary expansion in 1932 as evidence against the existence of important 

constraints on the Federal Reserve.
