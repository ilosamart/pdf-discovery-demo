are associated with post-crisis financial reforms, as well as money market reform and the 

greater transparency in the derivatives markets. 

To conclude, much depends on the evolution of inflation.  If, as many forecasters 

assume, the current shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective indeed proves 

transitory, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate would be warranted, perhaps 

along the lines of the median projection from the most recent SEP.  But, as I noted 

earlier, I am concerned that the recent low readings for inflation may be driven by 

depressed underlying inflation, which would imply a more persistent shortfall in inflation 

from our objective.  In that case, it would be prudent to raise the federal funds rate more 

gradually.  We should have substantially more data in hand in the coming months that 

will help us make that assessment.
