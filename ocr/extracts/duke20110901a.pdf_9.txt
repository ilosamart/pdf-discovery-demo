uncertainty are renting properties instead.  Rental demand has also been supported by 

families who have lost their homes to foreclosure.  The majority of these families move 

to rental housing, most commonly to single-family rentals.3  Unfortunately, these 

conditions supporting rental demand may persist for some time. 

The weak demand in the owner-occupied housing market and the relatively high 

demand in the rental housing market suggest that transitioning some REO properties to 

rental housing might benefit both markets.  Such conversions might also be in the best 

interests of lienholders and guarantors if recoveries from renting out properties exceed 

those from outright sales.  Over time, as financing conditions ease and the number of 

REO properties to be sold declines, the share of properties sold to owner-occupants and 

sold to investors for rental will adjust commensurately. 

Small investors are already converting some foreclosed properties to rental units 

on a limited scale.  Larger-scale conversion, however, has been hindered by at least two 

factors.  First, managing single-family rental homes is expensive unless the properties are 

concentrated within a geographic area and investors can be certain of acquiring a critical 

mass of properties.  Second, regulatory guidance and standard servicing practices have 

typically encouraged GSEs, FHA, servicers, and financial institutions to actively market 

REO properties for sale and to consider rentals only as a short-term income generator 

while the properties are being marketed.  

In August, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), working with the 

Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, issued a 

request for information seeking ideas for the disposition of REO owned by Fannie Mae,
