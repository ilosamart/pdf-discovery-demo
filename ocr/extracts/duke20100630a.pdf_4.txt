Credit costs have been so high in this cycle that it is easy to lose track of the other 

components of bank earnings.  But it is actually ongoing earnings strength that gives banks the 

resiliency to withstand credit cycles and build capital to support additional lending.   To separate 

the impact of credit costs from underlying earnings strength, it is helpful to look at pre-tax, pre-

provision net income--that is, earnings before provisions for loan losses.   In the first quarter of 

this year pre-provision net income returned to about pre-crisis levels for the largest 25 banks.  

The largest banks benefitted in particular from a rebound in trading revenues and improved 

interest margins.  In contrast, for smaller banks, net interest margins and non-interest income 

remained weaker than they were prior to the crisis, leaving pre-provision net income at smaller 

banks somewhat lower than it was in 2007.    

On the positive side, capital ratios at many banks have improved substantially since the 

start of the crisis.  And strong deposit growth has contributed to steady improvement in bank 

liquidity.  Still, the number of institutions and the total assets represented on the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation’s problem bank list continues to climb as some institutions face serious 

questions about capital adequacy due to weak loan quality, subpar earnings, and uncertainty 

about future conditions.   

Against this backdrop, lending has fallen significantly.  During 2009, total loans held by 

commercial banks fell by more than $345 billion, or 5 percent.  Excluding the effects of an 

accounting change that resulted in the addition of a significant volume of loans to bank balance 

sheets as of March 31, loans would have declined for the sixth consecutive quarter in the 

January–March period.  On the same basis, loans continued to contract in April and May at an 

estimated rate of about 7-3/4 percent.
