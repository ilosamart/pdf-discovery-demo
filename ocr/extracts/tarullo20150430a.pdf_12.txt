which a small bank is engaged in proprietary trading that could pose a risk to the deposit 

insurance fund or has in place a compensation system that incentivizes excessive risk, the 

supervisory process would remain available to address these risks.  I recognize that statutory 

revisions of this sort would not be a major reduction in compliance burden.  But they would 

reflect the fact that, absent a change in this regard, community banks must expend scarce 

compliance resources to conform to the requirements of such regulations.  There is, in my view, 

no need to make particularized prudential requirements of this sort applicable on a mandatory 

basis to thousands of community banks.  Indeed, the Volcker rule and the Dodd-Frank Act 

incentive compensation provisions present almost prototypical cases in which minimal potential 

safety and soundness benefits are outweighed by the compliance costs faced by those thousands 

of banks.  It would be preferable to relieve both supervisors and community banks from 

examining compliance with these kinds of requirements in order to concentrate resources on the 

real issues presently faced by these institutions, such as cybersecurity and interest rate risks. 

Third, I want to address concerns that community bankers have expressed regarding the 

revised standardized capital requirements issued in 2013.  In particular, we have heard that the 

framework’s separate risk weight for high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) loans is 

burdensome in part because it requires firms to classify which loans within their corporate loan 

portfolios are HVCRE using a complex definition that includes calculation of each such 

exposure’s loan-to-value ratio.  I should first say that, unlike proprietary trading or distorted 

compensation packages, HVCRE lending has posed real and substantial risks for community 

banks in recent years.  These kinds of loans performed much worse in the recession than other 

commercial real estate loans and, in fact, were a significant factor behind many of the roughly 

500 bank failures during this period.
