Sometimes, this statement is relatively simple: for example, many provisions of the Dodd–Frank 

Act by statute apply only to the largest banks. 

 In cases where the rules apply to all banks, but expectations vary by bank size or the degree 

to which banks engage in specific activities, it may be more helpful to make distinctions 

throughout the regulation or guidance.  For example, when we proposed interagency guidance 

covering incentive compensation, we tried to note under each provision the simplified 

expectations for community banks that did not make extensive use of incentive compensation.   

 Also helpful in clarifying supervisory expectations is the use of examples.  Interagency 

guidance issued in 2009 covering workouts of commercial real estate (CRE) loans contained 

several examples of loan restructurings and how they should be classified.2  I think the examples 

helped bankers and examiners alike understand policymakers’ expectations for the regulatory 

treatment of loan workouts.  Still, even with the examples, we heard reports that the guidance 

was not being implemented consistently in the field.  To further ensure consistency, we 

conducted extensive examiner training.  After the training was completed, we conducted a 

review of hundreds of loan files from recent examinations.  Our file review indicated that, with 

very few exceptions, the loans were classified according to the guidance. 

 I believe bankers come to fully understand supervisory expectations over time, as their 

experience grows.  But when something radically changes the supervisory landscape such as new 

regulations, drastic changes in the economic environment, or reassignment of regulatory 

authority, more direct outreach might be needed.
