before the crisis, the balance sheet will have grown as a share of GDP by about 

10.6 percentage points.  Bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth, or 

about 5.6 percent of GDP.  The crisis revealed that banks, especially the largest and most 

complex, faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought.  Because of 

both new liquidity regulations and improved management, banks now hold much higher 

levels of high-quality liquid assets than before the crisis.  Many banks choose to hold 

reserves as an important part of their strong liquidity positions.  

The rest of the increase in liabilities is accounted for by three other categories.  

First, public currency holdings will have grown by 2.4 percentage points as a share of 

GDP.  Second, the U.S. Treasury maintains an account at the Fed, which has been 

running 1.4 percentage points higher as a share of GDP.  And, third, other liabilities, 

which are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international 

financial system, will have grown by 1.1 percentage points.     

As was the case before the crisis, the FOMC’s chosen operating regime for 

controlling short-term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate 

quantity of reserves.  In January, the Committee stated its intention to continue in our 

current regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some 

successor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the 

overnight reverse repo facility.3  In this system, active management of the supply of 

reserves is not required.  Thus, the supply of reserves must be “ample,” in the sense of 

being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors 

                                                 
3 As noted in the minutes of the November 2018 FOMC meeting (see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20181108.htm), participants discussed costs 
and benefits of various alternatives to the federal funds rate, such as the overnight bank funding rate, and 
recommended further study of the issue.
