financial crisis, and has been declining since then in response to the significant steps 

made in the regulatory reform agenda.    

Do large banks, with lower costs of financing, take bigger risks?  The empirical 

relationship between bank size and their risk-taking has been examined by Laeven, 

Ratnovski, and Tong, who find that “large banks tend to have lower capital ratios, less 

stable funding, more market-based activities, and (to) be more organizationally complex 

than small banks.”27  From this they conclude that “[l]arge banks are riskier, and create 

more systemic risk, when they have lower capital and less-stable funding.  [They] create 

more systemic risk (but are not individually riskier) when they engage more in market-

based activities or are more organizationally complex.”28   

The key to these results is the recognition that banks have several sources of 

financing, and that the more they rely on market interest rate-sensitive short-term 

funding, the less stable they are likely to be.  Organizational complexity is certainly an 

issue: Maintaining managerial control, especially risk control, in a multi-activity bank, 

where individual rewards may be massive, is extremely difficult--think for instance of 

Baring’s in the late 1990s, or Societe Generale, or the so-called London Whale at 

JPMorgan Chase.  Strong risk management is essential but faces the hurdle of the 

structural incentives for risk-taking implied by limited liability for individuals and by

28 Large banks also hold less capital than small banks because they are more diversified--for example, small 
U.S. banks have larger geographical concentrations and larger single-name concentrations than larger 
banks.
