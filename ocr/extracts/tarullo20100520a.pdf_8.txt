only a limited, though important, role to play by helping to prevent liquidity pressures from 

intensifying and leading to a more widespread freezing up of financial markets, including in the 

United States.  To counter growing strains in dollar funding markets in Europe, last week the 

Federal Reserve re-established dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of foreign central banks 

following the receipt of information on the large support package developed by European leaders.2

The liquidity lines, which were authorized by a unanimous vote of the Federal Open 

Market Committee, are structured similarly to those that were put in place during the financial 

crisis.  As you know, central bank swap transactions have a long and well-established history, and 

their use by the Federal Reserve and other central banks goes back to the Bretton Woods era of 

fixed exchange rates.  In their current vintage, they are used by foreign central banks to relieve or 

forestall temporary liquidity pressures in their local dollar funding markets.  Foreign central banks 

draw on these lines by selling foreign currency to the Federal Reserve in exchange for dollars.  

The foreign central banks then lend these dollars to financial institutions in their jurisdictions.  At 

maturity, the foreign central bank returns the dollars back to the Federal Reserve in exchange for 

its own currency at the same exchange rate that prevailed at the time of the initial draw, and pays 

interest as well.   


The loans provided by the foreign central banks to institutions abroad are offered at rates 

that would be above market rates in normal times.  As such, when market conditions are not 

greatly strained, demand for dollar liquidity through the swap lines should not be high, as market 

alternatives would be more attractive.  Likely for that reason, the dollar liquidity offerings by

National Bank), Japan (the Bank of Japan), and Canada (the Bank of Canada).  The agreements establishing these 
facilities can be seen at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “Central Bank Liquidity Swaps,” webpage,
