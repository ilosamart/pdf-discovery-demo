particular factor.  Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation 

term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding 

period rather than its actual value.  As a result, the decompositions incorporate the effects 

of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the 

explanatory variables. 

ECI Growth Equation 

The estimated equation for the employment cost index (ECI) is: 

𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤 = −0.72 + .58𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒 + .10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑤𝑤 + .12𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2𝑤𝑤 + .10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−3𝑤𝑤 + .11𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−4𝑤𝑤 − .19𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 −

.57∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + .58𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡, 

where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤 is the annualized log difference of the ECI for hourly compensation of private 

industry workers, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 have the same definition as the corresponding variables 

from the PCE price inflation model, ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 denotes the first difference of 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡, 

𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡  is a moving average of an estimate of trend productivity growth for the 

business sector, and 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 is an error term.33  The coefficients are obtained from a restricted 

least squares regression using quarterly data from 1988:Q1 to 2017:Q2.34  Trend 

productivity growth is estimated as the low-frequency component of the annualized log 

difference of business-sector output per hour from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 

Productivity and Costs report.35  The moving average of trend productivity growth 

                                                 
33 The ECI series used here is obtained from a ratio splice of the SIC- and NAICS-based indexes; the SIC-
based index is used before 2001 and the NAICS-based index used thereafter.  (All data used in the model 
were current as of September 1, 2017.)   
34 The estimation procedure imposes the joint restriction that the sum of the coefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒  and the 
lagged ECI growth terms are equal to 1, and that the coefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒  and 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 are equal.  This 
joint restriction receives a p value of 0.57.  
35 The low-pass component is obtained from a band-pass filter.  The filter width and cutoffs are set equal to 
the values used in Douglas Staiger, James Stock, and Mark Watson (2001), “Prices, Wages, and the U.S. 
NAIRU in the 1990s,” in Alan Krueger and Robert Solow, eds., The Roaring Nineties:  Can Full 
Employment Be Sustained? (New York:  Russell Sage Foundation and Century Foundation Press), pp. 3-60.
