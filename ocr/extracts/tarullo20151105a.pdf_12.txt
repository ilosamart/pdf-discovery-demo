host country choices will also inevitably be affected by how home countries are carrying out 

their regulatory and supervisory roles.  This consideration includes, of course, not just 

regulations that are nominally applicable, but the manner in which those regulations are 

enforced.   

Branching presents a particularly instructive example of the tension between assuring 

financial stability and permitting foreign banking operations that may carry economic benefits.  

Because branches are not separately chartered and capitalized, a bank can relatively easily enter 

a foreign market by opening a branch, through which it can make loans--often initially to 

companies from its home country--using funds from the home bank.  Particularly where (as in 

the United States) foreign branches are forbidden by local law from accepting retail deposits, it 

might seem that there are minimal risks to the host country if the parent bank (and thus the local 

branch) fails.  However, U.S. experience with foreign branches in the decade prior to the crisis 

shows the very real risks that can arise when a branch is used to raise funds in the host country 

(in the United States, in dollars) through short-term wholesale borrowing, and then directs those 

funds out of the host country for loans or asset purchases by other parts of the bank.  As noted 

earlier, when short-term funding dried up, many foreign branches were left seriously short of 

liquidity and had to turn to the discount window. 

A shared feature of the U.S. and European Union regulatory systems for foreign banks is 

that branching is permitted without requiring separate capitalization.  Many other jurisdictions 

have similar policies.  Thus opportunities for foreign bank entry and market access are provided.  

In the United States, larger branches do have to meet some liquidity requirements, though they 

are less restrictive than the standards applicable to domestic banks and intermediate holding 

companies.  This requirement is an important example of a prudential measure that balances
