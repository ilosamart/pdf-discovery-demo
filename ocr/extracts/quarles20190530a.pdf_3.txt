sector.  These financial vulnerabilities have amplified adverse shocks to the overall 

economy time and again.  Such concerns have resurfaced among some observers, as the 

current long expansion has brought business borrowing to new heights.  My own 

assessment is that even though business debt is elevated, at least by some measures, 

overall financial stability risks are not, as the financial sector has substantial loss-

absorbing capacity and is not overly reliant on unstable short-term funding.  Yet, even if 

the risk of financial system disruption does not seem high, it well remain true that if the 

economy weakens, some businesses may default on this debt, potentially leading to a 

contraction in investment, a slow-down in hiring, and possibly to an unusual tightening in 

financial conditions.  These concerns highlight how cyclical factors influencing monetary 

policy borrowers may overlap with financial stability considerations.   

How Monetary Policy Can Influence Financial Stability    

Let me begin by laying out how monetary policy can influence financial stability.  

Monetary policy, operating primarily through adjustments in the level of short-term 

interest rates, has powerful effects on the entire financial system.  A more 

accommodative monetary policy lowers interest rates across the maturity spectrum.  The 

textbook result is that mortgage rates and corporate borrowing rates, among others, 

decline; equity prices rise; and the dollar exchange rate depreciates.  In other words, 

financial conditions broadly ease, spurring households to buy more and businesses to 

invest and hire, thereby supporting economic growth and price stability.2   

Monetary policy, however, if too accommodative, may lead to a buildup of 

financial vulnerabilities.  These incentives arrive through a number of channels.  For
