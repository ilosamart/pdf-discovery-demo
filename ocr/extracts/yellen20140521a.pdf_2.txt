Thank you, President Sexton.  On behalf of the honorees, let me express my 

thanks to NYU.  And congratulations from all of us to you, the Class of 2014, and to your 

families, especially your parents.  This is a special day to celebrate your achievements 

and to look forward to your lives ahead.  

Your NYU education has not only provided you with a foundation of knowledge; 

it has also, I hope, instilled in you a love of knowledge and an enduring curiosity.  Life 

will continue to be a journey of discovery if you tend the fires of curiosity that burn 

brightly in all of us. 

Such curiosity led Eric Kandel, here at NYU, to his lifetime goal, to discover the 

chemical and cellular basis of human memory.  A few years after his graduation, he was 

doing research on cats.  But he had the idea of focusing on an animal with a simpler, 

more fundamental brain: the California sea slug.  His colleagues all but ridiculed him for 

the idea.  They “knew” that the study of the lowly sea slug was irrelevant for 

understanding human memory.  Kandel’s surgically-skilled collaborator deserted him.   

To get up to speed on sea slugs, he had to go abroad to study.  But Kandel persisted and, 

in 2000, his curiosity won him the Nobel Prize.  It was, as you must have guessed, for 

deciphering the chemistry of memory in humans, as revealed by his research on sea slugs.  

Kandel’s life, I believe, demonstrates how a persistent curiosity can help us reach 

ambitious goals, even with great roadblocks in the way.    

A second tool for lifelong intellectual growth is a willingness to listen carefully to 

others. These days, technology allows us access to a great breadth of perspectives, but it 

also allows us to limit what voices we hear to the narrow range we find most agreeable.  

Listening to others, especially those with whom we disagree, tests our own ideas and
