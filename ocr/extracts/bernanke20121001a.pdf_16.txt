GAO is the investigative arm of the Congress and GAO reviews may be initiated at the 

request of members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of 

individual policy decisions could be seen, with good reason, as efforts to bring political 

pressure to bear on monetary policymakers.  A perceived politicization of monetary 

policy would reduce public confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to make its 

policy decisions based strictly on what is good for the economy in the longer term.  

Balancing the need for accountability against the goal of insulating monetary policy from 

short-term political pressure is very important, and I believe that the Congress had it right 

in the 1970s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from the 

possibility of politically motivated reviews. 

Conclusion 
 

In conclusion, I will simply note that these past few years have been a difficult 

time for the nation and the economy.  For its part, the Federal Reserve has also been 

tested by unprecedented challenges.  As we approach next year’s 100th anniversary of the 

signing of the Federal Reserve Act, however, I have great confidence in the institution.  

In particular, I would like to recognize the skill, professionalism, and dedication of the 

employees of the Federal Reserve System.  They work tirelessly to serve the public 

interest and to promote prosperity for people and businesses across America.  The Fed’s 

policy choices can always be debated, but the quality and commitment of the Federal 

Reserve as a public institution is second to none, and I am proud to lead it. 

 Now that I’ve answered questions that I’ve posed to myself, I’d be happy to 

respond to yours.
