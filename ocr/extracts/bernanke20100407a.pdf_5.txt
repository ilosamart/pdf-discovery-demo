of failure, nearly collapsing before being purchased, with government assistance, by 

JPMorgan Chase.  In August, the two largest players in the housing market, the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were taken into 

conservatorship.  In September, the sharply intensifying panic hit the investment bank 

Lehman Brothers, and soon after, AIG.  Much as in a traditional run on a bank, the 

creditors and counterparties of these companies raced to call in loans or demand extra 

collateral, ratcheting up the pressure on already shaky firms.  Concerted government 

attempts to find a buyer for Lehman proved unavailing; lacking sufficient collateral to 

secure a Federal Reserve loan, the company’s only option was bankruptcy.   

In contrast to Lehman, AIG had sufficient assets to secure credit from the Federal 

Reserve and thus avoid imminent failure.  I have said before that nothing made me 

angrier during the crisis than the irresponsible decisions at AIG that put our entire 

financial system and economy at grave risk and left the government with no good 

options.  However, with the financial system already teetering on the brink of collapse, 

the disorderly failure of AIG, the world’s largest insurance company, would have 

undoubtedly led to even greater financial chaos and a far deeper economic slump than the 

very severe one we have experienced.  

The rapidly worsening crisis soon spread beyond financial institutions into the 

money and capital markets more generally.  Losses on Lehman’s commercial paper at a 

prominent money market mutual fund led to a run on that fund and many others; over the 

subsequent weeks, fearful money-fund investors withdrew more than $400 billion.  

Equity prices fell precipitously, large firms and banks hoarded cash, and short-term credit 

became available, if at all, only at very high interest rates and for very short terms.
