Unlike the firms depicted in much of the IO literature, financial conglomerates transact with one 

another on a continual basis and enter into contractual arrangements that impose future 

obligations.  In other words, cooperation is often institutionalized so that the day-to-day 

operations of a given firm depend crucially on the institutions with which it cooperates.  This, of 

course, is one--though not the only--reason why systemic crises are a recurring feature of the 

financial system. 

Understanding the role of cooperation among financial conglomerates that are 

interconnected through counterparty relationships and correlated exposures may be challenging, 

but it could be quite important for effective macroprudential regulation.  Cooperation among 

large firms can, in principle, buffer the impact of systemic events.

  On the other hand, the 

expectation of future cooperation from one’s competitors can induce riskier behavior on the part 

of individual firms.  And, perhaps more troubling, the sudden breakdown of cooperation during a 

systemic event can accelerate the transmission of adverse consequences throughout the financial 

system. 

Regulators must consider how new resolution frameworks such as that created by Dodd-

Frank will affect market participants’ beliefs about what will happen in the case of distress at a 

large financial institution and, consequently, how cooperative behavior among financial 

counterparties might change.  Orderly liquidation authority can be understood as a ―credible 

threat‖ on the part of regulators to allow a troubled institution to fail.  Resolution plan 

requirements may allow other firms to better anticipate the consequences of such a failure and, as 

a result, to reduce the cost of uncertainty for those firms.  Both of these features of Dodd-Frank 

have, in theory, the potential to weaken implicit cooperative arrangements during a crisis.  Even
