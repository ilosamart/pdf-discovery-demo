Developments in Housing and Housing Finance 

The multiyear boom and bust in housing prices of the past decade, together with 

the sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and defaults that followed, were among the 

principal causes of the financial crisis and the ensuing deep recession--a recession that 

cost some 8 million jobs.  And continued weakness in housing--reflected in falling prices, 

low rates of new construction, and historic levels of foreclosure--has proved a powerful 

headwind to recovery.  It is encouraging, therefore, that we are seeing signs of 

improvement in the housing market in most parts of the country.  House prices nationally 

have increased for nine consecutive months, residential investment has risen about 

15 percent from its low point, and sales of both new and existing homes have edged up.

Homebuilder sentiment has improved considerably over the past year, and real estate 

agents report a substantial rise in homebuyer traffic.  The growing demand for homes has 

been underpinned by record levels of affordability, the result of historically low mortgage 

rates and house prices that are 30 percent or more below their peaks in many areas.  

To be sure, the housing sector is far from being out of the woods.  Construction 

activity, sales, and prices remain much lower than they were before the crisis.  About 

20 percent of mortgage borrowers remain underwater--that is, they owe more than their 

homes are worth.  Despite marked improvements in overall credit quality, 7 percent of 

mortgages are either more than 90 days overdue or in the process of foreclosure.

although the number of homes in foreclosure has edged down since cresting in 2010, that
