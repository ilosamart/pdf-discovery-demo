also true that the change in population over time has a bearing on the economic health of 

communities and regions, and is part of the story for economic growth in the western United 

States. 

In recent years, that story has been a very positive one.  The U.S. economy is strong, and 

the western economy is especially strong.  While we don’t have state or regional numbers for 

this year, from 2015 through 2017, GDP, after adjusting for inflation, grew two to nearly three 

times as fast in the West as in the rest of the United States.  Since the Great Recession ended in 

2010, real GDP has grown twice as fast in the West as in the Northeast, about 50 percent faster 

than in the Midwest, and a third faster than in the South.6    

But there is another distinction to the western economy, one that many in this audience 

know well, that brings these high-flying results down to earth.  While the good times are 

typically very good in the West, the bad times are usually pretty bad, and that was certainly true 

during the Great Recession.  From 2008 through 2010, the western economy contracted four 

times as much as the average for all of the United States.  The same is true for per capita 

personal income, which contracted more sharply in the West than elsewhere, as job losses in the 

western region during the recession were worse than elsewhere.  

Taking a longer perspective, however, even with the booms and the busts that have 

characterized the West for upwards of 200 years, the West is still the fastest growing region of 

the United States.  Since 2000, real GDP has grown twice as fast in the West as in the Northeast 

and Midwest, and about 30 percent faster than in the South.  Since 1988, the numbers are 

roughly the same.  Per capita personal income grew faster in the West during good years,
