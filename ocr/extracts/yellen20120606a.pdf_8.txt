The solid blue bars in figure 4 present a snapshot of the distribution of nominal wage 

changes for individual jobs during the depth of the current labor market slump, based on data 

collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.6  For comparison, the dashed red line presents a 

hypothetical distribution of wage changes, using a normal distribution that approximates the 

actual distribution of wage changes greater than zero.  The distribution of actual wage changes 

shows that a relatively high percentage of workers saw no change in their nominal wage, and 

relatively few experienced modest wage cuts.  This pile-up phenomenon at zero suggests that, 

even when the unemployment rate was around 10 percent, many firms were reluctant to cut 

nominal wage rates.  In the absence of this barrier, nominal gains in wages and unit labor costs 

would have likely been even more subdued given the severity of the economic downturn, with 

the result that inflation would probably now be running at a lower rate.   

Anchored inflation expectations are another reason why inflation has remained close to 2 

percent in the face of very low resource utilization.  As shown in figure 5, survey measures of 

longer-horizon inflation expectations have remained nearly constant since the mid-1990s even as 

actual inflation has fluctuated.  As a result, the current slump has not generated the downward 

spiral of falling expected and actual inflation that a simple accelerationist model of inflation 

might have predicted.  Indeed, keeping inflation expectations from declining has been an 

important success of monetary policy over the past few years.  At the same time, the fact that 

longer-term inflation expectations have not risen above 2 percent has also proved extremely 

                                                            
6 The data shown in figure 4 refer to the change in wages over the 12 months to March 2010.  See Bruce Fallick, 
Michael Lettau, and William Wascher (2011), “Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity in the United States during the 
Great Recession,” unpublished manuscript, November.  Similar results, based on a different source of data, are 
reported in Mary Daly, Bart Hobijn, and Brian Lucking (2012), “Why Has Wage Growth Stayed Strong?” Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter 2012-10, April 2, 
www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-10.html.  I have explored the implications of downward 
nominal rigidity for the Phillips curve and stabilization policy in greater depth in Janet L. Yellen and George A. 
Akerlof (2006), “Stabilization Policy:  A Reconsideration,” Economic Inquiry, vol. 44 (January), pp. 1-22.
