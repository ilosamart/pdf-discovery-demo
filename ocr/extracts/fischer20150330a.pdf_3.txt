in many activities within the financial system as well, such as securities lending.  The 

nonbank sector has produced material benefits:  increased market liquidity, greater 

diversity of funding sources, and--it is often claimed--a more efficient allocation of risk 

to investors.  However, threats to the stability of the overall financial system have also 

increased, as was evident in the recent financial crisis. 

It is now eight years since major cracks in the financial system that led to the 

Global Financial Crisis first appeared in nonbank entities and activities.  While the causes 

of the crisis were complex, I will start by telling part of the tale of how nonbank distress 

was transmitted to the broader financial system.  The story begins with nonbank 

mortgage companies, which were important originators of subprime and prime mortgage 

loans, typically securitizing them or selling them to investment banks to be securitized.  

Rumors of troubles among these firms were circulating in 2006 as house prices started to 

decline, and a large firm filed for bankruptcy in December 2006.2  Then New Century, at 

one point the second largest subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy in April 2007 because 

its funding had disappeared as a result of fears about losses.  Many more followed in 

2007 and 2008.  Replacement of nonbank lendersâ€™ capacity to process mortgage 

applications and to fund mortgage loans occurred only partially and slowly.   

Next step:  The distress in mortgage markets was amplified in the broader 

financial system in several ways, including something similar to a bank run but which 

instead occurred on asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) vehicles.  These vehicles 

invested in private-label mortgage securitizations and other long-term debt securities but 

were funded with short-term commercial paper.  Buyers of the commercial paper issued 

2 Ownit Mortgage Solutions, one of the top 20 subprime mortgage originators nationally, filed for 
bankruptcy on December 28, 2006.  Virtually all such firms have since either failed or been acquired.
