that the domestic financial system may simply not have the capacity to effectively 

intermediate large volumes of inflows.  For example, if financial supervision is not 

sufficient to ward off such problems, short-term lending from abroad (so-called hot 

money) can result in maturity mismatches, which can bankrupt domestic institutions in 

the event of sharp and sudden outflows.  Unhedged borrowing in foreign currencies 

creates an additional mismatch, where a sharp currency depreciation can dramatically 

boost debt burdens, push borrowers into insolvency, and, in a vicious circle, induce 

further curtailment of finance from abroad.  Heavily managed exchange rate regimes may 

also provide incentives for such mismatches to arise.  In addition, increased financial 

openness may increase countriesâ€™ exposure to the risk of contagion and spillovers from 

financial shocks elsewhere in the global economy. 

 Many of these vulnerabilities have been manifest in the emerging market crises of 

the past several decades.  For example, in the lead-up to the 1997-98 Asian crisis, 

domestic financial intermediation failed to prudently allocate capital, and these 

deficiencies were amplified by large amounts of external borrowing in foreign currencies, 

encouraged by heavily managed exchange rate regimes.  As such deficiencies came to 

light, exchange rates collapsed, resulting in large balance sheet losses.  Foreign investors 

lost confidence in much of the region, precipitating capital flight, the spread of the crisis 

to additional countries, and a sharp downturn in activity in these economies.   

 Consistent with the broad set of practical challenges posed by capital flows that I 

have just highlighted, the empirical literature on the connection between openness and 

growth contains a wide range of findings.  For example, work using firm-level data finds 

notable positive effects, while other papers that draw on cross-country data find little or
