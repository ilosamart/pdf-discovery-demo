smartphone world.  If a developer wants to use a Google Maps API to embed a map in her 

application, she first must create a developer account with Google, agreeing to Google’s terms 

and conditions.  This means she will have entered a contract with the owner of the API, and the 

terms and conditions may differ depending on how sensitive the particular API is.  Google may 

require only a minimum amount of information for a developer that wants to use an API to 

display a map.  Google may, however, require more information about a developer that wants to 

use a different API to monitor the history of a consumer’s physical locations over the previous 

week.  And in some cases, the competitive interests of Google and a third-party app developer 

may diverge over time, such that the original terms of access are no longer acceptable.16    

The fact that it is possible and indeed relatively common for the API provider--the 

platform--to require specific controls and protections over the use of that API raises complicated 

issues when imported to the banking world.  As banks have considered how to facilitate 

connectivity, the considerations include not only technical issues and the associated investment, 

but also the important legal questions associated with operating in a highly regulated sector.  The 

banks’ terms of access may be determined in third-party service provider agreements that may 

offer different degrees of access.  These may affect not only what types of protections and 

vetting are appropriate for different types of access over consumers’ funds and data held at a 

bank in order to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations for data security and other consumer 

protections, but also the competitive position of the bank relative to third-party developers.     

There is a second broad type of approach in which many banks have entered into 

agreements with specialized companies that essentially act as middlemen, frequently described

as it continues its push into driverless cars, thereby reducing its reliance on Google Maps. Leslie Hook, “Uber to
