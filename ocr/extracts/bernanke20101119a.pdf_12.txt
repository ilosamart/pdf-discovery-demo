surpluses in the emerging markets, thus helping cool these rapidly growing economies 

while adding to demand in the advanced economies.  Moreover, currency appreciation 

would help shift a greater proportion of domestic output toward satisfying domestic needs 

in emerging markets.  The net result would be more balanced and sustainable global 

economic growth.   

Given these advantages of a system of market-determined exchange rates, why 

have officials in many emerging markets leaned against appreciation of their currencies 

toward levels more consistent with market fundamentals?  The principal answer is that 

currency undervaluation on the part of some countries has been part of a long-term 

export-led strategy for growth and development.  This strategy, which allows a countryâ€™s 

producers to operate at a greater scale and to produce a more diverse set of products than 

domestic demand alone might sustain, has been viewed as promoting economic growth 

and, more broadly, as making an important contribution to the development of a number 

of countries.  However, increasingly over time, the strategy of currency undervaluation 

has demonstrated important drawbacks, both for the world system and for the countries 

using that strategy. 

First, as I have described, currency undervaluation inhibits necessary 

macroeconomic adjustments and creates challenges for policymakers in both advanced 

and emerging market economies.  Globally, both growth and trade are unbalanced, as 

reflected in the two-speed recovery and in persistent current account surpluses and 

deficits.  Neither situation is sustainable.  Because a strong expansion in the emerging 

market economies will ultimately depend on a recovery in the more advanced economies, 

this pattern of two-speed growth might very well be resolved in favor of slow growth for
