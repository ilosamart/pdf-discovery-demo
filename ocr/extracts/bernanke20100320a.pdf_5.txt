excessive risks.  

 Having institutions that are too big to fail also creates competitive inequities that 

may prevent our most productive and innovative firms from prospering.  In an 

environment of fair competition, smaller firms should have a chance to outperform larger 

companies.  By the same token, firms that do not make the grade should exit, freeing up 

resources for other uses.  Our economy is not static, and our banking system should not 

be static either. 

 In short, to have a competitive, vital, and innovative financial system in which 

market discipline encourages efficiency and controls risk, including risks to the system as 

a whole, we have to end the too-big-to-fail problem once and for all.  But how can that be 

done?  Some proposals have been made to limit the scope and activities of financial 

institutions, and I think a number of those ideas are worth careful consideration.  

Certainly, supervisors should be empowered to limit the involvement of firms in 

inappropriately risky activities.  But even if such proposals are implemented, our 

technologically sophisticated and globalized economy will still need large, complex, and 

internationally active financial firms to meet the needs of multinational firms, to facilitate 

international flows of goods and capital, and to take advantage of economies of scale and 

scope.  The unavoidable challenge is to make sure that size, complexity, and 

interconnectedness do not insulate such firms from market discipline, potentially making 

them ticking time bombs inside our financial system. 

 To address the too-big-to-fail problem, the Federal Reserve favors a three-part 

approach.  First, we and our colleagues at other supervisory agencies must continue to
