This brings me to regulatory policy.  One of the questions I am most frequently asked 

when I speak to audiences like this one is, “What on earth is going on in Washington these 

days?”   

Well, there certainly is a lot going on.  Right now, among some other things, federal 

regulators are working to build out hundreds of requirements laid out by Congress in the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  And, in the midst of this complicated 

rule-writing effort, there is a renewed debate over whether these requirements are sufficient to 

end too-big-to-fail.  Regulators are also continuing to oversee improvements to the operational 

problems in the massive numbers of foreclosures in the wake of the financial crisis and exploring 

the risks to financial stability that may persist in the differentially regulated parts of our financial 

system.  This is all necessary work, and it is appropriately getting significant attention from 

officials at the highest levels in multiple agencies.   

But just as important is what, unfortunately, is not yet getting as much attention in 

Washington.  What is not happening--what in fact may be difficult to achieve until this post-

crisis work is near completion and the overarching goal of financial stability has been 

addressed--is a more proactive inquiry and articulation of a positive vision of what kind of 

financial system we want to foster or preserve.  While we focus on the difficult task of 

implementing a wide range of rules, a number of questions about the industry remain, questions 

that we must shift our full focus to once the post-crisis work is near completion. 

For example, is diversity in both the size and type of financial institutions critical to the 

goals of stability and access to credit?  Should new technologies that permit mobile payments 

and mobile banking be fostered through federal policy?  To what extent should we be concerned 

about cyber threats, and are there features of a financial system that can mitigate or thwart such
