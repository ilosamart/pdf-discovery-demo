On behalf of my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System, I want to 

thank you for joining us today.  As educators, your work is critical to our economy and 

our nation.  Well-prepared students make for a productive and innovative workforce and 

a well-functioning democracy.  

The economist Alfred Marshall said that economics is the study of people in the 

ordinary business of life.1  What could be more fundamental?  Learning about economics 

helps students understand how the decisions of millions of people about what to produce 

and consume determine what Adam Smith called “the wealth of nations”--our living 

standards.2

I am sure that your students have been eager to understand the economic and 

financial events of the past few years.  The recent financial crisis was among the most 

profound challenges to economic and financial stability since the Great Depression, and 

its causes and its ultimate remedies have been, and will continue to be, widely debated.  

The study of economics will allow your students to join the debate in a responsible and 

informed way.  

  In particular, economics helps students understand both the strengths and the 

shortcomings of our market-based economic system.  

One of the key lessons of the recent financial crisis is the importance of personal 

financial literacy.  Many of you teach your students the skills necessary to make good 

financial decisions.  Your efforts are of paramount importance in helping students 

understand how to save for the future and how to invest their money to make it grow.  In 

retrospect, some of the people who were hurt the most during the crisis borrowed money 

that they should not have borrowed and signed financial contracts they should not have
