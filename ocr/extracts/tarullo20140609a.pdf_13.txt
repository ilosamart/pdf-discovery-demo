to equity in a context where resolution is a credible option should make the price of those 

instruments especially sensitive to the relative risk of failure of those firms.  Requiring 

systemically important financial firms to issue a meaningful amount of long-term debt would 

indirectly influence corporate governance by introducing at-risk debt holders as a constituency 

whose concerns management must monitor and address. 

 A second kind of measure to align corporate governance at financial firms more closely 

to regulatory objectives is a substantive requirement or constraint upon decisions made within 

the firm.  As a practical matter, it would be hard to develop a rule setting a comprehensive risk 

appetite consonant with regulatory objectives.  However, there are regulatory requirements that 

can serve as partial surrogates for such a rule.  A good example, already in place, is a feature of 

the Federal Reserve’s program of stress testing and capital planning.  A firm may not make 

capital distributions (whether in the form of dividends or capital repurchases) that would, when 

added to losses under hypothesized adverse scenarios as projected in our annual supervisory 

stress test, reduce the firm’s capital below certain minimum levels.   

When we adopted this rule several years ago, we were criticized by some for encroaching 

on the prerogative of boards of directors of financial firms to decide on capital distribution 

policies, in accordance with general corporate governance practice.  This criticism has always 

seemed to me misplaced.  After all, banking regulators are not only permitted, but obliged, to set 

minimum capital requirements at banking organizations and other systemically important 

financial firms.  Limiting capital distributions is, conceptually, no different from requiring a firm 

to build capital in the first place.12  A regulation designed to maintain minimum capital levels in 

large banking organizations in a projected period of stress is consistent with the macroprudential 

                                                 
12 Indeed, insured depository institutions are prohibited by statute from making any capital distribution that would 
render the firm undercapitalized.  12 U.S.C. §1831o(d)(1).
