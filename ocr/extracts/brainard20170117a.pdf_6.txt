The current nominal neutral interest rate--or the level of the federal funds rate that 

is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and 

stable inflation--is quite low at present.6  Adjusting for inflation, most estimates of the 

neutral rate are currently close to zero, compared with about 2 percent for the quarter-

century prior to the financial crisis.7  A low neutral rate implies that conventional 

monetary policy has less room to respond when the economy is hit by adverse shocks.  

With conventional monetary policy constrained in the vicinity of the lower bound, it is 

more difficult for the economy to recover and for inflation to move back to target.8 

Policies that persistently raise aggregate demand alone can lift the neutral rate, but 

that may come at substantial cost.  Because these policies do not affect the economy’s 

long-term growth potential but do result in persistent fiscal deficits, they can lead to 

substantial increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio.  The greater space for monetary policy to 

respond to adverse shocks provided by a higher neutral rate comes at the expense of 

reducing the space for fiscal policy to stabilize the economy in the event of future adverse 

shocks.  

In this regard, it matters importantly whether increased fiscal deficits 

predominantly raise aggregate demand or also expand the supply potential of the 

economy more broadly.  Changes in fiscal policy that raise the level or growth rate of 

productivity or that induce greater labor force participation and higher levels of skill and
