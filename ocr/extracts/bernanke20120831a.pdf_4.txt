the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the FOMC turned to nontraditional 

policy approaches to support the recovery. 

As the Committee embarked on this path, we were guided by some general 

principles and some insightful academic work but--with the important exception of the 

Japanese case--limited historical experience.  As a result, central bankers in the United 

States, and those in other advanced economies facing similar problems, have been in the 

process of learning by doing.  I will discuss some of what we have learned, beginning 

with our experience conducting policy using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, then 

turn to our use of communications tools.   

Balance Sheet Tools 

In using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a tool for achieving its mandated 

objectives of maximum employment and price stability, the FOMC has focused on the 

acquisition of longer-term securities--specifically, Treasury and agency securities, which 

are the principal types of securities that the Federal Reserve is permitted to buy under the 

Federal Reserve Act.3  One mechanism through which such purchases are believed to 

affect the economy is the so-called portfolio balance channel, which is based on the ideas 

of a number of well-known monetary economists, including James Tobin, Milton 

Friedman, Franco Modigliani, Karl Brunner, and Allan Meltzer.  The key premise 

underlying this channel is that, for a variety of reasons, different classes of financial 

                                                            
3 Agency securities are securities issued by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and include both 
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by GSEs and GSE debt.  Since August 2008, Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship with capital support provided by the U.S. Treasury. 
The Federal Reserve's net acquisitions of securities are financed by the creation of commercial bank 
reserves, which in turn are held in accounts at the Federal Reserve. (*The text of this footnote has been
