instance, to buy a house or for businesses to expand.  Similarly, when the economy is 

threatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the 

economy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust. 

But what exactly do the terms “maximum employment” and “price stability” 

mean?  Does maximum employment mean that every single person who wants a job has a 

job?  No.  There are always a certain number of people who are temporarily between jobs 

after having recently lost a job or having left one voluntarily to pursue better 

opportunities.  Others may have just graduated and have started looking for a job or have 

decided to return to working--for instance, when their child starts school.  This so-called 

frictional unemployment is evident even in the healthiest of economies. 

Then there is structural unemployment--a difficult problem both for the people 

affected and for policymakers trying to address it.  Sometimes people are ready and 

willing to work, but their skills, perhaps because of technological advances, are not a 

good fit for the jobs that are available.  Or suitable jobs may be available but are not close 

to where they and their families live.  These are factors over which monetary policy has 

little influence.  Other measures--such as job training and other workforce development 

programs--are better suited to address structural unemployment.   

After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what 

unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can 

be sustained in the longer run?  The rate can change over time as the economy evolves, 

but, for now, many economists, including my colleagues at the Fed and me, judge that it 

is around 4-3/4 percent.  It’s important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is
