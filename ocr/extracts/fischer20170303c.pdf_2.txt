In recent years, reforms in the monetary policy decisionmaking process in central 

banks have been in the direction of an increasing number of monetary policy committees 

and fewer single decisionmakers--the lone governor model.1  We are only a few months 

away from the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the Bank of Englandâ€™s Monetary 

Policy Committee, just a few years after the 300th birthday of the venerable Old Lady of 

Threadneedle Street.  The Bank of Israel moved from a single policymaker to a monetary 

policy committee in 2010, while I was governor there; more recently, central banks in 

India and New Zealand have handed over monetary policy to committees. 

The Federal Reserve is not part of this recent shift, however.  The Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the 

United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the 

founding of the Fed itself.2 

The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in 

aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.  Despite the 

prevalence and importance of committees in modern central banking, the role of 

committees in the formulation of policy has not attracted nearly as much academic 

attention as has the research on monetary policy rules.3 

The literature on monetary policy rules stretches back to at least Adam Smith and 

includes important contributions from David Ricardo, Knut Wicksell, and Milton

views expressed are mine and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open 
Market Committee. 
2 Although the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the institutional structure and governance that we have 
today date from 1935.  See Bordo (2016) and Wheelock (2000). 
3 It is true, though, that popular books on prominent central banks typically relate more frequently to the 
outstanding governors or presidents of the central banks than they do to the organizational structure of 
those banks.
