prudentially regulated institutions.  The Board has finalized the liquidity coverage ratio7 and is 

developing the net stable funding ratio to diminish large banks’ vulnerability to abrupt changes 

in short-term wholesale markets.  The Board’s annual Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and 

Review provides an opportunity for supervisors to assess and, where necessary to contain risks, 

require changes to the specific funding practices of large banking organizations.8  Finally, in 

order to increase the resilience of firms that continue to use significant amounts of such funding, 

we have also incorporated a measure of a firm’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding into 

the calibration of both the capital surcharge for U.S. GSIBs and our proposed long-term debt 

requirement for those firms.9   

These measures, applicable as they are only to prudentially regulated banking 

organizations, do nothing to address the risks of short-term wholesale funding by nonbank 

intermediaries.  Indeed, constraints imposed on banking organizations may prompt more short-

term wholesale funding to migrate outside the regulated sector.  In the past, bank backstops were 

generally needed for shadow banks to obtain substantial amounts of such funding.  But it is not 

so far-fetched to think that, with time and sufficient economic incentive, the financial, 

technological, and regulatory barriers to the disintermediation of prudentially regulated banking 

firms could be overcome.  Indeed, we have observed some investment funds exploring the 

possibility of disintermediating dealers by lending cash against securities collateral to other 

market participants.  While it would be inadvisable to apply bank-style regulation to all entities 

that make use of short-term wholesale funding, a degree of consistent regulatory treatment is
