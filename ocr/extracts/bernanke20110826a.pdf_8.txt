moderating and with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, we expect 

inflation to settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit 

less, that most Committee participants view as being consistent with our dual mandate.   

In light of its current outlook, the Committee recently decided to provide more 

specific forward guidance about its expectations for the future path of the federal funds 

rate.  In particular, in the statement following our meeting earlier this month, we 

indicated that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a 

subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally 

low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.  That is, in what the 

Committee judges to be the most likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in 

the medium term, the target for the federal funds rate would be held at its current low 

levels for at least two more years.  

In addition to refining our forward guidance, the Federal Reserve has a range of 

tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus.  We discussed the 

relative merits and costs of such tools at our August meeting.  We will continue to 

consider those and other pertinent issues, including of course economic and financial 

developments, at our meeting in September, which has been scheduled for two days (the 

20th and the 21st) instead of one to allow a fuller discussion.  The Committee will 

continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared 

to employ its tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context 

of price stability.
