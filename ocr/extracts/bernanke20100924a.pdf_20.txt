Conclusion 

I began my remarks by drawing the distinction between the scientific, 

engineering, and management aspects of economics.  For the most part, in my view, the 

financial crisis reflected problems in what I referred to as economic engineering and 

economic management.  Both private-sector arrangements (for example, for risk 

management and funding) and the financial regulatory framework were flawed in design 

and execution, and these weaknesses were the primary reasons that the financial crisis 

and its economic effects were so severe. 

Disasters require urgent action to prevent repetition.  Engineers seek to enhance 

the reliability of a complex machine through improvements in basic design; more-

rigorous testing and quality assurance; and increases in the resilience of the machine 

through means such as stronger materials, greater redundancy, and better backup systems.  

Economic policymakersâ€™ efforts to avoid, or at least mitigate, future financial crises are 

proceeding along analogous lines.  First, the recent reform legislation has improved the 

design of the regulatory framework, closing important gaps such as the lack of oversight 

of the shadow banking system.  Likewise, in the private sector, firms have taken 

significant steps to improve their systems for managing risk and liquidity.  Second, to 

reduce the probability and severity of future crises, policymakers will monitor the system 

more intensively.  For example, the recent legislation creates a Financial Stability 

Oversight Council, made up of the heads of the financial regulatory agencies, which will 

assess potential risks to the financial system, identify regulatory gaps, and coordinate the 

efforts of the various agencies.  Enhanced market discipline, the result of a new 

resolution regime for systemically critical firms and a number of measures to increase
