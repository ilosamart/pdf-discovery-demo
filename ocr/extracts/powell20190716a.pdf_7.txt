economic and financial conditions in others through financial markets, trade, and 

confidence channels.  Pursuing our domestic mandates in this new world requires that we

policy decisionmaking.

during the crisis, policymakers quickly exhausted conventional monetary policy tools and 

employed a range of unconventional measures to support their economies.   

In the United States, these measures included new forms of forward guidance and 

a range of balance sheet policies.  Broadly across different economies, so-called 

unconventional monetary policies have generally been successful at lowering interest 

rates and supporting economic recovery, though cyclical and structural headwinds have 

made achieving our inflation targets a challenge.  A legacy of the crisis is that 

policymakers now have a broader range of tested tools to turn to the next time the 

effective lower bound is reached.  We must continue to assess additional strategies and 

tools to bolster our economies and meet our inflation and employment mandates. 

Finally, the crisis and Great Recession brought into stark relief the need for 

transparency and accountability for central banks.  Central bank communication is 

increasingly important and increasingly challenging.  It is important because clear,
