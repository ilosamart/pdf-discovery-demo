In addition, the Federal Reserve could, if necessary, use its balance sheet tools to 

mitigate the risk of a sharp rise in rates.  For example, the Committee has indicated its 

intention to sell its agency securities gradually once conditions warrant.  The Committee 

also noted, however, that the pace of sales could be adjusted up or down in response to 

material changes in either the economic outlook or financial conditions.  In particular, 

adjustments to the pace or timing of asset sales could be used, under some circumstances, 

to dampen excessively sharp adjustments in longer-term interest rates. 

Conclusion

challenging economic environment, at a time when our main policy tool, the federal 

funds rate, is near its effective lower bound.  On the one hand, the Fedâ€™s dual mandate 

has led us to provide strong support for the recovery, both to promote maximum 

employment and to keep inflation from falling below our price stability objective.  One 

purpose of this support is to prompt a return to the productive risk-taking that is essential 

to robust growth and to getting the unemployed back to work.  On the other hand, we 

must be mindful of the possibility that sustained periods of low interest rates and highly 

accommodative policy could lead to excessive risk-taking in some financial markets.  

The balance here is not an easy one to strike.  While the recent crisis is vivid testament to 

the costs of ill-judged risk-taking, we must also be aware of constraints posed by the 

present state of the economy.  In light of the moderate pace of the recovery and the 

continued high level of economic slack, dialing back accommodation with the goal of 

deterring excessive risk-taking in some areas poses its own risks to growth, price 

stability, and, ultimately, financial stability.  Indeed, as I noted, a premature removal of
