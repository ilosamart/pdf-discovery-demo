  Salomon was clearly understood to be outside the safety net, and I 

recall no discussion of a government rescue.  But the firm’s failure would almost certainly have 

caused massive disruption in the markets.  To this day, I am grateful that we resolved that crisis 

with neither a bailout nor a failure.   

Over 20 years later, both these events still frame the too big to fail reform agenda.  Faced 

with the failure of a large commercial bank, we chose to extend the safety net rather than run the 

very real risk of a systemic depositor run.  Our “near miss” with Salomon in 1991 presaged the 

enormous damage that would result from the failure of Lehman Brothers, another investment 

bank, in 2008.  In fact, the dimension of the problem grew substantially over the years.  Since 

1991, the ratio of U.S. banking assets to annual gross domestic product in the United States has 

more than doubled, from 55 percent to 126 percent.  Meanwhile, the percentage of those assets 

held by the largest three institutions has increased from 14 to 32 percent.   

Bailouts may have been more tolerable in the early 1990s when they were rare and their 

use for a failing bank was uncertain.  That is no longer the case.  Recent years have seen large 

and numerous bailouts as a result of the financial crisis.  The public, the regulatory community, 

and large financial institutions themselves all agree now that too big to fail must end.   

As I said earlier, reforms to end too big to fail must wage the fight on two fronts.  First, 

we need enhanced regulation to make large financial institution failures much less likely.  

Second, we need a credible mechanism to manage the failure of even the largest firms, without 

causing or amplifying a systemic crisis.     

Let’s survey what has been proposed and implemented thus far in that two-front war on 

too big to fail.
