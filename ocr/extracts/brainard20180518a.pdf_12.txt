Fair Credit Access 

The fifth and final principle for CRA modernization is to ensure that revised CRA

percent increase from 2001.16  The percent of renter households that are spending half or more of 

their pretax income on housing increased by 42 percent during the same period.   

Households that spend a high fraction of their income on rent often may find themselves 

unable to pursue proven strategies to achieve financial security and invest in their familyâ€™s
