vulnerabilities within their financial sectors.  Currently, 13 countries have announced a 

CCyB above zero, ranging from 0.25 percent in Luxembourg to 2.5 percent in Hong 

Kong, Norway, and Sweden.7  The CCyB is a novel approach to financial regulation, and 

I think it is important that we, as regulators, learn from other countries’ experiences with 

the CCyB.  I see three important explanations for differences in the CCyB across 

countries.   

Perhaps the most important and direct reason for different CCyB levels among 

different countries is that they face different vulnerabilities.  According to national 

authorities’ announcements, the decisions to activate the buffers were generally 

motivated by credit growth, household debt, and housing prices; in this regard, it is 

notable that mortgage credit or house prices have expanded rapidly in several countries 

deploying the CCyB, including Hong Kong and the Nordic countries that have set their 

CCyB at 2.5 percent.  For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s decision to 

increase the CCyB level to 2.5 percent in January 2018 was importantly linked to housing 

developments.   

Another explanation for the differences in observed CCyB levels across countries 

is the range of available macroprudential tools to stem the buildup in financial 

vulnerabilities in different countries and the degree to which such tools have been the 

preferred means for addressing identified vulnerabilities.8  For example, housing market 

                                                 
7 This figure includes countries that have announced a positive CCyB that will become effective at some 
point within the next year.
