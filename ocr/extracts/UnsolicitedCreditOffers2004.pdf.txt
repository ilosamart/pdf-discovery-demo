Executive Summary and Overview 

Each year American consumers receive several billion written offers of credit or 
insurance they did not request. In many cases, the senders have prescreened the 
recipients for creditworthiness and suitability using consumer credit records in the files of 
consumer reporting agencies (CRAs).1 Such prescreened solicitations are now among the 
principal techniques creditors and insurers use to inform prospective customers of the 
availability of their products and to establish new or additional business relationships 
with them. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) permits creditors and insurers to use CRA 
information as a basis for sending unsolicited firm offers of credit or insurance, also 
known as prescreened solicitations, to consumers who meet certain criteria, but only 
within limits specified in the act. The FCRA also provides a mechanism by which 
consumers can elect not to receive such solicitations by directing CRAs to exclude their 
names and addresses from lists provided by these agencies for sending prescreened 
solicitations. Consumers who choose to have their names removed from lists used for 
prescreened solicitations may well still receive offers of credit or insurance by mail or 
telephone, but such offers will not be based on the credit records maintained by the 
CRAs. 

REQUIREMENTS OF THE STUDY AND REPORT 

To learn more about unsolicited written offers of credit and insurance, the Congress 
directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in section 213(e) of the 
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (Fact Act), to conduct a study of 
prescreened solicitations and to summarize the results of the study in a report to the 
Congress. The Fact Act specifically requires the Board to study the ability of consumers 
to avoid (or “opt out” of) receiving written offers of credit or insurance in connection 
with transactions not initiated by the consumer and the potential effect on consumers of 
any further restrictions on providing them with such written offers of credit or insurance. 
In particular, the Congress directed the Board to address the following five issues in the 
study and report: 

1. the availability to consumers of opt-out mechanisms 
2. the extent to which consumers use existing opt-out mechanisms 
3. the benefits to consumers of receiving written offers 
4. the costs to or adverse affects on consumers of receiving written offers

(http://www.experian.com), and TransUnion Corporation (http://www.transunion.com).

5.	 the potential effect on the following factors if further restrictions are imposed 
on the ability of creditors and insurers to make written offers: 
o the cost consumers pay to obtain credit or insurance 
o the availability of credit or insurance 
o consumers’ knowledge about new or alternative products and services 
o the ability of lenders or insurers to compete with one another 
o the ability to offer credit or insurance products to consumers who have 

been traditionally underserved 
(See appendix A of this report for the text of section 213(e)). This report responds to the 
congressional request. 

STUDY APPROACH 

In conducting the required study, the Board undertook three tasks, the results of which 
are summarized in this report. First, to examine the ability of consumers to avoid (or “opt 
out” of) receiving unsolicited offers of credit or insurance, the Board obtained from one 
of the three national CRAs the credit records of a large, nationally representative random 
sample of individuals (excluding identifying personal or creditor information). The 
sample was obtained for two reasons: (1) to examine what it revealed about the extent to 
which consumers have exercised their statutory rights to opt out, that is, decline to 
receive prescreened solicitations and (2) to determine the credit use and other 
characteristics of consumers who had or had not opted out. 

Second, to learn about the views of consumers concerning their experiences with mailed 
prescreened solicitations, the Board sponsored a May 2004 nationwide survey of 
consumers on this issue through the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers 
program. This survey covered consumers’ behavior with respect to such solicitations 
when received, their attitudes toward such offers, their knowledge about the contents of 
such solicitations, and their knowledge about their right not to receive such solicitations. 

Third, to obtain the views of creditors, insurers, and other interested or concerned parties, 
the Board requested public comments on these issues through a notice in the Federal 
Register that creditors, insurers, and others could further publicize through the trade 
press, consumer newsletters, and other sources.2 This request specifically asked for 
comments on the following topics: 

•	 the extent to which insurance providers send prescreened solicitations to 
consumers

Prescreened Solicitations or Firm Offers of Credit or Insurance” (Docket No. OP-1195), Federal Register, 
vol. 69 (May 24), pp. 29539-40. 


Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 3 

•	 the availability of statutory or voluntary mechanisms available to consumers to 
notify creditors and insurance providers that a consumer does not wish to receive 
prescreened solicitations 

•	 the extent to which consumers are currently using existing statutory and voluntary 
mechanisms to avoid receiving prescreened solicitations 

• the benefits of receiving prescreened solicitations 
•	 significant costs or adverse effects, if any, that consumers incur as a result of 

receiving prescreened solicitations (especially specific comments on fraud-related 
losses due to identity theft) 

•	 additional restrictions, if any, that should be imposed on consumer reporting 
agencies, lenders, or insurers to restrict the ability of lenders and insurers to 
provide prescreened solicitations to consumers. More specifically, 
o how the additional restrictions would benefit consumers 
o	 how the additional restrictions would affect the cost consumers pay to obtain 

credit or insurance, the availability of credit or insurance, knowledge about 
new or alternative products and services, the ability of creditors or insurers to 
compete with one another, and the ability of creditors or insurers to offer 
credit or insurance to consumers who have been traditionally underserved 

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 

Prescreened offers can be useful to both their senders and recipients. Many companies 
that solicit new credit accounts and insurance policies have found prescreening to be a 
cost-effective way to identify individuals who are likely prospects for the products they 
offer and to control certain risks related to offering these products. Because it can be 
expensive to solicit and establish new business relationships with consumers, firms that 
solicit new credit accounts and insurance policies are interested in identifying likely 
prospects for the services they offer; hence, the interest in prescreening. Firms weigh the 
costs of prescreening against the expected profitability of additional business developed 
through this marketing channel. If they find that the net benefits are likely to be positive, 
they may engage in prescreened marketing as one way to generate new business. 

For consumers, prescreened solicitations reduce search costs by providing them with 
ready information about product availability and pricing tailored more closely to their 
financial experiences and needs. Such screening also increases the likelihood that 
consumers responding to such solicitations qualify for the product or service being 
offered and thereby reduces the possibility that the consumer will be wasting his or her 
time and effort when responding to a mailing. Because of their advantages to senders and 
consumers, prescreened solicitations are important in promoting competition and 
enhancing consumer welfare in the markets for credit and insurance. 

Nonetheless, some observers have raised concerns that sometimes such solicitations 
might lead to difficulties for some consumers. In addition to the simple inconvenience of 


4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

receiving unwanted “junk mail,” these observers note that prescreened solicitations can 
become lost or stolen and potentially lead to fraudulent activity that may impair a 
consumer’s credit rating or result in out-of-pocket losses. Some also believe that 
individuals’ rights to privacy are compromised when creditors or insurers use CRA 
records to contact them through prescreened solicitations. Finally, some observers are 
concerned that the large volume of credit offers made through prescreened solicitations 
might encourage some consumers to take on more debt than they can reasonably handle. 

This report has not found that prescreened solicitations have a significant bearing on the 
extent of these problems, and, therefore, finds that further restrictions on prescreened 
solicitations are not likely to alleviate such problems. Moreover, any substantive 
restrictions would be likely to significantly reduce the beneficial effects of prescreened 
solicitations on competition and consumer access to credit and insurance. These findings 
and conclusions are covered in more detail below. 

Availability and Use of Opt-Out Provisions 

Consumers who prefer not to receive prescreened written offers of credit or insurance are 
able to act on this preference through a process of “opting out.” The most important 
means of opting out is by using the statutory mechanism contained in section 604 of the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which governs the use of prescreening techniques. 
Section 604 specifically establishes a set of rules that regulate how creditors and insurers 
may use CRA records as the basis for sending unsolicited firm offers of credit or 
insurance to consumers. It also prescribes a mechanism by which consumers can elect 
not to receive these prescreened solicitations by opting out. Section 604 further requires 
creditors and insurers using prescreening to notify consumers of this opt-out right in each 
prescreened solicitation they send. 

Beyond the statutory provision for opting out, voluntary mechanisms established by 
industry groups and individual companies permit consumers to eliminate their names 
from listings used for prescreened written offers of credit or insurance. These voluntary 
mechanisms are important in the marketplace, accounting for an estimated one-third of 
the individuals on the opt-out lists maintained by the national CRAs. 

Currently, about 6 percent of consumers with credit records have opted out of receiving 
prescreened written offers of credit or insurance. The large number of individuals who 
have opted out suggests that it is not especially difficult to do so if individuals are aware 
of this option. A consumer survey indicates that about one-fifth of consumers are aware 
of their right under federal law not to receive prescreened solicitations. If awareness of 
this right was more widespread, it is likely that more consumers would opt out. 

Analysis of CRA records indicates that consumers with more credit accounts are more 
likely to opt out than those with fewer accounts. The higher opt-out rate for those with a 
relatively large number of credit relationships may indicate that such individuals (1) are 


Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 5 

not looking for further credit or (2) are more familiar with the opt-out process or both. 
Such individuals may be more familiar with the opt-out process because they have 
received more prescreened solicitations and, therefore, have had more opportunities to 
read the opt-out notice included in such solicitations. 

The Benefits and Costs of Receiving Written Offers 

The benefits to consumers of receiving prescreened written offers of credit or insurance 
are significant. Prescreened offers help consumers more quickly identify those credit and 
insurance products for which they likely qualify. (Because prescreened offers must be 
“firm offers” of credit or insurance, a consumer generally will receive prescreened 
solicitations for only those products for which he or she likely qualifies.) These 
prescreened offers also contain pricing and product information, often in a form easily 
comparable to accounts currently held. 

Consumer survey data analyzed by the Board indicate that consumers seem generally 
familiar with the type of content in written prescreened solicitations, even if they do not 
always open, read, or study each offer. When consumers do review the prescreened 
solicitations, they are most interested in the pricing information. The widespread 
availability of such pricing and product information contained in prescreened offers helps 
to make markets for these products more competitive, an advantage that benefits all 
consumers. 

The ability of creditors and insurers to tailor offers of credit or insurance to consumers’ 
pricing and product preferences at relatively low cost enhances competition and 
marketing efficiency. Also, by having access to credit record information for the 
purposes of prescreening, creditors and insurers are better able to control certain risks 
related to offering these products. 

In a competitive market, cost savings for creditors and insurers translate into lower prices 
and wider credit and insurance availability for consumers, possibly benefiting those 
consumers who have traditionally been underserved. Additionally, because prescreened 
solicitations are widely used and must be “firm” offers of credit, consumers gain better 
awareness of available credit products and rates. 

Written prescreened solicitations for credit and insurance carry some potential costs, 
including the inconvenience of receiving unwanted mail, the possibility of identity theft, 
the possible loss of privacy, and the potential for additional debt burden. Although these 
issues are important considerations, it does not appear that restricting written offers of 
credit or insurance would mitigate these problems, and the alternatives to prescreening 
may even exacerbate some of them. For example, restricting the ability of creditors and 
insurers to send prescreened solicitations to qualified applicants could result in the receipt 
of more unsolicited and unwanted mail by consumers as companies are forced to use less-
efficient mechanisms to acquire customers. 


6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

Potential Effects of Further Restrictions on Prescreened Solicitations 

Written offers of credit and insurance sent directly to consumers, often resulting from 
prescreened solicitation lists using credit records in the files of CRAs, have the potential 
to increase competition in the market for the relevant consumer financial services. The 
primary benefits of competition consist of lower prices and an increased availability of 
the product or service in question. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that actions 
undertaken to restrict the ability of lenders and insurers to provide written offers of credit 
or insurance to consumers would on balance result in a less competitive marketplace and 
thus relatively higher prices and reduced availability. 

Also, it is difficult to see how further restrictions on the ability of lenders and insurers to 
provide written offers of credit or insurance to consumers would improve the condition of 
those individuals or groups of individuals who might have been underserved in the past. 
It also is difficult to see how reducing the amounts of direct, tailored information sent to 
consumers on the availability and pricing of financial services would improve their 
“knowledge about new or alternative products and services.” 

The Fact Act includes enhancements to the opt-out-notice provisions of the FCRA; these 
include a review of the presentation and placement of the notice in prescreened 
solicitations and an extension of the opt-out period from two years to five years. The 
Congress also directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct a campaign to 
raise public awareness of opt-out rights, which may have the effect of increasing the 
frequency of opting out. These developments suggest that further legislative or 
regulatory changes to the opt-out system should await evaluation of the effects of these 
new provisions.

Background 

Creditors and insurers use a variety of methods to establish account relationships with 
consumers. The most common methods used by creditors offering general-purpose credit 
cards (such as Discover, MasterCard, Optima, or Visa), for example, are direct mail 
(prescreened or not); outbound telephone calls (prescreened or not); television, print, and 
Internet advertisements; electronic mail; promotional events; and “take one” brochures. 
Creditors also use direct mail and a variety of other print and electronic media to solicit 
customers for other credit products.3 

Insurance companies market their products and services in different ways depending on 
their business model. Some rely on a network of independent insurance agents or their 
own agents to identify and acquire customers. Some also use direct marketing 
approaches, including prescreened solicitations. 

HOW PRESCREENING WORKS 

In prescreening, a creditor or insurer establishes a set of specific credit criteria (such as a 
minimum credit score) and requests from a CRA the names, addresses, and certain other 
information on consumers in the CRA’s database who meet the specified criteria.4 

Alternatively, the creditor or insurer may provide a list of potential customers to the CRA 
and request that the CRA identify which consumers on that list meet the established 
credit criteria. Prescreening requests to CRAs may be made either directly by the 
creditors and insurers or indirectly through a third-party vendor. Prescreened 
solicitations may be conducted by mail, telephone, or electronically through the Internet, 
with use of the U.S. mail being the most common approach.5 

3 Although creditors use credit files at CRAs to prescreen solicitations for a variety of credit products, 
prescreening is most common in soliciting credit card accounts. For this reason, most available information 
about prescreening, and much of the discussion in this report, pertains to credit card accounts. 

4 Generically, a “credit score” is a statistically derived measure of creditworthiness that ranks 
individuals according to their default or credit risk, typically on the basis of information in their credit 
reports. As such, a credit score measures the relative degree of credit risk a borrower represents to a 
creditor. Credit scores are typically associated with an odds ratio that represents the proportion of 
individuals at that credit-score level who are likely to become delinquent on their credit obligation. 
“Insurance scores” also are derived from information in consumer reports, but such scores use insurance 
claims experience. In this report, the term “credit score” refers to both kinds of scores. 

5 As required, this report addresses only written prescreened solicitations. For purposes of 
completeness, however, the report contains some data on prescreened solicitations made by telephone.

TYPES OF CREDITORS AND INSURERS THAT USE PRESCREENING 

Prescreened solicitations are used to establish credit relationships for a wide variety of 
products including credit cards, home equity lines of credit, “live check” loans, student 
loans, and automobile credit.6 Perhaps the most frequent use of prescreening is in the 
area of credit cards. 

Industry sources indicate that nearly 70 percent of general-purpose credit card accounts 
established in 2002 resulted from direct mail contact, prescreened or not (table 1). Such 
mailings have grown substantially over the past decade, to about 5 billion in 2001 and 
2002, a level nearly five times that of a decade earlier (figure 1). About 75 percent of the 
credit card accounts established through direct mailing (53 percent of all new accounts)

consumer for an exact amount. The terms of the offer specify that by endorsing and depositing the check, 
the consumer has agreed to a loan from the company for the amount of the check.

were the consequence of a prescreened solicitation (table 1). Prescreened telephone 
contacts accounted for about 15 percent of the new accounts. Prescreened solicitations, 
both through the mail and by telephone, accounted for more than two-thirds of all new 
credit card accounts established in 2002.

Use of prescreening by insurance companies is more limited, in large part because so 
much of their acquisition of new accounts is through independent agents who are 
responsible for marketing. A public comment by one national CRA indicated that it had 
used its files for prescreening on behalf of forty-two insurance companies in 2003. This 
is a much smaller number than the number of creditors employing prescreening using 
CRA files. The number of companies in the latter group is not known precisely, but it is 
at least in the hundreds.

WHY MANY CREDITORS AND INSURERS USE PRESCREENING 

Many companies have found that prescreening improves marketing efficiency. 
Companies using prescreening have found that it facilitates the solicitation process by 
limiting solicitations to those consumers who satisfy the established credit criteria, 
reducing account acquisition costs for creditors and insurers. For example, prescreening 
allows many creditors and insurers to avoid the cost of sending solicitations to large 
numbers of consumers who ultimately would not qualify for the credit or insurance 
products being offered. Likewise, prescreening allows many creditors and insurers to 
reduce the number of responses that they must reject and the related costs of providing 
required rejection letters and dealing with those who may be dissatisfied. 

Also, creditors and insurers have found that by having access to credit record information 
at the prescreening phase, they are better able to control certain risks relating to the 
offering of their products. For example, by prescreening, a creditor or insurer can use the 
information in a credit file twice, once to select prospective customers, and a second 
time, if the prospect replies, to verify that no substantive change has occurred in the 
individual’s credit status. Having information about the consumer at two points in time 
increases the predictability of risk involving that consumer. 

As discussed below, in a competitive market, these market efficiencies and better control 
of risks result in lower prices, more product choices, and wider credit and insurance 
availability to consumers, including those traditionally underserved. Consumers further 
benefit by the receipt of fewer solicitations that do not match their credit or insurance 
circumstances.

Opting Out: Mechanisms to Avoid Receiving 
Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit or Insurance 

The first issue that the present study is to address under section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act 
is “the current statutory or voluntary mechanisms that are available to a consumer to 
notify lenders and insurance providers that the consumer does not wish to receive written 
offers of credit or insurance.” 

THE FCRA STATUTORY MECHANISM 

Section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act specifically establishes a set of rules that 
regulate how creditors and insurers may use CRA records as the basis for sending 
unsolicited firm offers of credit or insurance to consumers. It also prescribes a 
mechanism by which consumers can elect not to receive these prescreened solicitations. 

Section 604(c) designates the conditions for “furnishing reports in connection with credit 
or insurance transactions that are not initiated by the consumer,” in other words, for 
prescreened offers of credit or insurance based on information in the individual’s credit 
record. Specifically, section 604(c) mandates that a CRA may provide information on a 
consumer for prescreening only if (1) the consumer authorizes the CRA to provide the 
information (not usually a component of prescreened offers of credit or insurance) or (2) 
“the transaction consists of a firm offer of credit or insurance,” the CRA has established 
the required procedures allowing consumers to exclude themselves from the prescreened 
lists, and the consumer has not done so. A “firm offer of credit or insurance” is defined 
as any offer of credit or insurance to a consumer that will be honored if, on the basis of 
information in the consumer’s credit record, the consumer meets the specific criteria used 
to select him or her for the offer, except that the offer may be further conditioned in 
certain circumstances.9 

This provision establishes an important first requirement, namely that prescreening must 
be employed solely for offering credit or insurance, not merely for advertising. 
Furthermore, a person receiving a prescreened list from a CRA may receive only limited 
information about each consumer: (1) the name and address of the consumer, (2) an 
identifier that is not unique to the consumer and that is used by the person solely for the 
purpose of verifying the identity of the consumer (such as a partial social security 
number), and (3) other information about the consumer that does not identify the 
relationship or experience of the consumer with a particular creditor or other entity. In 
addition, the law requires that CRAs must comply with the provisions concerning 

9 These circumstances include verification of the specific criteria (for example, verification of income 
and employment) used to select the consumer for the offer and the consumer’s willingness to supply any 
needed collateral disclosed in the offer. These circumstances are outlined in section 603(l) of the FCRA. 


12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

consumers’ options to have their names removed from prescreened lists; this option is 
called the right to “opt out.” 

The statute also details the required procedures concerning consumers’ opt-out rights. It 
specifies the ways that consumers may notify CRAs of their intention to opt out, the 
agencies’ required responses to opt-out notices received from consumers, necessary 
timing for acting on opt-out notices from consumers, the duration of opt-out notices from 
consumers, and necessary components of the notification system itself (for example, toll-
free telephone availability). Equally important are the requirements that the existence of 
the system be disclosed to consumers, but these mandates are found later, in section 615 
of the law. 

A consumer may notify the agency through a system maintained by the agency (which, as 
indicated, must include a toll-free telephone number) or by submitting a signed “notice of 
election” form issued by the agency. Under provisions of the FCRA that go into effect 
on December 1, 2004, requests made through the telephone notification system 
maintained by the agency expire five years after notification unless the consumer revokes 
the election.10 Requests made through a signed notice-of-election form never expire, 
although they may be revoked by the consumer. When a consumer contacts an agency 
through the notification system, the agency must inform the consumer that the election is 
effective for only five years if the consumer does not submit to the agency a signed 
notice-of-election form issued by the agency. The agency also must provide to the 
consumer a notice-of-election form upon request of the consumer.11 

Section 615(d) of the FCRA specifies the details of the required notice to consumers 
regarding their right to opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations. Conversations with 
officials of the CRAs indicate that their companies monitor compliance by clients who 
use their credit files for prescreening activities. 

Under the FCRA, any person who uses a consumer report in connection with a 
prescreened solicitation must, with each written prescreened solicitation, provide to the 
consumer, a clear and conspicuous statement that (1) information contained in the 
consumer report was used in connection with the offer; (2) the consumer received the 
offer because he or she satisfied the criteria for creditworthiness or insurability used to 
screen for the offer; (3) if applicable, the credit or insurance may not be extended if, after 
the consumer responds, it is determined that the consumer does not meet the criteria used 

10 Requests made through the telephone notification system before December 1, 2004, expire two years 
after notification unless the consumer revokes the election. 

11 Although opting out eliminates future solicitations based on credit-record information, consumers 
may still receive other types of mail solicitations (not prescreened) from creditors and insurers. In addition, 
consumers may receive advertisements and solicitations (not prescreened) from, for example, local and 
national merchants, religious and charitable organizations, professional and alumni associations, and 
political candidates and parties. To avoid mail from these sources, the consumer would need to contact 
them directly or rely on voluntary, private-sector “do not mail” lists, such as the one maintained by the 
Direct Marketing Association (discussed in more detail below). 


Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 13 

for screening or any applicable criteria bearing on creditworthiness or insurability, or the 
consumer does not furnish required collateral; and (4) the consumer has the right to 
prohibit use of information in the consumer’s file in connection with future prescreened 
offers of credit or insurance by contacting the notification system established by the CRA 
that provided the report. The address and toll-free telephone number of the appropriate 
notification system also must be provided. 

In 2003, section 213 of the Fact Act amended the FCRA concerning disclosures about 
prescreened solicitations. Section 213(a)(2)(B) amends the FCRA to require that the 
notice provided by creditors or insurers with each written unsolicited prescreened offer 
“be presented in such format and in such type size and manner as to be simple and easy to 
understand, as established by the [FTC], by rule, in consultation with the federal banking 
agencies and the National Credit Union Administration.” These rules are to be in place 
by December 4, 2004. Beginning December 1, 2004, section 213(c) of the Fact Act 
extends from two years to five years the effective period of a consumer’s election not to 
receive prescreened solicitations through a telephone notification system described 
above. 

VOLUNTARY MECHANISMS 

The private sector has created voluntary mechanisms for consumers to avoid receiving 
prescreened solicitations in the mail with the goal of satisfying the needs both of 
consumers and of participating companies. Most notably, the Direct Marketing 
Association (DMA) maintains an opt-out list of consumers who have indicated they do 
not wish to receive advertising mail at home.12 The DMA’s Mail Preference Service 
(MPS) allows individuals to opt out of national mailing lists used by companies to 
identify individuals to whom they may send marketing materials. Consumers can 
participate in the system to avoid the receipt of unwanted prescreened solicitations, and 
companies participate to cut marketing expenses and to avoid upsetting consumers who 
have made it known that they do not want to receive prescreened solicitations in the mail. 

All companies that are members of the DMA are required to use the MPS. Members run 
their list of prospective customers against the MPS “do not mail” file to remove these 
individuals from any mailing. The MPS also is made available to nonmembers of the 
DMA, so that these marketers may also take advantage of the service. The DMA updates 
its do-not-mail list monthly, and it is distributed four times per year. The individual’s 
name is maintained on the list for a period of five years. To create a comprehensive opt-
out list, the CRAs add the individuals on the DMA’s do-not-mail list to those who have 
opted out directly with the CRAs. 

12 The DMA is the largest national trade association for the direct marketing industry. For more 
information about its do-not-mail list, see www.dmaconsumers.org/offmailinglist.html.

In addition to the joint opt-out lists established either by law or voluntarily through 
industry effort, many companies have opt-out programs of their own. About one-third of 
industry respondents to the Board’s request for comments on the present study 
specifically mentioned that they maintained an internal list of their own customers who 
specifically requested not to receive further prescreened solicitations. These companies 
indicated that relatively few customers had directly requested that they not receive further 
solicitations.

Extent to Which Consumers Use the Available 
Mechanisms to Avoid Receiving Written Offers 

The second issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is “the 
extent to which consumers are currently utilizing existing statutory and voluntary 
mechanisms to avoid receiving offers of credit or insurance.” 

Little information has been available regarding the frequency at which consumers opt out 
of receiving prescreened solicitations for credit and insurance products using provisions 
in section 604 of the FCRA. Likewise, little information has been available about the 
credit or other characteristics of consumers who have placed their names on the opt-out 
list. To learn more about consumers’ use of consumer credit generally as well as their 
use of the opt-out provision provided by the FCRA, the Board engaged one of the three 
national CRAs to supply the credit records of a large, nationally representative sample of 
individuals as of June 30, 2003. The credit record data include all information found in 
the credit files of the approximately 300,000 individuals in the sample except that they 
exclude all identifying information about the individuals and the creditors. 

The sample data do not contain any addresses of individuals but do include the state, 
county, and census tract location of their residence. This information allows comparisons 
with the 2000 decennial census information on census tract population characteristics 
(such as income and geographic distribution, including urban, suburban, and rural 
delineations) and other regional and state classifications. 

Each credit record in the Board sample contains as many as 350 distinct items describing 
the consumer’s past and ongoing experiences with credit, collection-agency actions, and 
various types of so-called “public records,” which consist of bankruptcies, foreclosures, 
tax liens (local, state, or federal), garnishments, and other civil judgments. Many 
thousands of creditors and other entities reported information contained in the credit 
records, including more than 92,000 reporters overall and 23,600 currently providing 
credit-related data at the time of the sample.13 In the aggregate, the sample contains 
information on about 3.7 million credit accounts, more than 318,000 collection-related 
actions, approximately 65,000 public record actions, and about 913,000 creditor 
inquiries. The credit record of each individual did not necessarily contain each kind of 
information (table 2). 

The sample data also contains credit scores for about 250,000 individuals (about 83 
percent of the sample), each constructed using the CRA’s proprietary credit-risk-scoring 

13 The latter figure is the number of reporters providing information to the CRA within three months of 
the time the sample was drawn.

model as of the date the sample was drawn.14 To facilitate the analysis here, the scores 
received from the CRA were aligned statistically to match the distribution of the more 
familiar FICO score, named for its developer (Fair, Isaac, and Company); information on 
the distribution of FICO scores across the population is readily available.15 About 17 
percent of individuals in the sample were not assigned a credit score by the CRA; the vast 
majority of these individuals either did not have any credit accounts or had credit 
accounts so recently established that the payment history was too new to judge. 

At the request of the Board, the CRA placed an indicator in the record of each individual 
in the sample who had asked by March 2004 to have his or her name placed in the opt-out 

14 The credit score is not part of the credit record of an individual. Rather, upon request by a user of 
the data, such as a prospective creditor or insurer, the CRA calculates the score on the basis of information 
in the credit record.

list maintained by the CRA that supplied the credit records (this list includes requests 
received by the CRA as well as names received from the DMA’s do-not-mail list). 
Combined, the credit record files and the opt-out indicator provide the information 
necessary to measure the extent to which individuals have chosen to opt out and to profile 
the credit and selected individual or neighborhood demographic or locational 
characteristics of such individuals. 

OPTING OUT 

The nationally representative sample indicates that, as of March 2004, about 6 percent of 
all individuals in the country with credit records had chosen to place their names on the 
opt-out list maintained by the national CRAs (table 3). This large number of individuals 
suggests that it is not difficult for individuals to opt out of receiving solicitations.16 

The opt-out percentage includes individuals with a credit record but no credit account. 
Notably, about 12 percent of the individuals in the sample have credit records only 
because of an item reported by a collection agency, such as unpaid bills for medical or 
utility services (table 2). In addition, a very small proportion of individuals have a credit 
record only because of a public-record action, such as a judgment or tax lien, that had 
been reported to the CRAs. If the sample of credit records is limited solely to the 
population of credit-using adults (individuals age 21 and older who have an open credit 
account with a positive balance), the incidence of opting out increases from 6.0 percent to 
9.4 percent (data not shown in table 3). 

WHO CHOOSES TO OPT OUT, AND WHY 

We compared the credit circumstances of individuals who are on the opt-out list 
maintained by the CRAs to those who are not by segmenting the sample in various ways. 
One of the divisions was according to measures of credit (for example, numbers, kinds, 
balances, and utilization of credit accounts).17 A second division was by the summary 
risk measure called a credit score. A third division was by records of serious derogatory 
information, such as collections activity or public-record actions. The remaining 
divisions were by the age of the individual, by state and region of the country where the 

16 In its public comment on the present study, TransUnion, one of the three national CRAs, reported 
that it has 18.7 million consumer names and addresses on its opt-out list, of which about 35 percent arise 
from the DMA do-not-mail list. Some individuals may be double counted because they requested that their 
names be placed on both the DMA and CRA opt-out lists. 

17 Credit card accounts include only those reported to the CRA in the twelve-month period preceding 
the date the survey sample was drawn. The specific sample size differs for each analysis discussed in the 
text because the use of credit varies widely across the population or because information may not have been 
available for some individuals.

individual lives, and by characteristics of the census tract in which the individual lives

Analysis of the sample of credit records indicates that individuals on the opt-out list 
maintained by the national CRAs exhibit credit and personal profiles that differ 
noticeably from other individuals in several dimensions, including some measures of 
credit use and creditworthiness, but not in others. In general, those with greater current 
credit experience (evidenced by numbers of credit accounts, amounts outstanding, or 
available as credit lines) and those who are better credit risks are somewhat more likely 
to opt out. In contrast, those with few credit accounts, smaller outstanding balances, less

which they live are found in appendix B.

credit currently available in terms of additional lines, and greater credit risk are somewhat 
less likely to opt out. 

These findings lend themselves to more than one interpretation. One possibility is that 
those individuals with more credit accounts or exhibiting lower credit risk choose not to 
receive additional prescreened solicitations because they believe that they have enough 
credit sources available. At the same time, those with less credit currently in use or 
exhibiting higher measures of risk may be less interested in cutting off their access to 
more credit. Alternatively, those with more credit and who are better risks may have 
reviewed so many prescreened solicitations that they are simply more likely to have 
observed the opt-out notice and to have acted on it. Of course, these hypotheses are not 
necessarily incompatible; both may be correct to some degree. Furthermore, only a 
minority of individuals in any grouping have placed their names on the opt-out lists 
maintained by the national CRAs (table 3). 

CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO OPT OUT 

Factors related to whether a consumer may opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations 
include the following: number of credit accounts, credit limits and outstanding balances, 
credit scores, presence of a mortgage, collection items and public records, and creditor 
and insurer inquiries. 

Number of Credit Accounts 

Most individuals with credit records have at least one credit account of some type in good 
standing, and more than 40 percent of those with credit accounts have four or more such 
accounts (table 3). Nearly 11 percent of the individuals in the sample with six or more 
active credit accounts have chosen to opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations, 
compared with about 3 percent of those with just one active account and only 1 percent of 
those with no active accounts. A similar pattern is evident with regard to credit card 
accounts. About 11 percent of the individuals with seven or more credit card accounts 
have opted out of further prescreened solicitations compared with about 2 percent of 
those with only one such account and only 1 percent of those with no credit card 
accounts. 

Credit Limits on Revolving Accounts 

The same pattern is again evident when considering the total size of revolving credit 
lines. The similarity is not surprising because the number of credit card accounts, which 
constitute the bulk of revolving-credit lines, is correlated with total credit lines. Issuers 
of credit cards and unsecured personal lines of credit typically restrict the size of the 
credit line to limit the credit risk posed by any given account. Creditors normally report 


24 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

the credit limits established for a revolving account when they report account information 
to CRAs (although not always, particularly in the past). Summing the reported credit 
limits on each revolving account available to an individual gives an estimate of the 
aggregate credit limit on accounts of this type for each individual. In those cases in 
which creditors fail to report the credit limit on the account to the CRA, the typical 
industry practice is to assume that the highest balance ever reported as owed on the 
account is the limit, and that approach is employed here. 

Sorting the opt-out list according to credit limit on revolving accounts shows that about 
13 percent of the individuals in the top quintile of credit-line holders have opted out of 
receiving additional prescreened solicitations. Only 4 percent of individuals with a total 
revolving credit line in the bottom quintile have opted out. 

Total Balances and Utilization Rate on Revolving Accounts 

Another measure of credit availability and use is the amount actually owed on revolving 
credit accounts. In this case, the sample of credit records shows that those in the highest 
quintile of individuals arrayed by balances owed are more likely to opt out of further 
prescreened solicitations than individuals in the lower quintiles. The ratio of balance 
outstanding to the total credit limit for each individual permits construction of an overall 
credit “utilization rate.” When evaluating the credit risk posed by a prospective borrower, 
creditors often consider such a ratio. In this case, the sample data indicate that those 
individuals with utilization ratios in the middle range are about twice as likely to opt out 
as those with ratios at the extremes. Individuals with credit utilization rates in the lowest 
and highest quintiles may desire additional credit opportunities and so they may be less 
likely to opt out. 

Number of Mortgage Accounts 

Credit records also include information on mortgages. The sample data indicate that 
about one-fourth of the individuals represented had a mortgage loan outstanding. About 
11 percent of the individuals with a mortgage in good standing have placed their names 
on the opt-out list, compared with 5 percent among those who do not have such a 
mortgage. 

Credit Score 

Most individuals have good credit histories, as reflected in the distribution of credit 
scores across the population of individuals with credit records (table 3 and figure 2). 
Assuming they satisfy other underwriting requirements, such individuals pose relatively 
little credit risk to prospective lenders. Creditors vary somewhat in the thresholds they 
use to identify individuals who pose relatively little credit risk, but in general those with

credit scores above 660 fall in this group and are frequently referred to as prime 
borrowers. Among individuals assigned credit scores in the Board sample, 73 percent 
had credit scores above 660. 

At the other extreme are individuals who pose relatively high credit risk. Individuals 
with credit scores below 620 are frequently referred to as nonprime or subprime 
borrowers. About 17 percent of the individuals in the sample with credit scores had 
scores of 620 and below. It should be noted that the thresholds used for distinguishing 
individuals who pose higher or lower credit risk vary not only among creditors but also 
across credit types. Secured credit products, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, 
sometimes have different thresholds than unsecured products, such as credit cards. 

According to the sample data, the propensity to opt out varies among individuals arrayed 
by their credit scores. Individuals who opt out tend to have relatively high credit scores; 
the mean and median credit scores for those in the sample who have opted out were 742 
and 765 respectively, compared with 705 and 722 for those who have not opted out (data 
not shown in tables). Moreover, larger proportions of individuals with higher credit 
scores have opted out compared with the proportions with lower scores. Nearly 


26 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

10 percent of individuals with credit scores above 700 have opted out, but only 3 percent 
of those with credit scores below 550 have done so. In the aggregate, 77 percent of all 
individuals who have opted out have credit scores above 700, whereas about 60 percent 
of the entire sample has a credit score in that elevated range. Almost 88 percent of all 
individuals who have opted out may be considered prime borrowers (credit scores above 
660), whereas about 73 percent of all individuals in the sample are in that category. 

As noted, not every individual in the Board sample of credit records has a credit score. 
Of the individuals who were not scored (mostly because of a sparse credit history), only 
0.2 percent opted out, compared with 7.6 percent of the scored individuals. The lower 
incidence of opting out among the individuals without credit scores may simply indicate 
that these individuals receive and review fewer prescreened solicitations and hence may 
have fewer opportunities to become aware of the opt-out option. Alternatively, such 
individuals may be relatively more interested in building their credit records by obtaining 
new credit and may be less interested in pursuing the opt-out option. 

Number of Collection Items and Public Records 

The number of collection items in an individual’s credit record is an important indicator 
of credit risk. More than one-third of the individuals in the sample data had one or more 
collection items in their credit records; these individuals are somewhat more likely to opt 
out than individuals with no reported collection actions—7.3 percent versus 5.8 percent. 

The number of public records in an individual’s credit record is also an important 
indicator of credit risk. Most individuals in the sample (88 percent) did not have any 
public-record actions in their credit records. The sample data indicate that individuals 
with one or more records of a public action are somewhat more likely to opt out than 
other individuals, but the difference is not particularly large—7.3 percent versus 6.2 
percent. 

Number of Recent Inquiries about Credit or Insurance 

Finally, credit records contain data on inquiries made about an individual’s credit 
circumstances. The information includes the identities of firms or individuals who 
request such information (for example, landlords or prospective employers), the date of 
the inquiry, and an indication of the purpose of the inquiry. Most inquiries arise when an 
individual is seeking credit and the prospective creditor or insurer contacts a CRA about 
the individual’s current credit status. 

Not every use of a credit file results in a lasting record of an inquiry. For example, only 
inquiries made over the previous two years are included in credit records. In addition, 
inquiries made in the course of sending prescreened solicitations or to monitor existing 
account relationships do not appear on the credit report used for prescreening. Also not 


Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 27 

appearing on the report used for prescreening are individuals’ requests for copies of their 
own reports. 

About 80 percent of the individuals in the sample had a record in their credit file of one 
or more inquiries over the past year; about 11 percent of the individuals had six or more 
inquiries. Available evidence suggests that the number of inquiries recorded in an 
individual’s credit record is largely unrelated to propensity to opt out of further 
prescreened solicitations. For example, 7.9 percent of those who had more than six 
inquiries recorded in their file over the past year opted out, compared with about 7.4 
percent of the individuals with no record of an inquiry over this period. 

LOCATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO OPT OUT 

Information in the sample data on place of residence allows examination of the 
propensity to opt out by region of the country and by state. By region (Northeast, 
Midwest, South, and West, each also with subregions), the sample data indicate little 
difference in the propensity to opt out. Individuals residing in the West have the highest 
incidence of opting out (7 percent), and those residing in the South have the lowest (5.7 
percent). Among the subregions, the West North Central and Mountain areas have the 
highest opt out rate (about 8 percent of the individuals with credit records) and the East 
South Central and West South Central areas have the lowest rate of opting out (5 percent 
of the individuals). As with the regions, the states vary in the propensity of individuals to 
opt out. Residents of Missouri and Colorado have the highest rate of opting out, while 
residents of West Virginia and Arkansas have the lowest rates.

Benefits of Receiving Written Offers 
of Credit or Insurance 

The third issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is “the 
benefits provided to consumers as a result of receiving written offers of credit or 
insurance.” 

GREATER AVAILABILITY OF TARGETED PRICING 
AND PRODUCT INFORMATION 

Prescreened solicitations significantly benefit consumers by providing them with ready 
access to product information on credit and insurance products for which they likely 
qualify. Thus, prescreened offers help consumers by greatly reducing the time and effort 
necessary for shopping for these products. Also, the widespread dissemination of pricing 
and product information contained in prescreened offers helps to make markets for these 
products more competitive, a result that benefits all consumers whether or not they 
engage in extensive shopping themselves. 

Theoretical developments in economics known as the economics of information have 
demonstrated the importance of information for the effective and efficient functioning of 
product markets and for enhancing competition. One of the important insights from this 
comparatively new branch of economic theory is that advertising can contribute to the 
competitiveness of markets for consumer products by substituting for substantial amounts 
of consumer shopping.19 This is especially true for the advertising of product pricing, but 
it is also true for the advertising of product quality despite the greater difficulty of 
establishing credible advertising in that area.20 

Most consumers probably realize that more shopping would be useful in obtaining the 
lowest available price for their purchases. But aside from new clothing, automobiles, 
some appliances, antiques and collectibles, and some other items, additional shopping for 
most products and services is simply too time consuming and burdensome for many 
consumers relative to the potential benefit. Under these circumstances, advertising can 
reduce shopping costs if it brings the relevant information to consumers in a way that is 
less burdensome to them than looking for it on their own. For straightforward products 
without extensive quality differentiations, widespread availability of price and product

Journal of Political Economy, vol. 69 (June), pp. 213-25. 

20 The relationship of information flows and product quality is treated extensively in Joseph E. Stiglitz 
(1987), “The Causes and Consequences of the Dependence of Quality on Price,” Journal of Economic 
Literature, vol. 25 (March), pp. 1-48.

information can improve the competitiveness of markets to the benefit of all buyers, 
whether they engage in extensive shopping themselves or not. 

Probably few consumer products better illustrate the potential benefits of price and 
product advertising than credit cards. Credit cards likely are not among the products 
consumers enjoy shopping for; rather, in most cases, they are probably closer to the other 
end of this spectrum. But, credit cards are relatively simple products that can be 
compared fairly easily across brands. They have few major differentiating dimensions 
and pricing appears to be the information of greatest interest among potential users.21 

These characteristics suggest the usefulness both of price lists and of disclosures for 
simplifying comparisons, and the Congress has already included provisions in the Truth 
in Lending Act to provide statutory requirements in each area.22 

PRESCREENING AND SHOPPING 

Prescreened solicitations based on CRA records provide price and product information to 
the marketplace in vast quantities tailored and provided directly to consumers who might 
use the products. Consumers receive billions of tailored prescreened solicitations yearly. 

For credit cards, each prescreened solicitation contains pricing information in a tabular 
form in a type size and format that is easy to read and consistent across providers. In this 
way, credit card solicitations are much different from the advertising typical for many 
products, which focuses on brand awareness or on product features other than price. The 
pricing information in prescreened solicitations is tailored to the risk profile of the 
consumer receiving the solicitation. If a consumer’s profile changes over time for the 
better, the next set of prescreened offerings should reflect the change through an offering 
at a lower price. Because of this tailored pricing information, prescreened solicitations 
for credit cards can supplement, and even take the place of, a large amount of consumer 
shopping for this product, lowering the potential burden to consumers of this volume of 
unattractive shopping. This possible reduction in shopping costs, along with the 
widespread dissemination of pricing and product information contained in prescreened 
offers, may help to make markets for credit cards more competitive. 

21 See Thomas A. Durkin (2002), “Consumers and Credit Disclosures: Credit Cards and Credit 
Insurance,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 88 (April), pp. 201-13. 

22 The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988 amended the Truth in Lending Act to 
require the Board to semiannually survey credit-card rates and terms at 150 financial institutions, including 
the 25 largest issuers, and to provide the results to the Congress and the public (see Truth in Lending Act, 
section 136; and “Survey of Credit Card Plans,” www.federalreserve.gov/pubs.shop/survey.htm). The Fair 
Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act also required that solicitations mailed to consumers or applications 
to open a credit card or charge card account provide several disclosures, including the annual percentage 
rate or rates on the account in a tabular format (see Truth in Lending Act, section 122; and Regulation Z, 12 
C.F.R. 226.5a(a)(2)(i) and appendix G). 


30 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

This theory of a competitive market may help put into perspective the often-cited decline 
in consumer response to the prescreened solicitations for credit cards: one interpretation 
is lack of interest among consumers, but another is that as consumers have continued to 
receive information, markets have become more competitive and consumers are thus less 
frequently receiving offers that are better than their current arrangements. The latter 
possibility is hardly bad for consumers. Although one cannot attribute all changes in 
credit card markets in recent years to the greater availability of information, evidence 
suggests both that many consumers notice the information and that markets have become 
more competitive over time. 

For insurance, the benefits of prescreened solicitations in providing additional 
information to consumers and reducing shopping costs are similar to those for credit 
cards. However, insurance sales typically require an extra step before the benefits can be 
fully realized. Prescreened solicitations for insurance generally do not contain complete 
pricing information tailored to a consumer because it is difficult to set the price of 
insurance solely based on information in CRA files. Specifically, prescreening using 
CRA files reveals something about the creditworthiness of individuals (maybe because it 
reveals something about the reliability of the insured), but it does not reveal any 
information about the property or life to be insured. The insurance company must obtain 
that information through some sort of further contact with the recipient of a prescreened 
solicitation before the underlying insurance price can be specified completely. 
Nonetheless, prescreened solicitations for insurance do provide a point of contact 
between insurance companies actively trying to expand their business and the potential 
customers receiving the solicitations. 

CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WITH PRESCREENED SOLICITATIONS 

To learn more about consumer awareness, attitudes, and responses to prescreened 
solicitations, the Board sponsored a nationwide survey in which consumers were asked a 
series of questions on these topics. About 77 percent of respondents held one or more 
credit cards when interviewed, and 23 percent held none (table 4). Among those with 
credit cards, 95 percent had a general-purpose credit card with a revolving feature, such 
as Discover, MasterCard, Optima, or Visa (data not in table). 

The survey showed that the majority of consumers both with and without credit cards had 
received prescreened solicitations in the mail for credit card accounts in the previous six 
months, although the proportions who received prescreened solicitations differed 
somewhat between the groups. More than 96 percent of those with credit cards had 
received prescreened solicitations for additional or replacement cards in the six months 
preceding the survey, compared with 81 percent of those with no cards. The numbers of 
prescreened solicitations received also varied between the groups, but most of the 
respondents in both groups reported receiving multiple prescreened solicitations per 
month. More than half of the group already holding cards and more than 30 percent of 
those without cards reported receiving six or more prescreened solicitations per month

over the preceding six months. Only a small proportion of either group reported that the 
number of prescreened solicitations received per month during this period was one or 
zero. 

The survey also asked respondents about opting out of prescreened solicitations. About 
21 percent of respondents who have a credit card had heard of the opt-out law, and about 
20 percent of that group chose to opt out. Multiplying these proportions yields about 4 
percent of respondents with credit cards who said they had placed their names on the opt-
out list. Likewise about 17 percent of respondents who do not have a credit card had 
heard of the opt-out law, and about 33 percent of that small group chose to opt out. 
Multiplying these proportions yields about 5 percent of respondents without credit cards 
who said they had opted out. An opt-out rate of 4–5 percent is approximately the same 
(small) proportion of opt outs indicated by the CRA files. Because the survey found that 
only about 20 percent of consumers are aware of their right under federal law not to 
receive prescreened solicitations, it seems that if awareness of this right were higher, 
more consumers would opt out. 

For consumers who are aware of the law, a larger proportion of those with credit cards 
than those without credit cards (38 percent versus 14 percent) said that they had thought 
about placing their names on the list but had not yet done so. Although thinking about an 
action is not the same as undertaking it, this outcome is not inconsistent with the finding 


32 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

from the CRA reports that those with more credit experience are more likely to be 
involved in the opt-out process than those with less credit experience. 

Consumers in the group who said they had heard of the federal law were asked further 
how they had heard of the law. Most responses mentioned their information was from 
television, newspapers, and magazines. Some consumers also mentioned family, 
acquaintances, and other sources. Less than 10 percent of those with credit cards and 
aware of the law indicated that they learned about the opt-out possibility from the 
prescreened solicitation itself (data not in table). 

The survey also asked those respondents with general-purpose credit cards who had 
received prescreened solicitations for more information about their experiences with the 
mailings they had received.23 One question asked whether the information contained in 
the mailings was helpful. About 9 percent of the respondents to this question indicated 
they did not know, and so it seems probable they did not pay very much attention to the 
information (table 5). The rest of the respondents were close to evenly divided on 
whether the information received was helpful (about 40 percent) or not (just under 50 
percent). Within the groups, a much higher proportion of the negative responders took 
the more extreme position that it was very unhelpful, probably indicating an expression 
of frustration with receiving so much “junk mail.” Regardless, the finding that a 
significant portion of consumers appeared to be generally familiar with the kind of 
information in the prescreened solicitations is consistent with the view that prevalence of 
prescreened solicitations is useful in disseminating pricing information and encouraging 
competitive conditions in markets for credit cards generally, even if only a small minority 
of recipients actually respond to a given prescreened solicitation program. 

For those respondents who said that the information was helpful, a follow-up question 
asked what specific information was helpful. Nearly 70 percent mentioned interest rates 
or annual percentage rates (table 5). Some noted information about particular rate 
features, for example, introductory rates or standard rates. About 35 percent of the 
respondents specifically mentioned various fees such as annual fees, balance transfer 
fees, and late fees. All of this again suggests that many consumers seem to know what 
the prescreened solicitations contain, which is important for price competition to work, 
even if they do not respond to, or even focus very carefully on, the contents of any given 
piece of mail that they receive from card issuers.24 

23 The survey design did not contemplate asking those without general-purpose credit cards many 
follow-up questions about their experiences with solicitations because the small sample size of this group in 
the nationally representative survey would not permit much further breakdown of their experiences. 

24 A follow-up question asked both those who said the information was helpful and those who said it 
was not how it could be made more helpful. Respondents gave a wide variety of answers, but those already 
favorably inclined toward the information more often suggested aspects of format and clarity (data not in 
table). Those unfavorably inclined indicated more often either that they did not know how the information 
could be improved, or just said fewer mailings should be sent. The latter group just seemed more frustrated 
with the frequency of “junk mail,” likely because they were not looking for any more credit cards.

Another question asked consumers what they actually do most often with the mailings 
they receive. Responses indicate that the mailings are not solely or always considered 
“junk mail,” even if they are so regarded in many instances. About 55 percent said that 
they throw them away, but the others said that they open them and that they look at them, 
although not especially carefully (table 5). The respondents who said that they usually 
opened the prescreened solicitations were asked whether they looked for any particular 
information, and if so, what information. Among those who usually opened the 
prescreened solicitations, about 68 percent provided a variety of answers that mostly 
concerned pricing (data not in table). The remainder indicated that there was nothing in 
particular they looked for. Again, while it appears that the strong attitude toward the 
solicitations as “junk mail” leads most respondents to throw them away unopened, it also 
appears that nearly half of consumers are clearly aware of the contents of the mailings 
they receive. In other words, they have direct access to pricing and product information 
at a time when they can make a decision.25 

In sum, most consumers receive written offers of credit or insurance, and a significant 
portion appeared to be at least somewhat familiar with the contents of the mailings, 
including a minority who were aware of the opt-out notice. Only a relatively small 
proportion acted on the opt-out information and had their names placed on the opt-out list 
maintained by the CRAs. 

COMPETITION 

One cannot demonstrate conclusively that prescreened solicitations have had an effect on 
the competitiveness of markets for credit cards, but the available evidence is consistent 
with this hypothesis. Consider, for example, the uptrend in the volume of credit card 
prescreened solicitations seeking to attract or retain customers through offers of reduced 
interest rates and additional credit availability (see figure 1). Importantly for consumers, 
annual percentage rates on credit card accounts have fallen over the past fifteen years. 
Data from the Board’s reporting series FR2835 indicate that credit card interest rates fell 
sharply from mid-1991 through early 1994, after being relatively stable for most of the 
previous twenty years, and they fell again over the period 1998-2003.26 The decline in 
rates from mid-1991 is the result of many factors, including the continued advancement 
of data processing, communications technology, and credit evaluation methods such as 
credit scoring, and the sharp drop in card issuers’ costs of funds during this period. But it 
also seems likely that competitive factors were important in passing production and 
financing-cost savings through to customers. In 1990, only 6 percent of credit card 

25 Responses to a further question in the survey revealed that about 9 percent of those with general-
purpose credit cards who received solicitations in the past six months had responded to a solicitation from 
some card issuer during that time period (data not in table).

balances were on cards carrying rates of less than 16.5 percent; by 2002, that proportion 
was more than 70 percent (figure 3). 

Furthermore, during the past decade, when prescreening has been most prevalent in the 
credit card industry, the trade press has reported that large competitors have been active 
in purchasing any available portfolios of card-related receivables. While on its face this 
might appear to be an action consistent with a reduction in competition, the portfolios 
have tended to gravitate toward the most aggressively competitive firms in the industry. 
Furthermore, these purchases have taken place at a time when there are still hundreds of 
active market participants, including dozens of large ones.27 

In the area of insurance, the entry into the marketplace of direct issuers (firms that do not 
rely on agents) who rely heavily on mailed prescreened solicitations for new business 
undoubtedly has enhanced competition and provided new opportunities for consumers. 
To the extent that consumers find this alternative attractive, other market participants 
must respond in order to maintain competitive viability. 

CONSUMERS BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS OF CREDITORS AND INSURERS 

As discussed above, many companies that solicit new credit accounts and insurance 
policies have found prescreening to be a cost-effective way to identify those potential 
consumers who are likely prospects for the products they offer and to control certain risks 
related to offering these products. In a competitive market, cost savings for creditors and 
insurers translates into lower product prices, a greater range of choices, and wider 
availability of credit or insurance for consumers, including those traditionally 
underserved. 

Because it lowers the costs of soliciting new customers, prescreening also gives even 
small companies the ability to make credit and insurance available to consumers over a 
wider geographic area. Such activities can spur competition in local markets. 

27 The Board’s most recent report on the profitability of credit card plans reveals that twenty-two large 
credit card banks (assets of more than $200 million) together held about 68 percent of bank-type credit card 
credit outstanding (either directly or securitized) at year end 2003. This ratio does not indicate an 
especially high concentration when compared with that of many other industries. Return on assets for these 
specialized institutions is higher than for banks as a whole, but the difference is likely due in part to the 
undiversified nature of their assets by product line (Board of Governors, The Profitability of Credit Card 
Operations of Depository Institutions).

Costs of Receiving Written Offers 
of Credit or Insurance 

The fourth issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is 
“whether consumers incur significant costs or are otherwise adversely affected by the 
receipt of written offers of credit or insurance.” 

A review of congressional testimony, examination of available studies, discussion with 
interested parties including members of the Federal Reserve Board’s Consumer Advisory 
Council, and a review of public comments submitted on the present study indicate that 
four costs or problem areas for consumers have been identified in regard to prescreened 
offers of credit or insurance: (1) inconvenience, (2) the potential for identity theft, (3) 
privacy implications, and (4) debt burden. 

INCONVENIENCE 

First, but probably least consequential among the four costs or problem areas, is the 
inconvenience for some consumers arising from receiving unwanted prescreened 
solicitations for insurance and credit, especially credit card accounts resulting from 
marketing campaigns relying on prescreening. As noted above, in 2001-02 unsolicited 
mailings to consumers of offers of credit cards reached 4 to 5 billion pieces annually. 
Not at all clear, however, is whether the number of mailings would decline significantly, 
or the need for consumers to dispose of mailings they do not want would diminish (the 
major element of the inconvenience), if prescreening were not available. 

If prescreening were not allowed, credit card companies and other creditors, as well as 
insurance companies, might well switch a greater portion of their marketing effort to 
other sorts of purchased mailing lists that did not involve prescreening. This likely would 
lose many of the efficiencies of prescreened mailings discussed above and employ greater 
amounts of less-efficient post-screening. A reduced ability to target solicitations to 
qualified consumers might well lead to a larger number of mailings and might not be any 
less inconvenient for consumers now concerned about receiving too much “junk mail.” 

Nonetheless, the consumer survey asked some questions to find out a bit more about 
consumers’ overall attitudes toward the availability of prescreened solicitation programs. 
Following questions about voluntarily placing their name on an opt-out list, all 
respondents (whether or not they had credit cards) were asked for their views concerning 
government intervention in this area. The questions focused on whether they believed an 


38 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

opt-out law was a good approach and whether they thought the government should ban 
prescreened solicitations.28 

Responses to these questions exhibit a distinct preference among consumers for the 
presence of an opt-out law, even if most do not personally employ it, but also for the 
government not to decide whether they opt out. About 80 percent of respondents said it 
is a good idea that there is a federal law permitting opting out, with the proportion 
somewhat higher among card holders than others (table 6). But about 65 percent of 
respondents indicated that they do not prefer that the government prohibit prescreened 
solicitations, even after a majority indicated they do not open and peruse the prescreened 
solicitations they receive. Again, this proportion is higher among those with credit cards.

federal law that permits you to put your name on a list and then credit card companies cannot send you 
these offers?” This question was followed immediately by a related question, “Do you think the 
government should prohibit credit card companies from sending pre-approved offers for credit cards?”

These findings suggest that the inconvenience associated with receiving mailings is, 
overall, not especially great for consumers, even though they apparently frequently 
consider the mailings “junk mail.” Although credit card holders are most likely to 
receive prescreened solicitations for additional credit cards, and they are more likely than 
those without cards to say that an opt-out list is a good idea, they largely do not believe 
that government should eliminate the availability of such solicitations. Presumably this 
feeling is associated with the view that information about new products, features, and 
pricing is something that is worthwhile, even if only occasionally used. Although most 
consumers appear to prefer the availability of an opt-out list, they also appear to prefer 
that they decide the opt-out question for themselves rather than have the government ban 
the solicitations altogether. 

THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT 

Second, and potentially much more consequential regarding the costs of prescreened 
solicitations, is the issue of identity theft. Theft of individuals’ identifying information, 
including bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and credit information, and 
use of the information for fraudulent activities has become a major issue for law 
enforcement. Crimes of this sort have become prevalent enough and of sufficient 
concern that identity theft has become the recent focus of legislative activity at both the 
federal and state levels. Indeed, title I of the Fact Act is “Identity Theft Prevention and 
Credit History Restoration,” and fighting identity theft was one of the motivating factors 
for passage of the act. In 2004, less than seven months after passage of the Fact Act, the 
Congress turned again to identity theft with passage of the Identity Theft Penalty 
Enhancement Act. The latter legislation establishes a new federal crime of “aggravated 
identity theft” for certain kinds of identity-related criminal activity and specifies 
penalties. 

Although identity theft has become a major public issue and is costly to consumers and 
the economic system generally, a complete review of its causes, consequences, and 
prevention is beyond the scope of this study, which involves only unsolicited written 
offers of credit and insurance. Nonetheless, because some observers connect prescreened 
offers with the possibility of identity theft, some examination is warranted. 
Consequently, this section looks at congressional testimony on the subject along with a 
review of studies done by others, public comments, and findings on the subject from the 
consumer survey. 

Definition of Identity Theft 

The definition of identity theft has varied among observers of financial institutions and 
others interested in the question. The significance of these variations was evident at a 
February 2004 one-day conference in Philadelphia on the problem of identity theft, which 


40 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

devoted one of its five sessions to the question of defining identity theft.29 Variations in 
the definition of identity theft result in varying assessments of its frequency and 
significance. 

Discussions at the Philadelphia conference showed that law enforcement agencies usually 
employ what might be called a broad definition of identity theft. Such a definition 
encompasses any misconduct in the use of a consumer’s identifying information, 
including the theft or misuse of credit cards or card numbers, but it also includes frauds 
involving employment, government documents, and telecommunications and utilities. 
Under a definition of this kind, frauds arising from lost credit cards, inappropriate use of 
credit cards by relatives, or even the use of cards after a wallet theft or purse snatching 
could be considered identity theft. For law enforcement agencies, credit card fraud is 
sometimes associated with a violent robbery but usually not, and the subtleties of a 
narrower definition of identity theft are not typically necessary for their purposes. 

In contrast, financial institutions often use a narrower definition of identity theft that 
focuses on the acquisition of new credit accounts or the takeover of existing accounts by, 
for example, making unauthorized changes to the addresses on accounts and applying for 
new credit cards or personal identification numbers (PINs). Under this narrower 
definition, traditional payment fraud, such as fraud resulting from lost, stolen, or misused 
credit cards or card numbers, is not identity theft. Financial institutions prefer this 
narrower definition because their security forces and procedures employ different fraud-
prevention techniques to counteract different types of fraud-related behaviors. For 
financial institutions and their security officials, preventing “identity theft” under their 
definition involves controls on procedures when opening new accounts or changing 
consumer information such as addresses on existing accounts. On the other hand, 
traditional payment fraud is controlled by other means, such as requiring PINs at 
automated teller machines or using computer programs to monitor accounts for signs of 
unusual activity. 

Attending to the details of the definition are important because the different definitions 
produce substantially different estimates of the volume of identity theft. The Consumer 
Sentinel database developed and maintained by the FTC makes available to law 
enforcement agencies complaints about fraudulent activities received by the FTC and 
more than 100 other organizations.30 Under a broad definition of identity theft, this 
source suggests that about 42 percent of complaints of fraud posted to the database in 
2003 consisted of identity theft. The majority of these involved telephone or utilities 
fraud, employment fraud, government documents fraud, and other bank fraud. The 

29 The February 10, 2004, conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, entitled “Identity 
Theft: Where Do We Go From Here?” was sponsored by the Payment Cards Center of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia and the Gartner Fellows Program; for a summary of the conference, see Julia S. 
Cheney (2004), “Identity Theft: Where Do We Go From Here?” conference summary, Payment Cards

Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 41 

database characterized about 8 percent of the total of cases received as “new account” 
credit card fraud.31 This smaller number is closer to the narrow definition of identity 
theft used by financial institutions. 

Another study released by the FTC contains some estimates of the absolute magnitude of 
identity theft.32 Using a nationwide consumer survey, the FTC found that about 1.5 
percent of respondents said that they had been victims of new-account and other sorts of 
identity fraud in the past year. The cases included misuse of identifying information 
when someone is charged with a crime, for renting an apartment, or when obtaining 
medical care, and excluded the misuse of credit card numbers on existing accounts. 
However, the incidence of fraud rose to 4.7 percent of respondents when the previous 
five years are included. According to the study, 4.7 percent represents about 10 million 
individuals, not all of them, of course, victims of credit card fraud.33 Some of them 
experienced more than one type of identity theft over this period, and the survey results 
refer to the most serious incident reported. 

Prescreening and Identity Theft 

For the purposes of this report, the question is not how much identity theft occurs but 
rather how much is due to crimes involving prescreened solicitations for new accounts. 
There is only very limited specific information available about this volume, but it seems 
that, for a number of reasons, identity theft crimes arising from prescreened solicitations 
account for only a small amount of identity theft under either a broad or narrow definition 
of the crime. 

First, prescreened solicitations typically do not contain information of a sensitive nature 
that would be useful to a thief. The primary information that would become available to 
a thief is the recipient’s name and mailing address, along with, of course, the information 
that the intended recipient is considered creditworthy by someone. The recipient’s name 
and address are available from many sources, including the telephone book, mailing lists, 
the Internet, and even other mail that might also be stolen, including such mundane items 
as bills, newspapers, and magazines. In addition, evidence of creditworthiness is less 
than a striking revelation about most members of the population because most are 
creditworthy to some degree.34 

31 Federal Trade Commission, National and State Trends, p. 10. Nineteen percent of 42 percent equals 
about 8 percent. 

32 Federal Trade Commission (2003), Identity Theft Survey Report (Washington: FTC, September). 
33 This study separates crimes involving existing credit card accounts from other cases of identity 

fraud, but it does not specifically identify fraud involving new credit card accounts. 
34 The consumer survey results discussed above suggest that as many as 85 percent of households are 

sufficiently creditworthy to receive prescreened solicitations for credit cards. Some of the remainder have 
opted out. As noted earlier, credit scores indicate that more than 73 percent of consumers in the Board 
sample of credit reports would be regarded prime borrowers in many credit programs. 


42 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

Second, the fraud control systems of the card issuers work best for situations, such as 
those related to prescreened solicitations, in which the card issuer already knows a bit 
about the customer and can use this information to help with verification of responses to 
the solicitation.35 If, for example, a thief steals a prescreened solicitation and sends a 
false response to the card issuer, the incoming returned document still faces a variety of 
fraud controls, including the requirement that activation of the card be completed with a 
call from the home telephone. In particular, if the thief requests a change of address to 
complete the theft, the returned solicitation is automatically directed to fraud control, 
since it exhibits characteristics that raise concerns. The card issuing firm may still 
eventually issue the card, but not without further screening that often includes manual 
checking of the address change request by telephone or other means out of the control of 
the potential thief. 

Such control systems apparently are a large part of the reason why card issuers estimate 
that only a small portion of credit card fraud arises from prescreened solicitations. There 
is almost no publicly available information about the volume of losses arising from 
prescreened solicitations, but information that is available suggests the total is 
comparatively small. According to a report of an interview with a large card issuer, 
“prescreening has the lowest incidence rate of application fraud versus other application 
channels.” This issuer told the Information Policy Institute that the fraudulent use of 
prescreened solicitations “accounts for less than 20 percent of identity theft losses at the 
company, which in turn constitute only a small fraction of its total fraud losses.” 
According to the issuer, most application fraud involving prescreened offers is committed 
by “someone familiar to the victim,” such as a family member or relative.36 The 
Information Policy Institute concludes that limitations on prescreening as a method of 
new account acquisition likely will increase identity theft because prescreening is now 
such an important channel for acquiring new accounts, and other acquisition channels are 
associated with greater amounts of identity theft than prescreened solicitations.37 

In congressional testimony on June 19, 2003, an executive at Chase Cardmember 
Services documented the infrequent nature of identity theft associated with prescreened 
solicitations and some of the reasons for its infrequency.38 According to Chase, identity 
theft that “involves the unlawful acquisition and use of another person’s information to 
obtain credit, or the use of that information to create a fictitious identity to establish an 
account” amounts to only about 3 percent of their fraud cases. Closely related account-
takeover fraud amounts to about 1 percent of their fraud cases.39 

35 A flow chart of the entire process associated with a prescreened solicitation program appears in 
Information Policy Institute, The Fair Credit Reporting Act, appendix F, pp. 91-93.

Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 43 

To complete a fraudulent application, a potential thief would also need not only name and 
address but also certain unique identifiers such as mother’s maiden name, Social Security 
number, and other information such as mortgage payments. According to Chase, the 
need for personal information is the reason that 40 percent of the small proportion of such 
cases arises from persons familiar to the victim, often family members or those in 
positions of trust. For the company, identity theft involving prescreened accounts 
amounted to 600 out of 75,000 fraud cases in 2002 (less than 1 percent) and out of 17 
million active card accounts (less than 0.004 percent). The 600 cases in 2002 were less 
than 0.04 percent of the 1.6 million new accounts opened by Chase that year through 
prescreened solicitations.40 

Although such evidence shows that fraud of this sort exists, it also suggests that the 
incidence is relatively small because there are means to contain it, and much of the 
remainder arises from family members or associates, who are difficult to control. It does 
not seem that the existence of prescreened solicitations is likely to make the identity theft 
situation noticeably worse. It would be easy enough for someone familiar with the 
victim’s identity information, such as a disgruntled family member or dedicated thief, to 
apply for credit using a false identity through normal “take one” brochures or Internet 
channels without waiting for a prescreened mailing, which does not contain much 
identifying information anyway. As the testimony of Chase pointed out, most identity 
thieves are not going to take the approach of submitting an application subject to 
verification of information that is generally not easily available to thieves who are not 
family members. 

Also, the Fact Act contains two provisions dealing with prescreened solicitations that are 
designed, at least in part, to address identify theft issues. First, if a consumer places an 
extended fraud alert in his or her file at a CRA, the CRA must exclude the consumer from 
prescreened lists for five years, unless the consumer requests otherwise. Second, if a 
consumer places an active-duty military alert in his or her file at a CRA, the CRA must 
exclude that consumer from prescreened lists for two years, unless the consumer requests 
otherwise. 

PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS 

Third among potential consumer costs associated with prescreening are the privacy 
implications of prescreened solicitations. Some consumers may be concerned that 
creditors or insurers may have access to the consumer’s financial information held by 
CRAs before the consumer has indicated an interest in a creditor’s or insurer’s products. 
Consumers also may be concerned that once creditors or insurers obtain this financial 
information, these creditors or insurers may use the information for inappropriate 
purposes or share the information with other parties. As with inconvenience, however, 

40 Cunningham, “Statement,” p. 100. 


44 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

prescreened solicitations do not appear to raise substantial privacy problems for a number 
of reasons, and for those especially concerned with privacy, opting out seems easy 
enough, as discussed previously, and provides an effective means for consumers to act on 
their concerns. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act itself contains several provisions designed, at least in part, 
to address privacy concerns related to prescreened solicitations. Most important, under 
the FCRA, consumers have the right to opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations if 
they do not want their consumer report information to be used for prescreening purposes. 
And, under the FCRA, creditors and insurers must inform consumers of this opt-out right 
in each prescreened solicitation they send out. 

For consumers who do not opt out, creditors and insurers have only limited access to 
information in CRA files at the prescreening phase: (1) the name and address of the 
consumer, (2) an identifier that is not unique to the consumer and that is used by the 
person solely for the purpose of verifying the identity of the consumer (such as a partial 
social security number), and (3) other information about the consumer that does not 
identify the relationship or experience of the consumer with a particular creditor or other 
entity. Also, the creditor or insurer would know that each consumer on the list at least 
meets the credit criteria used to generate the prescreened list but would not receive a 
consumer’s specific credit information, such as a credit score, from the CRA as part of 
the prescreening process. 

Creditors or insurers may use the limited information that they receive from the CRAs (as 
described above) for the purpose of providing a “firm” offer of credit or insurance to the 
consumer and verifying information provided by the consumer if the consumer responds 
to the prescreened solicitation. The creditor or insurer generally may not use that 
information for other marketing purposes. 

Creditors or insurers generally do not share information received from CRAs with parties 
that are not affiliated with the creditors or insurers. If they shared this information with 
such nonaffiliated third parties, they would run the risk of becoming a “consumer 
reporting agency” under the FCRA, and most creditors and insurers do not want to be 
regulated as CRAs. Also, creditors or insurers may share consumer report information 
about a consumer received from CRAs with companies that are affiliated with the 
creditors or insurers, but they may do so only if the creditors or insurers provide the 
consumer an opportunity to opt out of the sharing and then only if the consumer does not 
opt out. Again, creditors and insurers provide this opt out before sharing such 
information to avoid the risk of becoming CRAs. 

DEBT BURDEN 

Finally, some observers suggest that prescreening can lead to overburdening of 
consumers with debt. As with any advertising campaign, the goal of credit solicitation is 


Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 45 

to sell more products, and, as with any advertising campaign, there is the chance that it 
will be successful. A number of pieces of evidence suggest that prescreened solicitations 
for credit cards or other forms of credit have not caused excessive indebtedness among 
large segments of the public (although there likely are individuals who have been so 
affected by prescreened solicitations). 

One piece of evidence is that a large element of competition in the credit area in recent 
years has consisted of attempts by lenders to take borrowers from other lenders rather 
than to add to debt levels. An example of these attempts is the widespread and important 
marketing approach of offering balance transfers at low annual percentage rates on credit 
cards. A switch in credit source brought about by a balance transfer does not, by itself, 
produce an increase in total indebtedness. 

Second, most prescreened solicitations are unproductive, as evidenced by recent response 
rates of about 0.5 percent for a given campaign (figure 1). Consumer survey results 
indicate that only about 6 percent of consumers had responded to a solicitation for a new 
or replacement card in the previous six months, and probably only a fraction of those 
were in any debt difficulty sufficient to cause payment problems, because in that case 
such consumers would not likely have received prescreened solicitations. As mentioned 
previously, low solicitation acceptance rates do not mean that the wide circulation of 
pricing and product information due to these programs is not useful in promoting 
competition; but it does cast some doubt on the hypothesis that the solicitations, by 
themselves, result in widespread overindebtedness. Although some cases of consumer 
overindebtedness arising from solicitations for new credit accounts undoubtedly occur, it 
is not clear that the elimination of prescreened solicitations would meaningfully reduce 
the current incidence of overindebtedness. 

Furthermore, the relationship of required debt service and financial obligations to income 
does not suggest that the burden in these areas has increased in recent years as much as is 
sometimes believed. The Federal Reserve Board regularly estimates the aggregate 
consumer debt service ratio and the broader financial obligations ratio. These ratios 
represent aggregates and do not necessarily indicate the experience of the typical 
household. Although the trend in the ratios in recent years has been upward, they have 
fluctuated within only a few percentage points over the past fifteen years and, as of mid-
2004 were not at their highest levels.41 However, a rise in the proportion of households 
filing for bankruptcy over the same period indicates increasing difficulties among some 
consumers in managing their debts in the face of changing personal circumstances such 
as loss of employment. 

Finally, results of the present study’s survey of consumers reveal that some of the anxiety 
about overindebtedness appears to arise from consumers’ concerns about the

obligations, see Karen Dynan, Kathleen Johnson, and Karen Pence (2003), “Recent Changes to a Measure 
of U.S. Household Debt Service,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 89 (October), pp. 417-26.

hypothesized experiences of unknown others rather than from these consumers’ actual 
experiences. To probe this issue, respondents were asked whether written offers of credit 
caused others to use too much credit. About 85 percent of respondents indicated that it 
did. In contrast, when asked the same question about themselves, the responses provided 
a mirror image; only 15 percent of respondents believed that prescreened solicitations had 
caused them to use too much credit. 


47 

Potential Effects of Further Restrictions on Written 
Offers of Credit or Insurance 

The fifth issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is 
“whether further restricting the ability of lenders and insurers to provide written offers of 
credit or insurance to consumers would affect: (i) the cost consumers pay to obtain credit 
or insurance; (ii) the availability of credit or insurance; (iii) consumers’ knowledge about 
new or alternative products and services; (iv) the ability of lenders or insurers to compete 
with one another; and (v) the ability to offer credit or insurance products to consumers 
who have been traditionally underserved.” 

As discussed in this report, it appears that written offers of credit and insurance sent 
directly to consumers, often resulting from prescreened solicitation lists using credit 
records in the files of CRAs, have the potential to increase competition in the market for 
the relevant consumer financial services. Available evidence suggests that the markets 
for credit cards and insurance have become more competitive over time, and it seems that 
prescreened solicitations have contributed to this development. 

As noted, the primary benefits of competition consist of lower prices and an increased 
availability of the product or service in question. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude 
that further restrictions on the ability of lenders and insurers to provide written offers of 
credit or insurance to consumers would on balance result in a less competitive 
marketplace and thus relatively higher prices and reduced availability. 

It is difficult to see how further restrictions on the ability of lenders and insurers to 
provide written offers of credit or insurance to consumers would improve the condition of 
those individuals or groups of individuals who might have been underserved in the past. 
More competition would presumably serve the interests of consumers better than less 
competition. Also, prescreening allows marketing to a larger audience of creditworthy 
individuals, including those in the low- and moderate-income bracket who have a need 
for credit but may not otherwise apply due to fear of being turned down. 

It also is difficult to see how reducing the amounts of direct, tailored information sent to 
consumers on the availability and pricing of financial services would improve their 
“knowledge about new or alternative products and services.” In today’s marketplace, 
consumers receive vast amounts of information about the availability of credit and 
insurance. Those sending the prescreened solicitations must tailor the offerings to the 
actual conditions of recipients because they must be “firm offers of credit or insurance.” 
Such information is much more likely to reflect actual market conditions than 
advertisements that have few restraints on the claims made or the characteristics of the 
underlying arrangements. Without prescreening, consumers would be less certain about 
whether or not they would qualify for favorable terms on the various credit or insurance

products available in the marketplace and might expend valuable time and effort pursuing 
products for which they do not qualify. 

Moreover, restrictions on sending prescreened solicitations are likely to cause creditors 
and insurers to use less-efficient techniques to market their services, including additional 
mailings to prospective customers and to those unqualified for the product or service. 
The additional mailings would result in higher costs and ultimately higher prices to 
consumers, greater unease for those sensitive to privacy issues, and potentially more 
incidences of identity theft. 

The fact that approximately 20 million consumers have placed their names on the opt-out 
lists maintained by the national CRAs suggests that it is not especially difficult to avoid 
written offers of credit or insurance if so desired. Further, consumer survey responses 
reveal relatively little support for further government restrictions in this area. 

Finally, any further legislative or regulatory changes to the opt-out system should be 
informed by an evaluation of the effects of several new provisions of the Fact Act. In 
particular, the Fact Act provides further enhancements to the opt-out notice provisions of 
the FCRA, including a review of the presentation and placement of the notice in written 
prescreened solicitations and an extension of the opt-out period from two years to five 
years. The Congress has also directed the FTC to raise public awareness of opt-out 
rights.

Appendix A:

Section 213(e) of the Fair and Accurate

Credit Transactions Act of 2003


(e) ANALYSIS OF FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OFFERS OF CREDIT OR INSURANCE.— 

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Board shall conduct a study of— 

(A) the ability of consumers to avoid receiving written offers of credit or 
insurance in connection with transactions not initiated by the consumer; and 

(B) the potential impact that any further restrictions on providing consumers with 
such written offers of credit or insurance would have on consumers. 

(2) REPORT.—The Board shall submit a report summarizing the results of the study 
required under paragraph (1) to the Congress not later than 12 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, together with such recommendations for legislative or 
administrative action as the Board may determine to be appropriate. 

(3) CONTENT OF REPORT.—The report described in paragraph (2) shall address the 
following issues: 

(A) The current statutory or voluntary mechanisms that are available to a 
consumer to notify lenders and insurance providers that the consumer does not 
wish to receive written offers of credit or insurance. 

(B) The extent to which consumers are currently utilizing existing statutory and 
voluntary mechanisms to avoid receiving offers of credit or insurance. 

(C) The benefits provided to consumers as a result of receiving written offers of 
credit or insurance. 

(D) Whether consumers incur significant costs or are otherwise adversely 
affected by the receipt of written offers of credit or insurance. 

(E) Whether further restricting the ability of lenders and insurers to provide 
written offers of credit or insurance to consumers would affect— 

(i) the cost consumers pay to obtain credit or insurance;

(ii) the availability of credit or insurance;

(iii) consumers’ knowledge about new or alternative products and

services;

(iv) the ability of lenders or insurers to compete with one another; and

(v) the ability to offer credit or insurance products to consumers

who have been traditionally underserved.

Age and Census Tract Characteristics of Individuals

in the Credit Record Sample


AGE 

Credit records include information that can be used to determine the age of the individual. The 
sample data indicate that older individuals are much more likely to opt out of receiving 
prescreened mail solicitations for credit or insurance than younger persons. About 10 percent of 
those age 55 and older have opted out, compared with 3 percent of individuals under the age of 
25 (table B.1). Younger individuals may be more likely to need credit in the future and for this 
reason less inclined to limit the number of credit offers they receive in the mail. It is also likely 
that younger individuals have received fewer prescreened solicitations and may be less aware of 
the opt-out option. 

URBAN, SUBURBAN, OR RURAL RESIDENCE 

The Bureau of the Census categorizes all areas of the country according to three levels, or 
degrees, of urbanization: urban, suburban, and rural. (Urban and suburban areas constitute 
metropolitan areas as defined by the Office of Management and Budget; rural areas constitute 
nonmetropolitan areas.) The sample data indicate that individuals residing in the suburbs are 
most likely to opt out, and those in rural areas are least likely to do so. 

RELATIVE INCOME OF CENSUS TRACT 

The sample data also include state, county, and census tract indicators for the individuals in the 
sample. For this analysis each census tract was placed into one of four relative income categories 
by comparing the median family income of the census tract to the median family income of the 
broader area in which it is located (incomes were as of the 2000 decennial census).42 For a census 
tract in a metropolitan (that is, urban or suburban) area, the comparison is to the median family 
income of the metropolitan area in which the census tract is located; for each rural census tract, 
the comparison is to the median family income of the nonmetropolitan portion of its state (table 
B.1). 

Individuals residing in lower-income areas (incomes less than 80 percent of the broader area 
median) have the lowest incidence of opting out (2.6 percent), while those in the highest-income 
areas (incomes 120 percent or more of the broader area medians) have the greatest incidence of 
opting out (9.5 percent). These patterns are consistent with differences in the use of credit by the 
residents of these areas; residents of higher-income areas, for example, have more credit 
accounts, on average, than residents of lower-income areas (data not shown in tables). As noted 

42 The four income categories correspond to the income groups used to measure the records of banking 
institutions in complying with the Community Reinvestment Act.

in the main text, individuals with more accounts may not feel the need to receive additional 
solicitations, or they may be more aware of the opt-out option. 

RACIAL OR ETHNIC COMPOSITION OF CENSUS TRACT 

Finally, census tracts were categorized according to the racial and ethnic composition of their 
populations (table B.1). The sample data indicate that individuals residing in areas with a 
relatively low concentration of racial and ethnic minorities (population less than 10 percent 
minority) are more than twice as likely to opt out as individuals residing in predominantly 
minority areas (population at least 80 percent minority). These patterns are consistent with 
differences in the use of credit. Residents of predominantly nonminority areas, for example, have 
more credit accounts, on average, than residents of predominantly minority areas (data not shown 
in tables). Once again, individuals with more accounts may not feel the need to receive additional 
solicitations, or they may be more aware of the possibility of opting out.
