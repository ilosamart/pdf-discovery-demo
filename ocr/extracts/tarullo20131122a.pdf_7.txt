For example, the Basel III capital requirements increase from 0 percent to 20 percent the credit 

conversion factor for commitments with an original maturity of one year or less that are not 

unconditionally cancellable.  In addition, the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) assigns a 

100 percent drawdown rate to undrawn amounts of credit and liquidity facilities extended by 

banks to a special purpose entity (SPE), effectively requiring a bank to hold $100 in high-quality 

liquid assets (HQLA) for every $100 it commits to a SPE. 

Implicit support presents more of a regulatory challenge.  Identifying implicit forms of 

support requires a supervisory judgment that, despite sometimes stern warnings in offering 

documents, a banking organization bears some of the risk associated with that investment.  

Regulators must decide how much of the risk the banking organization retains and make context-

sensitive judgments about the financial stability implications of various remedies.  These 

challenges notwithstanding, regulators have made some progress in addressing instances of 

implicit support that played a major role in the last crisis.  Let me mention two examples. 

The first involves the implicit support associated with the provision of intraday credit by 

clearing banks in the tri-party repo market.  In a repurchase agreement or “repo,” the cash 

borrower agrees to sell a security to a cash lender, and to repurchase the security from the cash 

lender at a later date.  In a tri-party repo transaction, a clearing bank handles settlements through 

accounts held at that financial institution by the parties to the transaction.  To allow broker-

dealers who borrow in the tri-party repo market to have access to their securities for routine 

trading purposes, the market developed an operational feature known as the “daily unwind.”  

Before the crisis and for some time afterwards, the clearing banks unwound all tri-party repo 

trades each day--even those with a significant term, which in theory represented longer-term 

financing commitments--returning securities to borrowers and cash to lenders.  However,
