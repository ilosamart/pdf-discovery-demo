International Group, or AIG, had to be bailed out primarily because of its inability to post 

enough collateral to cover liabilities on credit protection it had sold on many entities 

(including Lehman) and because it lost funding in the securities lending market.  The 

Reserve Primary fund, a money market mutual fund, “broke the buck” as a result of its 

holdings of Lehman securities. 

Banks were not immune to the financial market stress of this period, but they 

were far less involved in the unfolding of the crisis than were nonbanks – a phenomenon 

that highlighted the importance of the nonbank sector and the vulnerability of the 

financial system to its distress.  When nonbanks pulled back, other parts of the system 

suffered.  When nonbanks failed, other parts of the system failed. 

Regulatory Reforms Implemented in the Wake of the Financial Crisis  

A crisis as deep as the Global Financial Crisis was bound to produce widespread 

regulatory changes.  It was clearly necessary to strengthen the banking system and to 

better analyze and understand the importance of the links between the banking sector and 

the nonbank financial sector.  With respect to the nonbank financial sector, there was a 

clear need for greater transparency, less leverage, and more stable forms of liquidity 

transformation.

macroprudential perspective to supervision and regulation.5  Central bankers and bank 

supervisors in the United States now regulate and supervise large complex banks not only 

as standalone entities, but also with consideration of how their actions could affect other 

5 There appear to be two meanings of the word “macroprudential.”  At first, it referred to a focus on 
systemic interactions within the financial system.  It is in that sense that we are talking at this point.  The 
second meaning is almost the opposite:  It relates to regulatory but not monetary policy measures focused 
on some aspect of the financial system whose behavior is giving cause for concern.
