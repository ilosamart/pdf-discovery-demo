company debt and equity holders may prefer less prepositioning, while local creditors and 

financial market utilities may prefer more.  These other stakeholders can act in ways that can be 

destabilizing.  Building a system that is transparent and is perceived by stakeholders as allocating 

losses fairly is key in this regard.  

Finally, I would like to note that the considerations of policymakers in determining the 

right balance of flexibility and certainty may differ depending on whether the resource at issue is 

capital or liquidity.  In resolution, the most important difference between capital and liquidity is 

the speed with which financial stress can appear.  Liquidity needs are sudden and tend to 

manifest in all areas of the organization, and the consequences of not meeting liquidity demand--

an immediate default on an obligation--can be grave.  Capital needs, however, may be more 

localized and slower to evolve but are foundational to the execution of an SPOE resolution.  It is 

unlikely that host regulators would be comfortable cooperating in an SPOE resolution strategy 

without some confidence in the viability of the entities in their jurisdictions.    

U.S. Approach 

Historically, the United States and the United Kingdom have been in a unique position of 

having large interests as both home country and host country regulators of internationally active 

banks.  Soon, the European Union is likely to assume this privilege as well.  We understand that 

any requirements we impose on foreign banks operating in the United States may well be 

imposed on U.S. firms operating abroad.  In addition, we are operating under a veil of ignorance, 

as we donâ€™t know whether the next firm in distress will be a U.S. firm operating globally or a 

foreign firm with U.S. operations.  This provides us with strong incentives to view the risks from 

both sides.
