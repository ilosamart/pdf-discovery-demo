their products and services digitally.  We want whatever we design to be clear and more 

predictable for banks in order to promote more and more impactful CRA activity.   

Taken together, changes to the CRA regulationsâ€™ definition of assessment areas 

and performance test structure, along with improved metrics based on better data have the 

potential to enhance the regulations and better serve its purpose of encouraging banks to 

help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities.  We understand 

and appreciate that banks want to be able to make plans and manage their risks carefully 

through clearer standards regarding what counts, where it will be counted, and how.  If 

we can address these suggestions effectively, banks will be more effective in addressing 

the needs of their local communities and in some cases extend their activities to benefit 

chronically underserved communities. 

I will be interested to hear whether some of the ideas I have shared today resonate 

with you.  I want to assure you that we will continue to engage with bank and community 

stakeholders to find a path forward that honors the purpose of the CRA by encouraging 

banks to attend to the credit needs of their local communities and to better address the 

needs of underserved areas.  This engagement will be vital as we join together with the 

other banking agencies to formulate regulatory changes that preserve what is best about 

CRA while ensuring its value and relevance for another generation.
