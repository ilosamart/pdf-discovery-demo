here, and more obstacles to complete your degree.  One of the biggest of these obstacles, 

in fact, was that some people doubted you could or would succeed.  But others in your 

life believed in you.  Some of them are here today.  They believed in you, and you 

believed in yourself, and your talent and intelligence and hard work enabled you to earn 

the degree you are about to receive.   

If this sounds like you, then you are absolutely right, because I am not describing 

just one member of the University of Baltimoreâ€™s Class of 2016--I am trying to describe 

every one of you.  In different ways, I expect all of you have overcome obstacles and 

demonstrated resilience and determination to succeed.  All of you have gained knowledge 

and used your intelligence and talents to complete your degrees.  As impressed as I am 

with any individual graduating today, I am more impressed with what all of you have 

achieved. 

Let me tell you what else I have learned.  More than the students of some colleges 

and universities, I know that many of you have deep roots in this city and in the county.  

Many of you will start careers, build your lives, and raise your families here.  The 

challenges you have overcome are the challenges faced by many people in Baltimore and 

in communities throughout America.  Your success, which we celebrate today, is also the 

promise of a brighter future for this city.  The degrees you have worked so hard to earn 

and the opportunities now opening up to you represent the stubborn, earnest hope that 

anyone and everyone who strives to succeed still can succeed.   

And that is why I consider it a rare privilege to speak to you today, and a great 

honor to be associated with the University of Baltimore and the members of the Class of 

2016.  Thank you, and congratulations.
