organizations.  Other measures--such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase 

agreements and other securities financing transactions--could, at least in principle, apply 

on a marketwide basis.  To the extent that minimum margin requirements lead to more 

conservative margin levels during normal and exuberant times, they could help avoid 

potentially destabilizing procyclical margin increases in short-term wholesale funding 

markets during times of stress. 

Leaning Against the Wind 

At this point, it should be clear that I think efforts to build resilience in the 

financial system are critical to minimizing the chance of financial instability and the 

potential damage from it.  This focus on resilience differs from much of the public 

discussion, which often concerns whether some particular asset class is experiencing a 

“bubble” and whether policymakers should attempt to pop the bubble.  Because a 

resilient financial system can withstand unexpected developments, identification of 

bubbles is less critical.  

Nonetheless, some macroprudential tools can be adjusted in a manner that may 

further enhance resilience as risks emerge.  In addition, macroprudential tools can, in 

some cases, be targeted at areas of concern.  For example, the new Basel III regulatory 

capital framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which may help build 

additional loss-absorbing capacity within the financial sector during periods of rapid 

credit creation while also leaning against emerging excesses.  The stress tests include a 

scenario design process in which the macroeconomic stresses in the scenario become 

more severe during buoyant economic expansions and incorporate the possibility of 

highlighting salient risk scenarios, both of which may contribute to increasing resilience
