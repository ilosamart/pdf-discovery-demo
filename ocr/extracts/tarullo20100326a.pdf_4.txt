horizon for at least 12 separate categories of loans and a few other asset classes, using 

year-end 2008 financial statement data as a starting point.  To guide the banks, 

supervisors provided indicative loss-rate ranges for the system as a whole, derived from 

both analysis of historical loss experience at large banks and quantitative models relating 

loan performance to macroeconomic variables.  Banks were informed that loss estimates 

below the indicative range would be closely scrutinized.  

 Second, the supervisory teams evaluated the banks’ estimates to identify 

methodological weaknesses, missing information, overly optimistic assumptions, and 

other problems.  Examiners had detailed conversations with bank managers, which led to 

numerous modifications of the banks’ submissions.  Supervisors then made judgmental 

adjustments to the banks’ loss and revenue estimates based on sensitivity analyses 

performed by the firms, comparative analysis across the firms, and the supervisors’ own 

judgments. 

 Third, the supervisors supplemented these judgmental assessments with objective, 

model-based estimates for losses and revenues that could be applied on a consistent basis 

across firms.  Each participating institution was asked to supply, in a standardized format, 

detailed information that supervisors could use to estimate losses and revenues, such as 

details about loan characteristics.  These data allowed supervisors to make consistent 

estimates using independently constructed models.  Finally, supervisors systematically 

incorporated all of these inputs into loss, revenue, and reserve estimates for each 

institution.  These estimates were combined with information on existing reserves and 

capital to project capital buffers that the banks would need under the two scenarios.
