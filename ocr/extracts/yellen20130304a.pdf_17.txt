based on assumptions about the course of balance sheet normalization that are consistent 

with the exit strategy principles adopted at the June 2011 FOMC meeting.

The projections resulting from this exercise imply that Federal Reserve 

remittances to the Treasury will likely decline for a time.  In some scenarios, they decline 

to zero.  Once the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is normalized, however, earnings are 

projected to return to their long‐run trend.  The study supports the conclusion that the 

Federal Reserve’s purchase programs will very likely prove to have been a net plus for 

cumulative income and remittances to the Treasury over the period from 2008 through 

2025, by which time it is assumed that the balance sheet has been normalized.

Focusing only on the ebb and flow of the Federal Reserve’s remittances to the 

Treasury, however, is not, in my view, the appropriate way to evaluate the effect of these 

purchases on the government’s finances.  More germane is the overall effect of the 

program on federal finances.  If the purchases provide even a modest boost to economic 

activity, increased tax payments would swamp any reduction in remittances.  By 

depressing longer-term interest rates, the purchases also hold down the Treasury’s debt 

service costs.  These effects can be quantified through simulations of the Board’s 

FRB/US model.  In the simulation I described earlier, a hypothetical program involving 

$500 billion of asset purchases would reduce the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic

Governors (2011b).

 The extent of realized capital losses on sales of Federal Reserve assets depends on the precise securities 

sales policy that the Committee eventually decides to undertake.  An increase in longer-term interest rates 

would lower the market value of the securities in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio.  But 

the Federal Reserve would continue to receive interest income on those securities for as long as they 

remained in the SOMA portfolio, and securities held to maturity could roll off the portfolio without the 

Federal Reserve realizing losses on them.  While the authors of the Board staff study used particular 

assumptions about future securities sales that are consistent with the exit strategy principles outlined by the 

Committee in June 2011, other strategies for sales that are equally consistent might lead to different results.
