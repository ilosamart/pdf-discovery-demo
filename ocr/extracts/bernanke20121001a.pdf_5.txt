cars or to finance capital investments.  Since 2008, we’ve used two types of less-

traditional monetary policy tools to bring down longer-term rates.   

The first of these less-traditional tools involves the Fed purchasing longer-term 

securities on the open market--principally Treasury securities and mortgage-backed 

securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac.  The Fed’s purchases reduce the amount of longer-term securities held by 

investors and put downward pressure on the interest rates on those securities.  That 

downward pressure transmits to a wide range of interest rates that individuals and 

businesses pay.  For example, when the Fed first announced purchases of mortgage-

backed securities in late 2008, 30-year mortgage interest rates averaged a little above 

6 percent; today they average about 3-1/2 percent.  Lower mortgage rates are one reason 

for the improvement we have been seeing in the housing market, which in turn is 

benefiting the economy more broadly.  Other important interest rates, such as corporate 

bond rates and rates on auto loans, have also come down.  Lower interest rates also put 

upward pressure on the prices of assets, such as stocks and homes, providing further 

impetus to household and business spending. 

The second monetary policy tool we have been using involves communicating our 

expectations for how long the short-term interest rate will remain exceptionally low.  

Because the yield on, say, a five-year security embeds market expectations for the course 

of short-term rates over the next five years, convincing investors that we will keep the 

short-term rate low for a longer time can help to pull down market-determined longer-

term rates.  In sum, the Fed’s basic strategy for strengthening the economy--reducing 

interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally--is the same as it has always
