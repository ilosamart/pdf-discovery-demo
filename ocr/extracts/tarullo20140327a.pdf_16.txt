countries implement their Basel III commitments.  However, quite apart from what may happen 

in the future, there are two U.S.-based firms--Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley--whose global 

business mix resembles that of the U.S. subsidiaries of FBOs that are predominantly engaged in 

broker-dealer activities in the United States.  In fact, under the enhanced supplementary leverage 

ratio the Board proposed during the summer, these and other U.S. G-SIBs would be subject to a 

higher Basel III leverage ratio requirement (5 percent) than would apply to FBO IHCs (3 

percent).   

 The applicable liquidity requirements, while somewhat differently defined, are roughly 

comparable to those already applicable to FBOs in the United Kingdom.  The similar positions of 

our two nations as host countries for foreign bank operations heavily involved in trading and 

significantly reliant on potentially runnable short-term wholesale funding explain this rough 

parallelism. 

 The most notable departure of the new U.S. FBO standards from existing EU and U.K. 

practice lies in the IHC requirement for foreign banks with large domestic operations.  Given the 

structure of U.S. financial regulation that is a legacy of Glass-Steagall, as well as the efforts by a 

small number of very large foreign banks to evade the intent of Congress that capital standards 

apply to their U.S. operations, we needed to create this structural requirement.  It is unclear how 

much difference this makes for the capital requirements of FBOs in the United States as opposed, 

say, to those of U.S. operations in the EU.  That would depend on the existence and size of 

financial affiliates owned by the U.S. firm that are not subject to Basel standards directly.  In any 

case, it seems sound prudential practice--and consistent with the various Basel Committee 

principles to which I earlier referred--that large domestic operations of foreign banks meet
