I am honored to join you to celebrate the first 10 years of the Treasury Market Practices 

Group (TMPG).  The TMPG has become an essential forum where industry participants gather 

under the auspices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to address market practice issues as 

they arise in the fast evolving markets for Treasury securities.  Outside this room, you are

at the door.  The TMPG is the place where market participants recognize and address their

all of the market participants here today to take the TMPG’s recommendations just as seriously 

and to adopt them as best practices that will enhance the market’s functioning.

financial firms of that time.  Over one memorable August weekend, we first prohibited the firm 

from dealing in government securities on behalf of customers, and then reduced that sanction as 

top Salomon management left the firm and Warren Buffett, then a large Salomon shareholder, 

agreed to assume the chairmanship of the board of directors.  This event takes up a chapter in
