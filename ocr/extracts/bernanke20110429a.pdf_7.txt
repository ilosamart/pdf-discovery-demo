market value.  The initiative, dubbed Stabilizing Urban Neighborhoods, or SUN, is 

focused on six low-income neighborhoods in Boston that have the cityâ€™s highest 

concentration of foreclosures.  Taking advantage of the diminished home values, the 

group buys the properties and then resells them at affordable prices to existing 

occupants--both owners and tenants--who can demonstrate that they have suffered 

hardship.  This program prevents properties from becoming vacant and provides families 

with a sustainable and affordable housing situation; it is designed to start small and 

expand as needed.   

 In the South, ACCION Texas-Louisiana, a nonprofit organization, has been 

focused on assisting entrepreneurs start small businesses and helping existing small 

businesses to expand.  ACCION lends to entrepreneurs whose businesses are too small or 

too new to qualify for a regular bank loan.  Minority-owned businesses receive more than 

80 percent of its loans, and almost half of the lending goes to women-owned businesses.  

Since 2009, the organization has expanded from Texas into Louisiana to respond to small 

businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina.  The recession put extra pressure on ACCION, 

as existing borrowers were having increasing trouble paying back their loans.  At the 

same time, demand for its services increased, as newly laid-off workers were seeking 

loans to start their own businesses.  The organization responded by expanding its 

services--opening a business support center and business incubators, providing more 

comprehensive technical assistance, developing new business partnerships, reaching into 

new markets, and strengthening its underwriting platform to reduce waiting time for 

applicants and reduce its own costs.
