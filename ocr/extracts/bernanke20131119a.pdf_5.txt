year.2  The statement begins by affirming the FOMC’s commitment to meeting both of 

its statutory objectives.  It then indicates that, in the context of the FOMC’s dual 

mandate, the Committee sees price stability as corresponding to a 2 percent longer-term 

inflation goal.  On the employment side of the mandate, the Committee makes its best 

assessment of the maximum level of employment at any given time, recognizing that 

such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  In practice, the 

Committee often expresses its employment objective in terms of the longer-run normal 

rate of unemployment.  Currently, FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run 

normal unemployment rate, as publicly reported in the quarterly Summary of Economic 

Projections, range from 5.2 to 6 percent.3   

As I noted, explicit objectives are most useful when accompanied by provisional 

plans for achieving them.  Many central banks supplement their announced objectives 

with published forecasts that, implicitly or explicitly, lay out plans for achieving their 

goals.  Although the size and diversity of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking committee 

has made achieving a single consensus forecast difficult, the quarterly Summary of 

Economic Projections reports each FOMC participant’s view of the most likely future 

paths of inflation, unemployment, and output growth, conditional on that individual’s 

view of appropriate monetary policy.  In recent years, this survey has also included 

participants’ projections of the path of future short-term interest rates they see as most 

likely to achieve the Committee’s goals.  In general, the Committee’s two objectives of

three highest and three lowest values submitted by FOMC participants) was 5.2 to 5.8 percent in
