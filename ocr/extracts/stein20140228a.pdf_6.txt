briefly mentions, and that is worth a fuller treatment, has to do with the potential for 

outflows of assets under management (AUM) from open-end funds.  Note that the model 

is effectively one of a closed-end fund, since the manager is assumed to have a fixed 

amount of AUM; the fragility, in this case, comes entirely from the manager’s portfolio 

allocation decision and from the strategic interaction among fund managers.  But another 

source of run-like risk comes from the strategic interaction among fund investors and the 

incentives that each of them may have to get out before others do when asset values are at 

risk of declining.   

These AUM-driven run dynamics are more likely to arise in those open-end funds 

that hold relatively illiquid assets.  The key question in determining whether there is a 

strategic complementarity in the withdrawal decisions of fund investors is, When investor 

i exits on day t, does the net asset value (NAV) at the end of the day that defines investor 

i’s exit price fully reflect the ultimate price effect of the sales created by his exit?  If not, 

those investors who stay behind are hurt, which is what creates run incentives.  And, if 

the run incentives are strong enough, then a credit-oriented bond fund starts looking 

pretty bank-like.  The fact that its liabilities are not technically debt claims is not all that 

helpful in this case--they are still demandable, and hence investors can pull out very 

rapidly if the terms of exit create a penalty for being last out the door. 

A fund’s stated NAV is less likely to keep pace with the ultimate price impact of 

investor withdrawals if the underlying assets are illiquid, for two distinct reasons.  First, 

some of the assets are likely to have stale prices--that is, not to have been recently 

marked to market.  And, second, if most of a fund’s assets are illiquid securities, its
