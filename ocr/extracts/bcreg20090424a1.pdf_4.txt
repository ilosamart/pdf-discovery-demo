expenses by major category, domestic and international portfolio characteristics, forecast methods, and 

important assumptions. 

The SCAP process was extensive. In early March, firms submitted their projections to the 

agencies, which included significant amounts of detailed data. Supervisory teams, organized by specific 

asset classes, revenues, and reserves, evaluated the substance and quality of the initial submissions and, 

where appropriate, requested additional data or evaluation of the sensitivity of projections to 

alternative assumptions. The supervisors also developed independent benchmarks based on f i rm-

specific portfolio characteristics against which they evaluated the appropriateness of the firms' 

projections for losses and resources that would be available to absorb losses. Results for each f i rm also 

were evaluated to assess the sensitivity of the f i rm to changes in the economy based on projections 

under the baseline and the more adverse scenarios. The evaluations drew on the expertise of more 

than 150 senior supervisors, on-site examiners, analysts, and economists from the agencies. Senior 

supervisory officials made the determination of the necessary capital buffer for each BHC. 

While the SCAP is conceptually similar to stress tests that firms undertake as part of their 

ongoing risk management, the objective of this program was to conduct a comprehensive and 

consistent assessment simultaneously across the 19 largest BHCs using a common set of macroeconomic 

scenarios, and a common forward-looking conceptual framework. This framework allowed supervisors 

to apply a consistent and systematic approach across the group to evaluate the projected loss and 

resource estimates submitted by the firms. The extensive information on the characteristics of loan, 

trading, and securities portfolios and modeling methods provided by these institutions allowed 

supervisors to conduct a cross-firm analysis and assess the projections. In addition, the SCAP is 

considerably more comprehensive than stress tests that focus on individual business lines, because it 

simultaneously incorporates all of the major assets and the revenue sources of each of the firms. 

As discussed in the interagency statement released on February 10, the SCAP may result in a 

determination that a BHC may need to augment its capital base to establish a buffer. This capital buffer 

should position the largest BHCs to continue to play their critical role as intermediaries, even in a more 

challenging economic environment. The United States Treasury has committed to make capital available 

to eligible BHCs through the Capital Assistance Program as described in the Term Sheet released on 

February 25. In addition, BHCs can also apply to Treasury to exchange their existing Capital Purchase 

Program preferred stock to help meet their buffer requirement. 

Section II describes the program design of the SCAP and Section III provides detail on how the 

assessment of losses and revenues were conducted, and how the capital need was calculated. 

II. Program Design 

This section provides a discussion of the SCAP framework, a general description of the process, 

the guidance given to BHCs, and the projections that the participating BHCs were asked to make. 

II. A. Discussion of SCAP Analytical Framework 

The SCAP process involves the projection of losses on loans, assets held in investment portfolios, 

and trading-related exposures, as well as the firm's capacity to absorb losses in order to determine a 

sufficient capital level to support lending under a worse-than-expected macroeconomic scenario. The
