  Thank you and happy New Year.  It is a pleasure to be with you today as you 

meet to discuss so many pressing and important issues.  I know there has been much 

discussion at this conference about the public function of law schools and I commend you 

for tackling this essential challenge.  In my speech today, I hope to add to the 

conversation a little bit by presenting a simple argument, that laws and regulations must 

be enforced, and enforcement must be part of what we teach lawyers and future 

lawmakers to study.  What we think of as the rule of law encompasses not merely 

theories of the process by which public laws and regulations are created through 

particular legislative and administrative procedures, and not merely theories of how laws 

and regulations are interpreted by courts.  The rule of law includes enforcement itself.  

The rule of law compels us to consider whether a rule has been crafted in such a way that

actors.  The rule of law also involves decisions about whether there has been compliance, 

and if not, what should be done about it. 

The failure of timely enforcement leads to the entrenchment of bad practices and 

an increase in the costs of correction.  For example, turning to what will be the focus of 

my comments today--the role of mortgage servicers in the foreclosure crisis--the longer it 

takes for mortgage servicers to make the operational adjustments necessary to fix their 

sloppy and deceptive practices, the costlier and more difficult it becomes for them to sort 

them out and correct them.   

More fundamentally, a failure by regulators to enforce the laws and regulations as 

strong antidotes to financial misconduct and unsafe and unsound practices by the 

institutions they regulate establishes de facto acquiescence to the dominant norms of the
