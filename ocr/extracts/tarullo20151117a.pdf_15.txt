might be tempted to relax regulation on their firms, even though they might agree that the best 

outcome would be to retain their existing regulations but have the other sector subject to some 

constraints as well.  This seems to me not a bad description of what happened in banking for a 

good part of the three decades beginning in the mid-1970s, when the banking agencies pursued a 

variety of deregulatory measures in part because they believed that the franchise of commercial 

banking was being eroded by various capital market activities that were not subject to 

appropriate prudential requirements. 

Conclusion 

 The Financial Stability Board study to which I referred earlier notes that the growth of 

shadow banking in the United States in recent years has been relatively modest.  With the 

regulated financial sector so much more resilient than in pre-crisis days, the financial system as a 

whole is obviously safer.  Moreover, much of the innovation occurring in lending and payments 

arenas today carries the promise of genuinely increased efficiency, and does not appear to be just 

an arbitrage against the stronger post-crisis regulatory regime.   

But if history is any guide, the grace period we are now experiencing will not last forever.  

New forms of intermediation may carry new risks, or older forms may acquire new risks as they 

expand and adapt to new circumstances.  If we are to pursue a policy of case-by-case assessment 

that permits healthy forms of nonbank intermediation while protecting the financial system, 

financial regulators will need to develop effective and supple mechanisms for what I have termed 

prudential market regulation.
