lenders?  Is it something that will ultimately prove transitory once households finish 

repairing their balance sheets or become more confident about their future prospects for 

employment and income?15  The answer to this latter question could have significant 

implications for the longer-run normal, or neutral, level of interest rates and thus for the 

conduct of monetary policy.  

Inflation Dynamics 

My fourth question goes to the heart of monetary policy:  What determines 

inflation? 

From my perspective, the standard framework for thinking about inflation 

dynamics used by central bank economists and others prior to the financial crisis remains 

conceptually useful today.  A simple description of this framework might go something 

like this:16  Inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially 

constant since the mid-1990s; previously, this trend seemed to drift over time, influenced 

by actual past inflation or other economic conditions.  Theory and evidence suggest that 

this trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that, in turn, depend on 

monetary policy.  In particular, the remarkable stability of various measures of expected 

inflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits of the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

sustained efforts since the early 1980s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low 

level.  The anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not, 

however, prevent actual inflation from fluctuating from year to year in response to the 

temporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances.  In addition,

driving consumption during the Great Recession.  Work by Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2015) 
suggests that debt overhang alone cannot explain the slow recovery from the Great Recession.
