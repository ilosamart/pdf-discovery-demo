The next set of questions raised by a systemwide perspective on financial regulation can 

be described much more briefly.  It pertains to the appropriate target once a need for regulation 

has been established.  The selection among, and mix of targets for, systemically-motivated 

regulation will be an important determinant of the character of financial regulation in the years 

ahead. 

The relevant choices here are frequently identified in binary terms--that is, the regulation 

may be directed either at financial institutions or financial activities.  This leads to confusion 

because, for example, what has been described as an “activities-based” approach to dealing with 

the potential risks posed by certain asset management activities actually involves regulation of 

the firms involved in those activities, such as through liquidity and risk management 

requirements.  I suspect this confusion has arisen because, in the minds of some, “institution-

based” regulation has become close to synonymous with banking regulation.  Thus those 

opposed to, say, capital requirements for a particular kind of intermediary will advocate for 

activities-based regulation. 

My own sense is that it is useful to distinguish three possible targets of regulation--

specific financial institutions, financial business models, and financial transactions.  Most 

financial regulation, historically and contemporaneously, falls within what I would describe as 

business model regulation.  So, for example, any entity engaged in the “business of banking” is 

subject to the panoply of requirements found in Title 12 of the U.S. Code.  Similarly, the 

requirements imposed on money market funds by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC), and being considered for application to asset management activities, are also targeted at a 

business model, even though the kind of regulation is quite different from that applicable to 

insured depository institutions.
