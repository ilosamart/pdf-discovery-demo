policy for that purpose, especially in light of the difficulty in judging the appropriateness 

of asset valuations.   

 One type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument.  Increases 

in interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be 

experiencing speculative activity.  Moreover, monetary policy generally operates with 

one instrument--a short-term interest rate--and using it to damp asset price movements 

implies more medium-term variability in output and inflation around their objectives.  

Among other things, inflation expectations could become less well anchored, diminishing 

the ability of the central bank to counter economic fluctuations.  In the current situation, 

with output expected to be well below its potential for some time and inflation likely to 

be under the 2 percent level that many FOMC participants see as desirable over the long 

run, tightening policy to head off a perceived threat of asset price misalignment could be 

expensive in terms of medium-term economic stability.   

Furthermore, small policy adjustments may not be very effective in reining in 

speculative excesses.  Our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial 

increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot.com stock speculation in 

the first instance, and housing price increases in the second.  And larger adjustments 

would incur greater incremental costs.  Policy adjustments need to damp speculation; if 

higher rates just weaken output and inflation without damping speculation, the economy 

could be even more vulnerable when the speculative bubble bursts.  We do not have good 

theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in their efforts to use short-term 

interest rates to limit financial speculation.
