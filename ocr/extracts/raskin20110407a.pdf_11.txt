In addition to setting high expectations, examiners should strive for balance and 

consistency throughout the business cycle--that is, we should be careful not to be too hands-off 

when times are good and not to overreact when times are bad.  If you’re driving a car on a 

curving mountain road, accelerating too fast on the straight stretches leaves you with three 

choices when the road bends:  either you slam on the brakes, end up in a ditch on the side of the 

road, or get lucky and make it through.  It’s far safer to maintain a relatively steady speed, 

accelerating and decelerating gently as necessary, than to swing between extremes.  So it is with 

examination.  If examiners do not evaluate banks’ practices with sufficient rigor during the boom 

years, then it may be necessary to take a more draconian approach during the bust years, when 

problems are revealed.  

It has emerged that a number of regulators and examiners became concerned about 

concentrations in commercial real estate lending several years before the financial crisis.  Despite 

the red flags raised by this lending, it was difficult for examiners to challenge bank management 

at a time when these loans were performing well and banks were generating record profits.  

There was also strong pushback from the industry when the banking regulators began raising 

alarms about the potential risks of excessive concentrations.  Regulators finally issued guidance 

on concentrations in commercial real estate in late 2006, but in retrospect I think it is fair to 

wonder whether action should have been taken sooner.    

That brings me to my next point, which is that examiners have a key role to play in 

reviewing and assessing the quality of a bank’s internal controls, compliance, internal audit, et 

cetera.  A central element of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs is assessing the 

effectiveness of these processes and functions. We should understand where a bank’s primary 

risks arise and use enforcement tools as necessary to ensure that management is sufficiently
