actions was the best policy.7  A key insight of these scholars was that monetary policy 

affects employment, incomes, and inflation to a large extent through its effects on the 

public’s expectations about future policy.  Many spending decisions, such as financing 

the purchase of a home or businesses’ capital expenditures, depend on longer-term 

interest rates that are connected to monetary policy through expectations of short-term 

interest rates over the lifetime of a mortgage or an investment project.  In other words, the 

effect of monetary policy on the economy today depends not only, or even primarily, on 

the FOMC’s current target for the federal funds rate or the quantity of assets on its 

balance sheet, but rather on how the public expects the Federal Reserve to set the paths of 

these variables in the future.  These expectations influence longer-term interest rates and 

asset prices as well as the public’s views concerning the likely future paths of income and 

inflation.  

The history of oil price shocks is a good example to illustrate this point.  In the 

1970s, two large oil price shocks led to sharp increases in general inflation that were not 

met with prompt inflation-fighting actions by the Federal Reserve.  This delay left the 

public unsure whether the Federal Reserve would act to reverse the increase in inflation, 

and expectations of longer-term inflation ratcheted up.  When the Federal Reserve 

eventually did act to bring inflation down from double-digit levels, the consequence was 

the painful recession of 1981 and 1982.  

The effects of that policy shift were severe, but the decision helped change 

expectations of the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability, and thereby 

ultimately led to longer-run inflation expectations becoming anchored at their current low 

                                                 
7 While Robert Lucas mainly analyzed models in which only monetary surprises have any effect on real 
activity, his important insight in the present context was that the perceived monetary policy rule is critical 
in determining the effects of monetary policy actions, both anticipated and unanticipated.
