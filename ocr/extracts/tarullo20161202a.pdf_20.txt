Thus, to truly assure the safety and soundness of the financial system, a leverage ratio 

serving as the sole or dominant form of prudential regulation would probably have to be set 

considerably higher, at a level where the impact on financial intermediation could be quite 

extensive, particularly in what are today regarded as relatively safe capital market activities.  

Using both a leverage ratio and a strong set of risk-based capital requirements best combines the 

goals of safety and soundness, on the one hand, and efficient economic intermediation on the 

other.  We should remember that it was because of the limitations of a stand-alone leverage ratio 

that risk-based capital requirements were introduced in the 1980s. 

Conclusion 

 This conference is a good moment to remember just how bad things can be when 

financial stability is not effectively safeguarded and a financial crisis ensues.  It is, accordingly, 

also a good moment to caution against backsliding on the considerable progress that has been 

made toward a regulatory system that will provide just such a safeguard, particularly with respect 

to the largest, most systemically important banks.  While other modes of reform might have been 

taken, the one we have followed has provided a strong foundation for financial stability.  And, 

although I am sure some large banks would like to pare back our liquidity and risk management 

requirements or reduce required capital levels, both they and the economy have now largely 

adjusted to the new regime.  

After compelling banks in the depths of the crisis to raise capital sufficient to keep them 

at the minimum level necessary to function as effective intermediaries, we have since increased 

their resiliency through requirements to increase the quality and quantity of their capital.  But we 

have done so with a long transition period that allowed them mostly to build capital through 

retained earnings.  And we have generally left to the banks choices about reducing size or exiting
