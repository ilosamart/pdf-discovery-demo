When the Federal Reserveâ€™s policies are effective, they improve the welfare of 

everyone who benefits from a stronger economy, most of all those who have been hit 

hardest by the recession and the slow recovery.   

Now let me offer my view of the state of the recovery, with particular attention to 

the labor market and conditions faced by workers.  Nationwide, and in Chicago, the 

economy and the labor market have strengthened considerably from the depths of the 

Great Recession.  Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the 

economy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen 

more than 3 percentage points to 6.7 percent.  That progress has been gradual but 

remarkably steady--February was the 41st consecutive month of payroll growth, one of 

the longest stretches ever.   

Chicago, as you all know, was hit harder than many areas during the recession 

and remains a tougher market for workers.  But there has been considerable improvement 

here also.  Unemployment in the city of Chicago is down from a peak of nearly 13 

percent to about 9-1/2 percent at last count.  That is about the same improvement as in the 

larger Chicago metro area, where unemployment has fallen to 8-1/2 percent.  Metro 

Chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1 

But while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy 

and the job market are not back to normal health.  That will not be news to many of you, 

or to the 348,000 people in and around Chicago who were counted as looking for work in 

                                                 
1 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville 
metropolitan division has increased 183,000 since December 2009, or about 5 percent.  Over this period, 
employment nationally has increased about 6 percent.
