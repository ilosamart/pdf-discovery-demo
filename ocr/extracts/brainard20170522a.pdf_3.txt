Inclusion and Maximum Employment 

Inclusion is an enduring goal of public policy that is embodied in our maximum-

employment mandate.  The Employment Act of 1946 charges the federal government 

with creating “conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those 

able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production, 

and purchasing power.”2  Maximum employment is inherently an inclusive goal.  In 

1977, the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to make achieving maximum 

employment an explicit objective of monetary policy, along with stable prices.  In 

fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target 

of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum 

employment.  That is because the level of maximum employment depends on 

“nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which 

can change in important ways over time.3   

The recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes 

in the economic landscape serves us well.  It puts the onus on members of the FOMC to 

analyze the changing features of the labor market and develop a nuanced understanding 

of the different margins of slack.  This approach to maximum employment has allowed

3 The FOMC’s inflation target was adopted in January 2012 in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and 
Monetary Policy Strategy.  It was amended in January 2017 to clarify that the target is symmetric around 
2 percent; the most recent Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (in which the 
quoted text appears in paragraph 3) is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.  For the interim period, 
Thornton (2012) and Steelman (2011) document the evolution of views among FOMC members on the 
dual mandate.
