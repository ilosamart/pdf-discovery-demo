uneasily alongside the requisites of openness, connectivity, and data access that enable today’s 

app ecosystem.11  For instance, before entering an outsourcing arrangement, a bank is expected 

to consider whether the service provider’s internal processes or systems (or even human error at 

the outside party) could expose the bank and its customers to potential losses or expose the 

bank’s customers to fraud and the bank to litigation; whether the service provider complies with 

applicable laws and regulation; and whether poor performance by that outside party could 

materially harm the bank’s public reputation. 

The smartphone app ecosystem developed without the regulations or associated 

guardrails pertaining to institutions that people trust to hold their life savings.  For instance, 

when Pokémon Go was first launched, its creator, Niantic, used an outdated Google API to 

verify consumer identities.  This created confusion about whether millions of consumers had 

unwittingly granted Niantic full access to their e-mails, contact lists, and calendars.12  However, 

it did not stand in the way of Pokémon Go subsequently being downloaded a half billion times.13  

In contrast, these kinds of mistakes in the banking sector could raise grave concerns about 

consumer data privacy and security and the integrity of consumer transactions data.  That’s why 

banks are expected to conduct extensive risk assessments and due diligence of their service

access device and grants authority to make transfers to a person (such as a family member or co-worker) who 
exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless the consumer has notified the 
financial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.”); Division of Banking Supervision and

Labs, to read and send email, access, edit and delete documents in Google Drive and Google Photos, and access 
browser and maps histories.  In fact, both Google and Niantic Labs, say that ‘full access’ counterintuitively means 
nothing of the sort, a claim backed up by independent security researchers.  The issue appears to stem from the fact 
that Niantic Labs uses an outdated version of Google’s shared sign-on service.”)
