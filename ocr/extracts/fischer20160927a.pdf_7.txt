explain most of the gap in wealth between white families and black families, a substantial 

portion of this gap cannot be explained by such factors.9  Additional research is required

Thank you for inviting me to speak to you.  It would be great to see some of you 

who are here today going on to influence the direction of the country on any number of 

issues.  To put it in a nutshell, I firmly believe that a degree in economics will equip you 

for a personally productive and rewarding career, will position you to help make progress 

on some of society’s toughest issues, and will change the field of economics itself. 

Thank you for listening--and may you all both enjoy and succeed in your future 

careers, especially in economics.
