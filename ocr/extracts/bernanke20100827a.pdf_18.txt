increased uncertainty for households and businesses, higher risk premiums in financial 

markets, and the potential for destabilizing movements in commodity and currency 

markets would likely overwhelm any benefits arising from this strategy. 

Each of the tools that the FOMC has available to provide further policy 

accommodation--including longer-term securities asset purchases, changes in 

communication, and reducing the IOER rate--has benefits and drawbacks, which must be 

appropriately balanced.  Under what conditions would the FOMC make further use of 

these or related policy tools?  At this juncture, the Committee has not agreed on specific 

criteria or triggers for further action, but I can make two general observations.   

First, the FOMC will strongly resist deviations from price stability in the 

downward direction.  Falling into deflation is not a significant risk for the United States 

at this time, but that is true in part because the public understands that the Federal 

Reserve will be vigilant and proactive in addressing significant further disinflation.  It is 

worthwhile to note that, if deflation risks were to increase, the benefit-cost tradeoffs of 

some of our policy tools could become significantly more favorable. 

Second, regardless of the risks of deflation, the FOMC will do all that it can to 

ensure continuation of the economic recovery.  Consistent with our mandate, the Federal 

Reserve is committed to promoting growth in employment and reducing resource slack 

more generally.  Because a further significant weakening in the economic outlook would 

likely be associated with further disinflation, in the current environment there is little or 

no potential conflict between the goals of supporting growth and employment and of 

maintaining price stability.
