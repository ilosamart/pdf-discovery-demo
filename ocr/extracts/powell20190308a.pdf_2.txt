Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today at the Stanford Institute for 

Economic Policy Research, a place dedicated to scholarship supporting policies to better 

peoples’ lives.  As today is International Women’s Day, I would like to preface my 

remarks by commending the American Economic Association for highlighting the 

diversity challenges of the economics profession and charting a way forward.  Diversity

purchases of longer-term securities, which became known as quantitative easing, or QE.  

There is a range of views, but most studies have found that these tools provided

Today I will explore some important features of normalization and then turn to 

what comes after.  In some ways, we are returning to the pre-crisis normal.  In other 

ways, things will be different.  The world has moved on in the last decade, and 

attempting to re-create the past would be neither practical nor wise.  As normalization 

moves into its later stages, my colleagues and I also believe that this is an important
