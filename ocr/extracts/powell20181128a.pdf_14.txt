Bottom Line: Financial Stability Risks Are Moderate 

I have reviewed a few of the key facts that inform our thinking about financial 

stability, and you will find a great deal more detail in our new report.  You will also find 

that the report does not come to a bottom line conclusion.  As I noted earlier, we have 

limited experience with this monitoring, and there is no widely accepted basis for 

reaching a bottom line.  Thus, the purpose of the report is to provide a common platform 

and set of readings from which policymakers and other interested parties can form their 

own views.  Individual policymakers will sometimes differ in their assessments and on 

the relative weight they put on particular vulnerabilities.  My own assessment is that, 

while risks are above normal in some areas and below normal in others, overall financial 

stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level.13   

In my view, the most important feature of the stability landscape is the strength of 

the financial system.  The risks of destabilizing runs are far lower than in the past.  The 

institutions at the heart of the financial system are more resilient.  The stress tests 

routinely feature extremely severe downturns in business credit, and the largest banks 

have the capital and liquidity to continue to function under such circumstances.  Because 

this core resilience is so important, we are committed to preserving and strengthening the 

key improvements since the crisis, particularly those in capital, liquidity, stress testing, 

and resolution. 

                                                 
13 The staff have also assessed financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate.  For instance, see the minutes 
of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, July 31-August 1, 2018, available on the Boardâ€™s website
