themselves.  The theory behind the Federal Reserve’s actions was fairly clear:  Arbitrage 

between short- and long-term markets is not perfect even when markets are functioning 

smoothly, and arbitrage is especially impaired during panics when investors are putting an 

unusually large premium on the liquidity and safety of short-term instruments.  In these 

circumstances, purchasing longer-term assets (and thus taking interest rate risk from the market) 

pushes up the prices of the securities, thereby lowering their yields.  But by how much and for 

how long?  Good studies of these sorts of actions also are sparse.  Currently, we are relying in 

large part on event studies analyzing how much interest rates declined when purchases were 

announced in the United States or abroad.  According to these studies, spreads on mortgage-

related assets fell sharply on November 25, 2008, when the Federal Reserve announced that it 

would initiate a program to purchase agency debt and agency MBS.  A similar pattern for 

Treasury yields was observed following the release of the March 2009 FOMC statement, when 

purchases of longer-term Treasury securities were announced.6

                                                           
6 Treasury yields also declined notably on December 1, 2008, following a speech by the Chairman noting that the 
Federal Reserve could purchase longer-term Treasury securities in substantial quantities.  See Ben S. Bernanke 
(2008), “Federal Reserve Policies in the Financial Crisis,” speech delivered at the Greater Austin Chamber of 
Commerce, Austin, Tex., December 1, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm. 

  Effectiveness, however, is hard 

to quantify, partly because we are uncertain about how, exactly, the purchases put downward 

pressure on interest rates.  My presumption has been that the effect comes mainly from the total 

amount we purchase relative to the total stock of debt outstanding.  However, others have argued 

that the market effect derives importantly from the flow of our purchases relative to the amount 

of new issuance in the market.  Some evidence for the primacy of the stock channel has 

accumulated recently, as the recent end of the MBS purchase program does not appear to have 

had significant adverse effects in mortgage markets.
