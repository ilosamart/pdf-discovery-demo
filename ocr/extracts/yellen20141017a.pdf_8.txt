families severely, pushing them well down the wealth distribution.  Figure 6 shows that 

homeowners in the bottom half of households by wealth reported 61 percent less home 

equity in 2013 than in 2007.  The next 45 reported a 29 percent loss of housing wealth, 

and the top 5 lost 20 percent. 

Fortunately, rebounding housing prices in 2013 and 2014 have restored a good 

deal of the loss in housing wealth, with the largest gains for those toward the bottom.  

Based on rising home prices alone and not counting possible changes in mortgage debt or 

other factors, Federal Reserve staff estimate that between 2013 and mid-2014, average 

home equity rose 49 percent for the lowest half of families by wealth that own homes.12  

The estimated gains are somewhat less for those with greater wealth.13  Homeowners in 

the bottom 50, which had an average overall net worth of $25,000 in 2013, would have 

seen their net worth increase to an average of $33,000 due solely to home price gains 

since 2013, a 32 percent increase.  

Another major source of wealth for many families is financial assets, including 

stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and private pensions.14  Figure 7 shows that the wealthiest 

5 percent of households held nearly two-thirds of all such assets in 2013, the next 

45 percent of families held about one-third, and the bottom half of households, just 

2 percent.  This figure may look familiar, since the distribution of financial wealth has 

                                                 
12 The house price data used are from CoreLogic, and data track price changes at the Core Based Statistical 

Area level between the survey month in 2013 and June 2014.  The average increase in home prices over 

this period was 8 percent.  No adjustments are made to account for possible changes in mortgage leverage. 
13 Home price gains in 2013 and 2014 are estimated to have raised the home equity of home-owning 

households in the next 45 percent of households in the wealth distribution by 12 percent, and by 9 percent 

for home-owning households in the top 5 percent of the wealth distribution. 
14 The SCF defines financial assets as liquid assets, certificates of deposit, directly held pooled investment 

funds, stocks, bonds, quasi-liquid assets (including retirement accounts), savings bonds, whole life 

insurance, other managed assets, and other financial assets.
