Some argue that the downward march of the dots has damaged the Committee’s 

credibility.  For me, the story is both more complicated and more interesting.  Like Jon, I 

do not think of the dot plot as a useful predictor of near-term policy moves.  But that is 

not to say that the dot plot is without value.  Indeed, changes in the SEP and the dot plot 

over time have been quite revealing about the evolution of policymakers’ views about the 

path of policy. 

In recent years, FOMC participants have significantly revised their views about 

the values to which key economic variables will converge over the longer run.  The same 

is true of many other economic forecasters.  Since the beginning of 2012, participants’ 

views about the longer-run annual growth potential of the economy have dropped from 

2.45 percent to 1.85 percent (figure 4).15  Much of the downward revision in estimates of 

longer-run potential growth reflects the implications of demographic trends and the 

slowdown in productivity growth.16  These structural factors have also weighed on 

participants’ assessments of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate--the rate that would 

be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its 

                                                 
overnight index swap (OIS) paths are estimated using a spline approach; each line corresponds to the 
estimated path on the day before the release of SEP projections.  OIS paths are mean forecasts of market 
participants and may be influenced by variations in risk premiums over time.  The primary dealer survey 
paths are medians of modal forecasts, and the survey responses are collected about a week before the SEP 
projections are released. 
15 Other forecasters--for instance, Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters--have also revised 
down their estimates for longer-run real gross domestic product (GDP) growth.  See Jerome H. Powell 
(2016), “Recent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the Economy, and Monetary Policy,” 
speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, May 26, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160526a.htm.  In making these comparisons, I 
use the midpoint of the central tendency for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate.
