percent per annum.  The emerging market economies have likewise led the way in the 

recovery from the global financial crisis:  From 2008 to 2010, real gross domestic 

product (GDP) rose cumulatively by about 10 percent in the emerging market economies 

even as GDP was essentially unchanged, on net, in the advanced economies.3   

Naturally, increased economic activity in emerging market economies has 

increased global demand for raw materials.  Moreover, the heavy emphasis on industrial 

development in many emerging market economies has led their growth to be particularly 

intensive in the use of commodities, even as the consumption of commodities in 

advanced economies has stabilized or declined.  For example, world oil consumption rose 

by 14 percent from 2000 to 2010; underlying this overall trend, however, was a 

40 percent increase in oil use in emerging market economies and an outright decline of 

4-1/2 percent in the advanced economies.  In particular, U.S. oil consumption was about 

2-1/2 percent lower in 2010 than in 2000, with net imports of oil down nearly 10 percent, 

even though U.S. real GDP rose by nearly 20 percent over that period. 

  This dramatic shift in the sources of demand for commodities is not unique to oil.  

If anything, the pattern is even more striking for industrial metals, where double-digit 

percentage rates of decline in consumption by the advanced economies over the past 

decade have been overwhelmed by triple-digit percentage increases in consumption by 

the emerging market economies.4  Likewise, improving diets in the emerging market 

economies have significantly increased their demand for agricultural commodities.

The difference between the advanced and emerging market economies is also evident in the statistics on 
industrial production, which is perhaps more directly relevant to the demand for commodities.  According 
to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, from March 2009 to March 2010, industrial 
production rose 26 percent in the emerging market economies and 11 percent in the advanced economies. 
4 A portion of commodity use in the emerging market economies serves as inputs to the production of 
exports, some of which are ultimately consumed in advanced economies.
