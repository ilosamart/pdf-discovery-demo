Banking and Financial Conditions 

While conditions in some financial markets have improved markedly in recent 

months, conditions in the banking sector continue to be weak.  The largest banks were 

modestly profitable during 2009, but community banks as a group reported a loss of $4.1 

billion and showed a negative return on assets of 0.17 percent.  Community bank losses 

were driven primarily by large loan loss provision expenses, as well as a decline in net 

interest margins related in part to a substantial increase in nonperforming assets.   

There are signs that these problems might be reaching a plateau in some loan 

categories, but delinquencies and charge-off rates grew steadily last year and the 

nonperforming assets ratio for community banks is now approaching five percent, a level 

considerably higher than the previous highs reached in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In 

addition, although capital ratios at many banks have improved substantially since the start 

of the crisis, other institutions continue to face serious questions about capital adequacy 

due to weak loan quality, subpar earnings, and uncertainty about future conditions.  

Together, these developments have led to an increase in the number of problem banks to 

the highest level since the early 1990s.  The rate of bank failures has accelerated and 

appears likely to remain elevated for some time.  While most banks remain sound, 

appropriately capitalized, and profitable, this can be difficult to remember in the midst of 

strained banking conditions and weekly bank failures.       

The coordinated efforts and initiatives of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury 

Department, and other government agencies have contributed to the progress we have 

achieved in stabilizing the financial markets and the banking system.  I think it is
