many estimates of its natural rate.  But the unemployment rate probably understates the 

amount of slack still remaining in the labor market.  The labor force participation rate 

continues to be unusually low, suggesting that potential workers may be waiting on the 

sidelines for further improvements in job opportunities and wages.  The number working 

part time who want full-time jobs also remains elevated.  The low level of wage increases 

also suggests additional slack. 

 The Committee said that it will want to be reasonably confident that inflation will 

move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  On a 12-month basis, headline inflation 

in February, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, stood at 

0.3 percent; meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food 

components, was 1.4 percent.  These low current readings are partly a consequence of 

two transient shocks--the dramatic decline in oil prices and the effect of the appreciation 

of the dollar on import prices.  Before those shocks, both headline inflation and core 

inflation were running at about 1.5 percent.  When the effects of these shocks pass, I 

expect that inflation will return roughly to those earlier levels and then rise gradually to 

our 2 percent objective over the medium term as labor and product markets tighten 

further.  Despite the current low inflation readings, survey-based measures of inflation 

expectations in the United States have been stable.  However, market-based readings on 

inflation compensation have declined significantly since mid-2014.  I view this decline as 

more likely reflecting movements in risk premiums and other transitory factors, rather 

than shifts in longer-term inflation expectations.  Still, it will be important to keep an eye 

on the performance of inflation breakevens.
