First, not all states have passed legislation that is needed to permit land banks.  Second, 

this is difficult work, and existing land banks have limited capacity to handle high 

numbers of properties at a time.  More funding and technical assistance would be needed 

to scale these efforts up to an adequate level.  Of course, new funds are hard to come by 

in the current fiscal environment, but this appears to be an instance where relatively 

modest investments have the potential to yield significant benefits, such as reduced crime 

stemming from vacant properties, lower municipal costs to limit property deterioration or 

provide services to neighborhoods that are largely vacant, higher property tax revenue 

derived from property values not being unduly depressed, and other benefits that may be 

realized.   

Conclusion 

These are my thoughts on some of the things that can be done in the near term to 

help the housing market stabilize and rebalance.  An immediate priority is balancing 

supply and demand in a market overwhelmed by financially stressed homeowners, tight 

credit conditions, and an unusually high number of foreclosed homes.  It is an important 

part of rebuilding our market for housing and housing finance, but it is only a part.  In 

addition, we must think carefully about longer-term policy and market changes that may 

affect Americansâ€™ housing options for years and even decades to come.  This is important 

work, and I appreciate your participation in the forum today. 

Thank you.
