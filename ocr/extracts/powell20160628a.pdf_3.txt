How should we evaluate our current performance against the dual mandate?  I 

would say that we have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, 

although there is still some room for improvement.  We have more work to do to assure 

that inflation moves back up to our 2 percent goal.   

Let’s start with the employment mandate.  After several years of strong job 

growth, employment is now over 5 million higher than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.  The 

unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in May, essentially 

at the level that many observers identify as the natural rate.  This rate is very far from a 

bright line--it cannot be observed directly, and estimates of its level are subject to great 

uncertainty.1  So we look to a wide range of labor market indicators to assess the overall 

health of the labor market.  Many of those indicators suggest that the labor market is 

strong.  To mention a few of these, job openings are at an all-time high by some 

measures.  The “quits” rate--the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs--is 

about at pre-crisis levels. Surveys of individuals and businesses suggest that the ease of 

finding and filling jobs is similar to that experienced in the mid-2000s. 

Even though we are near the natural rate of unemployment, there is still room for 

improvement on several margins.  Important among these is the labor force participation 

rate.  If someone leaves the labor force for any reason, even temporarily, that person is 

not counted as unemployed.  So the labor force participation rate is also a key 

determinant of the unemployment rate.  Labor force participation is influenced by many 

                                                   
1 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the 
parameter estimates given the model.  The canonical paper by Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock and Mark 
W. Watson (1997), “How Precise are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?,” in Christina D. 
Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press) puts the 95 percent confidence interval at 1½ percentage points on either side of the point 
estimate.
