In January 2012, the Committee first released its Statement on Longer-Run Goals 

and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed annually.  This consensus statement 

serves as a quasi-constitutional document that clarifies that the Committee’s inflation 

objective is 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the PCE price index, that this

nonmonetary factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market, and that 

the Committee will take a balanced approach to promote its objectives of maximum 

employment and 2 percent inflation under circumstances in which the Committee judges

Compared with a decade ago, FOMC participants express their views more

FOMC participants now speak longer than they did before 2006, and they typically make 

their remarks prior to hearing the policy views of the Chair.  Since September 2010, the 

minutes have included paragraphs that reflect the views on monetary policy expressed by

policy as defined by the value of the federal funds rate target or the midpoint of the federal funds rate target 
range at the end of each calendar year of the SEP forecast.
