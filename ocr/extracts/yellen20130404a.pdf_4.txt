FOMC communication has long been a topic of great interest to me, and one I 

have worked on more directly since 2010, when Chairman Bernanke asked me to lead a 

new FOMC subcommittee on communications.  This is probably a good moment to 

remind you that, as always, I speak for myself and not the FOMC or my colleagues in the 

Federal Reserve System.   

From “Never Explain” to Transparency 

Recently I used the word “revolution” to describe the change from “never 

explain” to the current embrace of transparency in the FOMC’s communication.3  That 

might sound surprising to an audience that knows very well what it feels like to be in the 

middle of a communications revolution.  The speed and frequency of most 

communication, it seems, never stops growing, and I will admit that the FOMC’s changes 

to the pace and form of its communication seem rather modest in comparison.  I’ve 

mentioned the Chairman’s quarterly postmeeting press conferences, which were initiated 

two years ago.  While these events are televised and streamed live, the mode for most of 

the FOMC’s communication is decidedly old-school--the printed word.  The 

Committee’s most watched piece of communication is the written statement issued after 

each of its meetings, which are held roughly every six weeks.  It may seem quaint that 

my colleagues and I continue to spend many hours laboring over the few hundred words 

in this statement, which are then extensively analyzed only minutes after their release. 

The revolution in the FOMC’s communication, however, isn’t about technology 

or speed.  It’s a revolution in our understanding of how communication can influence the 

effectiveness of monetary policy.
