know in advance how term premiums will respond when U.S. normalization gets under 

way.  To the extent that the commencement of normalization leads to relatively greater 

demand for U.S. assets, we could see echoes of the so-called conundrum in the period 

from 2004 to 2005, when rising short-term rates were accompanied by falling forward 

rates.  But the reverse is also possible, with term premiums moving more steeply than 

appropriate for underlying economic conditions, which we saw in the so-called taper 

tantrum episode in 2013. 

Certainly, my colleagues and I are mindful of recent episodes in which we have 

seen unusually sharp spikes in market volatility.  Accordingly, I expect that the FOMC 

will continue proceeding to the greatest extent possible in a very deliberate manner, 

aiming to provide clear communications about Committee members’ assessments of the 

economic and policy outlook.  

Based on today’s picture of moderate underlying momentum in the domestic 

economy and the likelihood of continued crosscurrents from abroad, the process of 

normalizing monetary policy is likely to be gradual.  It is also important to remember that 

the stance of monetary policy will remain highly accommodative even after the federal 

funds rate moves off the effective lower bound, because the real federal funds rate will 

initially still be low and because of the elevated size of the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet and the associated downward pressure on long-term rates.  Moreover, the FOMC 

has stated clearly that it will reduce the size of the balance sheet in a gradual and 

predictable manner starting at an appropriate time after liftoff, which will depend on how 

economic and financial conditions evolve.
