demand falls, then long-term interest rates will decline.  Todayâ€™s very low level of long-

term rates suggests that both of these factors are at play.   

   Both expectations of slower growth and the aging of our population are having 

significant effects on desired saving and investment and are thus important causes of 

lower interest rates.  If the economy is expanding more slowly, then the level of 

investment needed to meet demand will be lower.  The lower path of growth reduces 

future income prospects of households, and they will tend to raise their saving.  The 

pending retirement of baby boomers means higher saving, because people tend to save 

the most in the years just before their retirement.  In addition, the lower rate of return on 

capital owing to lower productivity growth will lead to less investment and lower interest 

rates. 

As with productivity, the factors behind the fall in U.S. interest rates include an 

important global component, as rates are low around the world.  Indeed, although our 

rates are near historical lows, U.S. Treasury rates are among the highest among the major 

advanced economy sovereigns (figure 14).    

Is This the New Normal? 

What can we do to prevent low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates from 

becoming the new normal?  We need to focus on ways to increase our long-term growth 

and spread that prosperity as broadly as possible.  I hasten to add that these policies are, 

for the most part, outside the purview of the Federal Reserve.  We need policies that 

support productivity growth, business hiring and investment, labor force participation, 

and the development of skills.  We need effective fiscal and regulatory policies that 

inspire public confidence.  Increased spending on public infrastructure may raise private-
