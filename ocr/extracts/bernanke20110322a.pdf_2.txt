It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak once again before the Independent 

Community Bankers of America (ICBA).  This is the sixth consecutive year that I’ve met with 

you at this event, and the themes of my remarks over the years tell a story not only about the 

financial and economic upheaval that we have all experienced, but also about some of the very 

difficult issues that continue to confront both bankers and policymakers today.  Back in 2006, 

less than two months after I started as Chairman, I spoke to you about the strong performance of 

community banks as well as about some important longer-term challenges.  In subsequent years, 

my remarks touched on the need to strengthen regulation and supervision of Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac, approaches to reducing preventable mortgage foreclosures, community banking 

and the financial crisis, and then last year, the need to address the problem of financial 

institutions that are “too big to fail.”  My themes today are the vital role that community banks 

need to play in the economic recovery, the value that the Federal Reserve places on insights from 

community banks, and the evolving regulatory environment. 

Community Banks and the Economic Recovery 

To me, the title of the 2009 ICBA annual report, Empowering Main Street, is a concise 

and accurate description of the critical role that community banks play in the U.S. economy.  

Community bankers live and work where they do business, and their institutions have deep roots, 

sometimes established over several generations.  They know their customers and the local 

economy.  Relationship banking is therefore at the core of community banking.  The largest 

banks typically rely heavily on statistical models to assess borrowers’ capital, collateral, and 

capacity to repay, and those approaches can add value, but banks whose headquarters and key 

decisionmakers are hundreds or thousands of miles away inevitably lack the in-depth local 

knowledge that community banks use to assess character and conditions when making credit
