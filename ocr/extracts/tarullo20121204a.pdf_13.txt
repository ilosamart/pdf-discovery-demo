effective and efficient ways to deal with short-term funding markets, often characterized 

as the shadow banking system, that are inherently subject to runs. 

Requiring minimum levels of long-term debt   

Proposals to require large financial firms to hold minimum levels of long-term 

debt are offered as a way to facilitate the orderly resolution of such firms.  Variations on 

this general theme have gathered momentum as the Financial Stability Board, the Basel 

Committee on Banking Supervision, and other groups have explored ways to make large 

financial firms more readily resolvable, thereby giving national authorities a third choice 

between the unattractive options of bailout and disorderly failure. 

The basic idea is that the maintenance of minimum levels of long-term debt at the 

top holding company level will allow a resolving authority to transfer operating 

subsidiaries of the failed firm to a functioning bridge entity, while leaving behind in a 

receivership the equity and sufficient long-term debt to absorb the original firm’s losses.  

Eventually, the resolving authority could recapitalize the bridge entity by exchanging 

claims of the long-term unsecured creditors of the parent for equity, long-term debt of the 

bridge, or both.  In the United States, this approach is consonant with the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Company’s stated preference for a “single-entry” strategy in dealing with the 

resolution of systemically important firms under the orderly liquidation authority of the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  But it 

is also consistent with variants on resolution mechanisms being implemented in other 

jurisdictions around the world. 

A minimum long-term debt requirement could lend greater confidence that the 

combination of equity owners and long-term debt holders would be sufficient to bear all
