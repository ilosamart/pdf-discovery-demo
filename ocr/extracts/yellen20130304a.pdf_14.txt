meetings as well.  I see the currently available evidence as suggesting that our asset 

purchases have been reasonably efficacious in stimulating spending.  There is 

considerable evidence that these purchases have eased financial conditions, and so have 

presumably increased interest-sensitive spending.

  Research suggests that our purchases 

of mortgage-backed securities pushed down MBS yields and that MBS yields pass 

through, with a lag, to mortgage rates.

  Indeed, I see the recent strength in housing and 

consumer durables, such as motor vehicle purchases, as partly reflecting the effect of 

reduced borrowing costs.  Plausible, albeit uncertain, estimates of the ultimate economic 

effect of asset purchases can be obtained from simulations of the Board’s FRB/US model.  

Such simulations suggest that a hypothetical program involving $500 billion in longer-

term asset purchases would serve to lower the unemployment rate by close to 

¼ percentage point within three years while keeping inflation close to the Committee’s 

2 percent objective. 

One issue on which there has been considerable debate is whether low interest 

rates are doing as much to promote economic growth since the financial crisis as they 

would have before the financial crisis--whether the interest rate channel of transmission 

for monetary policy has been attenuated.  I agree with those who think this channel has 

been partially blocked.  Individuals who have impaired credit histories, have been 

unemployed, or hold underwater mortgages are experiencing great difficulty gaining 

access to credit, whether to buy or refinance a home, finance a small business, or support

 Empirical studies have drawn on the experience of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases in 

recent years, as well as from earlier episodes in the United States and from the experience with asset 

purchases in the United Kingdom.  See, for example, D’Amico and King (forthcoming), D’Amico and 

others (2012), Gagnon and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Joyce and others (2011), 

Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011), and Swanson (2011).
