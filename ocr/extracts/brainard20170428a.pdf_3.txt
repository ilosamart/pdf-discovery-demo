apps were not created or even envisaged by Apple.  These apps have been downloaded 130 

billion times, generating over $50 billion in revenue for third-party developers.6  

The iPhone is a key platform on which that app ecosystem operates.  How did that 

happen?  Apple essentially made the smartphone a toolkit for third-party developers to 

experiment, innovate, build, and scale new apps.  It did so by investing heavily in developing 

open application programming interfaces (APIs) that provided third-party developers clear 

instructions and open access to the iPhone platform. This strategy enabled those outside 

developers to build new applications that delivered Apple’s customers additional value by taking 

advantage of the existing functionality of the iPhone.  Specifically, this open architecture makes 

available to outside developers clear instructions that enable them to use the iPhone’s various 

sensors, processors, displays, and other interfaces in combination with their own code to develop 

new products. 

On top of that, a robust secondary layer of developers use the APIs of other developers in 

their technology stacks to quickly assemble new business models.  Take ride-sharing services, 

for instance. They have built multibillion-dollar businesses that are, in large part, dependent on 

combinations of APIs from different companies.  They may use Google Maps’ APIs for location 

services, Stripe or Braintree’s APIs for payments, Twilio’s APIs for text messaging, and Amazon 

Web Services’ or IBM’s APIs for computing power.  All of these products, and more, work 

seamlessly together in real time to provide products that are so ubiquitous that we now use them 

as verbs for how we navigate the world.  We “Uber” to the store or “Snapchat” a friend.
