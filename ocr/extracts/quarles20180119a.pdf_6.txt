comprehensive and substantial undertaking as well as a five-agency endeavor.  As such, it will 

naturally take a bit of work for the agencies to congeal around a thoughtful Volcker rule 2.0 

proposal for public review.  Volcker rule reform remains a priority in the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

regulatory efforts.  

Emerging Areas for Review 

With that update on the familiar, I will turn to my own impressions of what is next for 

post-crisis regulation.  In my early days as the Vice Chairman for Supervision, I asked our staff

earlier--capital, stress testing, liquidity, and resolution.  The objective is to consider the effect of 

those regulatory frameworks on resiliency and resolvability of the financial system, on credit

a comprehensive and serious process, and work is still underway.  I should note, however, that I 

have already formed views on a few areas that warrant more focus, and that I will be working 

with my colleagues on the Board to constructively consider.   

I will start with the issue of tailoring supervision and regulation to the size, systemic 

footprint, risk profile, and business model of banking firms.  The Federal Reserve has devoted 

considerable energy in its post-crisis regulatory work to incorporate the tailoring concept in its

the other banking agencies to do on the tailoring front.   

I would emphasize that tailoring is not an objective limited in scope to a subset of the 

smallest firms.  As my colleagues and I have said before, the character of our regulation should
