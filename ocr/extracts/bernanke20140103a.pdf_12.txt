credit creation.  Staff members are investigating the potential of this and other regulatory 

tools, such as cyclically sensitive loan-to-value requirements for mortgages, to improve 

financial stability.  A number of countries, including both advanced and emerging-market 

economies, have already deployed such measures, and their experiences should be 

instructive.  Although, in principle, monetary policy can be used to address financial 

imbalances, the presumption remains that macroprudential tools, together with well-

focused traditional regulation and supervision, should serve as the first line of defense 

against emerging threats to financial stability.  However, more remains to be done to 

better understand how to design and implement more effective macroprudential tools and 

how these tools interact with monetary policy. 

Monetary Policy  

While liquidity provision and other emergency steps were critical to stemming the 

financial panic, a rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy was necessary to counteract 

the massive economic blow delivered by the crisis.  The FOMC reduced the target federal 

funds rate from 5-1/4 percent in the summer of 2007 to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the 

end of 2008, a very rapid easing.  The federal funds rate has been at its effective lower 

bound since then.   

To provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint 

imposed by the effective lower bound on interest rates, the Federal Reserve turned to two 

alternative tools:  enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal 

funds rate and large-scale purchases of longer-term securities for the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

portfolio.  Other major central banks have responded to developments since 2008 in 

roughly similar ways.  For example, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have
