with capital outflows and financial tightening against a backdrop of weakening economic 

growth and financial imbalances.  For these economies, while exchange rate depreciation 

can help offset weaker demand for exports and tighter financial conditions, it also puts 

upward pressure on inflation and may create problems for corporations with considerable 

foreign-currency denominated debt.  In the case of China, a previously set course of tying 

the renminbi to the U.S. dollar led to an appreciation of the currency from mid-2014 to 

mid-2015 in an economy that was already slowing.  Attempts to offset the effects of this 

undesired appreciation have had mixed results.   

Discontinuity around the Zero Lower Bound 

If the research is correct in concluding that the channels for spillovers do not 

differ, these episodes should have played out little differently for conventional policy 

changes than they did for unconventional policy.  That raises the question of why 

announcements of new policy actions around the zero lower bound have elicited such 

intense reactions.  The launch of the Federal Reserve’s second asset purchase program in 

November 2010, for instance, sparked a blistering response from several foreign 

policymakers.  One foreign finance ministry official was famously quoted as denouncing 

it as “clueless,” while others dubbed it the start of a “currency war.”  Officials from 

emerging markets with managed exchange rates argued that the United States “has not 

fully taken into consideration the shock of excessive capital flows to the financial 

stability of emerging markets.”5
