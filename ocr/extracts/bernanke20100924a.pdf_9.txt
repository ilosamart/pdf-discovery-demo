Because the runs on the shadow banking system occurred in a historically 

unfamiliar context, outside the commercial banking system, both the private sector and 

the regulators insufficiently anticipated the risk that such runs might occur.  However, 

once the threat became apparent, two centuries of economic thinking on runs and panics 

were available to inform the diagnosis and the policy response.  In particular, in the 

recent episode, central banks around the world followed the dictum set forth by Bagehot 

in 1873:  To avert or contain panics, central banks should lend freely to solvent 

institutions, against good collateral.4

  The Federal Reserve indeed acted quickly to 

provide liquidity to the banking system, for example, by easing lending terms at the 

discount window and establishing regular auctions in which banks could bid for term 

central bank credit.  Invoking emergency powers not used since the 1930s, the Federal 

Reserve also found ways to provide liquidity to critical parts of the shadow banking 

system, including securities dealers, the commercial paper market, money market mutual 

funds, and the asset-backed securities market.  For today’s purposes, my point is not to 

review this history but instead to point out that, in its policy response, the Fed was relying 

4 Bagehot also suggested that “these loans should only be made at a very high rate of interest” (Lombard 
Street, p. 99; see note 2).  Some modern commentators have rationalized Bagehot’s dictum to lend at a high 
or “penalty” rate as a way to mitigate moral hazard--that is, to help maintain incentives for private-sector 
banks to provide for adequate liquidity in advance of any crisis.  However, the risk of moral hazard did not 
appear to be Bagehot’s principal motivation for recommending a high rate; rather, he saw it as a tool to 
dissuade unnecessary borrowing and thus help protect the Bank of England’s own finite store of liquid 
assets.  See Bernanke, “Liquidity Provision,” in note 2 for further documentation.  Today, potential 
limitations on the central bank’s lending capacity are not nearly so pressing an issue as in Bagehot’s time, 
when the central bank’s ability to provide liquidity was far more tenuous.  Generally, the Federal Reserve 
lent at rates above the “normal” rate for the market but lower than the rate prevailing in distressed and 
illiquid markets.  This strategy provided needed liquidity while encouraging borrowers to return to private 
markets when conditions normalized.
