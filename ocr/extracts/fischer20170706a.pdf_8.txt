Labor Quality 

Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital--

workersâ€™ knowledge and skills.  Such investment is a particular issue because most 

forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment--both for college and high 

school--may soon come to an end.  One area where policy may play a role is promoting 

educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively 

low. 

Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early 

childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups.  Such programs increase 

high school graduation, promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their 

parents, and produce other socially beneficial outcomes, such as greater health. 13   

At the other end of the education process, a college degree has long been 

considered a worthwhile investment, and thus our society should promote access to and 

readiness for college among a broad range of individuals--in particular through federal 

support for need-based financial aid.14 

Lastly, I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our 

workforce is closely tied to public health.  A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the 

U.S. population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons.  Workers too ill to 

perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole.  

Research has shown just such a trend among prime-age non-Hispanic Americans without 

                                                 
13 Research on the effect of early childhood education is surveyed in Elango and others (2015).  Garcia and 
others (2017) consider the effect over the full life cycle of an early childhood program targeting 
disadvantaged families and estimate an internal rate of return of nearly 14 percent. 
14 Dynarski and Scott-Clayton (2013) review the evidence that college enrollment rates are positively 
affected by student aid.
