which are liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks, and deposit accounts, which are liabilities of a 

bank or another regulated depository institution backed by federal insurance up to a specific 

level.  And while a typical cryptocurrency may be used in payments, it is not legal tender, in 

contrast to U.S. currency.   

A typical cryptocurrency relies on the use of distributed ledger technology, which 

provides a new way to keep ownership records and transfer ownership from one user to another, 

often with little to no information about the identity of the owner.  For instance, Bitcoin relies on 

the blockchain, which is run by anonymous computers all over the world linked together through 

a ledger of anonymized transactions.  Digital currencies use automation via computer processing 

power, networking via the internet, and cryptography to transfer value from one person to 

another.  What is innovative is that the computer code behind these transactions uses automated 

checks and balances to validate the sender and receiver, and whether there is enough value in the 

sender’s account to make the payment.  Traditionally, this validation would be done by banks 

and payment networks.  Instead, with a cryptocurrency, this validation could be done by anyone 

with enough computing power and resources to participate.  Importantly, this technology is not 

owned or managed by any entity--regulated or not--that would be responsible for its 

maintenance, security, and reliability.  Rather, its maintenance, security, and reliability are 

handled by a decentralized developer community, which often lacks strong governance.   

 This combination of a new asset, which is not a liability of any individual or institution, 

and a new recordkeeping and transfer technology, which is not maintained by any single 

individual or institution, illustrates the powerful capabilities of today’s technologies. But there 

are also serious challenges. For instance, cryptocurrencies have exhibited periods of extreme 

volatility.  If you purchased Bitcoin in December 2017 at a value of over $19,000, your
