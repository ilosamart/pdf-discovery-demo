At present, our monitoring does find some evidence of increased duration and 

credit risk, but the increases appear relatively moderate to date--particularly at the largest 

banks and life insurers.  Moreover, valuations for broad categories of assets such as real 

estate and corporate equities remain within historical norms, suggesting that valuation 

pressures, if present, are confined to narrower segments of assets.  For example, 

valuations do appear stretched for farmland, although recent data are suggesting some 

slowing, and for the equity prices of some small technology firms. 

Still, there are areas where investors appear to have been very sanguine regarding 

certain types of exposure and modest in their demands for compensation to assume such 

risk.  High-yield corporate bond and leveraged loan funds, for instance, have seen strong 

inflows, reflecting greater investor appetite for risky corporate credits, while underwriting 

standards have deteriorated, raising the possibility of large losses going forward.   

In these circumstances, it has to date seemed appropriate to rely on supervisory 

responses.  For example, in the face of substantial growth in the volume of leveraged 

lending and the deterioration in underwriting standards, the Federal Reserve, the Office 

of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued 

updated guidance on leverage lending in March 2013.6  This guidance outlined principles 

related to safe and sound leveraged lending activities, including the expectation that 

banks and thrifts originate leveraged loans using prudent underwriting standards 

regardless of their intent to hold or distribute them.     

In addition, the Federal Reserve, alongside other regulators, has been working 

with the firms we supervise to increase their resilience to possible interest rate shocks.
