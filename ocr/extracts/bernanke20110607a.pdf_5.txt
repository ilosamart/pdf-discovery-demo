continued to fall.  The housing sector typically plays an important role in economic 

recoveries; the depressed state of housing in the United States is a big reason that the 

current recovery is less vigorous than we would like.  

Developments in the public sector also help determine the pace of recovery.  

Here, too, the picture is one of relative weakness.  Fiscally constrained state and local 

governments continue to cut spending and employment.  Moreover, the impetus provided 

to the growth of final demand by federal fiscal policies continues to wane.   

The prospect of increasing fiscal drag on the recovery highlights one of the many 

difficult tradeoffs faced by fiscal policymakers:  If the nation is to have a healthy 

economic future, policymakers urgently need to put the federal government’s finances on 

a sustainable trajectory.  But, on the other hand, a sharp fiscal consolidation focused on 

the very near term could be self-defeating if it were to undercut the still-fragile recovery.  

The solution to this dilemma, I believe, lies in recognizing that our nation’s fiscal 

problems are inherently long-term in nature.  Consequently, the appropriate response is to 

move quickly to enact a credible, long-term plan for fiscal consolidation.  By taking 

decisions today that lead to fiscal consolidation over a longer horizon, policymakers can 

avoid a sudden fiscal contraction that could put the recovery at risk.  At the same time, 

establishing a credible plan for reducing future deficits now would not only enhance 

economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading 

to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. 

The Outlook for Inflation 

 Let me turn to the outlook for inflation.  As you all know, over the past year, 

prices for many commodities have risen sharply, resulting in significantly higher
