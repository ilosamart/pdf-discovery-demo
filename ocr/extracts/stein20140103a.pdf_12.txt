bank investors, shadow bank investors cannot afford to sleep through time 1; their ability 

to pull the plug at this interim date is essential to keeping their claim safe. 

For any given asset i, the key question is, which type of intermediary--traditional 

bank or shadow bank--will end up holding the asset in equilibrium, and in what relative 

proportions?  The answer to this question turns on the following tradeoff.  On the one 

hand, since banks finance themselves with more equity and less cheap “money” than 

shadow banks, their overall cost of financing is higher, which puts them at a 

disadvantage.  On the other hand, their more conservative capital structure means that 

banks’ deposits never run on them.  Hence, unlike shadow banks, they are never forced to 

liquidate assets at temporarily low prices when there is bad news at time 1; they can 

simply ride out this bad news and hold on to their investments until prices recover at time 

2.  In other words, as compared with shadow banks, traditional banks pay more to have a 

stabler funding structure, which is especially helpful for investing in those assets for 

which fire-sale discounts are high. 

To close the model, we need to endogenize the fire-sale discount factor, ki.  We 

assume that this fire-sale discount depends in part on the amount of liquidations at time 1, 

which is in turn related to the extent of ownership of asset i by the shadow banking 

sector--the more the shadow banking sector owns, the more gets dumped at time 1, and 

hence the lower is the fire-sale price.  This assumption implies that the fire-sale discount 

plays an important equilibrating role in the model, and that we can have interior 

equilibria in which the ownership of a given asset i is divided across the traditional 

banking and shadow banking sectors; as ownership migrates to shadow banks, the fire-

sale discount widens, which tends to reduce the relative advantage of shadow banks.
