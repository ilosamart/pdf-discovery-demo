happiness and life satisfaction are perhaps more closely related to participating 

meaningfully in a network of friends, family, and community than any other factor.11  I 

urge you to take this research to heart by making time for friends and family and by being 

part of and contributing to a larger community.  

 Another factor in happiness, perhaps less obvious, is based on the concept of 

“flow.”12  When you are working, studying, or pursuing a hobby, do you sometimes 

become so engrossed in what you are doing that you totally lose track of time?  That 

feeling is called flow.  If you never have that feeling, you should find some new 

activities--whether work or hobbies. 

Another finding is that happy people feel in control of their own lives.  A sense of 

control can be obtained by actively setting goals that are both challenging and achievable.  

Ultimately, though, there are many things in our lives we cannot control.  So it also is 

important to recognize what is and is not within our control, to cultivate the flexibility to 

accept unexpected change with equanimity, and to focus our efforts on achieving goals at 

the limit of, but still within, our reach. 

Finally--and this is one of the most intriguing findings--happiness can be 

promoted by fighting the natural human tendency to become entirely adapted to your 

circumstances.  One interesting practical suggestion is to keep a “gratitude journal,” in 

which you routinely list experiences and circumstances for which you are grateful.13

Being,” note 7.

York:  Harper and Row); and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1998), Finding Flow:  The Psychology of 
Engagement with Everyday Life (New York:  Basic Books).
