My remarks today will focus on recent and prospective developments in the labor 

market.  We have seen some positive signs on the jobs front recently, including a pickup 

in monthly payroll gains and a notable decline in the unemployment rate.  That is good 

news.  At the same time, some key questions are unresolved.  For example, the better jobs 

numbers seem somewhat out of sync with the overall pace of economic expansion.  What 

explains this apparent discrepancy and what implications does it have for the future 

course of the labor market and the economy? 

Importantly, despite the recent improvement, the job market remains far from 

normal; for example, the number of people working and total hours worked are still 

significantly below pre-crisis peaks, while the unemployment rate remains well above 

what most economists judge to be its long-run sustainable level.  Of particular concern is 

the large number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months.  Long-

term unemployment is particularly costly to those directly affected, of course.  But in 

addition, because of its negative effects on workers’ skills and attachment to the labor 

force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our 

economy.  The debate about how best to address long-term unemployment raises another 

important question:  Is the current high level of long-term unemployment primarily the 

result of cyclical factors, such as insufficient aggregate demand, or of structural changes, 

such as a worsening mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ requirements?  If 

cyclical factors predominate, then policies that support a broader economic recovery 

should be effective in addressing long-term unemployment as well; if the causes are 

structural, then other policy tools will be needed.  I will argue today that, while both 

cyclical and structural forces have doubtless contributed to the increase in long-term
