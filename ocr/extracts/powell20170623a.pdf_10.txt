 The next slide helps to represent the ensuing payment flows.7  Calls requesting payment 

are on the left in red.  When making a margin call, a CCP requests payment from its clearing 

members.  Clearing members in turn request margin payments from the customers for whom 

they are clearing, and those customers must then direct their bank to make the payment.   If 

everything works as it should, payments (in green, on the right) will ensue.  The customer’s bank 

will deliver the requested payment to the clearing member’s bank (or payment bank).  The 

payment bank will then deliver the funds to a settlement bank used by the CCP, and the 

settlement bank will then credit the funds to the CCP.  In theory, each of these payments would 

have to happen sequentially, but often parties offer intraday credit (represented by the dashed 

orange lines) to help smooth these flows.  For example, the settlement bank may provide 

intraday credit to the clearing member, sending funds to the CCP before the member has 

delivered funds to the payment bank or before those funds have been transferred to the 

settlement bank.  Clearing members or the customer’s bank may also provide intraday credit to 

their customers, again making payments before funds have been received in order to help speed 

the payments chain.   

 Over the course of October 19, 1987, the system worked largely as I have just described.  

But on October 20, every single link in these payments and credit chains was interrupted. This is 

represented graphically in the next slide.  By that morning, many settlement banks and clearing 

members had yet to receive offsetting payments for credit that had been extended the previous 

day.  Goldman Sachs and Kidder, Peabody had together extended $1.5 billion in credit that had 

not yet been paid.8  As a result, some firms pulled back on providing further credit, which then
