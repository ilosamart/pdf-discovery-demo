Although the pace of recovery has slowed in recent months and is likely to 

continue to be fairly modest in the near term, the preconditions for a pickup in growth 

next year remain in place.  Stronger household finances, a further easing of credit 

conditions, and pent-up demand for consumer durable goods should all contribute to a 

somewhat faster pace of household spending.  Similarly, business investment in 

equipment and software should grow at a reasonably rapid pace next year, driven by 

rising sales, an ongoing need to replace obsolete or worn-out equipment, strong corporate 

balance sheets, and low financing costs.  In the public sector, the tax receipts of state and 

local governments have started to recover, which should allow their spending to stabilize 

gradually.  The contribution of federal fiscal stimulus to overall growth is expected to 

decline steadily over coming quarters but not so quickly as to derail the recovery.  

Continued solid expansion among the economies of our trading partners should also help 

to support foreign sales and growth in the United States.  

Although output growth should be somewhat stronger in 2011 than it has been 

recently, growth next year seems unlikely to be much above its longer-term trend.  If so, 

then net job creation may not exceed by much the increase in the size of the labor force, 

implying that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly.  That prospect is of central 

concern to economic policymakers, because high rates of unemployment--especially 

longer-term unemployment--impose a very heavy burden on the unemployed and their 

families.  More broadly, prolonged high unemployment would pose a risk to consumer 

spending and hence to the sustainability of the recovery.
