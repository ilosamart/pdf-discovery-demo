business owners identified weak demand, taxes, and government regulations more 

frequently than interest rates and credit conditions as their most important problem.  

During that period, less than 5 percent of small business respondents typically identified 

interest rates and credit conditions as their most important problem.  In contrast, 

25 percent or more of small business owners considered weak demand the most 

important concern during much of the past three-year period (figure 1).  In considering 

responses to this question, however, it is important to remember that the survey allows 

owners to identify only their most important problem, not a set of problems.  It is possible 

that financing was the second-most-important problem, but we would not know it from 

this set of data. 

Even if tight credit is not the most important concern, perceptions of tight credit 

still might significantly influence the decisions made by current and prospective small 

business owners.  Among the small business borrowers surveyed by the NFIB, a fairly 

high net percentage--about 8 percent in March--continues to report that credit is more 

difficult to obtain than it was three months ago (figure 2).  This level of self-reported 

perceptions of tighter credit for small businesses is about the same as was observed in 

2007--a period prior to the recent business cycle peak.  It is also well below the 

16 percent of small business respondents, on net, who perceived that credit had become 

more difficult to obtain in 2009.  

Looking back to 2009, a Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation longitudinal study 

of small businesses that were founded in 2004 and tracked since then found that 

89 percent of the surviving firms that were denied loans in that year felt that banks’
