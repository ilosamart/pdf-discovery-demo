argues for fostering a financial sector capable of withstanding systemic stresses and still 

continuing to provide reasonably well-functioning capital intermediation through lending and 

other activities.  The aim is not to avoid all losses or any retrenchment in lending and capital 

markets.  It is to prevent financial markets from freezing up as they did in the latter part of 2008.    

A second principle is that achieving the aim of preserving reasonably effective 

intermediation even in a period of significant stress requires steps to ensure that market actors 

are, in the main, willing to deal with another by providing the liquidity necessary to support 

intermediation functions.  During the last crisis this willingness essentially disappeared.  It was 

restored--and then just partially--only through extensive government programs that provided 

liquidity and capital to broad segments of financial firms and markets.  

Much of the subsequent reform impulse has been animated by a determination to avoid a 

repeat of this result.  But while ex ante restrictions on ex post government assistance may 

increase market discipline and thus mitigate somewhat the amounts of risk and exposure in the 

system, such restrictions alone will not make financial actors willing to deal with one another 

when a serious dislocation nonetheless occurs.  A characteristic of a financial crisis is that the 

bursting of asset bubbles, shortage of liquidity, and sudden fragility of leverage combine with the 

opaque nature of the balance sheets of financial firms to produce high--sometimes extreme--

levels of uncertainty as to how to value assets and assess the soundness of counterparties.  It is 

precisely that uncertainty that freezes markets and, historically, has induced governments of 

many countries and ideological persuasions to buttress the system through some combination of 

loans, guarantees, capital infusions, and nationalization.   

If these heights of uncertainty are to be avoided, and intermediating activity is to continue 

even at the peak of a stress event, financial actors must have a basis for believing that their
