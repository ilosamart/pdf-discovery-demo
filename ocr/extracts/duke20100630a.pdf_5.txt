One way in which Federal Reserve researchers monitor the relationship between bank 

condition and overall bank lending is by using supervisory ratings to divide the population of 

banks into strong banks and weak banks and then compare the changes in the aggregate loan 

portfolios of the two groups.  Historically, significant declines in bank lending could be traced 

almost exclusively to declines in the portfolios of weaker banks.  But our researchers have found 

that something very different is happening this time.  In this cycle, reductions in bank lending 

can be seen at both the strong and weak banks.  This indicates that constraints on loan growth are 

due, at least in part, to factors other than the condition of lending banks. 

Regulatory Environment 

 In recent months, when I have spoken to bankers who say they are reluctant to extend 

new credit or to renew or restructure existing loans, many have cited an uncertain regulatory 

environment as a primary concern.  The current regulatory uncertainty stems from a number of 

causes, such as the ongoing work on regulatory reform in the Congress and international 

regulatory standards in Basel.  In addition, a number of recent and proposed changes in 

accounting standards will intersect with the regulatory changes in ways that cannot yet be 

predicted.  While bankers keep an anxious eye on these developments that will shape lending in 

the future, they are also concerned about the stance of bank examiners in bank examinations 

right now. 

 I do not believe it is appropriate or even possible for regulators to urge banks to make 

loans that are outside their risk tolerance or that would be unsafe or unsound.  But we can and 

should be sure that supervisory policies do not impede the flow of credit to all eligible 

borrowers.  Thatâ€™s why the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies have worked so hard 

during the past few years to ensure that while banks appropriately recognize loan problems they
