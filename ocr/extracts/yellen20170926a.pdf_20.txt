run PCE price inflation reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters; from 1991:Q4 

to 2006:Q4, the series is based on the median long-run forecasts of inflation as measured 

by the consumer price index (CPI), less a constant adjustment of 40 basis points to put 

the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis; before 1991:Q4,  is approximated by the long-run 

inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.  The relative import price term, 

, is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price index for core imported 

goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and semiconductors) less 

the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied by the share of 

nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.30 

Inflation Decomposition Procedure 

To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the 

series used in the inflation model--for which complete quarterly data are available only 

through 2017:Q2 in most cases--are first extended through the end of 2017.  In the case 

of inflation, the extensions are consistent with the medians of Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) participants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation in 2017 that 

were reported at the press conference following the September 2017 FOMC meeting.31  

Similarly,  over the second half of 2017 is defined to be consistent with the 

median of FOMC projections for the 2017:Q4 unemployment rate less the CBO’s 

estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate.  The CBO’s 2017 estimate is 

slightly higher than the median of FOMC participants’ most recent projections of the 

                                                 
30 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data 
provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
