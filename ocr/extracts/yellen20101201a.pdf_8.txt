such a rebalancing program was strongly endorsed by the leaders of the Group of Twenty 

at their recent meeting in Seoul.   

Although the fiscal consolidation process is just beginning, the weakness of 

private demand in the United States and other advanced economies, combined with 

robust growth in the emerging market economies, has led to a two-speed global recovery 

that already is creating pressures toward rebalancing.  The advanced economies started 

their recoveries in 2009, but economic growth has barely exceeded the growth rate of 

potential output; as a result, the level of output in most advanced economies, including 

the United States, is still well below its potential.  Forecasts suggest that growth and 

resource utilization will remain lackluster in the advanced economies for some time.  

Furthermore, inflation pressures in most other advanced countries, as in the United 

States, remain quite low, reflecting the existence of substantial economic slack.   

In contrast to the subdued pace of recovery in the advanced economies, economic 

activity in the emerging market economies has rebounded sharply, and the level of output 

in most of those economies now well exceeds pre-crisis levels.  The consequence is that 

policymakers in emerging market countries have turned their attention to the threat of 

rising inflation and have begun tightening monetary policy. 

The stronger growth prospects in the emerging market economies, coupled with 

the tightening stance of their monetary policies, appear to be contributing to a resurgence 

of capital inflows to these economies.  Sizeable differentials in expected returns between 

advanced and emerging market economies also seem to be reinforcing these flows and 

causing emerging market currencies to rise.  In light of their increasing concerns about 

inflation, a case can be made that emerging market policymakers should welcome
