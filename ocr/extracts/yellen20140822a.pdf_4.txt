inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half 

percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 

inflation expectations continue to be well anchored,” the Committee would not even 

consider raising the federal funds rate above the 0 to 1/4 percent range.2  This “threshold 

based” forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation 

was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment.   

Earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had 

been anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the FOMC recast its forward 

guidance, stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent 

target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress--both 

realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 

inflation.”3  As the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in 

the labor market need to become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about 

the level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, in 

its 2012 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, the FOMC 

explicitly recognized that factors determining maximum employment “may change over 

time and may not be directly measurable,” and that assessments of the level of maximum 

employment “are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”4  Accordingly, the
