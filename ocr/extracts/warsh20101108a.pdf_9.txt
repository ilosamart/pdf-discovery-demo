upon the imminent failures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac gives some indication of the harm 

that can be done when assets perceived to be relatively riskless turn out not to be. 

In the United States, the Fedâ€™s expanded participation in the long-term Treasury market 

also runs the more subtle risk of obfuscating price signals about total U.S. indebtedness.  Long-

term economic growth necessitates putting the U.S. fiscal trajectory on a sounder footing.  The 

fiscal authorities need as clear an early warning system as possible, not a handy excuse to delay. 

And overseas--as a consequence of more-expansive U.S. monetary policy and distortions 

in the international monetary system--we see an increasing tendency by policymakers to 

intervene in currency markets, administer unilateral measures, institute ad hoc capital controls, 

and resort to protectionist policies.  Extraordinary measures tend to beget extraordinary 

countermeasures.  Second-order effects can have first-order consequences.  Heightened tensions 

in currency and capital markets could result in a more protracted and difficult global recovery.  

These, too, are developments that the FOMC must monitor carefully. 

Responsible monetary policy in the current environment requires attention not only to 

near-term macroeconomic conditions, but also to corollary risks with long-term effects.  Should 

these risks threaten to materialize, however one gauges the probabilities, I am confident that 

members of the FOMC will have the tools and convictions to adjust policies appropriately. 

Conclusion  

Monetary policy has done much to ease credit conditions and improve financial market 

functioning.  And it is playing an important role in setting the conditions for the real economy to 

prosper.  But, the Federal Reserve cannot and should not do it alone.  Other policymakers must 

bear their burden and do their part to encourage more-robust economic growth and establish the 

conditions for stronger employment.
