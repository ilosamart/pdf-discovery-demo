Freddie Mac, and the FHA, including ideas for turning these properties into rental 

housing.  Together, the GSEs and the FHA hold about half of the outstanding REO 

inventory and so may be able to aggregate enough properties to facilitate a cost-effective 

rental program in many markets.   

In thinking through how a rental program might be structured, I want to highlight 

three possible design considerations.  First, as I noted earlier, achieving a cost-effective 

program may require obtaining a critical mass of properties--perhaps a couple hundred or 

more--within a limited geographic area.  In this respect, the comparative advantage of 

government is in solving the aggregation problem.  The combined portfolios of the GSEs 

and the FHA are large enough to achieve the necessary scale in a number of markets.  

However, the structuring of such a program might require the flexibility for a pooling 

entity to acquire properties from more than one seller or to contract for the acquisition of 

a minimum number of properties over time.  With such flexibility, the scale potential of 

the GSE-FHA portfolios could be supplemented with properties from servicer or 

financial institution portfolios. 

Second, it is important to ensure that such rental conversions are executed in a 

responsible manner and in the best interests of renters and local communities.  Replacing 

the blight of a foreclosed home with the blight of a rundown rental property would 

provide little assistance to the affected neighborhoods.  Examining how best to ensure 

that landlords keep their properties well maintained will be crucial. 

Third, in many markets, house prices have fallen to such an extent that better 

recoveries may result from renting properties rather than selling them.  However, in other 

markets, converting REO properties to rentals may not be in the narrow best interest of
