offers an alternative estimate of the number of jobs.  Employment as estimated from the 

household survey, adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the concept of 

employment measured in the establishment survey (figure 3), also shows an improvement 

in the labor market--indeed, by somewhat more than in the establishment survey.  I 

should note, however, that month-to-month changes in this measure are much more 

volatile than the employment measure from the establishment survey, which is why the 

Federal Reserve puts more weight on the establishment survey for the purposes of short-

term forecasting.   

The positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of 

labor utilization:  After hovering around 9 percent for much of last year, the 

unemployment rate (figure 4) has moved down since September to 8.3 percent in 

February, and the share of employment represented by people working part time for 

economic reasons, an indicator of underutilization, has declined modestly. 

Surveys of households and firms about their attitudes and expectations offer yet 

another window on job market developments.  Since the summer, household expectations 

for labor market conditions over the next year have gotten brighter (figure 5), unwinding 

a deterioration registered earlier last year.  Business hiring plans have also shown modest 

gains (figure 6).  Other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment insurance and 

measures of the breadth of hiring across industries, also point to better labor market 

conditions. 

Notwithstanding these welcome recent signs, the job market remains quite weak 

relative to historical norms, as Iâ€™ve already noted.  After nearly two years of job gains, 

private payroll employment remains more than 5 million jobs below its previous peak;
