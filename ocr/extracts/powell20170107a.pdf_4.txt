attractive investment and reduced the term premium.4  As shown in the next slide, a 

regression of the 10-year term premium on measures of 10-year inflation expectations 

and a rolling beta of Treasury returns with respect to equity returns (to proxy for the 

hedging value of bonds) shows that these two factors can account for a large part of the 

decline in the term premium.   

Regulations now require many financial institutions to hold more safe, high-

quality liquid assets, which likely has pushed down term premiums further.  Global 

factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the 

foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates 

abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5  

And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth 

over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to 

demographic change.6 

The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger 

Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will 

simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically 

important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of 

the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7  The SIFIs have more 

                                                 
4 The changing risk profile of nominal Treasury bonds can be seen from its capital asset pricing model (or 
CAPM) beta, a measure of the co-movement between returns on longer-term Treasury securities and the 
equity market.  Figure A.1 shows that the estimated rolling beta of the 10-year Treasury note with respect 
to the S&P 500 turned from positive to negative around 2000, indicating that Treasury bonds are now likely 
to act as a safe haven, performing well when equity markets do poorly.   
5 Figure A.2 shows the response in daily changes in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to changes in 10-year 
German bund yields around European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy decisions since 2010.  The 
significantly positive regression coefficient is evidence of substantial spillovers from ECB monetary policy 
to U.S. long-term yields.
