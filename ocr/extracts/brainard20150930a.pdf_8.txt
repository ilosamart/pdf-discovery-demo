Although data are limited on this sector, the data that are available suggest that 

the various types of online alternative lenders have captured a small but rapidly growing 

share of lending since the financial crisis.  In aggregate, the outstanding portfolio 

balances of these lenders have doubled every year since the mid-2000s.12  It is estimated 

that online alternative lenders originated $12 billion in 2014, with unsecured consumer 

loans representing $7 billion and small business loans accounting for approximately 

$5 billion.13  While this amount represents only a small fraction of U.S. unsecured

advances, are credit products that allow businesses to convert future credit card or payment account 

receivables into capital (Lipman and Wiersch, 2015).
