Thus, one could view Chairman Bernanke’s remarks during his June 2013 press 

conference as consistent with “market expectations.” 

Why did markets react so sharply to the apparent confirmation of the median 

expectation?  One simple possibility is that the median expectation of the primary dealers 

was not reflective of the median expectation of a wider range of market participants.  

Respondents to the primary dealer survey are more likely to be Fed watchers and 

therefore more likely in tune with Fed thinking than the average market participant.  For 

example, as seen in figure 2, a comparison of the June 2013 primary dealer survey with 

the contemporaneous Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, which draws from a wider 

sample of forecasters, reveals that Blue Chip respondents were more likely to expect a 

later start of tapering and thus more likely to have been surprised by Chairman 

Bernanke’s communications.   

In a related argument, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Jeremy Stein gave 

an insightful speech in May 2014 addressing how diversity in market expectations could 

have contributed to the taper tantrum.8  Jeremy pointed out that it is unhelpful to view the 

“market” as a single individual, a theme that has been explored by Hyun Song Shin of the 

Bank for International Settlements.9  Rather, the market is a collection of agents that can 

have widely divergent but perhaps strongly held beliefs at the individual level.  Jeremy 

attributes the taper tantrum to the existence of highly leveraged quantitative easing 

optimists--in other words, individuals who expected the Federal Reserve to continue to 

accumulate assets much longer than the median expectation and who put little weight on 

                                                 
8 See Stein (2014). 
9 For a recent example, see Shin (2017).  Shin suggests using caution when extrapolating “market” 
expectations from movements in asset prices, pointing to examples where technical factors likely 
complicate the interaction of market participants’ actions relative to their expectations.
