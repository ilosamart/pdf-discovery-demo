Keynesian approaches, to monetary targeting, to the modern frameworks of inflation 

targeting and the dual mandate of the Fed, and more.  We should not make our monetary 

policy decisions based on that assumption.  Rather, we need our policymakers to be 

continually on the lookout for structural changes in the economy and for disturbances to 

the economy that come from hitherto unexpected sources. 

Concluding Remarks 

Let me now sum up.  The prescriptions of monetary policy rules play a prominent 

role in the FOMC’s monetary policy deliberations.  And this is as it should be, in view of 

the usefulness of rules as a starting point for policy discussion and the fact that 

comparison with a benchmark rule provides a useful means of articulating one’s own 

preferred policy action.  But, for the reasons I have outlined, adherence to a simple policy 

rule is not the most appropriate means of achieving macroeconomic goals--and there are 

very good reasons why monetary policy decisions are typically made in committees 

whose structure allows them to assess the varying conditions of different regions and 

economic sectors, as well as to reflect different beliefs about the working of the economy.
