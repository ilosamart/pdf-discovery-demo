So far, markets have behaved in a manner consistent with a relatively benign 

scenario for EMEs:  Risk sentiment is holding up, credit spreads in emerging markets 

have been declining, equities are up, long-term yields have hardly budged, and the dollar 

has been declining.  Markets, however, can turn on a dime, and reactions can be outsized.  

This concern may be especially relevant at present, given the low level of volatility and 

elevated asset prices in global markets, which may increase the likelihood and severity of 

an adjustment.   

Most of the time bouts of market turbulence lead to relatively quick corrections 

that leave markets more resilient without substantially depressing global growth.  The 

taper tantrum of 2013 that I mentioned earlier is a good example.  Ultimately, the policy 

adjustments made by some of the most affected economies, along with the more realistic 

appraisal of risks by global investors, likely left the global economy in a somewhat better 

position than before the episode.  That said, however, market tantrums pose complex 

economic and financial challenges, and such episodes carry a significant risk of 

snowballing into something bigger that more substantially threatens the economic 

expansion.   

Conclusion 

To conclude, I have suggested that the most likely outcome is that the challenges 

posed to EMEs by the normalization of global financial conditions will be manageable.13 

So far, capital flows have been moving in line with market fundamentals.  Although, 

EME vulnerabilities have been rising, they are still well below the levels of the crisis-

                                                 
13 The IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report, released October 11, (IMF, 2017), also 
concludes that EMEs should be able to handle any reduction in flows from global monetary policy 
normalization “in a relatively smooth manner, given their enhanced resilience and stronger growth 
outlook.”
