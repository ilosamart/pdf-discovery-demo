Japanese consumer prices stabilized or exhibited a year-on-year increase.  A potential 

drawback of using the FOMC’s post-meeting statement to influence market expectations 

is that, at least without a more comprehensive framework in place, it may be difficult to 

convey the Committee’s policy intentions with sufficient precision and conditionality.  

The Committee will continue to actively review its communication strategy, with the goal 

of communicating its outlook and policy intentions as clearly as possible. 

A third option for further monetary policy easing is to lower the rate of interest 

that the Fed pays banks on the reserves they hold with the Federal Reserve System.  

Inside the Fed this rate is known as the IOER rate, the “interest on excess reserves” rate.  

The IOER rate, currently set at 25 basis points, could be reduced to, say, 10 basis points 

or even to zero.  On the margin, a reduction in the IOER rate would provide banks with 

an incentive to increase their lending to nonfinancial borrowers or to participants in short-

term money markets, reducing short-term interest rates further and possibly leading to 

some expansion in money and credit aggregates.  However, under current circumstances, 

the effect of reducing the IOER rate on financial conditions in isolation would likely be 

relatively small.  The federal funds rate is currently averaging between 15 and 20 basis 

points and would almost certainly remain positive after the reduction in the IOER rate.  

Cutting the IOER rate even to zero would be unlikely therefore to reduce the federal 

funds rate by more than 10 to 15 basis points.  The effect on longer-term rates would 

probably be even less, although that effect would depend in part on the signal that market 

participants took from the action about the likely future course of policy.  Moreover, such 

an action could disrupt some key financial markets and institutions.  Importantly for the 

Fed’s purposes, a further reduction in very short-term interest rates could lead short-term
