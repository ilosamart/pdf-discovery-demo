first election for the U.S. Senate in 1942, at the age of 49 he enlisted in the U.S. Marines 

and was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific.  Later, 

after he was elected to the Senate, Douglas was a champion of consumer protection laws, 

including the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, and was a leading supporter of civil rights 

legislation.  

One of Paul Douglas’s most important achievements in public life was to promote 

ethics in government.  He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was 

heavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior 

was also an eminently practical approach to life.  As a college professor, he entered 

public life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political 

and commercial corruption that was strangling the city.  Once elected to office, he faced 

the challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city’s 

aldermen were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the 

presumption that all politicians were “on the take.”  If he refused bribes and then had no 

money to hand out, how would he convince people that he wasn’t simply refusing to 

share?   

The key was transparency and communication.  Everyone who asked for a large 

payment was handed a mimeographed statement titled “Please Help Me to Be an Honest 

Alderman.” At first, the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought 

him a sucker for refusing to take bribes.  But over time, Douglas’s stand changed both the 

demands made by supplicants and his constituents’ expectations for ethical behavior by a 

government official.
