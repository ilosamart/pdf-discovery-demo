pockets and purses is making even desktop computers increasingly irrelevant.  (By the way, if 

you’re wondering what a typewriter is, you can look it up on your smartphone.) 

Not surprisingly, banks have taken advantage of this trend and developed tools and 

systems to enhance both customer service and internal operations.  Think about your own banks 

and how you interface with your customers.  A number of customers may still prefer the personal 

touch of coming into the branch, but I’m also willing to bet that an increasing number of your 

customers expect to be able do business electronically when it is convenient for them, not 

necessarily during the bank’s regular business hours.  Going back to the automated teller 

machine and continuing through telephone banking, internet banking, and now mobile banking, 

the banking industry has strived to deploy technology to be more cost-efficient while meeting 

customer needs.  Of course, the greater use of technology has its own risks as well, so I believe 

that community banks that are able to harness the power of technology while mitigating risks 

will be well positioned to better meet the demands of their customers in an innovative manner. 

Innovation is about much more than technology, however.  You have a special 

responsibility--and ability--to combine your knowledge of your communities’ financial needs 

with real relationship lending in a way that benefits your local markets and is profitable to your 

banks.  As we have seen during the financial crisis, healthy, profitable banks are well positioned 

to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers.  

Your personal experience with the people of your towns---your knowledge of their needs 

and resources--is the best path toward maintaining a high-road business model. 

Your knowledge of how to pair the needs of your communities with holistic, boots-on-

the-ground, due diligence and underwriting means that you have a powerful antidote to the 

mechanistic low-road approach to finance that has imperiled our economic well-being so
