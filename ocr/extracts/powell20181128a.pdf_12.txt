The fourth and final vulnerability arises when asset values rise far above 

conventional, historically observed valuation benchmarks--a phenomenon popularly 

referred to as a “bubble.”  The contentious term “bubble” does not appear in our work, 

however.11  Instead, we focus is on the extent to which an asset’s price is high or low 

relative to conventional benchmarks based on expected payoffs and current economic 

conditions.  Historically, when asset prices soar far above standard benchmarks, sharp 

declines follow with some regularity, and those declines may bring economic misery 

reaching far beyond investors directly involved in the speculative boom.  We therefore 

pay close attention when valuations get to the extreme ends of what we have seen in 

history.   

Looking across the landscape of major asset classes, we see some classes for 

which valuations seem high relative to history.  For example, even after standard 

adjustments for economic conditions, valuations on riskier forms of corporate debt and 

commercial properties are in the upper ends of their post-crisis distributions, although 

they are short of the levels they hit in the pre-crisis credit boom.  We see no major asset 

class, however, where valuations appear far in excess of standard benchmarks as some 

did, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom. 

The asset class that gets the most attention day-to-day is, of course, the stock 

market. Today, equity market prices are broadly consistent with historical benchmarks 

such as forward price-to-earnings ratios (see figure 8).  It is important to distinguish 

between market volatility and events that threaten financial stability.  Large, sustained 

                                                 
11 Analysts differ over how to define the term “bubble,” and debate continues about the degree to which 
economic fundamentals might explain even the most famous apparent bubble cases from history.  On the 
topic of tulip mania, for example, see Peter M. Garber (1989), “Tulipmania,” Journal of Political Economy, 
vol. 97 (June), pp. 535-60.”
