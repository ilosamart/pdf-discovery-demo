With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price 

stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.  The unemployment 

rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.  By 

conducting this review, we are ensuring that we are well positioned to continue to meet 

our statutory goals in coming years.  In addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy 

tools and enhanced its communications in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the 

Great Recession, and the review is evaluating these changes.  Furthermore, U.S. and 

foreign economies have significantly evolved since the pre-crisis experience that 

informed much of the research that provided the foundation for our current approach. 

Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates—or r*—appear to have fallen in 

the United States and abroad.3  Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to 

persist for years.  The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, 

including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in 

technology growth.  These factors’ contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of 

their precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important.  All 

else being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy 

rate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.  That 

development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy 

to support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.4

and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).

for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),
