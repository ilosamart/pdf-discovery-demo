The Role of Committees in Policy Formation 

Monetary policy decisions in the United States and elsewhere typically arise from 

a discussion and vote of a committee.16  In principle, a monetary policy committee could 

decide to follow a rule.  But a decision of this kind is unlikely to occur in practice.  

Committee discussions bring into policymaking features that a rule lacks.  A committee-

based decision process is, I suggest, likely to produce policy decisions that depart from 

the prescriptions of benchmark rules. 

A policy rule prescription is more consistent with a single perspective on the 

economy than with the pooling of multiple perspectives that is associated with a 

committee policymaking process.  Roger Lowenstein’s book America’s Bank details how 

the founding of the Federal Reserve involved reconciling a large number of interests in 

the United States.17  In a similar vein, the modern FOMC framework involves 

participation by 12 Reserve Bank presidents, each of whom represents a different district 

of the country.  The FOMC framework also balances centralized and decentralized 

decisionmaking by having most of the permanent voting members--specifically, the 

Board of Governors--be based in Washington, D.C.   

All of the FOMC participants have common goals--maximum employment and 

price stability--that are given by the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.  They have also 

agreed, for pursuing that mandate, on the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary 

Policy Strategy.18  But while they have this common ground, each FOMC participant 

brings to the table his or her own perspective or view of the world.  Part of their role in
