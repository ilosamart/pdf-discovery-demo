sometimes costly, as it may, for example, take considerable time or lead to a loss of 

cohesion on other, more pressing issues.  So it may be easier and more efficient to leave 

our behavior in some important contingencies for future discussions.  Think of why 

people often forgo prenuptial agreements when getting married--it is simply too painful 

to negotiate over every contingency ahead of time. 

This observation is helpful in understanding some of the differences between an 

open-ended asset purchase program, such as QE3, and its closed-end predecessors.  One 

advantage of going with an open-ended approach is that when we rolled out QE3 in 

September 2012, we were able to make a forceful statement that we would continue with 

asset purchases until we observed, as Chairman Bernanke put it in his postmeeting press 

conference, a “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.”

able to do so even though I suspect that, had we tried to put a number to it, there would 

have been considerable disagreement among Committee members as to the exact 

meaning of “substantial improvement.”  So in this case, leaving the Committee’s reaction 

function incompletely worked out allowed us to move forward with a major policy 

initiative in a timely manner, which otherwise might have been very difficult.  

Of course, the flip side of this reaction-function incompleteness is that it becomes 

harder for the Committee to precisely communicate its future intentions to the market--in 

part because these future intentions have not yet been fully fleshed out.  Rather, it makes 

more sense in this case to think of the Committee’s reaction function as being something 

that is not entirely predetermined and that will naturally tend to evolve over time.
