whether or not in the context of a fiscal rule, would have to contend with forecast 

uncertainties. 

Third, rules seem to be more effective when they focus on variables that the 

legislature can control directly, as opposed to factors that are largely beyond its control.  

For example, as I noted, actual budget deficits depend on spending and taxation decisions 

but also on the state of the economy.  As a result, when a target for the deficit or the debt 

is missed, ascribing responsibility may be difficult.  Current congressional procedures 

generally require the CBO to “score” proposed spending and tax programs for their 

budget effects over a specified, longer-term horizon; this approach, although not without 

its problems, has the advantage of linking budget targets directly to legislative decisions. 

 Fourth, and perhaps most fundamentally, fiscal rules cannot substitute for political 

will, which means that public understanding of and support for the rules are critical.  For 

example, the fiscal rules that Switzerland adopted in 2001 had overwhelming popular 

support; the widespread support no doubt contributed to their success in helping to reduce 

that country’s ratio of public debt to national income.  Conversely, in the absence of 

public support and commitment from elected leaders, fiscal rules may ultimately have 

little effect on budget outcomes.  Educating the public about the consequences of 

unsustainable fiscal policies may be one way to help build that support. 

Conclusion 

Today I have highlighted our nation’s fiscal challenges.  In the past few years, the 

recession and the financial crisis, along with the policy actions taken to buffer their 

effects, have eroded our fiscal situation.  An improving economy should reduce near-term 

deficits, but our public finances are nevertheless on an unsustainable path in the longer
