limited, the risk of not making the loan—of letting AIG, which was significantly larger than 

Lehman, fail—was certain to be huge.  And no other entity—not a private company, not a 

consortium of private companies acting together, not any other branch or agency of the 

government—was in a position to do anything.  The clock was ticking, and default was 

imminent.  There was no time to gather more information or find another solution.  So I ask you, 

what would you have done?   

It was in this context that the Federal Reserve, with the full support of the Treasury, made 

a loan to AIG to prevent its failure.  The loan imposed tough terms, senior management was 

replaced, and shareholders lost almost all of their investments.   

If I had to cast that vote again, even knowing all that followed, including the criticism 

that we have received, I wouldn’t change it.  I still believe that the consequences would have 

been far worse for all businesses and consumers if we had let AIG fail.  Despite the claims by 

some that healthier Wall Street firms or even the small businesses and consumers on Main Street 

did not benefit from assistance to AIG, I would argue that no business or individual was immune 

to the effects of a sequential collapse of key financial intermediaries.   

As it was, we still had frozen credit markets so we turned our attention to facilities 

designed to unfreeze those markets.  While actions like our lending to AIG have grabbed the 

biggest headlines, other moves by the Federal Reserve, like those to ensure the functioning of 

consumer credit markets, were equally important when it came to supporting consumers and the 

economy in the midst of the financial crisis.  New issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS), 

which provided funding for auto loans, credit cards, student loans, and other loans to consumers 

and small businesses, had virtually ceased.  Investors had lost faith in the quality of the triple-A 

ratings on the securities, and the complex system that funded the securities known as the
