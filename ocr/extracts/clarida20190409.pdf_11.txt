In addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will examine 

additional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding.  During the crisis and its 

aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools 

deployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue.  But 

the review will reassess our earlier findings in light of more recent experience in other 

countries. 

The third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s 

communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?”  Our 

communication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal 

Reserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting.  Over the past decade or so, 

the FOMC has enhanced its communication practices to promote public understanding of 

its policy goals, strategy, and actions, as well as to foster democratic accountability.  

These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy 

Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about principles and strategy 

guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of 

individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate 

path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks 

around their projections.23

and others (2017); and Swanson (2017). 
23 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from 
various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy 
Report.  With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC 
increased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables 
included, and extended the forecast horizon.  Because the SEP includes individual contributions of 
projections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of 
FOMC members.  For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).
