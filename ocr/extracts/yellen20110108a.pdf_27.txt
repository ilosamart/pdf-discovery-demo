     Note:  This figure depicts an illustrative simulation of the Federal Reserve Board staff’s FRB/US model of the U.S. economy,  
with results expressed as deviations from baseline.  The left panel shows the implied trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings (in $ billions), and the right panel shows the level of private payroll employment (in thousands) .
