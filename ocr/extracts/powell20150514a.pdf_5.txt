capital requirements will continue to apply to the depository institution subsidiaries of 

these companies.   

The policy statement originally applied only to qualifying holding companies with 

no more than $150 million in total consolidated assets.  In 2006, the maximum asset size 

was raised to $500 million.  Significant changes in the structure of the banking industry 

since 2006 led Board members to believe that a further increase in the limit to $1 billion in 

assets should be considered.  However, because of limitations imposed by the Collins 

Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board could not raise the limit without further 

statutory action.  We are very pleased that the Congress passed legislation in December 

2014 that enabled the Board to raise the limit.  The policy statement now covers nearly 90 

percent of bank holding companies.   

The Volcker rule and incentive compensation are two additional areas where I 

believe relief for smaller institutions would be helpful.  The risks identified by the Dodd-

Frank Act in these areas apply almost exclusively to larger financial institutions.  

Community banks rarely engage in any of the activities prohibited by the Volcker rule, 

and community banks generally do not face the adverse incentives of compensation 

agreements that may encourage executives and loan officers to maximize lending volume 

at the expense of safety and soundness.  I believe community banks should not face 

significant burdens from complying with these requirements, so I support raising the asset 

threshold for both the Volcker rule and incentive compensation rules, perhaps to 

$10 billion.  In the event where the actions of a community bank might raise concerns in 

either of these areas, that could be addressed through our normal examination process.
