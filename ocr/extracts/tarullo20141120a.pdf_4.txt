 The classic responses to this classic problem have been a combination of deposit 

insurance and discount window access.  The former, established as part of New Deal banking 

reforms, assures depositors that they need not worry about insolvency, thereby presumably 

keeping out of the withdrawal line depositors who thought they might lose their funds entirely.  

The latter gives the bank access to short-term liquidity in order to meet the demands of 

depositors who have an immediate need for cash.  Regulatory requirements were imposed to 

guard against the moral hazard that both programs could create.  The resulting system meant that 

there were relatively few liquidity problems in the deposit-funded commercial banking system 

over the ensuing few decades. 

Beginning in the 1970s, deposits began to decline as a proportion of funding for credit 

intermediation, as the separation of traditional lending and capital markets activities established 

by New Deal financial regulation began to break down.  During the succeeding three decades, 

these activities became progressively more integrated, as credit intermediation relied more 

heavily on capital market instruments sold to institutional investors.  Over time, these markets 

became--like traditional commercial banks--an important locus of maturity transformation, 

which in turn led to both an expansion and alteration of traditional money markets.  Ultimately, 

there was a vast increase in the creation of so-called cash equivalent instruments, which were 

supposedly safe, short-term, and liquid.  

When, in 2007, questions arose about the quality of some of the assets on which this 

intermediation system was based--notably, those tied to poorly underwritten subprime 

mortgages--a classic adverse feedback loop ensued.  Investors formerly willing to lend against 

almost any asset on a short-term, secured basis were suddenly unwilling to lend against a wide 

range of assets.  Liquidity-strained institutions found themselves forced to sell positions, which
