by early identi�cation of issues and timely responses.

Major factors a�ecting the current strategic plan

include the following:

1. The desire to develop better performance metrics for

each division and major Board function, and pro-

vide comparative Boardwide management data to

senior sta�

2. Continuing advances in automation and telecom-

munication technologies that will

• foster the e�ciency associated with greater stan-

dardization of System supervision and regulation

automation tools and databases, and help ensure

better coordination of plans, strategies, actions,

and information sharing with other domestic and

foreign regulators;

• reduce reaction time to address systemic issues;

• require and make possible enhanced systems for

identifying, measuring, and pricing risk;

• improve the capabilities for gathering, analyzing,

and sharing data; and

• provide signi�cant opportunities for improving

communication with the public

3. The need for actions and policies that attract and

retain a highly motivated, properly trained, and

fairly compensated professional workforce

4. The need for contingency plans related to the safety

of personnel, disaster recovery, and information

5. The current state of the U.S. and foreign economies

As technological and other changes evolve and accel-

erate, planning is essential to the e�ective and e�cient

conduct of Board operations. A continuing challenge

to government agencies in this regard is identifying the

appropriate measures of performance. The Board’s

strategic planning e�ort recognizes the key distinctions

between government and private-sector strategic plan-

ning e�orts and measurement of those e�orts. Private-

sector planning often relies on measures of cost and

revenue derived from prices determined in competitive

markets; the results of that planning are re�ected in the

ability of the private entity to prosper over time. The

government does not have direct competition in certain

areas, and has a monopoly in others (conducting mon-

etary policy, for example); establishing a comparable

metric to costs and prices is therefore extraordinarily

di�cult. Moreover, the results are judged relative to

public policy objectives embodied in law, which often

are not readily measurable. The Board seeks to accom-

plish its mission e�ectively while creating the e�cien-

cies that come from strategic planning, recognizing that

analogies to the private sector are just that. The Board’s

central planning objective is oriented toward achieving

e�ectiveness and e�ciency speci�c to the functions it

serves.

MONETARY POLICY FUNCTION

Goal

Conduct monetary policy that promotes the achieve-

ment of the statutory objectives of maximum sustain-

able long-term growth and the price stability that fos-

ters that goal.

Objectives

1. Informed monetary policy: Staying abreast of recent

developments and prospects in the U.S. economy

and �nancial markets, and in those abroad, so that

monetary policy decisions will be well informed

2. Understanding of macroeconomics and markets:

Enhancing our knowledge of the structural and

behavioral relationships in the macroeconomic and

�nancial markets, and improving the quality of data

used to gauge economic performance, through

developmental research activities

3. E�ective implementation of monetary policy: Imple-

menting monetary policy e�ectively in rapidly

changing economic circumstances and in an evolv-

ing �nancial market structure

4. Contribution to international e�orts: Contributing to

the development of U.S. international policies and

procedures in cooperation with the U.S. Department

of the Treasury and other agencies

5. Expanded public awareness of monetary policy: Pro-

moting understanding of Federal Reserve policy

among other government policy o�cials and

the general public

Performance Measures

The e�ectiveness of the Board’s monetary policy in

relation to evolving economic and �nancial cir-

cumstances continues to be reviewed by the Congress

in the context of the Board’s semiannual monetary

policy report and the accompanying testimony. It is rec-

ognized that monetary policy has only a partial and

indirect in�uence on performance of the U.S. economy.

Resources

The majority of the resources utilized to achieve this

goal are reported in the Board’s three research divi-

sions, the O�ce of Board Members, the O�ce of the
