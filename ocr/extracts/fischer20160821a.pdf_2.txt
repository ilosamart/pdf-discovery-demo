The Fedâ€™s dual mandate aims for maximum sustainable employment and an 

inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE).  Employment has increased impressively over the past six years 

since its low point in early 2010, and the unemployment rate has hovered near 5 percent 

since August of last year, close to most estimates of the full-employment rate of 

unemployment.  The economy has done less well in reaching the 2 percent inflation rate.  

Although total PCE inflation was less than 1 percent over the 12 months ending in June, 

core PCE inflation, at 1.6 percent, is within hailing distance of 2 percent--and the core 

consumer price index inflation rate is currently above 2 percent.1 

So we are close to our targets.  Not only that, the behavior of employment has 

been remarkably resilient.  During the past two years we have been concerned at various 

stages by the possible negative effects on the U.S. economy of the Greek debt crisis, by 

the 20 percent appreciation of the trade-weighted dollar, by the Chinese growth 

slowdown and accompanying exchange rate uncertainties, by the financial market 

turbulence during the first six weeks of this year, by the dismaying pothole in job growth 

this May, and by Brexit--among other shocks.  Yet, even amid these shocks, the labor 

market continued to improve:  Employment has continued to increase, and the 

unemployment rate is currently close to most estimates of the natural rate. 

During that period, the decline in the price of oil changed from being regarded as 

a simple reduction in the cost of living of almost all households--and thus an unmitigated 

blessing--to also being a source of concern, as it was understood that the decline in
