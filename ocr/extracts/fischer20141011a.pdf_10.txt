It is also worth emphasizing that asset purchases are merely one form of monetary 

accommodation, made necessary when policy interest rates hit their zero lower bound.  

Earlier studies of the international effects of conventional U.S. monetary policy--namely, 

changes in the policy rate--have also found significant spillovers to asset prices in other 

countries.15  Studies that have compared the spillovers of monetary policy across 

conventional and unconventional measures generally conclude that the effects on global 

financial markets are roughly similar.16  

Given the relatively fast recovery of many EMEs from the crisis, post-crisis 

monetary accommodation in the United States and other advanced economies created 

policy challenges for many EMEs.17  If they resisted currency appreciation pressures by 

lowering their policy rates, they risked over stimulating domestic demand, exacerbating 

financial excesses, and overheating their economies.  If, instead, they reduced their policy 

rates less than the US had done while intervening to resist currency appreciation, capital 

inflows could have increased further, thus partially offsetting their attempts to stabilize 

their economies.  And, if they allowed currency appreciation pressures to pass through to 

their full extent, this could threaten their recoveries by hurting exports.  In the event, 

EMEs tried to make the best of a difficult set of tradeoffs by allowing some exchange rate 

15  See, for example, Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2009) and Hausman and Wongswan (2011).   
16  Among studies of spillovers from conventional versus unconventional U.S. monetary policy, Rogers, 
Scotti, and Wright (2014) report no significant differences in relative announcement effects on advanced 
foreign economy asset prices and Treasury yields; Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014) find similar 
EME asset price responses; Takáts and Vela (2014) report mixed results for EMEs, with a weaker post-
2007 relationship in levels of EME policy rates with U.S. rates but a stronger post-2008 relationship in 
levels of five-year yields; and Glick and Leduc (2013) also report similar spillovers to exchange rates.  The 
effects of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program on corporate bond yields and sterling 
exchange rates are similar to predictions from a model estimated over an earlier period by Joyce, Lasaosa, 
Stevens, and Tong (2011).
