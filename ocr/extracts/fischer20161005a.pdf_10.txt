policies to boost productivity growth and the longer-run potential of the economy are 

more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory measures than in central bank 

actions.18  Some combination of improved public infrastructure, better education, more 

encouragement for private investment, and more-effective regulation is likely to promote 

faster growth, which would increase the natural rate of interest and, thus, reduce the 

probability that we may find ourselves again struggling to avoid Keynesâ€™s infamous 

liquidity trap.  If the natural rate can be lifted by appropriate policies, the economic near-

stagnation that many countries have experienced in recent years may well turn out not to 

be that secular after all.
