unemployment and disability insurance, to better support some types of contingent work.  

Another possibility is to make benefits, such as health insurance and retirement saving, 

portable across different employers.  We may also want to encourage the additional 

saving that many contingent workers need to ensure that their basic consumption needs 

are not sacrificed when demand for their work declines, perhaps by providing monetary 

or other types of incentives. 

Closing Thoughts 

The apparent trend toward contingent work has recently coincided with new 

advances in technology that can potentially amplify this trend and push it in new 

directions.  We are still at an early stage in these developments, and it is too soon to say 

how these changes will play out.  But the effects on the labor market could be long 

lasting and significant.  Taking into account the potentially varied effects of the rising 

prevalence of gig work on household welfare, public policy should strive to maximize the 

benefits of the greater flexibility and lower entry barriers provided by advances in 

technology, while addressing the risks that currently accompany many forms of gig 

employment.  Going forward, better data will be necessary, along with detailed research 

and analysis, in order to enable workers, employers, and policymakers to guide these 

changes in the labor market in a direction that ensures the benefits are broadly shared and 

the risks are well understood and well managed.
