Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed a rule expanding the number of 

commercial real estate transactions that will no longer require an appraisal, allowing for a 

less detailed evaluation.  And just last week, the Fed, along with other regulators, took a 

significant step to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and other smaller 

and less complex institutions by proposing to simplify several requirements in the 

regulatory capital rule.   

 We have done this because we have an abiding commitment to consider how our 

decisions affect institutions and the customers they serve.  We are well aware that 

community banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often 

underserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized 

services than are often otherwise available.  We know that community bankers are part of 

the communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the 

aspirations of their customers. 

We hope that the research presented at this conference stimulates discussion about 

the leading policy issues facing the industry and supervisors.  As in the past, I see that 

this yearâ€™s agenda includes presentations related to several important issues, including the 

effect of supervision on risk-tasking and the effects of greater competition on community 

banks.  I am cheered to see that finance students at the University of Akron remain 

interested enough in community banking to participate in a case-study competition 

related to community banking, and I am pleased that the conference will hear a 

presentation of the winning case study.
