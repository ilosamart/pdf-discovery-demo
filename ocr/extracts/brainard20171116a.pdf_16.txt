terminate the collection and storage of their data.  For instance, when a consumer deletes a 

fintech app from his or her phone, it is not clear this would guarantee that a data aggregator 

would delete the consumer’s bank login and password, nor discontinue accessing transaction 

information.  If a consumer severs the data access, for instance by changing banks or bank 

account passwords, it is also not clear how he or she can instruct the data aggregator to delete the 

information that has already been collected.  Given that data aggregators often don’t have 

consumer interfaces, consumers may be left to find an email address for the data aggregator, 

send in a deletion request, and hope for the best. 

If things go wrong, consumers may have limited remedies.  In reviewing terms, it appears 

that many fintech advisors include contractual waivers that purport to limit consumers’ ability to 

seek redress from the advisor or an underlying data aggregator.  In some cases, the terms and 

conditions assert that the fintech developer and its third-party service providers will not be liable 

to consumers for the performance of or inability to use the services.  It is not uncommon to see 

terms and conditions that limit the fintech adviser’s liability to the consumer to $100. 

Traditionally, under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation 

E, consumers have had protections to mitigate their losses in the event of erroneous or fraudulent 

transactions that would otherwise impact their credit and debit cards, such as data breaches. 

Those protections are not absolute, however.41  In particular, if a consumer gives another person 

an “access device” to their account and grants them authority to make transfers, then the 

consumer is “fully liable” for transfers made by that person, even if that person exceeds his or 

                                                 
41 See 12 CFR section 1005.2(m) (1). (Excluding from the definition of “unauthorized electronic fund transfer” any 

“electronic fund transfer initiated… [by] a person who was furnished the access device to the consumer’s account by 

the consumer…..”)
