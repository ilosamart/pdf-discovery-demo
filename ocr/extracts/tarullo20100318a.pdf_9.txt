systems and other institutions, resolution of such an organization will carry significant 

risk of spillovers to other key markets, payments systems, or systemically important 

institutions.  The Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group consequently recommended 

developing initiatives that would result in simpler, less interconnected organizational 

structures.

This point leads us to one much-discussed idea, that of firm-specific resolution

mechanisms to other regulatory tools, both domestically and internationally. 

In one variant of the idea, each internationally active bank would be required to 

develop, and potentially to execute, its own resolution plan--literally, to plan for its own 

demise.  Such a requirement could doubtless be helpful to some degree, but it has notable 

limitations.  

Most obviously, it is very difficult to predict in advance of a crisis which parts of 

the firm will be under greatest stress, what geographical regions may be affected most 

severely, and what the condition in various markets and economies will be, as well as the 

stability of counterparties and similarly situated institutions.  Furthermore, governments 

may be understandably reluctant to rely too much upon a wind-down plan developed by 

an internationally active financial firm that so mismanaged itself that it is on the brink of 

failure, placing other institutions at peril.  Finally, management of an institution can be 

expected to seek to preserve as much value for shareholders as possible in its planning,
