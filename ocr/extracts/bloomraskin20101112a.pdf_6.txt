detailed work that is now required in the loss mitigation area, and the payment structures 

between the servicers and investors are not sufficient to support large-scale loan workout 

activity.  As it turns out, the structural incentives that influence servicer actions, 

especially when they are servicing loans for a third party, now run counter to the interests 

of homeowners and investors.   

 While an investor’s financial interests are tied more or less directly to the 

performance of a loan, the interests of a third-party servicer are tied to it only indirectly, 

at best.  The servicer makes money, to oversimplify a bit, by maximizing fees earned and 

minimizing expenses while performing the actions spelled out in its contract with the 

investor.   

In the case, for instance, of a homeowner struggling to make payments, a 

foreclosure almost always costs the investor money, but may actually earn money for the 

servicer in the form of fees.  Proactive measures to avoid foreclosure and minimize cost 

to the investor, on the other hand, may be good for the homeowner, but involve costs that 

could very well lead to a net loss to the servicer.  In the case of a temporary forbearance 

for a homeowner, for example, the investor and homeowner both could win--if the 

forbearance allows the homeowner to get back on their feet and avoid foreclosure--but 

the servicer could well lose money.  In the case of a permanent modification, the investor 

and homeowner could both be considerably better off relative to foreclosure, but the 

servicer could again lose money.  

 Why might a servicer lose money in an instance that could be win-win for the 

borrower and investor?  It’s because of the amount of work needed, the structure for 

reimbursing costs to the servicer, and other costs incurred by the servicer on delinquent,
