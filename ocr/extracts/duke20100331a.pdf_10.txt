Loans will be classified and valued on the basis of cash flow first, and collateral 

value second.  Assessments of cash flow and valuation will be much more reliable if 

based on solid documentation.  In the absence of documentation, examiners will have to 

make assumptions.  Most loans should fall into one of three categories: 

• First, if available cash flow, including the willingness and ability of any 

guarantors to provide cash support, is sufficient to carry a construction 

project to completion or to amortize a completed project on reasonable 

terms at a market rate of interest, the loan should not be classified;   

• If, on the other hand, there is no available cash flow to carry the loan and 

repayment can only come from the sale of the collateral, an amount equal 

to the value of the collateral less selling expenses will be classified and 

any remaining amount charged off; and   

• Finally, if cash flow is sufficient to partially amortize the loan, the bank 

may be able to restructure the loan into two parts, one of which is 

supported by cash flow and therefore a pass, and the second of which is 

less supported and so would be classified. 

This guidance is designed to address workouts and restructurings of problem 

credit, but the clarification of loan classification standards should also give bankers some 

confidence in evaluating new loans for both credit risk and risk of classification.  Overall, 

the guidance urges both lenders and examiners to take a balanced approach in assessing 

borrowers’ debt servicing capacity and to make realistic assessments of collateral 

valuations.
