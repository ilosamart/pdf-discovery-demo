In this regard, we also should be realistic about what a backstop is.  Any global 

backstop or liquidity facility should have certain features--accountability and monitoring, 

some degree of stigma in good times, and a high hurdle for usage.  In other words, 

backstops are not built to be liked.  In the United States, we are working to ensure that 

our financial institutions and other market participants are prepared for the normalization 

of monetary policy and the return to a world of higher interest rates.  It is equally 

important that individuals, businesses, and institutions around the world do the same.  For 

our part, the Federal Reserve will promote a smooth transition by communicating our 

assessment of the economy and our policy intentions as clearly as possible.  

IV.  Concluding Remarks  

To summarize and conclude, the Fedâ€™s statutory objectives are defined by its dual 

mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability in the U.S. 

economy.  But the U.S. economy and the economies of the rest of the world have 

important feedback effects on each other.  To make coherent policy choices, we have to 

take these feedback effects into account.  The most important contribution that U.S. 

policymakers can make to the health of the world economy is to keep our own house in 

order--and the same goes for all countries.  Because the dollar is the primary international 

currency, we have, in the past, had to take action--particularly in times of global 

economic crisis--to maintain order in international capital markets, such as the central 

bank liquidity swap lines extended during the global financial crisis.  In that case, we 

were acting in accordance with our dual mandate, in the interest of the U.S. economy, by 

taking actions that also benefit the world economy.  Going forward, we will continue to 

be guided by those same principles.
