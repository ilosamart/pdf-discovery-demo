holdings at an elevated level until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep 

some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well after the end of its asset 

purchase programs.  Although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longer-

term interest rates are subject to uncertainty, a recent study reported that the Federal 

Reserve’s securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the 10-year Treasury 

yield by roughly 1 percentage point at the end of 2016.14   

The guidance that the FOMC would eventually start a gradual and predictable 

reduction of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings implied that the downward 

pressure on longer-term yields would likely diminish over time as financial market 

participants came to expect that the start of balance sheet normalization was nearing.  

Indeed, with that process now under way, it is likely that our securities holdings are now 

depressing the term premium on the 10-year yield by somewhat less than the 

1 percentage point estimate reported for late last year. 

Several factors suggest that the downward pressure on term premiums exerted by 

our securities holdings is likely to diminish only gradually as our holdings shrink.  For 

instance, as I have already noted, our intention to reduce our balance sheet by reducing 

reinvestment of repayments of principal on our holdings--rather than selling assets--has 

been well communicated for several years now.  As a result, we do not anticipate a jump 

in term premiums as our balance sheet reduction plan gets under way.  In addition, the
