Consistent with the results of the SLOOS, C&I lending has indeed been rising 

sharply lately.  Banks have focused on C&I lending because business borrowers’ 

creditworthiness is improving and because the majority of C&I loans carry floating 

interest rates that reduce interest rate risk.  In addition, domestic banks reportedly are 

picking up customers as a result of a pullback by some European institutions.  Auto 

lending also has reportedly been solid, reflecting strong fundamentals in auto markets--

such as robust demand for used cars and relatively low delinquency rates on existing auto 

loans.  The strong fundamentals for auto loans in turn also appear to have contributed to 

an easing of lending standards and terms.   

But, as I mentioned earlier, residential mortgage lending has been particularly 

sluggish.  Tight lending standards and terms remain especially evident.  To be sure, a 

return to pre-crisis lending standards for residential mortgages wouldn’t be appropriate; 

however, current standards may be limiting or preventing lending to many creditworthy 

borrowers.  For instance, in the April SLOOS, we asked banks a hypothetical question 

about their willingness to originate GSE-eligible mortgages relative to 2006 for 

borrowers with a range of credit scores and available down payments.  The SLOOS 

found that even when the loans were accompanied by a 20 percent down payment, many 

banks were less likely to originate loans to borrowers with given GSE-eligible credit 

scores, despite the originating bank’s ability to sell the mortgage to the GSEs.  Most 

banks indicated that their reluctance to accept mortgage applications from borrowers with 

less-than-perfect records is related to “putback risk”--the risk that a bank might be forced 

to buy back a defaulted loan if the underwriting or documentation was judged deficient in 

some way.
