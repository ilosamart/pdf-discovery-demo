single-point-of-entry approach developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

(FDIC) in conjunction with other U.S. supervisors is a promising innovation, especially 

in combination with the recent proposal of the Financial Stability Board to increase the 

“total loss absorbency capacity” of systemically important firms in terms of their total 

levels of equity and long-term debt.  When fully worked out, these new regulatory 

regimes should permit a large, consolidated entity that owns  banks or broker-dealers to 

continue to function even if the ultimate holding company ceases to be viable and must 

be recapitalized or wound down.   

As I said at the outset, these reforms directed at the G-SIBs are well advanced.  

But much implementation remains, including, most notably, addressing cross-border 

issues associated with the failure of complex global firms.  It will take time and continued 

international cooperation to complete this task.3   

Infrastructure:  The crisis exposed a number of important weaknesses in the 

infrastructure of the financial markets--what might be more plainly called the plumbing.  

Reforms aimed at addressing these weaknesses receive less public attention than those 

focused on the G-SIBs, and are in some respects less advanced in their conception and 

execution.  But they are, in my view, of great importance. 

I will mention two important sets of reforms in the U.S. context, one well 

advanced and the other still under development.  The first concerns the triparty 

repurchase agreement (repo) market, which is a principal source of overnight financing
