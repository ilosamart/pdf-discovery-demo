during the recession was not greater for homeowners than for renters, nor was it 

especially pronounced for areas where housing prices have declined the most and so 

where house lock would likely be most prevalent.

Finally, I do not interpret data suggesting an outward shift in the Beveridge curve 

as providing much evidence in favor of an increase in structural unemployment.  The 

Beveridge curve plots the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies.  

Cyclical variations in aggregate demand tend to move unemployment and job vacancies 

in opposite directions, whereas structural shifts would be expected to move vacancies and 

unemployment in the same direction.  For instance, a structural mismatch between 

businesses’ hiring needs and the skills of unemployed workers would tend to push up the 

level of vacancies for a given level of unemployment.  Figure 3 plots the co-movement of 

unemployment and job vacancy rates since 2007.

  Consistent with a substantial decline 

in aggregate demand, followed by some modest recovery, movements in unemployment 

and vacancies since 2007 display a predominantly inverse relationship.  However, figure 

3 shows that as job vacancies have risen during the recovery, unemployment has declined 

by less than might have been expected based on the relationship that prevailed during the 

contraction.  This outcome has led some to suggest that the Beveridge curve has shifted 

outward, reflecting an increase in the extent of job mismatch.  In my view, a portion of 

this apparent outward shift in the Beveridge curve reflects increases in the maximum 

duration of unemployment benefits, which have been important in buffering the effects of
