The strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that 

have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.  For example, African 

Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than 

whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as 

the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to 

these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11  Likewise, 

although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they 

are for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market 

strengthens.12  And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for 

less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 

Scope of the Review 

Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on 

Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.14  First adopted in January 2012, the 

statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including earlier this 

year with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC participants.  The statement indicates 

that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations 

                                                 
10 See Cajner and others (2017) for a careful examination of how labor market differentials by race and 
ethnicity have evolved over time. 
11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and 
ethnicity in a strong labor market.  The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and 
for employment-to-population ratios. 
12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.  
However, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened.  The box “Employment 
Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report 
examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10-12).  See also Weingarden 
(2017). 
13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be 
calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The 
Economic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data.
