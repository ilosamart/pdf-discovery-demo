Each FOMC participant has his or her own approach to the process.  Some of the 

preparation rituals are as old and as time-tested as the go-rounds in every meeting.  Other aspects 

of preparation have developed in response to the unprecedented actions we have taken recently.  

As I get ready for a meeting, I try to formulate my own answers to three key questions: 

• First, how is the economy likely to evolve in the near and medium term?

• Finally, how should we communicate our actions so that the public can 

understand them?

up a lot and are deeply intertwined.  While the outlook for the economy and the appropriate 

instrument selection and calibration for policy are fairly obvious parts of the monetary policy

communication is perhaps the way in which the FOMC has changed the most in recent years, so 

I think it deserves some extra attention here. 

First Question: How is the Economy Likely to Evolve in the Near and Medium Term? 

Any discussion of monetary policy has to begin with an assessment of current economic

we do have is a group of extremely knowledgeable, experienced, and talented people who study 

all aspects of the economy.  We also have a number of powerful economic models that have been 

developed and tested over the years.  In addition to the economists and researchers at the Board, 

every Reserve Bank has economic research groups.  We also have financial market experts at the
