United States will grow at about 1/2 percent per year over the next decade, less than half 

the pace observed, on average, in the two decades before the financial crisis. 

Slower growth can both boost saving and depress investment.  As households 

revise down their expectations for future income growth, they become less likely to 

borrow and more likely to save.  Likewise, slower growth diminishes the number of 

business opportunities that can be profitably undertaken, weighing on investment 

demand. 

Demographics  

The aging of the population can work to lower the equilibrium interest rate 

beyond its effect on the size of the labor force and trend growth.  As households near 

retirement, they tend to save more, anticipating having to run down their savings after 

they leave the labor force.  Federal Reserve economists, in one study, estimate that higher 

saving by near-retirement households could be pushing down the longer-run equilibrium 

federal funds rate relative to its level in the 1980s by as much as 75 basis points.9    

Investment    

Another factor weighing on equilibrium real interest rates has been the recent 

weakness of investment.  What explains the tepid response of capital spending to 

historically low interest rates?  As mentioned earlier, low productivity growth has 

certainly been a contributing factor, as firms see fewer profitable investment 

opportunities.  But elevated uncertainty, both political and economic, has likely also 

played a role.  For one, uncertainty about the outlook for government policy in health
