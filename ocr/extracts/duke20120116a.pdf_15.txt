well, albeit long-windedly:  “You are not here merely to make a living.  You are here in 

order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of 

hope and achievement.  You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if 

you forget that errand.”  Aside from the obvious societal benefits, there is much to be 

gained personally from working to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of 

people.  It has been richly rewarding for me to bring decades of experience as a banker to 

discussions on matters that have the power to transform that very industry.  And I have 

been fortunate to work alongside other public servants who share the commitment to 

bettering the lives of the people we serve by working to ensure a strong financial system 

and a stable economy. 

 Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.
