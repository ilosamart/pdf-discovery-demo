We recognize the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to 

transform the way financial market participants transfer, store, and maintain ownership 

records of digitized assets.  The genuinely innovative aspect of distributed ledger 

technology combines a number of core elements that can be used to support the transfer 

process and distributed recordkeeping for digital assets and digital representations of 

assets.  These elements include peer-to-peer networking and distributed data records, 

which provide broadly shared access to a single ledger across participants in the system, 

so that all participants maintain a shared, accurate history of all transactions in the 

system.  In addition, cryptography provides a secure way to initiate a valid transaction as 

well as to securely transmit and store data.  And consensus algorithms provide a process 

for transactions to be confirmed and added to the single ledger, which is an important 

feature when more than one participant has permission to propose updates to the ledger. 

We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, 

recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in 

payments, clearing, and settlement.1   

The Federal Reserve Board has established a working group that is engaged in a 

360-degree analysis of financial innovation across the broad range of our responsibilities, 

drawing on engagement with industry stakeholders and on expertise from across the 

Federal Reserve System, including in supervision, consumer protection, financial stability 

and information technology.  One important area of oversight is the payments system,
