When he ran for president in 1976 and had some success in the primaries, he was challenged by 

the press that said his victories were limited to the West, and he replied “What do you mean I 

can’t win an eastern state?  I won Nebraska!” 

One dimension to how households and most businesses experience banking is the number 

of banks competing for their services, and one difference between the West and the East is that 

the West has fewer banks, even if we count them on a per capita basis.9  In addition, banks in the 

West tend to be larger. One reason for the disparity in the average number and size of banks is 

that historically, a larger share of western states allowed statewide branching or had relatively 

limited branching restrictions, leading to the development of fewer and larger banks.10   

In metropolitan areas of the West, the average number of banks was 23 in 2017, 

compared to 27 in eastern metro areas.   In rural counties of the West, customers had access to an 

average of 4.6 banks in 2017, compared to 5.4 banks in the East.  In both urban and rural areas, 

in both the East and the West, the average number of banks increased in the years leading up to 

the financial crisis but has been declining since then.  While there is certainly more to say about 

banking services in cities, I want to focus on rural areas for the moment.  Over the last 20 years, 

rural westerners have consistently had access to something like 20 percent fewer banks than rural 

easterners, which amounts to about one less bank per rural county.   That may not sound like 

much, but that one less bank, on average, can make a big difference to the households and small 

businesses inhabiting those rural counties.

of banks across states have persisted.
