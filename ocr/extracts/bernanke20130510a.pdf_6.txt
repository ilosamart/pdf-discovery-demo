Systemically Important Financial Institutions 

SIFIs are financial firms whose distress or failure has the potential to create 

broader financial instability sufficient to inflict meaningful damage on the real economy.  

SIFIs tend to be large, but size is not the only factor used to determine whether a firm is 

systemically important; other factors include the firm’s interconnectedness with the rest 

of the financial system, the complexity and opacity of its operations, the nature and extent 

of its risk-taking, its use of leverage, its reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and the 

extent of its cross-border operations.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the largest bank 

holding companies are treated as SIFIs; in addition, as I mentioned, the act gives the 

FSOC the power to designate individual nonbank financial companies as systemically 

important.  This designation process is under way. 

Dodd-Frank also establishes a framework for subjecting SIFIs to comprehensive 

supervisory oversight and enhanced prudential standards.  For all such companies, the 

Federal Reserve will have access to confidential supervisory information and will 

monitor standard indicators such as regulatory capital, leverage, and funding mix.  

However, some of these measures, such as regulatory capital ratios, tend to be backward 

looking and thus may be slow to flag unexpected, rapid changes in the condition of a 

firm.  Accordingly, we supplement the more standard measures with other types of 

information. 

One valuable source of supplementary information is stress testing.  Regular, 

comprehensive stress tests are an increasingly important component of the Federal 

Reserve’s supervisory toolkit, having been used in our assessment of large bank holding
