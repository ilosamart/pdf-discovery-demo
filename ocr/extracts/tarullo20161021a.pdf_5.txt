though, much post-crisis regulatory reform has been directed at strengthening the traditional 

form-based foundation, though perhaps to a somewhat greater degree in the United States than in 

some other financially important jurisdictions.  And, at a conceptual level, some features of 

particular forms of intermediaries--such as being an insured depository institution rather than a 

money market fund--remain rightly important for regulatory purposes.  So we will probably 

continue to build on a form-based regulatory regime, though the potential range of 

complementary function-based measures could be quite extensive.  And, at the very least, 

analyses based on function rather than form can be valuable heuristic exercises for identifying 

inconsistencies and lacunae in the financial regulatory system. 

A first set of questions follows from just such an identification of gaps in the regulatory 

system, which are arguably most troubling when they relate to systemic considerations--that is, 

when a financial intermediary or activity may contribute to risk in the financial system because 

of the related positions or activities of others.  Two critical gaps highlighted by the crisis were 

the inadequate prudential regulation of the most systemically important financial institutions 

(SIFIs) and the sometimes nonexistent prudential regulation of the many activities now 

denominated as “shadow banking.” 

The SIFI issue has received the most public attention, often in the context of too-big-to-

fail concerns.  It was at the center of some of the most notable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, 

many of which follow from the important principle enunciated in section 165 that prudential 

regulation should become increasingly stringent for institutions of greater systemic importance.  

Precisely because a satisfactory treatment of this topic would require at least one lengthy speech 

on its own, it seems reasonably clear that teaching and scholarship should highlight the SIFI
