arbitrage and the need for extensive and perhaps constant elaboration.  The advantages of the 

latter are that it might allow more innovation in financial markets, particularly by non-

established actors, and could well be more efficient. 

Second, what agency or agencies would be the appropriate regulators?  The answer to 

this question would obviously be related to the answer to the first, though some different 

considerations do apply.  The choice of a single agency versus multiple agencies involves the 

well-known tradeoff between relative coherence of approach and linkage with other agency 

functions and expertise, on the one hand, versus involvement of multiple agency perspectives 

and avoidance of too much concentration of authority in a single agency, on the other.   

Third, what form or forms would the regulation take?  A non-exhaustive list of 

possibilities includes outright prohibition, minimum margining requirements and practices, 

capital requirements, and taxation.  Again, the answer to this question may both affect, and be 

affected by, the considerations implicated by the first two.   

My fourth and fifth questions are quite different from the first three, and I will defer for a 

moment actually stating them, in order to provide some context.  To this point, my remarks have 

reflected the familiar perspective that identifies a set of market practices carrying significant risk 

of negative externalities--in this case, with some collective action problems thrown in--and then 

asks how to fashion an appropriate regulatory response.  An additional, important consideration 

here is that at least some of the short-term funding instruments implicated in this analysis 

respond not just to the desire of their creators for funding that is cheaper than equity or longer-

term debt, but also to the demand of many entities--from other financial firms to pension funds to 

foreign sovereigns--for “safe” assets.  As the term implies, these assets must be reliable stores of 

value that are readily available for use--features sometimes characterized as “money-like.”
