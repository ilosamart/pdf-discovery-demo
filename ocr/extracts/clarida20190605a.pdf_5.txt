In coming regularly scheduled meetings, the FOMC will undertake its assessment 

of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.  This assessment 

will be informed by what we’ve heard at this conference, by our listening sessions in the 

Federal Reserve Districts, and by the work of System staff.  When the Committee tackles 

important issues, we take the time for wide-ranging and candid discussions, and so I 

expect our deliberations will continue over several meetings for the remainder of this 

year.  We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review, 

likely during the first half of next year. 

Thank you and let’s move directly to our first session.
