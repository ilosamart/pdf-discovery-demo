is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work 

for those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare.40  Reforms 

that encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train 

workers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in 

exchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs.  Another 

problem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families.41  

And just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution 

have jobs that provide them with paid family leave.42  This circumstance puts many 

women in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and 

keeping their jobs.   

In this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of American 

women to those in other advanced economies.  In 1990, the labor force participation rate 

in the United States of prime working-age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but 

a few industrialized nations.  But in the intervening years, while the participation rate of 

U.S. women was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the United 

States fell to 17th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force 

participation.43  A number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in 

explaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries.  These studies 

find that policy differences--in particular, the expansion of paid leave following 

childbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased 

availability of part-time work--go a long way toward explaining the divergence between
