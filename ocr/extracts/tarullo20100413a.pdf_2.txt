regulatory reform.  The Federal Reserve and other financial regulators have, under existing 

statutory authority, already implemented some changes to prudential rules and to supervisory 

oversight processes.  Other changes are under active consideration.  Against this backdrop, and 

mindful that my audience is composed of institutional investors, I would like this morning to 

discuss the importance of more thoroughly involving markets and the public in the financial 

regulatory system.1 

The Emerging Structure of Financial Regulatory Reform 

The crisis arose against the backdrop of a regulatory system that had not adjusted to the 

extensive integration of traditional lending with capital market activities, which had created new 

sources of systemic risk.  The internal information and risk-management systems of many 

financial firms were revealed as inadequate to the task of identifying the scope of market and 

credit risks, much less ensuring the soundness of those firms, in a period of severe stress.   The 

already significant problem of institutions perceived as too-big-to-fail was further amplified by 

the government's actions in 2008 to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system.  To 

succeed, proposed reforms to counteract systemic risk must address these quite fundamental 

deficiencies. 

It may be helpful to organize the reform agenda by reference to the "three pillars" of 

financial regulation enunciated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision--minimum 

prudential requirements, supervisory oversight, and market discipline. Although the Basel 

Committee formulated the three-pillar approach in the context of the Basel II framework for 

capital requirements, this structure can also be applied to the broader set of reform measures.
