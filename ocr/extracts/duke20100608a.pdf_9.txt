Other Consumer Protections 

 The Federal Reserve has been active in issuing regulations governing other consumer 

products as well.  We implemented new rules that will help students shop intelligently for 

student loans.4  We implemented provisions in the CARD Act that apply to gift cards and 

marketing of credit cards to students.5  We also issued new regulations that prohibit automatic 

enrollment in overdraft programs, requiring that consumers opt in before they can be charged for 

overdrafts created by ATM withdrawals and one-time debit card transactions.  Furthermore, 

banks will be required to offer the same account fees and features to customers regardless of 

whether they opt in to coverage for debit overdrafts.6     

While the additional protections for consumers are long overdue, they will require 

considerable changes in bankers’ business practices and product pricing and design.  The 

changes reduce the ability to build profitability models around penalty pricing such as overdraft 

fees or raising interest rates on existing credit card balances.  They require pricing to be front 

loaded and clearly disclosed.  I fully expect current banking products to change as banks adjust 

to accommodate the new requirements.  And I understand the potential for at least a temporary 

lull in service innovation as providers concentrate on change implementation.  At the same time, 

I have every confidence that competition will ultimately restore innovation, but with products 

that are safer, simpler, and more transparent to consumers.
