institutional changes in recognition of this change in goals.  In a sense, we have come full

How should a central bank enhance financial stability?  One means is by 

assuming the lender-of-last-resort function that Bagehot understood and described 

140 years ago, under which the central bank uses its power to provide liquidity to ease 

market conditions during periods of panic or incipient panic.  The Fed’s many liquidity 

programs played a central role in containing the crisis of 2008 to 2009.  However, putting 

out the fire is not enough; it is also important to foster a financial system that is 

sufficiently resilient to withstand large financial shocks.  Toward that end, the Federal 

Reserve, together with other regulatory agencies and the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council, is actively engaged in monitoring financial developments and working to 

strengthen financial institutions and markets.  The reliance on stronger regulation is 

informed by the success of New Deal regulatory reforms, but current reform efforts go 

even further by working to identify and defuse risks not only to individual firms but to 

the financial system as a whole, an approach known as macroprudential regulation.   

Financial stability is also linked to monetary policy, though these links are not yet 

fully understood.  Here the Fed’s evolving strategy is to make monitoring, supervision, 

and regulation the first line of defense against systemic risks; to the extent that risks 

remain, however, the FOMC strives to incorporate these risks in the cost-benefit analysis 

applied to all monetary policy actions.
