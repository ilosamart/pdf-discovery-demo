The global financial crisis ended in 2009, and the economy has just completed its eighth 

consecutive year of expansion.  We are near full employment.  The housing market is generally

comprehensive program to raise prudential standards for our most systemically important banks.  

But fundamental housing finance reform--including reform to address the ultimate status of

underlying mortgages.  Thanks to the growth in securitization, these two GSEs have dominated 

U.S. housing finance since the late 1980s.     

The pre-crisis system did its job for many years.  By promoting standardization, 

structuring securities to meet a broad range of investor risk appetites, and issuing guaranteed
