22 percent in 2005, the overall rate of homeownership among young people fell to 

16 percent in 2014.21 

The combination of high educational debt levels and poor job market prospects 

faced by young adults entering the workforce in the aftermath of the financial crisis are 

the most likely causes of these sharp declines.22  Indeed, the share of adults under 

30 living with parents or other family members rose significantly in the wake of the 

financial crisis and has remained at a high level.23  The SHED found that, among 

individuals who live with their extended family or with roommates, over half are doing 

so to save money, and nearly three-fourths would move out on their own if they could 

afford to do so.  Federal Reserve research also indicates that debt is an important 

determinant of whether a young person lives with their parents, even after controlling for 

labor and housing market conditions.24  That analysis also indicates that credit 

delinquency and lower credit scores increase the propensity for adult children to move 

home as well as the length of time that young people live with their parents.   

                                                 
21 For those young adults who have formed a household, the rate of homeownership increased by about 
6 percentage points from 1995 to 2005, peaking at 37 percent in 2005, and has subsequently fallen sharply 
to below 30 percent today.  The data consist of Board staff calculations using the Census Bureau’s 
household vacancy survey.

23 In 1980, 36 percent of adults who were age 30 and younger lived with older family members.  That 
fraction gradually trended up through the early 2000s, then increased sharply to more than 45 percent by 
2012 and has not appreciably declined since then.  The data consist of Board staff calculations using the 
Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey.
