A fair summary is that, while the shadow banking sector is smaller today than 

before the crisis and some of its least stable components have either disappeared or been 

reformed, regulators and the private sector need to address remaining vulnerabilities.  For 

example, although money market funds were strengthened by reforms undertaken by the 

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2010, the possibility of a run on these 

funds remains--for instance, if a fund should “break the buck,” or report a net asset value 

below 99.5 cents, as the Reserve Primary Fund did in 2008.  The risk is increased by the 

fact that the Treasury no longer has the power to guarantee investors’ holdings in money 

funds, an authority that was critical for stopping the 2008 run.  In November 2012, the 

FSOC proposed for public comment some alternative approaches for the reform of 

money funds.  The SEC is currently considering these and other possible steps. 

With respect to the triparty repo platform, progress has been made in reducing the 

amount of intraday credit extended by the clearing banks in the course of the daily 

settlement process, and, as additional enhancements are made, the extension of such 

credit should be largely eliminated by the end of 2014.  However, important risks remain 

in the short-term wholesale funding markets.  One of the key risks is how the system 

would respond to the failure of a broker-dealer or other major borrower.  The Dodd-

Frank Act has provided important additional tools to deal with this vulnerability, notably 

the provisions that facilitate an orderly resolution of a broker-dealer or a broker-dealer 

holding company whose imminent failure poses a systemic risk.  But, as highlighted in 

the FSOC’s most recent annual report, more work is needed to better prepare investors
