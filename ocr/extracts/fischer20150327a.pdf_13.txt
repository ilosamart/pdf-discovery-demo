leveraged loans, credit default swaps, and other less liquid assets.  These funds offer daily 

or even intraday liquidity to investors while holding assets that are hard to sell 

immediately, thus making the funds vulnerable to liquidity risk.  Recently, the FSOC 

issued a notice seeking comment on the products and activities of the asset management 

industry.   

Third, there are also areas of the nonbank financial system into which we have 

only a limited view.  While the data we have on hedge funds has improved, we still need 

to get a complete picture of the scope and size of hedge fund activities.  Data coverage of 

the vast derivatives market could also be improved.  The paucity of information in some 

areas limits the ability of supervisors and regulators to work effectively toward the 

stability of financial institutions and the financial system.  For example, outside of the 

banking system, we have only limited information on leverage and maturity 

transformation rather than precise estimates for all types of nonbank entities. 

Conclusion 

To conclude, the U.S. financial system has changed a great deal over the past 

several decades.  One of the most important changes has been the rapid growth of the 

nonbank sector.  Many reforms have been adopted for both banks and nonbank financial 

institutions.  But regulation is a cat and mouse game.  Regulators need to respond to 

existing regulatory gaps and to keep pace with further changes.  We hope we will succeed 

in doing so.  But we know that we will never be able to identify in advance all the threats 

to stability that are out there, and that it is therefore all the more critical to maintain and 

strengthen the robustness of our financial institutions, and of the financial system as a 

whole.
