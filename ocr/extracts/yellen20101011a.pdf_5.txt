events demonstrate both the natural tendency of the financial system to cycle through 

booms and busts and the potential, absent adequate supervision and regulation, for 

breakdowns in the financial system to threaten the global economy.   

Financial market participants can be bipolar--prone to fads, manias, myopia, 

panics, and depression; driven by short-term gain; and easily caught up in the madness of 

crowds.  One’s belief about the beliefs of others is critical, like Keynes’s example of a 

beauty contest.3  In addition, the structure of compensation and incentives in the financial 

sector created strong motives for excessive risk-taking, especially during boom years.  

Methods of modern risk management may have intensified the cycle because of their 

reliance on metrics such as value at risk that are highly sensitive to recent performance, 

especially volatility.  In good times, volatility declined, and value at risk along with it.  

This pattern generated a pro-cyclical willingness to take on risk and leverage, amplifying 

and propagating the boom and bust cycle.  The vicious cycle of a collapse of confidence, 

asset fire sales, evaporation of liquidity, and a deleveraging free fall was the mirror image 

of the manic mortgage market that preceded it. 

 To avoid a repeat of these events, it is essential that we change the landscape of 

supervision and regulation.  The landmark legislation recently passed by the Congress, 

the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), is 

designed to do just that.  It requires regulators to contain risks to the financial system 

before they erupt into crises.  And it creates a structure to collect data, identify emerging 

threats to financial stability, and formulate policies to contain these risks.
