grow more quickly than it has recently, the unemployment rate is likely to remain far 

above levels consistent with maximum employment for some time.  

In light of the policy actions the FOMC has taken to date, as well as the 

economy’s natural recovery mechanisms, we might have hoped for greater progress by 

now in returning to maximum employment.  Some have taken the lack of progress as 

evidence that the financial crisis caused structural damage to the economy, rendering the 

current levels of unemployment impervious to additional monetary accommodation.  The 

literature on this issue is extensive, and I cannot fully review it today.29  However, 

following every previous U.S. recession since World War II, the unemployment rate has 

returned close to its pre-recession level, and, although the recent recession was unusually 

deep, I see little evidence of substantial structural change in recent years. 

Rather than attributing the slow recovery to longer-term structural factors, I see 

growth being held back currently by a number of headwinds.  First, although the housing 

sector has shown signs of improvement, housing activity remains at low levels and is 

contributing much less to the recovery than would normally be expected at this stage of 

the cycle.  

Second, fiscal policy, at both the federal and state and local levels, has become an 

important headwind for the pace of economic growth.  Notwithstanding some recent 

improvement in tax revenues, state and local governments still face tight budget 

situations and continue to cut real spending and employment.  Real purchases are also 

declining at the federal level.  Uncertainties about fiscal policy, notably about the 

resolution of the so-called fiscal cliff and the lifting of the debt ceiling, are probably also
