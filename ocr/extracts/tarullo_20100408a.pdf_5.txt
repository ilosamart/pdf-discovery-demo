practical steps are obviously taking place in preparation for a change in monetary policy.  But it 

is important to emphasize that the completion of preparatory steps need not be followed in short 

order by the initiation of tightening measures.  The preparations for exit will allow us to move 

with confidence when the time is right.  They do not push us toward the door.  Indeed, the 

relatively modest pace of recovery, the continued high rate of unemployment, subdued inflation 

trends, and well-anchored inflation expectations together suggest that the need for highly 

accommodative monetary policies will not diminish soon.  Of course, we should and will be 

attentive to new information suggesting otherwise. 

As to the precise mix and sequencing of tools when the time to tighten does come, the 

FOMC should continue to analyze conditions and keep the public apprised of our thinking.  But 

it seems to me neither necessary nor advisable to decide upon a single game plan that will be 

announced in advance and rigidly implemented after a decision is made to raise rates.  Apart 

from the key element of raising interest rates on reserves, the optimal strategy will likely depend 

on the specific money market and lending conditions that prevail at the time.  For instance, some 

circumstances might dictate the advisability of a quite rapid sequence of reserve draining and 

interest rate raising steps, whereas other conditions might argue for a more measured and 

incremental approach.   

Like many others--on and off the FOMC--I have certain predispositions in considering 

the question of an exit strategy.  For example, I would be very cautious about any exit strategy 

that includes early asset sales.  While we ultimately want to move our balance sheet back to a 

more traditional structure, the effects of such sales are very uncertain, particularly in a period 

before a sustainable recovery is well established.  But, as with all monetary policy decisions, we 

should ultimately tailor the particulars of our response to the circumstances as we find them.  If
