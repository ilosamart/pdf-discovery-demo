Thank you very much for your invitation to speak at this second annual symposium on 

financial regulatory reform.  Before addressing that topic, I want to say a word about the 

mortgage foreclosure documentation imbroglio, the latest chapter in the recent sad history of 

mortgage finance in this country.   

The Need to Increase Mortgage Modifications 

As you know, inquiries into the extent of, and culpability for, these problems are 

currently being conducted by banking regulators, other federal agencies, and state attorneys 

general.  Regardless of the findings that emerge, and the steps that servicers and others may take 

to correct their mistakes, this episode has again drawn attention to what can only be described as 

a perverse set of incentives for homeowners with underwater mortgages.  Homeowners who try 

to get a modification of the terms of their mortgages are all too frequently subject to delay and 

disappointment.  On the other hand, those who simply stop paying their mortgages have found 

that they can often stay in their homes for a year or more, rent free, before the foreclosure 

process moves ahead.     

This simply is not a good outcome from any broad perspective--not for the revival of 

housing markets, not for the banks and investors that hold the delinquent mortgages, and in the 

longer run, not even for the homeowners themselves, who will ultimately have to move out, 

taking with them a dark cloud over their creditworthiness.   

Several possible explanations have been suggested for this untoward state of affairs--the 

lack of servicer capacity to execute modifications, purported financial incentives for servicers to 

foreclose rather than modify, what until recently appeared to be easier execution of foreclosures 

relative to modifications, limits on the authority of securitization trustees, and conflicts between 

primary and secondary lien holders.  Whatever the merits and relative weights of these various
