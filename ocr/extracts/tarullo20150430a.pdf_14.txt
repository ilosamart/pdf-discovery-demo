believe the concept of a “simpler” set of requirements is meant to describe something much 

closer to Basel I in terms of the detail and number of risk categories.  Because so many smaller 

community banks maintain capital levels well above minimum regulatory levels anyway, the 

tradeoff of higher requirements for a simpler approach may be promising 

This is only one idea, and there may be other approaches that could simplify smaller 

community bank capital requirements in a manner consistent with the Collins Amendment.  I 

look forward to discussions within the banking agencies, with the industry, and with other 

interested parties on possibilities for developing a sensible and feasible approach.

will, among other things, be one that results in changes in the regulations and supervisory 

practices of the banking agencies so as to yield significant reduction in compliance costs for 

community banks.  It should not be a merely bureaucratic exercise in formal fulfillment of a 

statutory requirement.  There are numerous issues beyond those I’ve mentioned already that

particular regulatory and supervisory practices upon them and if, reciprocally, bankers 

understand the responsibility of regulators to protect the safety and soundness of banks and, thus, 

the deposit insurance fund.  So, for example, although it is always useful to hear why regulated
