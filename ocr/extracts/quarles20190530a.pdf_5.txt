the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is to examine the costs and benefits of such a 

policy in terms of unemployment and inflation.  In this approach, the costs of tightening 

monetary policy in response to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities are lower 

employment and potentially below target inflation in the near term.  The benefits are 

possibly reducing the risk of a future financial crisis, an event likely associated with a 

much larger fall in employment and inflation.   

One view is that monetary policy curbs household and business borrowing only 

modestly but can boost the unemployment rate notably.  And so using monetary policy to 

damp borrowing does more harm than good.  According to this view, using monetary 

policy to lean against financial vulnerabilities does not generate significant net benefits 

and may be counterproductive—increasing unemployment and decreasing inflation 

below a desired level with little reduction in risks to financial stability.4   

At the same time, some research has identified circumstances under which the 

benefits of using monetary policy to lean against financial vulnerabilities could outweigh 

the costs. 5  A key consideration is the estimated amount of economic activity lost in a 

financial crisis—and some research suggests such losses may be quite large, which raises 

the benefits of leaning against imbalances.  Similarly, monetary policy may affect a broad 

range of financial imbalances—excessively high house or equity prices and leverage 

within the financial sector—and the full set of these effects could shift the risk of 

financial instability sufficiently, at least under some circumstances, to make leaning 

against financial vulnerabilities with monetary policy desirable.  The broader point is that
