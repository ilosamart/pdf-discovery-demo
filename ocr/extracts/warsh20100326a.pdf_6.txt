In times of more significant economic and financial distress, the pace of monetary 

accommodation often increases.  And when liquidity becomes scarce--as was the case during the 

Panic of 2008--the Fed finds itself charged with more novel and significant challenges in 

providing liquidity to institutions and markets.5   

History teaches us that fiscal and monetary policies tend to blur in these times of crisis.  

Capital and liquidity issues become difficult to disentangle at troubled institutions. 6  Capital 

offsets losses.  Liquidity bridges gaps in funding.  And well-intentioned policymakers are 

compelled to make tough judgments amid significant time constraints.  What constitutes an 

emergency liquidity provision backed by good collateral at a penalty price?  And what is more 

aptly characterized as a fiscal provision to bolster capital?  

The Federal Reserve must do its utmost to stay foursquare within its role as liquidity 

provider.  The Fed’s financial stability responsibilities, which may well be elevated in pending 

legislation, should not give license to central bankers to be emergency capital providers.  Capital 

allocations should reside, if anywhere, with the fiscal authority and its fiscal agent, the 

Department of Treasury.   

The Fed, as first-responder, must strongly resist the temptation to be the ultimate rescuer.  

No matter the congressional calendar or the pleadings of the elected, the Fed is not a repair shop 

for broken statutes or broken financial ecosystems.7  And it should not be an appeals court to

6 The Fed’s role as liquidity provider in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) exemplifies the 
challenge in drawing clear lines.  The TALF made loans to investors for the purchase of highly rated assets.  The 
assets, in turn, served as collateral for the loans.  First losses were borne by the investors, as the loan was never for 
the full value of the assets.  The Department of Treasury took the second-loss position behind investors, thereby 
acting as a fiscal agent providing credit and taking some risk.  The Federal Reserve was in a third-loss position, and 
thus aimed to serve the role of liquidity provider. 
7 Mortgage finance deserves careful review.  Quasi-governmental entities, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are 
increasingly being deployed as fiscal agents.  The Federal Reserve’s actions should not slow the impetus to 
implement fundamental reform in housing finance.
