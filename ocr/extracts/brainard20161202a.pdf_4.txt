automating savings decisions based on what consumers can afford, and they are helping 

consumers set financial goals and providing feedback on expenditures that are 

inconsistent with those goals.  In some cases, fintech applications are automatically 

transferring spare account balances into savings, based on monthly spending and income 

patterns, effectively making savings the default choice.  Other applications are providing 

consumers with more real-time access to earnings as they are accrued rather than waiting 

for their regular payday.  This service may be particularly valuable to the nearly 50 

percent of adults with extremely limited liquid savings.4  It is too early to know what the 

overall impact of these innovations will be, but they offer the potential to empower 

consumers to better manage cash flow to reduce the need for more expensive credit 

products to cover short-term cash needs.5 

One particularly promising aspect of fintech is the potential to expand access to 

credit and other financial services for consumers and small businesses.  By reducing loan 

processing and underwriting costs, online origination platforms may enable financial 

services providers to more cost effectively offer smaller-balance loans to households and 

small businesses than had previously been feasible.6  In addition, broader analysis of data 

may allow lenders to better assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, facilitating 

                                                 
4 The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking finds that 46 percent 
of households report that they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an 
unexpected expense of $400.  The report of survey findings is available on the Board’s website at

5 Robo-advisors are making investing and retirement planning cheaper and more accessible, filling a 
particular need as the coverage of employer-provided retirement plans has declined.  According to Insider 
Newsletter published by Willis Towers Watson (vol. 26, no. 2, February 2016), only 20 percent of Fortune 
500 companies offered a defined-benefit plan to salaried new hires in 2015, down from 59 percent among 
the same employers in 1998.
