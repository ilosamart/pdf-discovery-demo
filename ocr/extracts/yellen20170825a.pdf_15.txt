the effects of financial market regulations and considering appropriate adjustments.  

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has independently taken steps to evaluate potential 

adjustments to its regulatory and supervisory practices.  For example, the Federal Reserve 

initiated a review of its stress tests following the 2015 cycle, and this review suggested 

changes to reduce the burden on participating institutions, especially smaller institutions, 

and to better align the supervisory stress tests with regulatory capital requirements.21  In 

addition, a broader set of changes to the new financial regulatory framework may deserve 

consideration.  Such changes include adjustments that may simplify regulations applying 

to small and medium-sized banks and enhance resolution planning.22 

More broadly, we continue to monitor economic conditions, and to review and 

conduct research, to better understand the effect of regulatory reforms and possible 

implications for regulation.  I will briefly summarize the current state of play in two 

areas:  the effect of regulation on credit availability and on changes in market liquidity. 

                                                 
21 In response to the Federal Reserve’s review and other information, the Board finalized a rule adjusting its 

capital plan and stress-testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle, on January 30, 2017.  The final rule 

removes large and noncomplex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR, 

reducing significant burden on these firms and focusing the qualitative review in CCAR on the largest, 

most complex financial institutions.  More generally, changes to improve regulatory and supervisory 

practices related to stress testing by reducing unnecessary burden while preserving resilience are under 

consideration.  Possible changes have been discussed in Daniel K. Tarullo (2016), “Next Steps in the 

Evolution of Stress Testing,” speech delivered at the Yale University School of Management Leaders 

Forum, New Haven, Conn., September 26,

22 An overview of a set of principles that may guide such adjustments is discussed by Jerome H. Powell 

(2017), “Relationship between Regulation and Economic Growth,” statement before the Committee on 

Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20170622a.htm.  In addition, the Federal 

Reserve Board has continued to engage in international efforts to assess the effects of reforms and possible 

adjustments; in this context, the FSB has developed a framework for the post-implementation evaluation of 

the effects of the Group of Twenty financial regulatory reforms; see Financial Stability Board (2017), 

Framework for Post-Implementation Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms
