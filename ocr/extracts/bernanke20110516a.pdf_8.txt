developed countries, with the United States still the leader in overall R&D spending.10   

However, in recent years, spending on R&D has increased sharply in some emerging 

market economies, most notably in China and India.  In particular, spending for R&D by 

China has increased rapidly in absolute terms, although recent estimates still show its 

R&D spending to be smaller relative to GDP than in the United States.11  Reflecting the 

increased research activity in emerging market economies, the share of world R&D 

expenditures by member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and 

Development, which mostly comprises advanced economies, has fallen relative to non-

member nations, which tend to be less developed.  A similar trend is evident, by the way, 

with respect to science and engineering workforces.12  

How should policymakers think about the increasing globalization of R&D 

spending?  On the one hand, the diffusion of scientific and technological research 

throughout the world potentially benefits everyone by increasing the pace of innovation 

globally.  For example, the development of the polio vaccine in the United States in the 

1950s provided enormous benefits to people globally, not just Americans.  Moreover, in a 

globalized economy, product and process innovations in one country can lead to 

employment opportunities and improved goods and services around the world.   

On the other hand, in some circumstances, the location of R&D activity can 

matter.  For example, technological prowess may help a country reap the financial and 

                                                 
10 Among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, the United States is 
estimated to have spent the most on R&D in 2010, followed by Japan, Germany, South Korea, France, and 
the United Kingdom (Battelle and R&D Magazine, 2010).  As a percentage of GDP, Israel ranked first 
among OECD nations in R&D spending, followed by Finland, Sweden, Japan, and South Korea (OECD, 
2010). 
11 China’s gross R&D expenditures are estimated to have increased more than five-fold between 1997 and 
2007 and, by 2010, are estimated to have been roughly on par with expenditures in Japan, the world’s 
second-largest spender on R&D, although they were still about one-third the expenditures in the United 
States.  See National Science Foundation (2010) and Battelle and R&D Magazine (2010).
