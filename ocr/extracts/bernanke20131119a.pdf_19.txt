threshold is crossed and at least until the preponderance of the data supports the 

beginning of the removal of policy accommodation.  

Conclusion 

I began my time as Chairman with the goal of increasing the transparency of the 

Federal Reserve, and of monetary policy in particular.  In response to a financial crisis 

and a deep recession, the Fed’s monetary policy communications have proved far more 

important and have evolved in different ways than I would have envisioned eight years 

ago.   

The economy has made significant progress since the depths of the recession.  

However, we are still far from where we would like to be, and, consequently, it may be 

some time before monetary policy returns to more normal settings.  I agree with the 

sentiment, expressed by my colleague Janet Yellen at her testimony last week, that the 

surest path to a more normal approach to monetary policy is to do all we can today to 

promote a more robust recovery.19  The FOMC remains committed to maintaining highly 

accommodative policies for as long as they are needed.  Communication about policy is 

likely to remain a central element of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to achieve its policy 

goals.
