influence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention 

to pursue a particular inflation goal in the future?  Or does the truth lie somewhere in 

between, with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear 

communications about policymakers’ inflation goal, concrete policy actions to 

demonstrate their commitment to that goal, and at least some success in moving actual 

inflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy?  

Although historical experience suggests that changing the public’s inflation expectations 

would be neither quick nor easy, it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct.23  

With nominal short-term interest rates at or close to their effective lower bound in 

many countries, the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on 

heightened importance.  Under such circumstances, many central banks have sought 

additional ways to stimulate their economies, including adopting policies that are directly 

aimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation.  The unusually 

explicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that 

was provided by the FOMC from 2011 through 2014 is an example of such a policy, as is 

the Bank of Japan’s upward revision to its official inflation objective in 2013.  Moreover, 

these and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future, given the 

likelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest 

rates, thereby making it unlikely that reductions in short-term interest rates alone would 

be an adequate response to a future recession.24   

                                                 
23 See Kiley (2008) for a discussion of the relationship between U.S. monetary policy and survey measures 
of long-run inflation expectations; his results suggest that it took many years for the Federal Reserve to 
succeed in anchoring long-run expectations at a low level.  In a similar vein, Bernanke and others (1999b) 
conclude that inflation expectations “respond only after a lag following declines in [actual] inflation” 
(p. 298) based on their study of the effects of adopting inflation targeting in different countries.   
24 I discussed this likelihood in a recent speech (Yellen, 2016).
