arranged” in describing qualifying liquid resources.  Indeed, the PFMI does not view spot 

transactions on the open market as reliable sources of liquidity during times of stress.  The 

Federal Reserve has strongly supported this approach.  Liquidity plans should not take for 

granted that, at a time of stress involving a member default, lines of credit, repurchase 

agreements, or FX swaps could be arranged on the spot.  Committed sources of liquidity are 

more likely to be available.  They also allow market participants and regulators to make sure that 

plans are mutually consistent.  If a CCP has arranged for a committed liquidity source, then the 

provider should account for it in its own plans and demonstrate that it can meet its commitment.  

Of course, this liquidity is not free, nor should it be.  Regulatory changes have forced 

banks to closely examine their liquidity planning and to internalize the costs of liquidity 

provision.  The costs of committed liquidity facilities will be passed on to clearing members.  

These costs are perhaps highest in clearing Treasury securities, where liquidity needs can be 

especially large.  To meet its estimated needs, DTCC’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation 

(FICC) is planning to institute a committed repo arrangement with its clearing members.  Despite 

initial concerns, the industry seems prepared to absorb these costs, but they will not be trivial for 

many members.4  


Payment Flows to CCPs 

While initial and variation margin help mitigate credit risk in central clearing, they can 

also create liquidity risk.  Clearing members and their clients are required to make margin 

payments to CCPs on a daily basis, and in times of market volatility these payments may rise
