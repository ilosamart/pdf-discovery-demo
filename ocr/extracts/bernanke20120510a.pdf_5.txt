larger institutions, most of the gains were due to reductions in loan loss provisions rather 

than to more sustainable sources of profit such as expanded lending.   

Financial-market indicators reflect the substantial improvements in banks’ 

financial conditions since the crisis as well as the sizable challenges remaining.  Bank 

credit default swap (CDS) premiums are now well below their crisis peaks, and bank 

stock prices have retraced some of their earlier losses and have outperformed the broader 

market this year, boosted somewhat by the release of the CCAR results in March and 

first-quarter earnings that largely beat analysts’ expectations.  However, CDS premiums 

remain elevated for some of the larger, more globally connected firms, and their stocks 

continue to trade at market-to-book ratios of less than 1.    

A number of key systemic risk measures that evaluate the potential performance 

of firms during times of financial market stress have improved in recent months.  These 

indicators of systemic risk are now well below their levels in the crisis, and, overall, they 

present a picture of a banking system that has become healthier and more resilient.

Regulatory and Financial Challenges 

Banks face a number of significant challenges as they adapt to the post-crisis 

economic environment and to new domestic and international regulatory requirements.  

The most systemically important financial firms will face meaningfully higher capital and

 Such measures include the conditional value at risk, or CoVaR, which is an estimate of the extent to 

which a bank’s distress would be associated with an increase in the downside risk to the financial system; 

the distress insurance premium, or DIP, which measures the cost of insuring a firm against systemwide 

distress; and the systemic expected shortfall, or SES, which estimates the extent to which the market value 

equity of a firm would be depleted by a marketwide decline in equity prices.  These measures are based on 

firms’ stock prices, CDS premiums, and stock price volatility, as well as the correlation in asset prices 

across firms.
