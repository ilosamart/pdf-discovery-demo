Monetary Policy and Risks to Financial Stability 

I hardly need remind this audience that the monetary policy pursued by the 

Federal Reserve in the past five years has occasioned considerable debate and 

controversy.  Much of the debate revolves around the degree of efficacy of the 

unconventional instruments, particularly large-scale asset purchases, and particularly 

whether there might be diminishing returns to these purchases in some circumstances.  I 

am certain that analysis of these issues will continue not only in the near term, but also in 

academic circles for years to come. 

A good bit of criticism has focused on the large expansion of the balance sheet 

and the sizable amount of excess reserves in the banking system.  One oft-stated worry is 

that when it is time to normalize policy, we will be unable to withdraw reserves as 

quickly as needed to prevent an unwanted rise in inflation.  Under the operating 

procedures used prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of excess reserves 

could well have impeded the FOMCâ€™s ability to raise short-term interest rates.  But we 

have a variety of tools to neutralize the effects of our balance sheet without selling assets.  

For example, we now pay interest on reserves; raising that rate would put upward 

pressure on short-term rates.  In addition, we can drain reserves by employing fixed-rate 

overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, and term repurchase agreements.  

We will continue to develop and, as appropriate, test these tools to allow normalization of 

the balance sheet without unwanted inflationary consequences. 

The area of concern about recent monetary policy that I want to address at greater 

length relates to financial stability.  The worry is that the actual extended period of low 

interest rates, along with expectations fostered by forward guidance of continued low
