term needs of small businesses.  In May, for example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 

hosted five small business roundtable discussions in the region--one each in Columbus, Toledo, 

Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh--and a workshop on venture capital as part of this series of 

meetings.   These meetings have brought together people with a wide range of backgrounds, 

including those from banks, community development financial institutions, bank exam teams, 

federal and local government, and small business trade groups.  While most sessions have 

focused on small businesses in general, others have been more targeted.  A meeting in Miami, 

for example, focused on the needs of Hispanic-owned small businesses.     

 Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke participated in a session in 

Detroit while I participated in a meeting in Tampa.  I find it interesting that the concerns that I 

heard in Tampa--for instance, with respect to the impact that devalued collateral has had on small 

business ownersâ€™ abilities to obtain financing--were also raised with the Chairman in Detroit.  

Although these two cities have very different economic situations, the impact of the recession 

has left small businesses in a strikingly similar bind.    

These small business forums have given us the opportunity to hear directly from local 

stakeholders about local market conditions.  We are gathering information from these meetings 

to help us address areas where the flow of credit to small businesses may be hindered.  Emerging 

themes, best practices, and common challenges will be presented at a conference at the Federal 

Reserve in Washington next month.  I look forward to that discussion and learning what 

government policymakers, nonprofit leaders, and others can do to facilitate the flow of credit to 

small businesses.
