 A stress test is a critical part of the annual capital review.  But, as these different purposes 

indicate, the capital review is about more than using a stress test to determine whether a firm’s 

capital distribution plans are consistent with remaining a viable financial intermediary even in an 

adverse scenario.  As indicated during our capital reviews in both 2011 and 2012, the Federal 

Reserve may object to a capital plan because of significant deficiencies in the capital planning 

process, as well as because one or more relevant capital ratios would fall below required levels 

under the assumptions of stress and planned capital distributions.  Likewise, the stress test is 

relevant not only for its role in the capital planning process.  As noted earlier, it also serves other 

important purposes, not least of which is increased transparency of both bank holding company 

balance sheets and the supervisory process of the Federal Reserve. 

Results of the 2012 Stress Test and Capital Review 

 The stress test that the Federal Reserve developed in the fall of 2011 and administered 

over the succeeding months was based on a quite adverse scenario.  It hypothesized a deep 

recession in the United States, with GDP contracting sharply, unemployment reaching a peak of 

more than 13 percent, equity prices falling by half, and house prices declining by an additional 

20 percent from their 2011 levels.  In addition, given the potential for financial stress in Europe, 

the scenario included a global recession and a global financial market shock.  The latter, applied 

to the trading, derivatives, and private equity positions of the six firms with the highest volumes 

of trading, included a dramatic widening of credit default spreads for both European sovereigns 

and financial institutions, as well as sharp increases in spreads for European sovereign bonds.   

 When we announced the scenario in November, a number of observers questioned 

whether a scenario of this severity was realistic.  In this regard, it is important to reemphasize 

that the stress scenario is not a forecast of what will happen.  It reflects, instead, an unlikely but
