young adults did not receive information about jobs and careers in high school and 

college.  P-TECH is focused on providing information about educational opportunities 

and jobs to students before they enter high school.   

Third, the survey found that many young workers are not employed in fields 

aligned with their education.  Fewer than half (45 percent) of the young workers surveyed 

said they were employed in a career field that is closely related to their educational and 

training background.  P-TECH focuses on aligning education with actual jobs.   

Finally, the survey found that steady employment is very important to young 

workers.  In 2015, young adults had a strong preference for steady employment (62 

percent) over higher pay (36 percent).  And, among the respondents who preferred steady 

employment, 80 percent would rather have one steady job than a stream of steady jobs for 

the next five years.  The work that P-TECH students do directly with employers helps 

steer them toward long-term, steady employment. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion, I am proud that the Federal Reserve is contributing to the efforts of 

the P-TECH program in the Rochester area and I look forward to the video presentations 

we will have shortly.   I want to congratulate in advance the winners of the video 

competition, who will also be announced shortly.  I also want to congratulate all of you 

for being part of a 21st century education program that will help connect you to pathways 

of opportunity and help enable you to make important contributions to the vitality of your 

community.
