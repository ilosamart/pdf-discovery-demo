I would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of 

Massachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble 

Memorial Lecture.  

In my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s 

conduct of monetary policy.  I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the 

United States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points:  that inflation is now much 

more stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level.  I will 

then consider the costs associated with inflation, and why these costs suggest that the 

Federal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent.  After briefly reviewing 

our policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and 

their implications for the outlook and monetary policy.  

Historical Review of Inflation 

A crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate 

of increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services.  Keeping inflation stable 

at a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is 

high, excessively low, or unstable imposes significant costs on households and 

businesses.  As a result, inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress 

has laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and 

stable prices.   

The Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability 

element of its mandate.  The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent 

change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)--the measure of 

inflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or
