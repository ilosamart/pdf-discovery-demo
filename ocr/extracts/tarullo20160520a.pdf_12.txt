Progress in developing such a global capital standard for internationally active insurance 

firms has been slow.  I will mention some of the difficulties that have been encountered.  First, 

there is considerable heterogeneity among the insurance products offered in different 

jurisdictions.  As one example, annuities and other savings and retirement products tend to be 

offered less frequently in countries with relatively expansive government pension programs.  In 

the context of developing capital requirements, a second factor has been jurisdictional variations 

in accounting and valuation standards on which global capital requirements for insurance 

companies can be built.  A third factor has been significant disagreement on the extent to which 

capital standards for internationally active insurance companies should be built on internal 

models.  These challenges and the protracted process they have occasioned have, as a practical 

matter, rendered the ICS insufficiently developed to be an option as the Federal Reserve moves 

forward with capital requirements applicable to the insurance companies we supervise. 

A second relevant initiative of the IAIS involves the design of an enhanced regulatory 

and supervisory framework for global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs).  In 2014, the 

IAIS released the Basic Capital Requirement (BCR) for G-SIIs.  It is the first international 

consolidated capital standard developed for the insurance industry.  The IAIS developed the 

BCR in an effort to ensure the soundness of global insurance firms with the largest systemic 

footprints.  In 2015, the IAIS supplemented the BCR with a Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) 

capital standard for G-SIIs.  But the IAIS will need to revisit the BCR after the first version of 

ICS is complete and will also need to revisit HLA after further refinement is made on its G-SII 

identification methodology.  This somewhat provisional character of the BCR, along with its 

reliance on a method of valuation not in use by U.S. companies and regulators, mean it does not
