addition, if the books of the insurance company are large enough, it then becomes a potential 

vehicle for transmitting distress at the company to other parts of the financial system. 

 Thus the liability side of the balance sheets of firms that are all “insurance companies” 

can vary substantially, just as with firms that are called “banks” or “bank holding companies.”  

Yet capital regulation currently applicable to insurance companies seems not to make some of 

the relevant distinctions.  Traditional capital regulation, with an implicit aim of protecting only 

conventional policyholders over time, potentially through an orderly insolvency, does not reflect 

the balance sheet risks I have just described.  Yet more recent measures, such as Solvency II, 

with its heavy emphasis on current market valuation, may not take account of the fact that 

liability and liquidity risks for genuinely traditional life insurance products are relatively limited 

compared to those of many other intermediaries.  In some respects, Solvency II ignores the 

strength of conventional insurance funding--that assets can be held for the truly long-term, 

through multiple business cycles--even as it focuses directly on the fluctuations in asset values 

that are indeed relevant to many less conventional activities. 

This brief review illustrates the challenges in fashioning capital requirements for large 

insurance companies with a mix of traditional, nontraditional, and noninsurance activities that 

are sometimes quite intertwined in particular business lines or subsidiaries.  And, even where 

these activities are reasonably segregated from one another, some of the policy devices suggested 

for differential capital treatment may be misplaced.  For example, deciding on higher capital 

requirements based solely on whether an activity is “nontraditional” for an insurance company 

can be inappropriate.  A “nontraditional” activity for an insurance company could embrace 

everything from the massive derivatives business maintained by the pre-crisis AIG to very sedate 

businesses outside the financial sphere entirely.  In confronting these and similar challenges, I
