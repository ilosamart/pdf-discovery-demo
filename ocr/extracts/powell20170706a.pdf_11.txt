principles are based on the lessons learned from the old system’s collapse, and from the 

experience of post-crisis bank reform. 

First, we ought to do whatever we can to make the possibility of future housing bailouts 

as remote as possible.  Housing can be a volatile sector, and housing is often found at the heart of 

financial crises.10  Our housing finance institutions were not--and are not--structured with that in 

mind.  Extreme fluctuations in credit availability for housing hurt vulnerable households, reduce 

affordability and availability, and, as we have seen, can threaten financial stability.  As with 

banks, the goal should be to ensure that our housing finance system can continue to function 

even in the face of significant house price declines and severe economic conditions.  Changing 

the system to attract large amounts of private capital would be a major step toward that goal.   

The question of the government’s role in the new system is a challenging one for 

Congress.  Many of the well-known reform proposals include some role for government.  Some 

argue that government cannot avoid bearing the deep-in-the-tail risk of a catastrophic housing 

crisis.  A number of proposals incorporate a government guarantee to cover this risk, to take 

effect after a significant stack of private capital is wiped out. 

That brings me to my second principle:  If Congress chooses to go in this direction, any 

such guarantee should be explicit and transparent, and should apply to securities, not to
