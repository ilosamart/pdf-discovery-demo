short-term real interest rate is too high, given the state of the economy), and the risk of 

deflation is higher than desirable.  Given that monetary policy works with a lag, the more 

relevant question is whether this situation is forecast to continue.  In light of the recent 

decline in inflation, the degree of slack in the economy, and the relative stability of 

inflation expectations, it is reasonable to forecast that underlying inflation--setting aside 

the inevitable short-run volatility--will be less than the mandate-consistent inflation rate 

for some time.  Of course, forecasts of inflation, as of other key economic variables, are 

uncertain and must be regularly updated with the arrival of new information. 

As of June, the longer-run unemployment projections in the SEP had a central 

tendency of about 5 to 5-1/4 percent--about 1/4 percentage point higher than a year 

earlier--and a couple of participants’ projections were even higher at around 6 to 

6-1/4 percent.  The evolution of these projections and the diversity of views reflect the 

characteristics that I noted earlier:  The sustainable rate of unemployment may vary over 

time, and estimates of its value are subject to considerable uncertainty.  Nonetheless, with 

an actual unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent, unemployment is clearly too high 

relative to estimates of its sustainable rate.  Moreover, with output growth over the next 

year expected to be only modestly above its longer-term trend, high unemployment is 

currently forecast to persist for some time.

Given the Committee’s objectives, there would appear--all else being equal--to be 

a case for further action.  However, as I indicated earlier, one of the implications of a 

low-inflation environment is that policy is more likely to be constrained by the fact that 

nominal interest rates cannot be reduced below zero.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve
