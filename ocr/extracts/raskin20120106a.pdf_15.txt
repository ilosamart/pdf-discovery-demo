views may differ.  I also believe it is critically important for federal examiners to work 

closely with their state colleagues, especially since we have joint supervisory 

responsibility for state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.  

When these working relationships are strong, the banks we jointly oversee receive 

supervisory messages that are consistent.   

The need for effective communication and feedback goes beyond the examination 

period.  Examiners and other supervisory staff are often key sources of information on 

regulatory developments between examinations.  We encourage our examiners to be 

responsive to questions from bankers and help banks understand new regulatory 

requirements, and they take this responsibility seriously.  

One of the analogies that I began to use years ago--and that I’ve shared with many 

of you--is that the risk-management system of a healthy bank can be pictured as a series 

of concentric circles.  The inner circles consist of the systems and functions that keep the 

bank healthy and allow it to meet the credit needs of its community while remaining 

financially sound and compliant with its legal and regulatory obligations.  Moving 

outward, additional circles include processes and checks such as internal audit, executive 

management committees, risk-management and internal controls, and appropriate 

governance by the board of directors.  The outermost circle is effective supervision.  The 

critical element of this model is that problem identification is first and foremost the 

responsibility of the bank, while banking supervisors kick the tires of the bank’s risk-

management and internal control systems.  The examiners are, in this sense, a last line of 

defense and do not substitute for a bank’s own processes for risk identification and 

mitigation.  They are not a guarantee of the bank’s ultimate success or failure.
