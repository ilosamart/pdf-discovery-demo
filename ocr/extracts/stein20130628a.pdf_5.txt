excessively sensitive to the sort of near-term momentum captured by, for example, the 

last payroll number that comes in just before the meeting.    

 In part, this principle just reflects sound statistical inference--one doesn’t want to 

put too much weight on one or two noisy observations.  But there is more to it than that.  

Not only do FOMC actions shape market expectations, but the converse is true as well:  

Market expectations influence FOMC actions.  It is difficult for the Committee to take an 

action at any meeting that is wholly unanticipated because we don’t want to create undue 

market volatility.  However, when there is a two-way feedback between financial 

conditions and FOMC actions, an initial perception that noisy recent data play a central 

role in the policy process can become somewhat self-fulfilling and can itself be the cause 

of extraneous volatility in asset prices.   

 Thus both in an effort to make reliable judgments about the state of the economy, 

as well as to reduce the possibility of an undesirable feedback loop, the best approach is 

for the Committee to be clear that in making a decision in, say, September, it will give 

primary weight to the large stock of news that has accumulated since the inception of the 

program and will not be unduly influenced by whatever data releases arrive in the few 

weeks before the meeting--as salient as these releases may appear to be to market 

participants.  I should emphasize that this would not mean abandoning the premise that 

the program as a whole should be both data-dependent and forward looking.  Even if a 

data release from early September does not exert a strong influence on the decision to 

make an adjustment at the September meeting, that release will remain relevant for future 

decisions.  If the news is bad, and it is confirmed by further bad news in October and
