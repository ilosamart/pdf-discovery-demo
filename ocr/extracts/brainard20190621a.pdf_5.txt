On the other hand, today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack, along with the 

limited ability to cut interest rates in a recession, means it can be more difficult to achieve 

our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis.  The limited ability to cut interest 

rates could provide less ability to buffer the economy in a downturn, while the very flat 

Phillips curve could make it harder to boost inflation during an expansion.  And that 

could further compress policy space in a negative spiral.   

As we have seen in other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the 

central bank’s objective, consumers, workers, and businesses start to expect lower 

inflation to continue.  Expectations of low inflation can create a self-fulfilling dynamic 

with actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.  

And because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates, that, in turn, can reduce the 

amount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from 

slipping into recession.  In fact, in recent years, central banks around the world have had 

to use a larger variety of policy tools than they have traditionally used to support the 

recovery.   

Some Issues to Explore 

Given the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of 

inflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here 

and around the world, with a view to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the 

Congress assigned to us.  Earlier this month, we held a conference in Chicago where we 

heard from experts as well as community organizations, small businesses, labor 

organizations, and retirees.  We are looking at our tools and strategies, assessing not just
