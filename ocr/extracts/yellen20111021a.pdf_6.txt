In the government sector, with ongoing pressures on their budgets, state and local 

governments have continued to shrink their payrolls and reduce their spending on 

construction projects.  Moreover, the boost to the economy from earlier stimulus policies 

by the federal government has begun to wind down, and, absent further actions by the 

Congress and the Administration, federal fiscal policy will also restrain the pace of the 

recovery in the year ahead.  Of course, it is unclear how the future path for fiscal policy 

will evolve--a topic I will return to later--and the uncertainty surrounding both the federal 

budget process and the future course of fiscal policy appears to have weighed on 

household and business confidence of late. 

I noted earlier that the recovery has benefited from rising exports, largely 

reflecting strong foreign economic growth.  But since the spring, the pace of underlying 

economic growth in many foreign economies has slowed.  Economic activity has 

decelerated particularly sharply in Europe because of the intensification of fiscal and 

financial stress in the euro area.  The substantial reductions in government spending and 

increases in taxes that some countries have had to put in place to address their fiscal 

problems also have weighed on the pace of economic activity in the region.  In addition, 

economic growth in many emerging market economies also looks to be moderating.  

Over the past two years, emerging market economies generally have been expanding at a 

faster rate than the more advanced economies, which has helped boost the overall pace of 

the global recovery.  The recent step-down in the rate of expansion in many of these 

economies likely reflects less demand for their exports from Europe and the United 

States.
