addition, algorithmic traders and institutional investors are a larger presence in various 

markets than previously, and the willingness of these institutions to support liquidity in 

stressful conditions is uncertain.  While no single factor appears to be the predominant 

cause of the evolution of market liquidity, some regulations may be affecting market 

liquidity somewhat.  There may be benefits to simplifying aspects of the Volcker rule, 

which limits proprietary trading by banking firms, and to reviewing the interaction of the 

enhanced supplementary leverage ratio with risk-based capital requirements.  At the same 

time, the new regulatory framework overall has made dealers more resilient to shocks, 

and, in the past, distress at dealers following adverse shocks has been an important factor 

driving market illiquidity.  As a result, any adjustments to the regulatory framework 

should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks 

associated with the reforms put in place in recent years.   

Remaining Challenges 

So where do we stand a decade after the onset of the most severe financial crisis 

since the Great Depression?  Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal 

Reserveâ€™s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability, in putting in 

place a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well designed to lower the risks to 

financial stability, and in actually achieving a stronger financial system.  Our more 

resilient financial system is better prepared to absorb, rather than amplify, adverse 

shocks, as has been illustrated during periods of market turbulence in recent years.  

Enhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, 

thereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad.
