reflected a change in global risk sentiment, as investors focused on vulnerabilities in 

EMEs following a period of complacency.  Asset prices have fallen considerably more in

countries with stronger fundamentals.  For example, as shown in chart 9, changes in EME

deficits.  In general, economies with larger current account deficits experienced greater 

depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields.  Thus, while a 

reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the recent retrenchment from 

EMEs, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the 

reaction. 

Whatever their source, large capital outflows from EMEs can pose challenges for 

EME policymakers by simultaneously producing significant currency depreciation, asset 

price deflation, and inflationary pressures.  In such cases, EME central banks are in the 

difficult position of judging whether to tighten policy at the same time that demand is 

weakening.  It is notable that some central banks with stronger records on price stability 

have been able to avoid tightening whereas others have been forced to raise rates to 

defend price stability in the face of domestic weakness.   

Monetary policy in the United States is likely to remain highly accommodative 

for some time, as our economy fights to overcome the remaining headwinds from the 

global financial crisis.  As our economic recovery continues, however, the time will come 

to gradually reduce the pace of asset purchases and eventually bring those purchases to a
