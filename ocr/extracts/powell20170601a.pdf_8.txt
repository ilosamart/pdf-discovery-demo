• Normalization of the balance sheet will commence only after the 

normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.10  Most 

FOMC participants think that this condition will be satisfied later this year if 

the economy continues broadly on its current path.11   

• The balance sheet will be allowed to shrink passively as our holdings of 

Treasury and agency securities mature (or prepay) and roll off.12   

• The process will be gradual and predictable.  As noted in the May minutes, 

although no decisions have been made, the Committee has discussed 

preannouncing a schedule of gradually increasing caps on the dollar value of 

securities that would be allowed to run off in a given month.   

• The Committee will continue to use the federal funds rate as its principal tool 

for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.13     

• Once the process of balance sheet normalization has begun, it should continue 

as planned as long as there is no material deterioration in the economic 

outlook.14
