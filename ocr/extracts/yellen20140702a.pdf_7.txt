been necessary to halt the housing bubble.2  Such a slowing in the housing market might 

have constrained the rise in household leverage, as mortgage debt growth would have 

been slower.  But the job losses and higher interest payments associated with higher 

interest rates would have directly weakened households’ ability to repay previous debts, 

suggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities in household 

balance sheets only modestly.3 

Similar mixed results would have been likely with regard to the effects of tighter 

monetary policy on leverage and reliance on short-term financing within the financial 

sector.  In particular, the evidence that low interest rates contribute to increased leverage 

and reliance on short-term funding points toward some ability of higher interest rates to 

lessen these vulnerabilities, but that evidence is typically consistent with a sizable range 

2 For a discussion of this issue encompassing experience across a broad range of advanced economies in the 
2000s, including the United States, see Jane Dokko, Brian M. Doyle, Michael T. Kiley, Jinill Kim, Shane 
Sherlund, Jae Sim, and Skander Van Den Heuvel (2011), “Monetary Policy and the Global Housing 
Bubble,” Economic Policy, vol. 26 (April), pp. 233-83.  Igan and Loungani (2012) highlight how interest 
rates are an important, but far from the most important, determinant of housing cycles across countries (see 
Deniz Igan and Prakash Loungani (2012), “Global Housing Cycles,” IMF Working Paper Series 
WP/12/217 (Washington:  International Monetary Fund, August), 
www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26229.0).  Bean and others (2010), examining the 
tradeoffs between unemployment, inflation, and stabilization of the housing market in the United Kingdom, 
imply that reliance on monetary policy to contain a housing boom may be too costly in terms of other 
monetary policy goals (see Charles Bean, Matthias Paustian, Adrian Penalver, and Tim Taylor (2010), 
“Monetary Policy after the Fall,” paper presented at “Macroeconomic Challenges:  The Decade Ahead,” a 
symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
August 26-28, www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/2010-08-23-bean.pdf).  Saiz (2014) suggests 
that about 50 percent of the variation in house prices during the 2000s boom can be explained by low 
interest rates, and finds that it was the remaining, “non-fundamental” component that subsequently 
collapsed--that is, the interest rate component was not a primary factor in what Saiz terms “the bust” (see 
Albert Saiz (2014), “Interest Rates and Fundamental Fluctuations in Home Values,” paper presented at the 
Public Policy and Economics Spring 2014 Workshops, hosted by the Harris School of Public Policy, 
University of Chicago, April 8,

3 The notion that tighter monetary policy may have ambiguous effects on leverage or repayment capacity is 
illustrated in, for example, Anton Korinek and Alp Simsek (2014), “Liquidity Trap and Excessive 
Leverage,” NBER Working Paper Series 19970 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic 
Research, March).
