In the category of communications policy, we also extended our estimate of how 

long we expect to keep the short-term interest rate at exceptionally low levels to at least 

mid-2015.  That doesn’t mean that we expect the economy to be weak through 2015.  

Rather, our message was that, so long as price stability is preserved, we will take care not 

to raise rates prematurely.  Specifically, we expect that a highly accommodative stance of 

monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economy 

strengthens.  We hope that, by clarifying our expectations about future policy, we can 

provide individuals, families, businesses, and financial markets greater confidence about 

the Federal Reserve’s commitment to promoting a sustainable recovery and that, as a 

result, they will become more willing to invest, hire and spend. 

Now, as I have said many times, monetary policy is no panacea.  It can be used to 

support stronger economic growth in situations in which, as today, the economy is not 

making full use of its resources, and it can foster a healthier economy in the longer term 

by maintaining low and stable inflation.  However, many other steps could be taken to 

strengthen our economy over time, such as putting the federal budget on a sustainable 

path, reforming the tax code, improving our educational system, supporting technological 

innovation, and expanding international trade.  Although monetary policy cannot cure the 

economy’s ills, particularly in today’s challenging circumstances, we do think it can 

provide meaningful help.  So we at the Federal Reserve are going to do what we can do 

and trust that others, in both the public and private sectors, will do what they can as well.
