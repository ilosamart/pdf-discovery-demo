 The importance of robust capital requirements for financial stability and the serious 

shortcomings of the pre-crisis capital regulatory regime have been well documented.  In the last 

few years, domestic and international initiatives have strengthened standards for the quantity and 

quality of capital held by banking organizations.  Implementation of these new standards should 

significantly increase the safety and soundness of the financial system.   

 But there are at least four reasons why simple compliance with the stricter standards will 

not achieve this goal.  First, as has long been recognized, a capital ratio -- even a much higher 

one -- is essentially a snapshot of a bank’s balance sheet and, thus, often a lagging indicator of 

the bank’s actual condition.  Second, the ability of a bank to remain a viable financial 

intermediary in times of stress depends not only on the losses likely to affect the value of current 

assets, but also the impact on revenues and, thus, the capacity to replenish capital during the 

stress period.  Third, if capital requirements are set solely with reference to more ordinary 

economic circumstances, they will not capture the potential impact of a shock to the value of 

widely held assets to the financial system as a whole.  Fourth, the capacity of both bank 

management and regulators to understand a firm’s capital position depends on its having good 

information and quantitative risk-management systems. 

 Thus, stronger capital standards must be complemented with supervisory tools that 

incorporate dynamic, macroprudential elements.  Two important such tools that have been 

adopted by the Federal Reserve since the onset of the financial crisis are stress testing and firm-

specific capital planning.  Since we have just completed a second annual exercise using both 

supervisory tools, I thought this risk conference would be a good occasion for reviewing the 

rationale and features of these tools, describing the recent results, and identifying some issues we 

will be considering as we continue to develop these tools in the future.
