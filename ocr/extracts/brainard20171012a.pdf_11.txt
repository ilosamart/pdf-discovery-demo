cross-border spillovers have increased notably since the crisis and are quite large.  For 

instance, European Central Bank policy news that leads to a 10 basis point decrease in the 

German 10-year term premium is associated with a roughly 5 basis point decrease in the 

U.S. 10-year term premium; by contrast, these spillovers were smaller in the years 

leading up to the crisis.16 

Moreover, news about policy rates and term premiums appears to have quite 

different effects on exchange rates, such that the ordering of policy normalization can 

have important implications for exchange rates and associated financial conditions, as I 

discussed earlier this year.17  Recent staff estimates suggest that news about expected 

changes in the policy rate tends to have a large spillover through the exchange rate, 

whereas news about changes in term premiums tends to lead to corresponding cross-

border changes in term premiums, as discussed previously, with much smaller effects on 

the exchange rate.  Moreover, the exchange rate effect of changes in short-term rates is 

much greater than it was pre-crisis.  For instance, policy news that leads to a 25 basis 

point increase in the expected interest rate portion of the 10-year Treasury yield is 

associated with a roughly 3 percentage point appreciation in the dollar, which is three 

times greater than the response pre-crisis.  By contrast, policy news surrounding a change 

in U.S. term premiums has a muted effect on the exchange rate both now and pre-crisis. 

Financial Imbalances 

Finally, a low neutral rate environment may also be associated with a heightened 

risk of asset price bubbles, which could exacerbate the tradeoff for monetary policy 

between achieving the traditional dual-mandate goals and preventing the kinds of
