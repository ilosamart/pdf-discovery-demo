The U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, a pace sufficient to 

generate ongoing improvements in the labor market.  On average, payrolls have expanded 

about 200,000 per month so far this year, and the unemployment rate has declined to 5.1 

percent, just a bit above Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participantsâ€™ median 

estimate of the normal long-run level of unemployment.  But there remain additional 

forms of slack in the labor market that are not fully captured by the standard 

unemployment rate.  The labor force participation rate remains below most estimates of 

its underlying trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but 

would prefer to work full time.  Moreover, nominal wage growth has remained subdued.  

Real wage growth has also been subdued, possibly reflecting the low rates of productivity 

growth in the United States economy during recent years. 

As you know, the last two months saw slower reported payroll gains of about 

140,000 per month.  While this step-down is somewhat disappointing, the pace of job 

growth is still sufficiently strong gradually to erode slack in the labor market, and the 

prospects for further labor market improvement look good overall.  Gross domestic 

product (GDP) growth in the first half of 2015 is now estimated to have been at an annual 

rate of 2-1/4 percent, and private forecasters are projecting GDP to continue to rise, at a 

pace in the neighborhood of 2 percent, in the second half.  Consumer spending has been 

rising solidly of late, likely a reflection of the boost to purchasing power from the lower 

oil prices as well as the ongoing job gains and a wealth-to-income ratio that remains high 

even after the recent declines in the stock market.  Further, the negative effect of low oil 

prices on the growth of investment in the U.S. energy sector appears to be waning.  The
