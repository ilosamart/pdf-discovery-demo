approaches are intended to address a gap caused by the effective lower bound.  This gap 

is the shortfall between what the FOMC likely would do in current economic 

circumstances, were it able to reduce the federal funds rate below zero, and the reality 

that the rate can’t be cut further.  

I believe that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases and other unconventional 

policy actions have helped, and are continuing to help, fill this gap and thus shore up 

aggregate demand.  The evidence suggests that the FOMC’s actions have lowered short- 

and longer-term private borrowing rates and boosted asset prices.8  However, while this 

contribution has been significant, lower interest rates may be doing less to increase 

spending than in past recoveries because of some unusual features of the Great Recession 

and the current recovery.  For example, as I noted, the housing crisis left many 

homeowners with high loan-to-value ratios and damaged credit records, creating barriers 

to their access to credit, while the financial crisis led many banks to lend only to 

borrowers with higher credit scores.  As a consequence, the proportion of households that 

have been able to take advantage of declining rates to refinance their mortgages or to 

borrow to purchase new homes has probably been lower than in past recoveries.  In 

addition, pronounced uncertainty about economic conditions has weighed on capital 

spending decisions and may have blunted the normal effect of lower interest rates on 

business investment.
