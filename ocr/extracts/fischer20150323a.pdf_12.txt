When shocks happen, as they do, policymakers will have to respond to at least 

some of them.  Accordingly there is considerable uncertainty about the level of future 

interest rates--a degree of uncertainty that can be estimated statistically, and that should 

be taken into account by market participants and recognized by the FOMC when it 

discusses future levels of interest rates.  The uncertainty about future levels of the federal 

funds rate can be represented in a “fan chart”--that is, a figure showing the expected path 

of the federal funds rate as well as a range representing the degree of uncertainty around 

that path.20      

The two sure elements of forward guidance that the FOMC will be able to offer 

after liftoff are that monetary policy will continue to be aimed at fostering the 

Committee’s dual objectives, and that it will be data driven.  As we move away from the 

zero lower bound, the data to which we will be responding will be driven less and less by 

the financial crisis and Great Recession, and increasingly by post-liftoff economic 

developments.  Whatever the state of the economy, the federal funds rate will be set at 

each FOMC meeting on the basis of what the members of the FOMC believe will best 

enable us to meet our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability over the 

course of time. 

As the FOMC responds to incoming information, it will continue to be absolutely 

transparent in explaining its decisions and how and why they contribute to meeting the 

legally mandated dual goals of monetary policy.  That transparency serves three 

purposes:  First, it is required if we are to be accountable to the public; second, it is the 

20 For example, the Sveriges Riksbank publishes a fan chart that displays a forecast for its policy repurchase 
agreement (or repo) rate, along with uncertainty bands based on historical forecast errors, showing the 
ranges in which the repo rate is forecast to fall with 50 percent, 75 percent, and 90 percent confidence.  For 
the chart, see Sveriges Riksbank (2015).
