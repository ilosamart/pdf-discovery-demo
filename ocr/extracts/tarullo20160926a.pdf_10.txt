testing program, other important additions have not.  Most significant are the various capital 

buffer requirements that sit atop the regulatory minimum levels.  These include a uniform 2.5-

percent capital conservation buffer (CCB), the GSIB surcharge, and a countercyclical buffer that 

can expand the CCB for a broad range of firms in times of increasing financial vulnerabilities.9  

Firms that do not hold capital sufficient to meet or exceed this combined buffer level are subject 

to restrictions on their capital distributions and bonus payments to executives, which become 

progressively stricter as their capital level falls deeper into the buffer.  

To better align CCAR with the regulatory capital rules as they now stand, we will be 

considering adoption of a “stress capital buffer” (SCB) approach to setting post-stress capital 

requirements that would further integrate our capital rules with our stress test and CCAR 

frameworks.  The simplest way to describe it is that the SCB would replace the existing 2.5 

percent CCB as a component in each CCAR firm’s point-in-time capital requirements.  The SCB 

would be risk-sensitive and vary across firms, based on the results of the annual stress test.  

Specifically, it would be set equal to the maximum decline in a firm’s common equity tier 1 

capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test before the inclusion 

of the firm’s planned capital distributions, a simplification from the current practice of 

calculating the capital positions of the firm separately for each quarter in the scenario horizon.   

As is now the case with the CCB and other applicable capital buffers, a firm would be 

subject to restrictions on its capital distributions whenever its capital levels fall below the 

combined regulatory minima and buffers.  Although it is likely that the stress test losses will 

continue to exceed 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets for most GSIBs, the SCB would have a 

                                                 
9 The countercyclical buffer applies to banking organizations with more than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in 
on-balance-sheet foreign exposures and to any depository institution subsidiary of such organizations. See 12 CFR
