economic developments proved disappointing.  However, following the June meeting and 

press conference, market yields moved sharply higher.  For example, between the FOMC 

meetings of June and September, the 10-year Treasury yield rose about 3/4 percentage 

point and rates on MBS increased by a similar amount. 

Financial market movements are often difficult to account for, even after the fact, 

but three main reasons seem to explain the rise in interest rates over the summer.  First, 

improvements in the economic outlook warranted somewhat higher yields--a natural and 

healthy development.  Second, some of the rise in rates reportedly reflected an unwinding 

of levered positions--positions that appear to have been premised on an essentially 

indefinite continuation of asset purchases--together with some knock-on liquidations of 

other positions in response to investor losses and the rise in volatility.  Although it 

brought with it some tightening of financial conditions, this unwinding and the associated 

rise in term premiums may have had the benefit of reducing future risks to financial 

stability and, in particular, of lowering the probability of an even sharper market 

correction at some later point.  Third, market participants may have taken the 

communication in June as indicating a general lessening of the Committee’s commitment 

to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy in pursuit of its objectives.  In 

particular, it appeared that the FOMC’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate had 

become less effective after June, with market participants pulling forward the time at 

which they expected the Committee to start raising rates, in a manner inconsistent with 

the guidance.16

following the June FOMC meeting, far more than could be explained by revisions to the economic outlook.
