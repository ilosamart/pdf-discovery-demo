factors influencing the Committeeâ€™s thinking about future policy and how that thinking 

might change as the outlook changed.11   

As my colleagues and I have frequently emphasized, the conditions stated in this 

guidance are thresholds, not triggers.  Crossing one of the thresholds will not 

automatically give rise to an increase in the federal funds rate target; instead, it will signal 

only that it is appropriate for the Committee to begin considering whether an increase in 

the target is warranted.  This threshold formulation helps explain why the Committee was 

willing to express the guidance bearing on the labor market in terms of the 

unemployment rate alone, instead of following its usual practice of considering a broad 

range of labor market indicators.  In the judgment of the Committee, the unemployment 

rate--which, despite some drawbacks in this regard, is probably the best single summary 

indicator of the state of the labor market--is sufficient for defining the threshold given by 

the guidance.  However, after the unemployment threshold is crossed, many other 

indicators become relevant to a comprehensive judgment of the health of the labor 

market, including such measures as payroll employment, labor force participation, and 

the rates of hiring and separation.  In particular, even after unemployment drops below 6-

1/2 percent, and so long as inflation remains well behaved, the Committee can be patient 

in seeking assurance that the labor market is sufficiently strong before considering any 

increase in its target for the federal funds rate. 

                                                 
11 An advantage of the state-contingent formulation is that it increases the tendency of financial market 
conditions to act as an automatic stabilizer for the economy.  For example, bad news about the labor 
market, which tends to lengthen the amount of time the public expects to be required for the unemployment 
rate to reach the threshold, should likewise increase the length of time that the public expects policy to 
remain highly accommodative.  In response to this shift in policy expectations, interest rates should fall and 
asset prices should rise, thus easing financial conditions and helping to offset the adverse change to the 
outlook.
