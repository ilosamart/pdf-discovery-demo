target was brought down to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent in December 2008, the FOMC has 

gradually adjusted its forward guidance about the anticipated future path of the federal funds 

rate.  In each meeting statement from March 2009 through June 2011, the Committee indicated 

its expectation that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for an extended period.”8  At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee decided 

to provide more specific information about the likely time horizon by substituting the phrase “at 

least through mid-2013” for the phrase “for an extended period”; at the January 2012 meeting, 

this horizon was extended to “at least through late 2014.”9  Has this guidance worked?  Figure 7 

illustrates how dramatically forecasters’ expectations of future short-term interest rates have 

changed.  As the dashed blue line indicates, the Blue Chip consensus forecast made in early 2010 

anticipated that the Treasury-bill rate would now stand at close to 3-1/2 percent; today, in 

contrast, private forecasters expect short-term interest rates to remain very low in 2014.   

Of course, much of this revision in interest rate projections would likely have occurred in 

the absence of explicit forward guidance; given the deterioration in projections of real activity 

due to the unanticipated persistence of headwinds, and the continued subdued outlook for 

inflation, forecasters would naturally have anticipated a greater need for the FOMC to provide 

continued monetary accommodation.  However, I believe the changes over time in the language 

of the FOMC statement, coupled with information provided by Chairman Bernanke and others in 

speeches and congressional testimony, helped the public understand better the Committee’s 

likely policy response given the slower-than-expected economic recovery.  As a result,
