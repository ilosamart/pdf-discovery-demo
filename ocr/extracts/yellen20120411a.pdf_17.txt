Figure 8 shows the projected paths for the federal funds rate called for by these 

two policy rules, along with the optimal control path that I presented earlier.

  These 

projections are constructed using the FRB/US model, conditioned on the same illustrative 

baseline outlook that I used a moment ago.  The Taylor (1993) rule calls for the federal 

funds rate to begin rising in early 2013, whereas the Taylor (1999) rule has its liftoff in 

early 2015, a lot closer to the optimal control path.  A sizable literature has examined the 

performance of simple rules like these by conducting stochastic simulations with a range 

of economic models.  Many studies, including Taylor’s own analysis, suggest that the 

Taylor (1999) rule generates considerably less variability in real activity and only slightly 

more variability in inflation than his original rule.

  Given the differential responses to 

economic slack across these two rules, this finding is hardly surprising, but it is a key 

reason why I consider the Taylor (1999) rule to be a more suitable guide for Fed policy.       

While the Taylor (1999) rule can serve as a useful policy benchmark, its 

prescriptions fail to take into account some considerations that I consider important in the 

current context.  In particular, this rule does not fully take into account the implications 

of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and hence tends to understate the 

rationale for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy under 

present circumstances.

 In these simulations, the Taylor (1993) rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 0.5Yt, while the Taylor 

(1999) rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 1.0Yt.  In these expressions, R is the federal funds rate, π 

is the percent change in the headline PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and Y is the output gap.  

The output gap in turn is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.3(5.6-Ut), where 2.3 is the 

estimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating inflation 

rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.
