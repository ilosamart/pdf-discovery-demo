policymakers to be more systematic.  In addition, by observing how the SEP changes 

over time, the public can better understand how Committee members react to changes in 

the economy.  My view is that the dot plot, on balance, is helpful to market participants 

and hence to the Committee.  As the dot plot enters its fifth year of existence, my hope is 

that we will be able to capture those benefits while avoiding its shortcomings. 

I agree with the paperâ€™s suggestion of greater emphasis on the degree of 

uncertainty around the projections, which is much larger than the dispersion of the 

individual forecasts.  As you know, at its January meeting, the Committee discussed 

adding fan charts to the SEP.  Fan charts could help emphasize that the economic outlook 

is uncertain, and that consequently there is considerable uncertainty around the path of 

policy.
