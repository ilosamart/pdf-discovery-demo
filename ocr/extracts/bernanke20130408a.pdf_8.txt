in the fall, the severely adverse scenario is designed to reflect, at a minimum, the 

economic and financial conditions typical of a severe post-World War II U.S. recession.

In devising recession scenarios, we draw on many of the same macroeconomic modeling 

tools used in making monetary policy.  Of course, not all significant risks facing banks 

are tied to the business cycle.  Accordingly, our scenarios now generally incorporate not 

only the typical consequences of a severe recession but also, simultaneously, other 

adverse developments such as an exceptionally large decline in house prices, sharp drops 

in the value of stocks and other financial assets, or a worsening of global economic 

conditions more severe than might normally be expected to accompany a deep recession 

in the United States.   

 Importantly, in specifying the severely adverse scenario, we seek to avoid adding 

to the procyclicality of the financial system.  In other words, in applying stress tests, we 

do not want to inadvertently set a standard that is easier to meet in good times (when 

banks should be preparing for possibly tougher times ahead) than in bad times (when 

banks need to be able to use accumulated capital to support lending).  Accordingly, we 

will want to ensure that the stress scenario remains severe in an absolute sense even when 

the economy is strong and the near-term risks to the outlook seem relatively modest. 

 We have also improved our tools for estimating projected bank losses, revenues, 

and capital under alternative scenarios.  The original SCAP was supervisors’ first attempt 

to produce comprehensive and simultaneous estimates of the financial conditions of the 

nation’s largest banking firms, and the required data and analytical methods were
