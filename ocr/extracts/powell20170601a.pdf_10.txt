premiums by about 100 basis points, but that these effects should decline to about 

85 basis points by the end of 2017 as market participants see the normalization process 

approaching.17  The same approach suggests that bringing forward the date of the start of 

the anticipated phasing out of the Federal Reserve’s reinvestments from mid-2018 to the 

end of 2017 should have raised the term premium by only about 5 basis points.18  Of 

course, markets sometimes react quite differently than expected, as the 2013 taper 

tantrum showed.   

The market’s response to recent changes in expectations for reinvestment policy 

also suggests that there need not be a major reaction when the Committee begins to phase 

out reinvestments.  Long-term rates did not react strongly to the reinvestment discussions 

in the minutes for the FOMC’s March and May meetings, which led market participants 

to bring forward their expectations about the starting date for this process by about six 

months (figure 7).19  A recent survey of economists also suggests that they expect that a 

gradual, well-telegraphed reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet should have modest 

effects.20  These results augur well for an orderly phaseout of reinvestments.  If changes 

to reinvestment policy do tighten financial conditions more than anticipated, then I expect 

that the FOMC would take that into account.

18 Of course, estimates of the effects of monetary policy on term premiums often differ.  Engen, Laubach, 
and Reifschneider estimated that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are currently holding down term 
premiums by about 60 basis points, less than the estimate of Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei, but their findings still 
imply a similar small effect of bringing forward the date of normalization by six months; see Bonis, Ihrig, 
and Wei, “Effect of the Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings,” and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider, 
“Macroeconomic Effects,” in note 16.
