quality of the staff has been a great strength throughout our institution’s history.  

Maintaining that quality and commitment to public service will be essential if the Fed is 

to have a successful second century. 

 Dispassionate analysis, expertise, and commitment to public service--all are 

values that have served us well.  But one value that strikes me as having been at least as 

important as any other has been the Federal Reserve’s willingness, during its finest hours, 

to stand up to political pressure and make tough but necessary decisions.  The fight 

against inflation during Paul and Alan’s times in office was critical for the nation’s 

longer-term prosperity, and it required perseverance in the face of heavy criticism.  I keep 

in my office one of the 2-by-4s mailed to the Fed during Paul’s tenure, which 

communicates some distinctly unfavorable views of high interest rates and their effects.  

More recently, of course, the Federal Reserve took controversial but necessary measures 

to arrest what was arguably the worst financial crisis in American history, helping to 

avert what likely would have been a much more severe economic downturn than the 

Great Recession we did experience. 

We have been able to respond nimbly to economic emergencies and make 

difficult choices in part because of our institutional structure--including long terms for 

members of the Board of Governors and diverse regional representation in our 

policymaking Committee--and because of the willingness of policymakers, past and 

present, to do whatever was needed in the longer-run interest of the economy.  As an 

institution, the Federal Reserve must continue to be willing to make tough decisions, 

based on objective, empirical analysis and without regard to political pressure.
