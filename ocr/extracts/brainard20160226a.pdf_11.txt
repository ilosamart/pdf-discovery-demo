recent research suggests that financial transmission is likely to be amplified in economies 

with near-zero interest rates, such that anticipated monetary policy adjustments in one 

economy may contribute more to a shifting of demand across borders than a boost to 

overall demand.14  This finding could explain why the sensitivity of exchange rate 

movements to economic news and to changes in foreign monetary policy appear to have 

been relatively elevated recently.   

Financial tightening associated with cross-border spillovers may be limiting the 

extent to which U.S. policy diverges from major economies.  As policy adjusts to the 

evolution of the data, the combination of heightened spillovers from weaker foreign 

economies, along with a lower neutral rate, could result in a lower policy path in the 

United States relative to what many had predicted. 

Policy 

In circumstances where many economies face common negative shocks or where 

negative shocks in one country are quickly transmitted across borders, it is natural to 

consider whether coordination can improve outcomes.  Under certain conditions--such as 

flexible exchange rates, deep and well-regulated financial markets, and flexible product 

and labor markets--policies designed for the domestic economy can readily offset any 

spillovers from economic conditions abroad, and policies designed to address domestic 

conditions can achieve desirable outcomes both within the national economy and more 

broadly.15   

In some circumstances, however, cooperation can be quite helpful.  If, for 

example, economies face a common challenge, coordination can communicate to markets
