discuss foreclosure issues and develop solutions.  In some cases, alliances have been 

formed right on the spot to create and implement programs to keep people in their homes. 

We have also partnered with the U.S. departments of Labor and Treasury and 

with the HOPE NOW Unemployment Taskforce to help unemployed homeowners avoid 

losing their homes.  This collaboration led to the creation of an online tool that allows 

homeowners and servicers to document unemployment insurance benefits as income in 

order to qualify for federally sponsored mortgage modification programs. 

Each Federal Reserve Bank has an online Foreclosure Resource Center with 

information on foreclosure-related resources, including an enhanced Foreclosure 

Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detailed steps and information for localities seeking to 

develop foreclosure prevention activities.  The toolkit also includes a new Foreclosure 

Recovery Resource Guide, which helps consumers recover from the foreclosure process. 

A number of Federal Reserve research projects also have been initiated as part of 

the MORE program.  They include studies focusing on foreclosure prevention, financial 

education, and adverse neighborhood effects resulting from foreclosures.  You will hear 

more about that research over the next two days.  Community development researchers 

across the Federal Reserve System launched a study in 2009 of the planning and early 

implementation stages of the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP).  

Researchers interviewed more than 90 recipients of the Department of Housing and 

Urban Developmentâ€™s NSP funds in the fall of 2009.  These interviews and other data 

gathered during this study provide the first nationwide examination of the effect of the 

NSP and served as the basis for a number of Federal Reserve System reports currently in 

progress.
