crisis components of the shadow banking system are probably gone forever, current examples 

include money market funds, the triparty repo market, and securities lending.   

From the perspective of financial stability, the parts of the shadow banking system of 

most concern are those that create assets thought to be safe, short-term, and liquid--in effect, cash 

equivalents.  For a variety of reasons, demand for such assets has grown steadily in recent years, 

and is not likely to reverse direction in the foreseeable future.  Yet these are the assets whose 

funding is most likely to run in periods of stress, as investors realize that their resemblance to 

cash or insured deposits in normal times has disappeared in the face of uncertainty about their 

underlying value.  And, as was graphically illustrated during the crisis, the resulting forced sales 

of assets whose values are already under pressure can accelerate an adverse feedback loop, in 

which all firms with similar assets suffer mark-to-market losses, which, in turn, can lead to more 

fire sales.  This kind of contagion lay at the heart of the financial stresses of 2007 and 2008. 

 As already noted, pre-crisis shortcomings at the intersection of microprudential and 

macroprudential regulation have motivated a variety of reforms, many explicitly directed at the 

problem of too-big-to-fail institutions.  While some of these reforms remain unfinished, and 

some additional measures are needed, there has been considerable progress.  Unfortunately, the 

same cannot be said with respect to shadow banking and, more generally, the vulnerabilities 

associated with wholesale short-term funding.  These vulnerabilities involve both large, 

prudentially regulated institutions, and thus too-big-to-fail concerns, and the broader financial 

system.  Except for the liquidity requirements agreed to in the Basel Committee, however, the 

liability side of the balance sheets of financial firms has barely been addressed in the reform 

agenda.  Yet here is where the systemic problems of interconnectedness and contagion are most 

apparent.  And, as evidenced by the funding stresses experienced by a number of European
