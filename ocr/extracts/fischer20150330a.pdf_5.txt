funding constraints.  In turn, the finance companies cut credit availability, which sharply 

depressed purchases of consumer durables, including automobiles.  

These examples highlight five lessons.  One is that the recent crisis first 

manifested itself in the nonbank sector and was worse for the nonbank sector than for 

banks.  Almost all the examples of financial distress mentioned so far occurred before 

stress in the commercial banking system became acute, and in most cases well before.  

For example, only three commercial banks failed in the United States in 2007, and 

commercial bank distress did not peak until the end of 2008 and later.   

A second lesson is that nonbank distress can harm the real economy.  Mortgages, 

auto loans, and credit through securities issuance became harder to obtain.  Some of the 

slack was taken up by commercial banks, but credit contracted sharply, and millions of 

Americans suffered.   

Third lesson:  Many of the problems at nonbanks were similar to the problems 

that plagued banks.  These problems included insolvency, illiquidity (by which I mean 

the loss of access to funding even if the nonbank was solvent), and a general loss of 

confidence, in which counterparties of all kinds became reluctant to deal with some 

nonbanks.   

Fourth lesson:  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) can handle a 

bank insolvency by keeping the bank’s functions running while it pays off depositors and 

finds buyers for the bank’s assets.  The Federal Reserve, as a central bank, can address 

bank illiquidity using its lender-of-last-resort authority.  Bank supervisory agencies can 

address a loss of confidence by actions such as the stress tests conducted in the spring of 

2009.  However the lack of such powers for nonbanks made it much more difficult for the
