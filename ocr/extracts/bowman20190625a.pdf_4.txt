raised the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in assets for banks that could qualify for 

an 18-month examination cycle.  Further, we raised the asset threshold to $3 billion for 

the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy 

Statement.  This change, which exempts small holding companies from consolidated risk-

based capital rules, fosters local ownership of small banks by allowing more banking 

companies with limited access to capital markets to use debt in bank acquisitions.  

With respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve continues to tailor and reduce 

burden by conducting portions of examinations offsite for community banks that prefer 

that option.  The Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program identifies low-risk or, 

conversely, high-risk activities within state member banks and appropriately streamlines 

or expands examination work programs commensurate with the identified risk.  This 

minimizes the burden for banks that are well managed and directs supervisory resources 

to higher-risk activities where they are most needed.   

 Related to regulatory burden is an important initiative, in concert with the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation, to identify healthy minority banking organizations 

capable of acquiring or merging with MDIs in troubled condition.  Our PFP team has 

assisted with the process for establishing new MDIs and worked with MDIs to identify 

advantageous federally sponsored programs with which to collaborate.  I note that 

todayâ€™s agenda includes a session on this topic.
