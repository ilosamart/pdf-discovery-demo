suggests caution in this regard.  A second risk is that we could prematurely truncate the 

process of healing damage from the crisis, thereby ensuring that the admittedly severe 

cyclical effects become permanent. 

Overly accommodative monetary policy also poses risks.  First, the economy 

could overheat, and rising inflation could require the Committee to raise rates faster, 

which--if overdone--could produce a damaging recession.  For now, I would be more 

concerned with a second risk, which is that more-accommodative policy could lead to 

frothy financial conditions and eventually undermine financial stability.  While I do not 

see a troubling buildup of these risks today, tighter monetary policy might eventually be 

necessary if such risks do appear. 

Conclusion 

To wrap up, with the support of extraordinary monetary accommodation, our 

economy has made substantial progress.  As the FOMC moves to return monetary policy 

to a more normal footing, it makes sense to me to move fairly gradually as long as the 

incoming data evolve about as expected.  Doing so would, among other benefits, give our 

economy the best chance to make up lost ground.
