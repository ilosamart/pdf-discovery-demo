under way to construct better measures of counterparty credit risk and interconnectedness 

among systemically critical firms.  In particular, to better identify potential channels of 

financial contagion, supervisors are working to improve their understanding of banks’ 

largest exposures to other banks, nonbank financial institutions, and corporate borrowers.  

We are also collecting data on banks’ trading and securitization exposures, as well as 

their liquidity risks, as part of an internationally coordinated effort to improve regulatory 

standards in these areas.  Importantly,  attention is being paid not only to the risks to 

individual firms, but also to potential systemic risks arising from firms’ common 

exposures or sensitivity to common shocks. 

 Resolution Regime 

 A clear lesson from the events of the past few years--and a recommendation in the 

report with which we strongly agree--is that the government must not be forced to choose

having it fail in a disorderly and disruptive manner.  The government instead must have 

the tools to resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline--by 

ensuring that shareholders and creditors incur losses and that culpable managers are

possibly destabilizing effects of the firm’s collapse.  Having a method to resolve failing 

firms safely is necessary if commitments to allow failure are to be credible, which in turn 

is essential to reverse the perception that some firms are too big to fail.   

The financial reform legislation in both the House and the Senate would provide 

for such a resolution regime.  In both versions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

would be given the authority to manage the resolution of systemically important nonbank
