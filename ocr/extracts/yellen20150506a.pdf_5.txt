feedback loop.  Funding pressures contributed to “fire sales” of financial assets and 

losses, reducing capital levels and heightening liquidity pressures--culminating in the 

near collapse of the financial system in late 2008. 

Capital and liquidity 

Several factors encouraged excessive leverage, including market perceptions that 

some institutions were “too big to fail.”8  Financial institutions also had an incentive to 

engage in regulatory arbitrage, moving assets to undercapitalized off-balance-sheet 

vehicles.  The complexity of the largest banking organizations also may have impeded 

market discipline.  In addition, financial intermediation outside of the traditional banking 

sector grew rapidly in the years up to 2007, leaving gaps in the regulatory umbrella.  And 

conflicts in the incentives facing managers, shareholders, and creditors may have induced 

banks to increase leverage.9   

To strengthen banks’ resilience, the Federal Reserve and the other banking 

agencies have substantially increased capital requirements.  Regulatory minimums for 

capital relative to risk-weighted assets are significantly higher, and capital requirements 

now focus on the highest-quality capital, such as common equity.  In addition to risk-

based standards, bank holding companies and depositories face a leverage ratio 

requirement.  Also, significantly higher capital standards--both risk-weighted and 

leverage ratios--are being applied to the most systemically important banking 

organizations.  Such surcharges are appropriate because of the substantial harm that the

of how, in some cases, these factors reflect distortions that imply leverage was excessive, see Admati and 
others (2013a). 
9 The notion that “agency problems”--that is, conflicts in the interests of managers and various stakeholders 
in firms--may contribute to excessive debt has a long history, most notably following the notion of “debt 
overhangs” from Myers (1977).  Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011) emphasize the potential importance of 
this issue for the financial sector.  Admati and others (2013b) present a related mechanism.
