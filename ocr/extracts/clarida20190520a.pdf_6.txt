strengthens.12  And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for 

less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

Our monetary policy review will have several components.14  The Board and the 

Reserve Banks are hosting Fed Listens events—such as this one in New York—in which 

we are hearing from, among others, business and labor leaders, community development 

advocates, and academics.  Next month, we are holding a System research conference at 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  

The program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the 

review. 

Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal Open 

Market Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy, 

beginning around the middle of the year.  We expect to make our conclusions public in 

the first half of 2020. 

Concluding Thoughts 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

                                                 
12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.  
However, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened.  The box “Employment 
Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report 
examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10-12).  See also Weingarden 
(2017). 
13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be 
calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The 
Economic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data.
