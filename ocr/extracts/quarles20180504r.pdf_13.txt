The figure illustrates that the Fed’s securities holdings are projected to decline 

about $400 billion this year and another $460 billion next year as Treasury and agency 

securities continue to roll off gradually from the Fed’s portfolio.  The kink in each curve 

captures what the FOMC has referred to as the point of “normalization” of the size of the 

Fed’s balance sheet--that is, the point at which the balance sheet will begin to expand 

again to support the underlying growth in liabilities items such as Federal Reserve notes 

in circulation.  All else being equal, greater longer-run demand for currency, reserve 

balances, or other liabilities implies an earlier timing of balance sheet normalization and a 

higher longer-run size of the balance sheet, as illustrated by the top line.  And the 

converse--smaller demand for these liabilities and a later timing of normalization, 

illustrated by the bottom line--is also possible.  In the three scenarios shown, the size of 

the Fed’s securities portfolio normalizes sometime between 2020 and 2022.  That is quite 

a range of time, so as the balance sheet normalization program continues, the Fed will be 

closely monitoring developments for clues about banks’ underlying demand for reserves.  

What will the Fed be monitoring as reserves are drained and the balance sheet 

shrinks?  I would first like to emphasize that the Fed regularly monitors financial markets 

for a number of reasons, so I do not mean to imply that we will be doing anything that is 

very much different for our normal practice.  As reserves continue to be drained, we will 

want to gauge how banks are managing their balance sheets in continuing to meet their 

LCRs, watching in particular how the distribution of reserve balances across the banking 

system evolves as well as monitoring any large-scale changes in banks’ holdings of other 

HQLA-eligible assets, including Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed 

securities.
