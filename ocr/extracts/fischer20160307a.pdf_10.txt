and we may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the 

inflation rate--something that we would like to happen.   

2. Productivity and growth:  The rate of productivity growth in the United States 

and in much of the world has fallen dramatically in the past 20 years.  The 

table shows calculated rates of annual productivity growth for the United 

States over three periods:  1952 to 1973; 1974 to 2007; and the most recent 

period, 2008 to 2015.  After having been 3 percent and 2.1 percent in the first 

two periods, the annual rate of productivity growth has fallen to 1.2 percent in 

the period since the start of the global financial crisis.   

The right guide to thinking in this case is given by a famous Herbert Stein 

line:  “The difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and 2 percent is 100 

percent.”  Why?  Productivity growth is a major determinant of long-term 

growth.  At a 1 percent growth rate, it takes income 70 years to double.  At a 

2 percent growth rate, it takes 35 years to double.  That is to say, that with a 

growth rate of 1 percent per capita, it takes two generations for per capita 

income to double; at a 2 percent per capita growth rate, it takes one generation 

for per capita income to double.  That is a massive difference, one that would 

very likely have severe consequences for the national mood, and possibly for 

economic policy.  That is to say, there are few issues more important for the 

future of our economy, and those of every other country, than the rate of 

productivity growth.  

At this stage, we simply do not know what will happen to productivity 

growth.  Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has just published an
