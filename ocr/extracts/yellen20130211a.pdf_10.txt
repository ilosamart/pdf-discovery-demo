These are the major reasons why I believe this recovery has been so slow.  After a 

lengthy recession that imposed great hardships on American workers, the weak recovery 

has made the past five years the toughest that many of today’s workers have ever 

experienced.    

The unemployment rate now stands at 7.9 percent.  To put this number in 

perspective, while that’s a big improvement from the 10 percent reached in late 2009, it is 

now higher than unemployment ever got in the 24 years before the Great Recession.  

Moreover, the government’s current estimate of 12 million unemployed doesn’t include 

800,000 discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.  And, as 

exhibit 6 shows, 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working 

part time even though they would prefer a full-time job.  A broader measure of 

underemployment that includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.4 percent.   

The effects of the recession and the subsequent slow recovery have been harshest 

on some of the most vulnerable Americans.  The poverty rate has risen sharply since the 

onset of the recession, after a decade in which it had been relatively stable, and stands at 

15 percent of the population, significantly above the average of the past three decades.9  

Even those today who are fortunate enough to hold jobs have seen their hourly 

compensation barely keep pace with the cost of living over the past three years, while 

labor’s share of income--as measured by the percent of production by nonfinancial 

corporations accruing to workers as compensation--remains near the postwar low reached 

in 2011 (exhibit 7).  Compared with the 7.9 percent unemployment rate for all workers, 

the unemployment rate for African Americans is 13.8 percent.  The unemployment rate
