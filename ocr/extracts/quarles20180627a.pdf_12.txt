in them.  It is useful when the credibility and commitment of the decisions are especially 

important, such as when my Fed colleagues and I set monetary policy.  At the FSB, 

relying on consensus helps 68 agencies and other members from two dozen countries 

with different perspectives and agendas come together around our shared interest in a 

stable global financial system.  International negotiations and standard-setting is not the 

best approach to all problems, but in my past experience as a Treasury Department 

official, it is often the best way to tackle problems that are global in scope.  

By actively participating in the FSB and engaging with its members at a high 

level, the United States is supporting high international standards that are equal to those 

in the United States.  Our standards will be most effective when other major economies 

embrace them in a consistent manner.  The goal is to limit the risks of another financial 

crisis and do what we can to promote prosperity and a bright future for the people you 

serve so faithfully in the great state of Utah.
