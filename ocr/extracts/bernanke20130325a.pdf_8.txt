advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging 

markets, the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against 

the positive effects of stronger advanced-economy demand.  Which of these two effects 

would be greater is an empirical matter.  Simulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s 

econometric models of the global economy suggest that the effects are roughly offsetting, 

so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear, on 

net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market 

economies.8  A return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the 

interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike. 

Regarding capital flows:  It is true that interest rate differentials associated with 

differences in national monetary policies can promote cross-border capital flows as 

investors seek higher returns.  But my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that 

these policy differences are the dominant force behind capital flows to emerging market 

economies; differences in growth prospects across countries and swings in investor risk 

sentiment seem to have played a larger role.9  Moreover, the fact that some emerging 

market economies have policies that depress the values of their currencies may create an 

expectation of future appreciation that in and of itself induces speculative inflows. 

                                                 
8 Other work also supports the finding of no adverse spillovers.  For example, one that finds strong positive 
spillovers is Bennett T. McCallum (2003), “Japanese Monetary Policy, 1991-2001,” Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond, Economic Quarterly, vol. 89 (Winter), pp. 1-31,

9 For example, Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub find that factors other than U.S. monetary policy have been 
substantially more important as drivers of capital flows to emerging market economies; see Marcel
