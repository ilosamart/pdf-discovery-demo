degree.  A related point is that it is generally better to avoid cliff effects, whereby significant 

regulatory consequences ensue based on relatively modest differences among firms.  On this 

point, I would note that, while Dodd-Frank requires us to apply enhanced capital standards to all 

bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, we would not want a big difference 

between the capital requirements for firms with assets just over that level and those just under 

that level.  Thus the supplemental capital requirement for a $50 billion firm is likely to be very 

modest. 

At the same time, it is important to build in constructive incentive effects.  That is, the 

regulatory structure for SIFIs should discourage systemically consequential growth or mergers 

unless the benefits to society are clearly significant.  There is little evidence that the size, 

complexity, and reach of some of today’s SIFIs are necessary in order to realize achievable 

economies of scale and scope.iv  Some firms may nonetheless believe there are such economies.  

For them, perhaps, the highest level of an additional SIFI capital charge may be worth absorbing.  

Others, though, may conclude in light of the progressive form of the capital requirement that 

changes in the size and structure of their activities would align better with their returns.   

The implication of this point is that the enhanced capital requirements should increase 

based on the metric I discussed a few moments ago.  As a theoretical matter, the ideal approach 

would be a continuous function, by which the percentage rate of the additional requirement 

would vary precisely with the measure of a firm’s systemic importance.  An alternative would be 

a tiered structure, by which firms are divided into several groups on the basis of the systemic 

metric, with the rate of the additional requirement varying by group but the same for every firm 

in each group.
