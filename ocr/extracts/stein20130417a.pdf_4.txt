uplift seems to have shrunk to some degree since the passage of Dodd-Frank, it is still 

significant.

  All else equal, this uplift confers a funding subsidy to the largest financial firms. 

 Moreover, as I noted earlier, even if bailouts were commonly understood to be a zero-

probability event, the problem of spillovers remains.  It is one thing to believe that a SIFI will be 

allowed to fail without government support; it is another to believe that such failure will not 

inflict significant damage on other parts of the financial system.  In the presence of such 

externalities, financial firms may still have excessive private incentives to remain big, 

complicated, and interconnected, because they reap any benefits--for example, in terms of 

economies of scale and scope--but don’t bear all the social costs.   

 How can we do better?  Some have argued that the current policy path is not working, 

and that we need to take a fundamentally different approach.

  Such an alternative approach 

might include, for example, outright caps on the size of individual banks, or a return to Glass-

Steagall-type activity limits. 

 My own view is somewhat different.  While I agree that we have a long way to go, I 

believe that the way to get there is not by abandoning the current reform agenda, but rather by 

sticking to its broad contours and ratcheting up its forcefulness on a number of dimensions.  In 

this spirit, two ideas merit consideration:  (1) an increase in the slope of the capital-surcharge 

schedule that is applied to large complex firms, and (2) the imposition at the holding company

 For example, in June of 2012, Moody’s described its ratings process for Bank of America, Citigroup, and JP 

Morgan Chase as follows: “[Their] ratings benefit from three notches of uplift from the standalone credit assessment 

at the bank level, and from two notches of uplift at the holding company, reflecting Moody’s assumptions about a 

very high likelihood of support from the US government for bondholders or other creditors in the event such support 

was required to prevent a default… . The negative outlook on the parent holding company reflects Moody’s view 

that government support for U.S. bank holding company creditors is becoming less certain and less predictable, 

given the evolving attitude of U.S. authorities to the resolution of large financial institutions, whereas support for 

creditors of operating entities remains sufficiently likely and predictable to warrant stable outlooks.”

 See Fisher (2013), who said: “…we recommend that the largest financial holding companies be restructured so that 

every one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process, and in the case of the banking entities 

themselves, that they be of a size that is ‘too small to save’.  Addressing institutional size is vital to maintaining a 

credible threat of failure, thereby providing a convincing case that policy has truly changed.”
