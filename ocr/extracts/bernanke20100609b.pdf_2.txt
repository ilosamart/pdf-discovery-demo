about the variety of workforce development initiatives in Virginia.  I appreciate the 

efforts of everyone who is taking part today, and would like to especially thank the 

Community College Workforce Alliance and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond for 

organizing today’s forum.  I also want to acknowledge the presence of Lieutenant 

Governor Bolling. 

Organizations such as the Workforce Alliance and public-private partnerships 

supported by the governor’s office are helping people in Virginia improve their own lives 

and economic circumstances.  As our nation continues to recover from the recession, 

these and similar workforce development programs in communities across the country 

are demonstrating that they are vital to the well-being of Main Street economies all over 

America.   

Today’s forum has brought together representatives of a range of organizations 

with the shared goal of fostering economic growth and job creation--including the 

Governor’s Economic Development and Jobs Creation Commission, the Virginia 

Workforce Investment Council, the International Economic Development Council, and 

the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development. 

This forum supports the ongoing efforts of all of these organizations to develop 

and share strategies to help provide employment opportunities for Americans.  I 

understand that your sessions today have focused on efforts to retool Virginia’s 

workforce through community college and state government initiatives.  You have also 

shared insights about the condition of the national economy and employment trends.
