and the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14  Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the 

past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather 

than in inflation.  Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of 

excesses.    

These two realities present challenges.  The literature on uncertainty reviewed at 

the 2003 symposium--and much refined since then--provides important advice for how 

policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a 

prudent central bank should follow.15  The literature on robust rules, such as so-called 

difference rules, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of 

unemployment relative to u*.16  The FOMC’s practice of looking at a broad range of 

indicators when assessing the state of the labor market has explicitly been part of the 

FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy since its 

inception in 2012.17  We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of 

labor market tightness and of destabilizing excesses more generally. 

The risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the 

FOMC’s deliberations.  A paper by Federal Reserve Board staff is a recent example of a 

range of research that helps FOMC participants visualize and manage these risks.18  The 

research reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various 

                                                 
14 Kiley (2015) reviews the literature on this point. 
15 The literature was reviewed by Walsh at the 2003 symposium; see Walsh (2003).  Also from the same 

symposium, see, for example, Greenspan (2003), Feldstein (2003), Fischer (2003), and Yellen (2003).  For 

a more recent perspective, see Wilkins (2017). 
16 See Taylor and Williams (2011).  Note that the robust rules literature does not suggest ignoring the 

general notion of labor market tightness or of resource utilization more generally.  Indeed, robust rules 

often reflect tightness through the change in the unemployment rate.  Instead, the issue is about how best to 

take account of labor market tightness when the best estimates of u* are very imprecise.  See also Erceg
