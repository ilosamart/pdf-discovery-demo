Government regulations will also affect the cost of mortgage credit.  In January, 

the CFPB released rules, in addition to those for servicing standards, on ability-to-repay 

requirements, the definition of a qualified mortgage (QM), and loan originator 

compensation.

  The Federal Reserve and other agencies are in the process of moving 

forward on proposed rulemakings that would implement revised regulatory capital 

requirements and the requirements for risk retention mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which include an exemption for 

mortgages that meet the definition of qualified residential mortgages (QRM). 

As the regulatory capital and risk retention requirements are still under 

deliberation, I won’t comment on these regulations today.  However, I will share a few 

thoughts on the possible effects of the QM rulemaking on access to credit. 

As background, the QM rule is part of a larger ability-to-repay rulemaking that 

requires lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower can 

repay the loan.  The rulemaking addresses the lax underwriting practices that flourished 

during the housing boom by setting minimum underwriting standards and by providing 

borrowers with protections against lending abuses.  In particular, borrowers can sue the 

lender for violations of the ability-to-repay rules and claim monetary damages.  If the 

original lender sells or securitizes the loan, the borrower can claim these damages at any 

time in a foreclosure action taken by the lender or any assignee.  If the mortgage meets
