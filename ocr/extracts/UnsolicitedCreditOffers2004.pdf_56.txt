RACIAL OR ETHNIC COMPOSITION OF CENSUS TRACT 

Finally, census tracts were categorized according to the racial and ethnic composition of their 
populations (table B.1). The sample data indicate that individuals residing in areas with a 
relatively low concentration of racial and ethnic minorities (population less than 10 percent 
minority) are more than twice as likely to opt out as individuals residing in predominantly 
minority areas (population at least 80 percent minority). These patterns are consistent with 
differences in the use of credit. Residents of predominantly nonminority areas, for example, have 
more credit accounts, on average, than residents of predominantly minority areas (data not shown 
in tables). Once again, individuals with more accounts may not feel the need to receive additional 
solicitations, or they may be more aware of the possibility of opting out.
