I commend the organizers of this conference for the event’s apt subtitle:  “The 

Devil’s in the Details.”  For the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, getting 

the details right is crucial as we implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and strive to meet our broader financial 

stability responsibilities.  About three and a half years have passed since the darkest days 

of the financial crisis, but our economy is still far from having fully recovered from its 

effects.  The heavy human and economic costs of the crisis underscore the importance of 

taking all necessary steps to avoid a repeat of the events of the past few years. 

Tonight I will discuss some ways in which the Federal Reserve, since the crisis, 

has reoriented itself from being (in its financial regulatory capacity) primarily a 

supervisor of a specific set of financial institutions toward being an agency with a broader 

focus on systemic stability as well.  I will highlight some of the ways we and other 

agencies are working to increase the resiliency of systemically important financial firms 

and identify and mitigate systemic risks, including those associated with the so-called 

shadow banking system.  I will also discuss the broad outlines of our evolving approach 

to monitoring financial stability.  Our efforts are a work in progress, and we are learning 

as we go.  But I hope to convey a sense of the strong commitment of the Federal Reserve 

to fostering a more stable and resilient financial system.

Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has made important strides in the traditional, 

microprudential regulation and supervision of individual banking organizations.  

Promoting the safety and soundness of individual financial firms is a critical
