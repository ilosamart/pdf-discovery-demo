I am pleased to participate in this event, part of the listening tour that Reserve 

Banks are hosting around the country and a key input into the Federal Reserve’s review 

of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.1  We are bringing 

open minds to our review and are seeking a broad range of perspectives.  To us, it simply 

seems like good institutional practice to engage with a wide range of interested 

individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency 

and accountability.2 

President Harker already mentioned the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of 

maximum employment and price stability.  Our review will take these dual mandate goals 

as given.  We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index 

for personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our 

price-stability mandate.  While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and 

communications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate 

ways they might be improved.  That said, based on the experience of other central banks 

that have undertaken similar reviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not 

a revolution, in the way we conduct monetary policy. 

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and 

price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review.  The

2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy 
framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes.  See Jeffrey Fuhrer, Giovanni Olivei, Eric Rosengren, and Geoffrey Tootell (2018),

Papers on Economic Activity Conference, Fall, held at the Brookings Institution, Washington, September
