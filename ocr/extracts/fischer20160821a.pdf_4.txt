Turning briefly to recent developments, the pattern of high employment growth 

and low productivity growth that we have seen in recent years has continued this year.  

So far in 2016, nonfarm payroll gains have averaged about 185,000 per month--down 

from last yearâ€™s pace of 230,000, but still more than enough to represent a continued 

improvement in labor market conditions.  Estimates of monthly job gains needed to keep 

the unemployment rate steady range widely, from around 75,000 per month to 150,000 

per month, depending on what happens to labor force participation among other things. 

Output growth has been much less impressive.  Over the four quarters ending this 

spring, real GDP is now estimated to have increased only 1-1/4 percent.  This pace likely 

understates the underlying momentum in aggregate demand, in part because of a sizable 

inventory correction that began early last year; even so, GDP growth has been mediocre 

at best. 

The combination of strong job gains and mediocre GDP growth has resulted in 

exceptionally slow labor productivity growth.  Most recently, business-sector 

productivity is reported to have declined for the past three quarters, its worst performance 

since 1979.  Granted, productivity growth is often quite volatile from quarter to quarter, 

both because of difficulties in measuring output and hours and because other transitory 

factors may affect productivity.  But looking at the past decade, productivity growth has 

been lackluster by post-World War II standards.  Output per hour increased only 

1-1/4 percent per year on average from 2006 to 2015, compared with its long-run average 

of 2-1/2 percent from 1949 to 2005.  A 1-1/4 percentage point slowdown in productivity 

growth is a massive change, one that, if it were to persist, would have wide-ranging 

consequences for employment, wage growth, and economic policy more broadly.  For
