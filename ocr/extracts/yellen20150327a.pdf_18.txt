Rapid increases in short-term interest rates to arrest such an unwelcome development 

could, in turn, have adverse effects on financial markets and the broader economy. 

Proceeding too cautiously could also have undesirable effects on financial 

stability.  An environment of prolonged low short-term rates could prompt an excessive 

buildup in leverage or cause underwriting standards to erode as investors take on risks

evidence indicates that such vulnerabilities do not pose a significant threat, but the 

Committee is carefully monitoring developments in this area.17  Moreover, in my view, 

macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools should serve as our first line of defense 

in addressing these risks.18

target range for the federal funds rate and how to adjust it thereafter, the Committee’s 

decisions will be data dependent, reflecting evolving judgments concerning the 

implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.  We cannot be certain
