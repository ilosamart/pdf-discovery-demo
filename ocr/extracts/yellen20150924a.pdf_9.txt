had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12  Of course, in this situation, lenders would be 

receiving more real income.  But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in 

large part because borrowers typically have only a limited ability to absorb losses.  And if 

the increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to 

force borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small 

business owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13   

Monetary Policy Actions since the Financial Crisis 

As I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of 

inflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational 

definition of its longer-run price objective.14  In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, 

                                                 
12 See Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy. 
13 Very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in 
which the labor market can respond to adverse shocks.  In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand 
is slowing, declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs.  For 
various reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts.  (Bewley (1999) suggests a 
number of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have 
on employee morale.  Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it 
permits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal 
wages and rising prices.)  But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage 
reductions may no longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to 
fall on employment. 
14 Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks 
should consider raising their inflation targets, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have 
demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal 
interest rates than was originally estimated.  Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more 
appropriate target for the FOMC.  While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly 
underestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in 
the United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not 
take into account central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to 
mitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint.  In addition, it is not obvious that a modestly higher 
target rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in 
the special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through 
which lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably 
attenuated.  Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation 
objective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level 
because it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future.  If 
so, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below--an increased ability of monetary 
policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability--might be lost.  Moreover, if the 
purpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe 
recessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous 
supervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events.  Finally, targeting
