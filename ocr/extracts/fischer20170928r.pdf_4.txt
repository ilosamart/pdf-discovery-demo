year for the U.K. consumer price index.8 In the United States, in the FOMC’s Statement 

on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, first issued in 2012 and discussed 

annually, Committee participants have judged that the longer-run inflation objective that 

corresponds to the Federal Reserve’s mandate is a rate of 2 percent per year, as measured 

by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.9

In practice there is little difference between the policy goals of the two central 

banks, or between the variables that are targeted.  But there is a subtle difference between 

them in terms of who sets the inflation target.  To date, that difference has not generated 

any major divergence between the approaches to monetary policy of the two central 

banks.

Although much has changed in central banking since the 1990s, the case for 

instrument independence and against goal independence remains sound. The case against 

goal independence is that it is not appropriate in a democracy: goals should reflect the 

preferences of society at large and should not be determined by unelected officials.  

The goals of monetary policy should be set by the central government, as is the 

case in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  We all know what the goals of 

the Bank of England and the Fed are: For both, the goals are stability of the price level 

and full employment. Although there is a hint of a lexicographic ordering in favor of the 

rate of inflation in the Bank of England’s mandate, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate 

unambiguously places equal weight on both goals.  Across the world, there seems to be a

9 See Federal Open Market Committee (2017).  See Bernanke (2012) for testimony discussing the longer-
run objective shortly after it was announced.  Bernanke (2015, p. 528) indicated that the FOMC’s 
announcement of the 2 percent longer-run objective was preceded by consultation between himself and 
congressional leaders.  In Fischer (2015a), I took the explicit 2 percent longer-run objective as the means 
by which the FOMC had made its legislated price stability goal operational.
