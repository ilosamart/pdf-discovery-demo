(CCAR) cycles are less fundamental than those we were seeing even a few years ago.  So I think 

the time may be coming when the qualitative objection in CCAR should be phased out, and the 

supervisory examination work around stress testing and capital planning completely moved into 

the normal, year-round supervisory process, even for the G-SIBs.     

Coupled with adoption of the SCB, and the changes in modeling and assumptions 

associated with that proposal, the elimination of the qualitative objection process would integrate 

the process and substance of stress testing into the rest of the Federal Reserve’s prudential 

oversight activities.  In doing so, it should alleviate the apprehension of banks that they may be 

subject to objections to their capital plans that are both very public and hard to fully anticipate.  

The SCB itself would continue the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tier prudential requirements even 

among larger banks, with the G-SIBs having somewhat higher capital requirements 

commensurate with the damage their failure would inflict on the broader economy, and the 

regional banks subject to modestly lower requirements than those that effectively apply at 

present. 

Having just described some good directions for the evolving stress testing regime, let me 

comment on what I regard as some ill-advised ideas circulating in current policy discussions. 

One is to detach the stress test from any limitations on capital distributions.  This would, in 

effect, make the stress test simply an informational exercise for supervisors and markets and 

would, accordingly, presumably be treated less seriously by all concerned.  Were we to do so, the 

very virtues of the stress test that I recounted earlier would be lost, as we would return to using 

only general, backward-looking risk weights.  Of course, it would also reduce capital 

requirements for the largest banks, which may be one of the motivations for the idea.
