willing to offer quotes to borrowers with credit scores of 680 as well.  Fewer than two-

thirds of lenders, though, are willing to extend mortgage offers to consumers with credit 

scores of 620 (figure 10).

  And this statistic may overstate the availability of credit to 

borrowers with lower credit scores:  The rates on many of these offers might be 

unattractive, and borrowers whose credit scores indicate eligibility may not meet other 

aspects of the underwriting criteria. 

Tight credit conditions also appear to be part of the story for FHA-insured loans.  

In the Federal Reserve’s October 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 

Lending Practices (SLOOS), one-half to two-thirds of respondents indicated that they 

were less likely than in 2006 to originate an FHA loan to a borrower with a credit score 

of 580 or 620 (figure 11).  Standards have tightened a bit further since:  In the April 2013 

SLOOS, about 30 percent of lenders reported that they were less likely than a year ago to 

originate FHA mortgages to borrowers with a credit score of 580 or 620 (figure 12).

The April SLOOS offers some clues about why mortgage credit is so tight for 

borrowers with lower credit scores.  Banks participating in the survey identified a 

familiar assortment of factors as damping their willingness to extend any type of loan to 

these borrowers:  the risk that lenders will be required to repurchase defaulted loans from 

the GSEs (“putback” risk), the outlook for house prices and economic activity, capacity 

constraints, the risk-adjusted opportunity cost of such loans, servicing costs, balance

 These data series begin in 2009 and 2010, so we cannot compare the current level of rate quotes to those 

that prevailed before the financial crisis.  However, in response to a special question on the Federal 

Reserve’s April 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, nearly 85 percent of 

lenders reported that they were somewhat or much less likely than in 2006 to originate a mortgage to a 

borrower with a credit score of 620 and a down payment of 10 percent (see 

www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/201205/default.htm).  This response suggests that credit 

supply has contracted for such borrowers.
