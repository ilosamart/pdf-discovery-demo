tools, whereas the efficacy of new tools in the United States, such as the countercyclical 

capital buffer, remains untested.14 

In considering the difficulties caused by the relative unavailability of 

macroprudential tools in the United States, we need to recognize that there may well be 

an interaction between the extent to which the entire financial system can be strengthened 

and made more robust through structural measures--such as those imposed on the 

banking system since the Dodd-Frank Act--and the extent to which a country needs to 

rely more on macroprudential measures.15  Inter alia, this recognition could provide an ex 

post rationalization for the United States having imposed stronger capital and other 

charges than most foreign countries.   

Implications for monetary policy 

Though I remain concerned that the U.S. macroprudential toolkit is not large and 

not yet battle tested, that does not imply that I see acute risks to financial stability in the 

near term.  Indeed, banks are well capitalized and have sizable liquidity buffers, the 

housing market is not overheated, and borrowing by households and businesses has only 

begun to pick up after years of decline or very slow growth.  Further, I believe that the 

careful monitoring of the financial system now carried out by Fed staff members, 

particularly those in the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, and by the 

FSOC contributes to the stability of the U.S. financial system--though we have always to 

remind ourselves that, historically, not even the best intelligence services have succeeded

See also Kuttner and Shim (2013), who find stronger effects of policies like loan-to-value and debt-to-
income ratio caps on housing credit relative to policies targeted at banksâ€™ balance sheets and thereby loan 
supply.
