Thank you for the opportunity to join you this morning.  Let me begin by saying that it’s 

a pleasure for me to be among community bankers.  I used to be the banking commissioner in 

Maryland and will always be grateful to the community bankers there who were crucial to 

informing my views on effective bank regulation.  At the height of the mortgage crisis, those 

same community bankers partnered with regulators like me to survey the wreckage and to 

stabilize our communities as best we could.  Together, we confronted and weathered that searing 

experience and learned many lessons along the way.  I’m here today to share with you some of 

those lessons.   

Although decisive action by policymakers has been successful in containing the crisis, we 

should not presume that the experience of the crisis is over.  To be sure, the frantic days of 

rushed mergers of major financial institutions; emergency applications of nonbanks to become 

bank holding companies; and large-scale, targeted Federal Reserve programs to stabilize markets 

and restore the flow of credit are behind us.  If we were doctors, we’d say that we had 

successfully treated the worst symptoms of the illness.   

But as we’ve learned from the other crises that are buffeting our world today, both natural 

and man-made, rescue and containment are only the first steps.  Now we must address the 

aftershocks of the subprime mortgage meltdown:  dislocation, joblessness, and loss of 

confidence.   

From a regulatory and supervisory perspective, we will certainly be dealing with the 

long-term consequences of the crisis for years to come.  And, as we head toward an increasingly 

healthy, but still highly complex and concentrated, post-crisis financial system, we must strive to 

find the appropriate balance of responsibility between banks and supervisors.  I’m hoping to 

open the dialogue about that today.
