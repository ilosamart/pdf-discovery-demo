may not be as tight as they appear to be, and thus they may exert less upward pressure on 

inflation than anticipated.  Alternatively, long-run inflation expectations, which have an 

important influence on actual inflation, may not be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent 

goal.  More broadly, the conventional framework for understanding inflation dynamics 

could be misspecified in some fundamental way.  Let’s now consider each of these 

possibilities in turn.   

Resource Utilization 

The unemployment rate consistent with long-run price stability at any time is not 

known with certainty; we can only estimate it.  The median of the longer-run 

unemployment rate projections submitted by FOMC participants last week is around 

4-1/2 percent.  But the long-run sustainable unemployment rate can drift over time 

because of demographic changes and other factors, some of which can be difficult to 

quantify--or even identify--in real time.8  For these and other reasons, the statistical 

precision of such estimates is limited, and the actual value of the sustainable rate could 

well be noticeably lower than currently projected.9  Thus, although FOMC participants 

generally view current labor utilization as probably somewhat greater than what can be 

sustained in the longer run, the statistical evidence from past experience does not rule out 

                                                 
8 For example, Aaronson and others (2015) estimate that increases in the average age and educational 
attainment of U.S. workers will reduce the sustainable rate of unemployment almost 1/2 percentage point 
between 2014 and 2020.  Barnichon and Mesters (2017) also present evidence that demographic changes 
have somewhat reduced the structural unemployment rate in the United States in recent years.  Relatedly, 
Yoon, Kim, and Lee (2014) and Juselius and Takats (2015) estimate that ongoing demographic transitions 
are having modest disinflationary effects in the United States and other developed economies. 
9 The statistical evidence also suggests that the sustainable rate of unemployment could be higher.  As 
illustrated by the results reported in Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) and Barnichon and 
Matthes (2017), standard errors for estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment are typically at least 
1/2 percentage point.  Accordingly, if the sustainable rate is estimated to be about 4-1/2 percent, there is 
roughly a 15 percent probability that the actual value is less than 4 percent; symmetrically, there is a 
15 percent probability that it is greater than 5 percent.
