financial marketplace.  At that point, our laws become the resting place for unfair 

practices and broad disrespect for the law generally.  This is a phenomenon that 

Shakespeare’s Angelo observed in “Measure for Measure” when he said: 

We must not make a scarecrow of the law, 

 Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, 

And let it keep one shape, till custom make it  

Their perch and not their terror. 


For sure, different regulatory regimes could have different answers regarding the 

best way to enforce laws and regulations.  As law professors teaching both the substance 

of law and the practice of law, I imagine you find ways within your courses and 

scholarship to discuss theories of enforcement--for example, the use of private rights of 

action versus enforcement by regulatory agencies; different enforcement tools such as 

memoranda of understanding, consent orders, and cease and desist agreements; how these 

different enforcement tools are sequenced; and whether and when violations of law 

should be publicized. 

In answering all of these questions, there is consensus that public enforcement 

should be used in addressing pervasive regulatory problems.  Today I want to talk about 

how home mortgage foreclosures hurt the pace of an economic recovery, and how 

important it is that the severe misconduct that has been uncovered in the mortgage 

servicing sector be addressed through intensified public enforcement of the law as part of 

the overarching effort to rebuild our damaged communities and neighborhoods.
