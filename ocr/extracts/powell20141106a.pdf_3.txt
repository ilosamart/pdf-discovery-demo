these markets.  According to public data, roughly 20 percent of all credit derivatives and 

45 percent of all interest rate derivatives are now centrally cleared--amounts that have 

grown substantially since 2009, when central clearing of credit derivatives began and the 

amount of cleared interest rate derivatives was at roughly one-half of its current level.3  

These amounts should continue to grow over time as central clearing and, especially, 

client clearing requirements take effect in more jurisdictions. 

Given the global nature of derivatives markets, the success of the reform agenda 

depends critically on international coordination.  Thus, to support the move to central 

clearing and address other lessons from the financial crisis, regulators developed the new 

Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) for the infrastructures that clear 

derivatives, securities, and payments.4  The PFMIs are comprehensive international 

standards for the governance, risk management, and operation of central counterparties 

(CCPs) and other financial market infrastructures.  Such standards are essential given 

that, in the interest of transparency and improved risk management, policymakers have 

encouraged the concentration of activities at these key nodes.  And it is particularly 

important that the standards be promulgated globally, given the potential for OTC 

derivatives to span multiple jurisdictions and to migrate to jurisdictions where standards 

and risk management are less robust.  Regulators are now engaged in the important work 

of translating these principles into national regulations.  Only when these strong
