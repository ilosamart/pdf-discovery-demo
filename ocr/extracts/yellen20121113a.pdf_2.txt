Thank you.  I’m delighted to be back at Haas, which I’ve been proud to call home 

for much of my career.  I’d like to thank Dean Lyons for inviting me to speak to you this 

afternoon.1  

My subject is the recent revolution and continuing evolution in communication by 

central banks.  All of us, of course, live in an era of revolutionary advances in 

communication:  If I succeed in saying anything interesting this afternoon, those words 

may be posted, tweeted, and blogged about even before I’ve left this podium.  So, it 

might seem unsurprising that the Federal Reserve, too, is bolstering its efforts at 

communication.   

But the revolution in central bank communication is not driven by technological 

advances.  Rather, it is the product of advances in our understanding of how to make 

monetary policy most effective.  A growing body of research and experience 

demonstrates that clear communication is itself a vital tool for increasing the efficacy and 

reliability of monetary policy.  In fact, the challenges facing our economy in the wake of 

the financial crisis have made clear communication more important than ever before.  

Today I’ll discuss the revolution in thinking about central bank transparency and how, 

pushed by the unique situation precipitated by the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve 

has responded with fundamental advances in communication.  Indeed, I hope that one of 

the legacies of this difficult period is a permanent and substantial advance in Federal 

Reserve transparency, building on the policies I’ll talk about shortly.   

As you all know, the Federal Reserve is actively promoting a faster recovery.  Our 

efforts are hampered by the fact that our standard policy tool, the federal funds rate, is

contributed to the preparation of these remarks.
