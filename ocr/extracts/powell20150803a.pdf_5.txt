and computing, the speed of trading has increased at least a million-fold.7  Advances in computing 

and faster access to trading platforms have also allowed new types of firms and trading strategies to 

enter the market.  Algorithmic and high-frequency trading firms deploy a wide and diverse range of 

strategies.  In particular, the technologies and strategies that people associate with high frequency 

trading are also regularly employed by broker-dealers, hedge funds, and even individual investors.  

Compared with the speed of trading 20 years ago, anyone can trade at high frequencies today, and 

so, to me, this transformation is more about technology than any one particular type of firm.  

  Given all these changes, we need to have a more nuanced discussion as to the state of the 

markets.  Are there important market failures that are not likely to self-correct?  If so, what are the 

causes, and what are the costs and benefits of potential market-led or regulatory responses?   

  Some observers point to post-crisis regulation as a key factor driving any decline or change 

in the nature of liquidity.  Although regulation had little to do with the events of October 15, I would 

agree that it may be one factor driving recent changes in market making.  Requiring that banks hold 

much higher capital and liquidity and rely less on wholesale short-term debt has raised funding costs.  

Regulation has also raised the cost of funding inventories through repurchase agreement (repo 

markets).  Thus, regulation may have made market making less attractive to banks.  But these same 

regulations have also materially lowered banksâ€™ probabilities of default and the chances of another 

financial crisis like the last one, which severely constrained liquidity and did so much damage to our 

economy.  These regulations are new, and we should be willing to learn from experience, but their 

basic goals--to make the core of the financial system safer and reduce systemic risk--are appropriate, 

                                                           
7 Marcia Stigum (1990), in describing the secondary bond market, noted that trades could be completed in a matter of 
seconds.  Currently, trading can occur at speeds below one microsecond.  (See Marcia L. Stigum (1990), The Money 
Market, 3rd ed. (Homewood, Ill.:  Dow Jones-Irwin), p. 649.)
