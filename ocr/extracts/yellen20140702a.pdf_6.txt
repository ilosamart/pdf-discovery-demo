the very least, however, such an approach would have been insufficient to address the full 

range of critical vulnerabilities I have just described.  A tighter monetary policy would 

not have closed the gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some SIFIs and markets 

to escape comprehensive supervision; a tighter monetary policy would not have shifted 

supervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective; and a tighter monetary policy 

would not have increased the transparency of exotic financial instruments or ameliorated 

deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector. 

Some advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have 

helped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points, but they might also argue that a 

tighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices, the use of leverage 

within the private sector, and the excessive reliance on short-term funding, and that each 

of these channels would have contained--or perhaps even prevented--the worst effects of 

the crisis. 

A review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does 

influence house prices, leverage, and maturity transformation, but it is also clear that a 

tighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool:  Substantially mitigating the 

emerging financial vulnerabilities through higher interest rates would have had sizable 

adverse effects in terms of higher unemployment.  In particular, a range of studies 

conclude that tighter monetary policy during the mid-2000s might have contributed to a 

slower rate of house price appreciation.  But the magnitude of this effect would likely 

have been modest relative to the substantial momentum in these prices over the period; 

hence, a very significant tightening, with large increases in unemployment, would have
