Thank you, and I also would like to thank the organizers of this forum for 

arranging for me to be part of your conversation, on a day when other business 

unfortunately prevents me from travelling to Kansas City.   

And I am really looking forward to hearing from all of you on what I expect will 

be a range of topics, but I thought I might start with a few remarks about something of

I believe these efforts reflect a commitment to diversity that is found throughout 

the Federal Reserve System, and I would like to talk a bit about the basis for that 

commitment, starting with why it is that diversity, in its different forms, is so important.   

One reason that the Fed organizes conferences such as this one is to facilitate 

communication.  In this case, we want to communicate with you, as leaders of institutions 

we oversee and are otherwise affected by our decisions.  We want to understand your 

views and try to explain what we are trying to accomplish.  Such communication would

conversation.  Todayâ€™s forum includes bankers from smaller community banks, regional
