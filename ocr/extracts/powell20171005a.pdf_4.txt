process to greater competition.  However, in other areas that already worked well, we chose, for 

example, to open up issuance of securities that were in short supply (or “squeezed”) when 

needed rather than to risk negatively affecting the functioning of Treasury markets by instituting 

more invasive regulation.   

There is certainly a role for regulation, but regulation should always take into account the 

impact that it has on markets--a balance that must be constantly weighed.  More regulation is not 

the best answer to every problem.  There is also a role for a body such as the TMPG to address 

market problems.   

The TMPG’s approach to “fails” in the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities markets 

provides a good example.  Fails--that is, the failure to deliver collateral in either a cash or 

repurchase agreement transaction--impose a cost on the party expecting delivery.  If the practice 

were to become too frequent, then it could seriously impair market functioning.  But at the same 

time, it doesn’t make sense to simply outlaw the practice, since that limits flexibility in a way 

that may not always be called for and would likely reduce market liquidity.  The TMPG’s 

recommendations were carefully calibrated to set financial incentives that would minimize fails 

and have been a marked success.   

The TMPG also plays an important role in helping to “fill in the cracks” between the 

competing regulations that various Treasury market participants face.  Many different institutions 

and individuals depend on these markets, and the regulatory system reflects that.  The 

Government Securities Act gave the Treasury Department some rulemaking authority over all 

government securities brokers and dealers.  But the act also required these firms to register with 

the SEC.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve regulates many of the banks that are active in 

these markets, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also plays an essential role, both as
