near zero and cannot be reduced much further.  In this extraordinary environment, the 

Federal Reserve is employing two unconventional policy tools to spur job creation and 

growth:  large-scale asset purchases, which some people call quantitative easing, and 

communications about the future course of monetary policy, also known as forward 

guidance.  

At the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting in September, the 

FOMC--the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking body--employed both of 

these unconventional tools.  The Committee initiated a new large-scale asset purchase 

program to buy mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  In addition, with regard to forward 

guidance, the Committee said that, first, it intends to continue buying MBS and other 

assets until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.2  

Second, the Committee stated that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary 

policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery 

strengthens.  And third, the Committee noted that it currently expects to hold the federal 

funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2015, about a half-year longer 

than previously announced.  

The three elements of forward guidance that were adopted by the FOMC in 

September 2012 would have been unthinkable in 1992 and greatly surprising in 2002, but 

they have, in my view, become a centerpiece of appropriate monetary policy.  To better 

explain my views regarding the FOMC’s forward guidance, I will first discuss how it fits 

into the Committee’s broader thinking and communication about monetary policy.  The 

                                                 
2 The September FOMC meeting statement further indicates that the Committee will take account of the 
likely efficacy and costs of such purchases in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset 
purchases.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC
