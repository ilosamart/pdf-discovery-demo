  I’m very pleased to be here to discuss the current structure of the Treasury markets.1 My 

involvement with these markets dates back to the early 1990s, when I served as Under Secretary of 

the Treasury for Finance.  Some of you will recall the Salomon Brothers auction bidding scandal that 

broke in the summer of 1991.  That event required those of us with oversight responsibilities to do a 

thorough evaluation of the structure of the primary Treasury market, and ultimately to propose a 

series of reforms.2  As part of that process, we put together a public conference to consider further 

reforms to Treasury auction procedures, with the participation of regulators, academics, and the 

financial sector.  Some of the ideas that came out of that conference eventually led to changes in the 

way primary auctions were conducted, changes that I believe were beneficial to the efficiency and 

integrity of the Treasury market.  The issues we are discussing today relate to the secondary market 

rather than to the auctions.  Although the Treasury market remains deep and resilient, there are 

nonetheless reasonable questions as to whether market functioning can be improved.  

 The events of October 15 last year have been folded into the more general debate about 

market liquidity across a number of markets.  I take the concerns about a decline in market liquidity 

seriously.  Hard evidence on the level of liquidity in secondary Treasury markets is mixed, with some 

measures at or above pre-crisis levels and some suggesting a reduced ability to buy or sell large 

positions without material price effect--a reasonable definition of liquidity.3  It is also possible that

Reserve System (1992), Joint Report on the Government Securities Market (Washington:  Government Printing Office,

working group, which in July 2015 published a joint staff report on the events of October 15, 2014 
(http://ipv6.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2014.pdf), was 
among the reforms noted in the 1992 report. 
3 The joint staff report on the U.S. Treasury market on October 15, 2014 (see note 2), includes measures of benchmark 
order book depth in the cash market that have declined since 2013 although they are comparable to levels in the early 
2000s.  Measured trade sizes in both cash and futures markets are lower than levels in the early 2000s.
