On top of that, the recently agreed-to budget deal is likely to raise federal spending by 

around 0.4 percent of GDP in each of the next two years.6 

Achieving Our Inflation Objective and Sustaining Full Employment 

Although the economy is currently around full employment and has been expanding 

at an above-trend pace, inflation has remained subdued for quite some time.  Over the past 

year, overall PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 1.7 percent, and core 

PCE inflation was 1.5 percent--not very different from the average level of core inflation 

over the past five years. 

The persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved 

below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation may 

have softened.  While transitory factors no doubt played a role in last year’s step-down in 

core PCE inflation, various empirical analyses conclude that persistent factors are at play in 

the stubbornly low level of core inflation.  According to a variety of measures, underlying 

inflation--the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and price setting--may be 

running below levels that are consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee’s 

(FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective.7  For example, some survey measures of longer-run 

inflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are 

most estimates based on statistical filters.  Inflation compensation has moved up recently, 

but is still running somewhat below levels that prevailed before the crisis.   

                                                 
6 The Congressional Budget Office (2018) estimates that increased spending caps will allow additional 
spending worth about 3/4 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2019.
