information systems could not provide timely, accurate information about bank exposures 

to counterparties or complete information about the aggregate risks posed by different 

positions and portfolios.  Regulators had recognized these problems in some cases but did 

not press firms vigorously enough to fix them.  

Even without a macroprudential mandate, regulators could also have done more to 

try to mitigate risks to the broader financial system.  In retrospect, stronger bank capital 

standards--notably those relating to the quality of capital and the amount of capital 

required for banks’ trading book assets--and more attention to the liquidity risks faced by 

the largest, most interconnected firms would have made the financial system as a whole 

more resilient. 

The Crisis as a Classic Financial Panic  

Having laid out some of the triggers and vulnerabilities that set the stage for the 

crisis, I can briefly sketch the evolution of the crisis itself.  As I have noted, 

developments in housing and mortgage markets played an important role as triggers.  

Beginning in 2007, declining house prices and rising rates of foreclosure raised serious 

concerns about the values of mortgage-related assets and considerable uncertainty about 

where those losses would fall.  The economy officially fell into recession in 

December 2007, following several months of financial stress.  However, the most severe 

economic consequences followed the extreme market movements in the fall of 2008.  

To a significant extent, the crisis is best understood as a classic financial panic--

differing in details but fundamentally similar to the panics described by Bagehot and 

many others.
