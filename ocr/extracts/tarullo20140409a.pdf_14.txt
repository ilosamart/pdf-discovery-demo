In this regard, the issue of how much structural damage has been suffered by the 

labor market is of less immediate concern today in shaping monetary policy than it might

That expectation raised the question of whether a reasonably rapid tightening in monetary

In short, by promoting maximum employment in a stable inflation environment 

around the FOMC target rate, monetary policy can help set the stage for a vibrant and 

dynamic economy.  But there are limits to what monetary policy can do in counteracting 

the longer-term trends I have discussed.  In economic research and in policy debates, we
