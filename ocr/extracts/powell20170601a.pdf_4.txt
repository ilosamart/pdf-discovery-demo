the 12 months ending in April, compared with only 0.2 percent two years earlier 

(figure 3).  But much of that movement reflects price changes in the often-volatile energy 

and food components of the index.  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy 

prices, has proven historically to be a better indicator of where overall inflation is 

heading, although it, too, can be affected by transitory factors such as import prices.  

Core inflation was 1.5 percent for the 12 months through April.  This measure has also 

risen since 2015, although its gradual increase appears to have paused because of weak 

inflation readings for March and April.  Some of the recent weakness can be explained by 

transitory factors.  And there are good reasons to expect that inflation will resume its 

gradual rise.  Incoming spending data have been relatively strong, and the labor market 

should continue to tighten, exerting some upward pressure on wages and prices.  

Nonetheless, it is important that the Committee assess incoming inflation data carefully 

and continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our symmetric 2 percent 

objective. 

Despite strong job gains, very weak productivity gains have led to disappointingly 

slow economic growth of only about 2 percent over the course of this expansion 

(figure 4).  While monetary policy can contribute to growth by supporting a durable 

expansion in a context of price stability, it cannot reliably affect the long-run sustainable 

level of the economy’s growth.6  The success of monetary policy should be judged by the 

                                                 
6 I have argued elsewhere that we need to find ways to increase our long-term growth and spread that 
prosperity broadly if we are to avoid this “low growth trap.”  We need policies that support business 
investment, labor force participation, and productivity growth.  Increased spending on public infrastructure 
may raise private-sector productivity over time.  Greater support for public and private research and 
development, encouragement of workers to increase their skills, and policies that improve product and 
labor market dynamism may also be fruitful.  See Jerome H. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic 
Developments and Longer-Run Challenges,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of Indiana,
