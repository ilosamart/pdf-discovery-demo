research analyzing recessions and their aftermath, focusing specifically on the factors that 

determine the pace of recovery once the economy has hit bottom.1  They find that 

recoveries tend to be faster following deeper recessions, but slower following long 

recessions.  Recoveries from recessions associated with housing busts also tend to be 

unusually weak. 

This research finds that for the advanced economies--especially Europe and the 

United States--the growth in output has been somewhat weaker than past history would 

have suggested, even accounting for the depth and duration of the last downturn.  

Although monetary policy has been highly accommodative, the pace of fiscal 

consolidation in Europe and the United States has been much greater during this recovery 

than is typical following severe recessions.  Additionally, in Europe, financial strains 

have been acute, helping to push the region back into recession.  In the United States, 

spillovers from Europe and a still-depressed housing market also help account for our 

tepid recovery and elevated unemployment.  As I will discuss a bit later, Japan has fared 

somewhat better, but faces significant challenges of its own.   

The Role of Emerging Asia  

 In contrast to the advanced economies, emerging market economies, particularly 

in Asia, recovered sharply from the global downturn, in part by using countercyclical 

fiscal and monetary policies to bolster domestic demand.  Based on the research I 

referred to earlier, the recovery in the Asian economies appears on pace with what we
