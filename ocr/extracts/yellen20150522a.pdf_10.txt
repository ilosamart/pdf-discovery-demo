Putting it all together, the economic projections of most members of the FOMC 

call for growth in real gross domestic product of roughly 2-1/2 percent per year over the 

next couple of years, a little faster than the pace of the recovery thus far, with the 

unemployment rate continuing to move down to near 5 percent by the end of this year.  

And for inflation, as I noted earlier, my colleagues and I expect inflation to move up 

toward our objective of 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as transitory 

influences wane. 

Of course, the outlook for the economy, as always, is highly uncertain.  I am 

describing the outlook that I see as most likely, but based on many years of making 

economic projections, I can assure you that any specific projection I write down will turn 

out to be wrong, perhaps markedly so.  For many reasons, output and job growth over the 

next few years could prove to be stronger, and inflation higher, than I expect; 

correspondingly, employment could grow more slowly, and inflation could remain 

undesirably low.   

Implications for Monetary Policy  

Given this economic outlook and the attendant uncertainty, how is monetary 

policy likely to evolve over the next few years?  Because of the substantial lags in the 

effects of monetary policy on the economy, we must make policy in a forward-looking 

manner.  Delaying action to tighten monetary policy until employment and inflation are 

already back to our objectives would risk overheating the economy.   

For this reason, if the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be 

appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate 

target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.  To support taking this step,
