alternatives to cryptocurrencies.  After all, a central bank digital currency could overcome the 

volatility risks associated with an unbacked asset with no intrinsic value by substituting a digital 

instrument that is the direct liability of the central bank.  Moreover, advocates suggest a central 

bank would be able to develop a transfer mechanism that has robust governance.   

Even though central bank digital currencies may at first glance appear to address a 

number of challenges associated with the current crop of cryptocurrencies, this appeal may not 

withstand closer scrutiny.6   First, there are serious technical and operational challenges that 

would need to be overcome, such as the risk of creating a global target for cyberattacks or a 

ready means of money laundering.  For starters, with regard to money laundering risks, unless 

there is the technological capability for effective identity authentication, a central bank digital 

currency would provide no improvement over physical notes and could be worse than current 

noncash funds transfer systems, especially for a digital currency that could circulate worldwide.  

In addition, putting a central bank currency in digital form could make it a very attractive target 

for cyberattacks by giving threat actors a prominent platform on which to focus their efforts.  

Any implementation would need to adequately deal with a variety of cyber threats--especially for 

a reserve currency like the U.S. dollar.   

 Second, the issuance of central bank digital currency could have implications for retail 

banking beyond payments.  If a successful central bank digital currency were to become widely 

used, it could become a substitute for retail banking deposits.  This could restrict banks’ ability to 

make loans for productive economic activities and have broader macroeconomic consequences.  

Moreover, the parallel coexistence of central bank digital currency with retail banking deposits 

                                                           
6 See, for example, the recent joint Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and Markets Committee 
report “Central Bank Digital Currencies,” March 2018, https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf.  A Fed-issued 
digital currency might have implications for the rates and terms of funding for U.S. financial institutions and even 
the U.S. government as well as the transmission of monetary policy that I will not discuss here.
