To connect cyclical fluctuations in the level of aggregate activity with changes in 

employment, Okun’s law has been proved useful as an empirical description of the 

relationship between the output gap and the unemployment gap, 𝑢𝑢� = 𝑢𝑢−𝑢𝑢

 (see Knotek 

(2007); and Daly, Fernald, Jordà, and Nechio (2013, 2014)): 

 
𝑦𝑦� = −𝛾𝛾𝑢𝑢� .                 (Okun’s law)     (3)   

 
To characterize monetary policy, it is nowadays useful to consider how the central 

bank affects the level of interest rates by setting the federal funds rate, 𝑖𝑖, in response to 

deviations of expected inflation from its target, 𝜋𝜋� = 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 − 𝜋𝜋∗ (inflation gap), and percent 

deviations of output from its potential level, 𝑦𝑦� = 𝑦𝑦−𝑦𝑦

 (output gap): 

 
𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓�𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 − 𝜋𝜋∗,  𝑦𝑦��.                       (4) 

 
To capture the role of credit and financial intermediation in the economy, 

consider a loan market equation, where the demand on the left-hand side depends 

negatively on the borrowing rate, 𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵, and the level of economic activity (higher income 

implies lower financing needs).  The supply of loans depends negatively on the level of 

interest rates, 𝑖𝑖, and positively on the level of intermediation spreads, 𝜔𝜔, and income, 𝑦𝑦 

(to the extent that higher aggregate income increases deposits and banks’ capitalization 

and hence the supplies of intermediated funds).  This equation pins down the equilibrium 

level of the intermediation spread,𝜔𝜔: 

 
𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑(𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,𝑦𝑦) = 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠�𝑖𝑖,𝜔𝜔,  𝑦𝑦�.       (5) 
 
The borrowing rate, 𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵, is then equal to the sum of the risk-free rate set by the 

central bank, 𝑖𝑖, and the spread,𝜔𝜔:
