Conclusion 

 In the wake of the financial crisis, the changes in finance, in financial regulation, and in 

the relationship among government agencies that carry out prudential regulation have created 

any number of opportunities for financial law scholars to collaborate with their colleagues in 

other disciplines--from administrative law to constitutional law to bankruptcy law.  This 

collaboration is perhaps natural, since major shocks to the economy, and thus the country, have 

in the past occasioned legal changes whose implications reached far beyond the original area of 

reform.  As I hope you can tell from my remarks today, I have already found the interaction 

between corporate and financial law scholarship to have been helpful in thinking through the 

policies that will shape a safer financial system.  I look forward to the fruits of the collaborations 

encouraged by the event sponsored today.
