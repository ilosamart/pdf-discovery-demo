Under the enhancement of the international G-SIB surcharge being developed by the 

Federal Reserve, the formula used to set risk-based capital surcharge levels for U.S. G-SIBs 

would incorporate each U.S. G-SIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding.  Greater reliance 

on short-term wholesale funding leaves firms more vulnerable to runs that impose externalities 

on the entire financial system.  Requiring higher capital levels at such firms will improve their 

chances of maintaining access to market funding in periods of stress by providing greater 

assurance of their solvency to counterparties. 

The LCR and NSFR developed in the Basel Committee are path-breaking measures that 

create quantitative liquidity requirements.  Still, they do not fully cover all facets of liquidity 

risk.  We are trying to address those residual risks in two ways--first, by adding certain 

requirements in our domestic implementation of the international standards and, second, through 

our supervisory program. 

As to augmenting the international standards, let me give two examples.  First, the Basel 

LCR does not impose any regulatory charge on a bank’s use of overnight funding to fund assets 

that mature in less than 30 days.  This lacuna leaves open the possibility of a significant maturity 

mismatch within the 30-day LCR window.  The U.S. LCR fills this gap by imposing a regulatory 

charge on maturity mismatch within the 30-day period.14  Second, because the Basel LCR and 

the NSFR each calculate the liquidity position of a firm on a fully consolidated basis, neither 

adequately addresses the risk that stress could occur in one part of the organization while the 

liquidity needed to deal with that stress is trapped in another.  In the U.S. LCR, a holding 

14 While the original version of the NSFR had a similar shortcoming, the newly finalized version partially redresses 
that problem by giving banks an incentive to reduce maturity mismatches within the one-year window.  More 
specifically, the NSFR now allows firms to recognize as stable funding 50 percent of certain liabilities with a 
residual maturity between six months and one year, including funding from central banks and financial institutions, 
and requires them to hold some stable funding against most assets that mature in under one year.
