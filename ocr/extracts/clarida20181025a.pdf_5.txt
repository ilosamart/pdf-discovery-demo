discussed, and a rise in the still-low rate of labor force participation among the prime-age 

population provides scope for the job market to strengthen further without generating 

inflationary pressures. 

This outlook for the labor market also reflects my view that the structural, or 

longer-run, rate of unemployment--that is, the unemployment rate consistent with stable 

inflation over the longer run--may be somewhat lower than I would have thought several 

years ago.  What this means is that, even with today’s very low unemployment rate, the 

labor market might not be as tight--and inflationary pressures not as strong--as I once 

would have thought.  I am certainly not alone in this thinking.  Over the past several 

years, most FOMC participants have been reducing their individual estimates of the 

longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  The median assessment of FOMC 

participants fell from around 5-1/2 percent five years ago to 4-1/2 percent in the 

projections published last month.  Outside estimates, such as those from the 

Congressional Budget Office and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, show a 

similar pattern of downward revisions.  This makes sense.  With unemployment falling 

and wage gains thus far in line with productivity and expected inflation, the traditional 

indicators of cost-push price pressure are not flashing red right now.   

 Both total and core personal consumption expenditure inflation are now running 

close to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.  When thinking about the inflation outlook, I 

pay attention to market-based measures of inflation compensation from the TIPS 

(Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) market as well as to surveys of inflation 

expectations.  These “breakeven inflation rates” are simply the difference between yields 

on traditional Treasury securities and those on TIPS with comparable maturities.  While
