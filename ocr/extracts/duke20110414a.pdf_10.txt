For those small business owners whose loans or credit lines were approved, the 

terms of credit--the interest rate spread over the bank’s cost of funds, the cost of a credit 

line, the maturity, and the size of a loan--are practical measures that can be used to assess 

credit availability.  The January SLOOS indicates that about one-third of banks, on net, 

reported that they had trimmed the spreads of C&I loan rates over their costs of funds on 

loans to small firms (figure 6).  Somewhat smaller net fractions of these loan officers 

reported that they had lowered the costs of credit lines and lengthened the maximum 

maturities of loans to small firms.  Despite the fact that such terms of credit were eased 

for small firms, the banks reported that the maximum sizes of C&I loans, and limits on 

credit lines and business credit card accounts, remained unchanged over the past two 

surveys.  This result means that such lines were not being cut as they were during the first 

half of 2010.  Easing of credit conditions usually does not occur until banks see 

improvement in the credit metrics of existing portfolios.  In the January SLOOS, 77 

percent of bankers reported having seen an improvement in the quality of existing loans 

to small firms. 

The SLOOS does not distinguish between commercial real estate loans to small 

firms and such loans to others, but we know that real-estate-secured lending is an 

important source of credit for small businesses.  The respondents to the January SLOOS 

indicated that there was little movement, on net, in domestic banks’ lending standards for 

commercial real estate loans over the past two surveys (figure 7).  Such standards remain 

relatively tight even though more than one-half of banks expect an improvement in the 

quality of commercial real estate loans.  And, importantly for small business owners, the 

commercial bank Call Reports indicated that as of the end of last year, the loans secured
