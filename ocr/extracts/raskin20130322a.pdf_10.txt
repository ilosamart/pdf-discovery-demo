moderate- and upper-income census tracts.  While branch-building has been on the rise, 

indications are that the increase in the number of bank offices has not occurred evenly 

across neighborhoods of varying income.15 

  In fact, a significant number of low- and moderate-income families have 

become--or are at risk of becoming--financially marginalized.  The percentage of families 

earning $15,000 per year or less who reported that they have no bank account increased 

between 2007 and 2009 such that more than one in four families was unbanked.   

Families slightly further up the income distribution, earning between $25,000 and 

$30,000 per year, are also financially marginalized: 13 percent report being unbanked and 

almost 24 percent report being underbanked.16  

This combination of economic insecurity and financial marginalization has 

incentivized more low- and moderate-income families to seek out alternative financial 

service providers to meet their financial needs.  Some of the providers they find, such as 

check-cashers and outfits furnishing advance loans on paychecks, can lead unwary 

workers into very deep financial holes.    

  In light of these challenges, I ask questions that have been asked before:  What 

can economic policy do to reduce unemployment, economic marginalization, and the 

financial vulnerability of millions of lower-income working Americans?  There is no 

simple cure to these conditions, but government policymakers need to focus seriously on
