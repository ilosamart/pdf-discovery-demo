Fourth, and last, the Fed has a unique Community Development function that 

seeks to mobilize ideas, networks, and approaches that address a wide range of 

community and economic development challenges.  One thing that makes our 

Community Development function unique is that we have deep geographic coverage at 

the 12 Reserve Banks and their Branch locations.  Last year, we combined the resources 

of our Supervision and Regulation division with those of our Community Development 

department to staff our Partnership for Progress.  By bringing in Community 

Development, we brought in a new perspective, one that has an explicit focus on low- 

and moderate-income communities.  We know that you serve many of these same 

individuals and communities, and we are asking our Community Development staff 

around the country to reach out to you to gather your perspectives on the communities 

you serve to identify emerging issues of which we should be aware.   

In closing, your institutions are important to the American economy and our 

understanding of that economy.  Therefore, on behalf of the Federal Reserve, Iâ€™d like to 

once again thank you for the work you do in your communities and welcome you to Los 

Angeles.
