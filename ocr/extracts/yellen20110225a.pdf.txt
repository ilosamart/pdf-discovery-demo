The U.S. Monetary Policy Forum has become an important venue for promoting 

an exchange of views among policymakers, academics, and financial market participants.  

I’m pleased to participate in this panel on lessons learned about unconventional monetary 

policy.  In my remarks today, I’ll highlight the role of central bank communications in 

bolstering the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy.1  It is not my intention to 

provide new information about the outlook for the U.S. economy or monetary policy. 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has deployed unconventional 

monetary policy tools to promote economic recovery and price stability since late 2008.  

In particular, after the intensification of the financial crisis, conventional monetary policy 

became constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.  At that point, the 

FOMC began to provide forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate, 

and the Federal Reserve also announced a program to buy agency debt and mortgage-

backed securities (MBS).  Over time, the purchase program was augmented substantially 

and was expanded to include longer-term Treasury securities.  Furthermore, on several 

occasions, the FOMC has communicated to the markets about the likely longer-term 

trajectory of its holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS.   

In the remainder of my remarks, I will present some evidence regarding the 

effectiveness of these policy tools and discuss important similarities and differences in 

the transmission mechanisms through which they influence the economy.  I will also 

present some simulations of a macroeconometric model to illustrate the importance of 

                                                 
1 These remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of any other member of the Federal 
Open Market Committee.  I appreciate assistance from the members of the Board staff--including William 
English, Yuriy Kitsul, Jean-Philippe Laforte, Andrew Levin, David Reifschneider, and David Wilcox--who 
contributed to the preparation of these remarks.

clear and effective communication in conjunction with the use of these unconventional 

policy tools.  

Some General Observations  

It is important to recognize at the outset that conventional and unconventional 

monetary policy actions bear many similarities.  Forward guidance concerning the path of 

the federal funds rate, for example, is explicitly intended to influence market expectations 

concerning the future trajectory of shorter-term interest rates and thereby affect longer-

term interest rates.  That said, standard monetary policy actions also typically alter not 

just current short-term rates, but the anticipated path of short-term rates as well, 

influencing longer-term rates through the identical channel.  In fact, central bankers have 

long recognized that this “expectations channel” operates most effectively when the 

public understands how policymakers expect economic conditions and monetary policy 

to evolve over time, and how the central bank would respond to any changes in the 

outlook.   

The transmission channels through which longer-term securities purchases and 

conventional monetary policy affect economic conditions are also quite similar, though 

not identical.  In particular, central bank purchases of longer-term securities work through 

a portfolio balance channel to depress term premiums and longer-term interest rates.  The 

theoretical rationale for the view that longer-term yields should be directly linked to the 

outstanding quantity of longer-term assets in the hands of the public dates back at least to 

the 1950s.2   

                                                 
2 Early examples include Culbertson (1957), Tobin (1958), and Modigliani and Sutch (1966).  More 
recently, Vayanos and Vila (2009) study a preferred-habitat model in which short- and long-term assets are 
imperfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios and the effect of arbitrageurs is limited by their risk aversion 
or other market frictions such as capital constraints.

Each of these policy tools tends to generate spillovers to other financial markets, 

such as boosting stock prices and putting moderate downward pressure on the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar.  My reading of the evidence, which I will briefly review, is 

that both unconventional policy tools--the use of forward guidance and the purchases of 

longer-term securities--have proven effective in easing financial conditions and hence 

have helped mitigate the constraint associated with the zero lower bound on the federal 

funds rate.  

The Effectiveness of Forward Guidance  

I will begin with an assessment of the FOMC’s forward guidance concerning the 

federal funds rate, which began when the FOMC reduced its funds rate target to a range 

of 0 to 1/4 percentage point.  In particular, the December 2008 FOMC meeting statement 

indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for some time.”  Identical guidance was reiterated in January 2009, and 

in March 2009 the phrase “for some time” was changed to “for an extended period.”   

Figure 1 suggests that the provision of guidance concerning the future path of the 

federal funds rate likely contributed to more accommodative financial market conditions.  

In particular, the consensus outlook of professional forecasters regarding the path of the 

funds rate shifted down markedly in the Blue Chip survey published at the beginning of 

February 2009 (the solid line) compared with the survey published two months earlier 

(the dashed line).3   

A crucial feature of the FOMC’s policy communications is that the Committee’s 

forward guidance has been framed not as an unconditional commitment to a specific 

federal funds rate path, but rather as an expectation that is explicitly contingent on 
                                                 
3 See Blue Chip Financial Forecasts (2008, 2009).

economic conditions.  Since November 2009, the Committee has specifically indicated 

that the relevant economic conditions include “low rates of resource utilization, subdued 

inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations.”  An important consequence of such 

conditionality, serving to enhance the effectiveness of the guidance, is that incoming 

information about economic and financial developments has led forecasters and investors 

to revise their outlook for the path of the funds rate even in the absence of a change in the 

forward guidance language.  

The evolution of financial market expectations concerning the funds rate path 

over the past year illustrates that the conditional nature of the FOMC’s forward guidance 

allows incoming economic data to shift market views.  For example, as shown in the left 

panel of figure 2, the expected path of the funds rate shifted down markedly during the 

spring and early summer of last year in the wake of weaker readings on economic activity 

and prices and of some concerns about potential spillovers from developments in Europe.  

Those expectations shifted down somewhat further during late summer and early autumn.  

Conversely, as shown in the right panel, funds rate expectations have shifted upward over 

the past several months in response to more-positive economic news and greater 

confidence that a self-sustaining economic recovery may be taking hold. 

Down the road, once the recovery is well established and the appropriate time for 

beginning to firm the stance of policy appears to be drawing near, the FOMC will 

naturally need to adjust its “extended period” guidance and develop an alternative 

communications strategy to shape market expectations about the policy outlook.  

However, if there were an unexpected faltering of the recovery or a substantial widening 

of downside risks to economic activity and inflation, the forward guidance now in place 


 - 5 -

might well be sufficient to facilitate an outward shift in the expected path of the funds 

rate, just as we saw over the course of last year.   

If financial market participants appeared to be expecting policy firming to begin 

somewhat sooner than policymakers considered desirable or appropriate under such 

circumstances, the language of the forward guidance could be adjusted to shift 

expectations toward the somewhat longer horizon over which the Committee expected 

the federal funds rate to remain extraordinarily low.  Figure 3 illustrates the potential for 

such a change in forward guidance to support economic activity.   In the left panel, the 

dashed line denotes the baseline path for the federal funds rate as embedded in current 

financial market data, while the solid line corresponds to an alternative path in which the 

initiation of policy firming is postponed by one year.  If policymakers viewed that 

alternative path as appropriate and market participants came to share that view, then 

financial conditions would become significantly more accommodative, even in the 

absence of any change in the current level of the funds rate.  As shown in the right panel, 

a simulation of the FRB/US model--a macroeconometric model developed and 

maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--indicates that such a shift in policy 

expectations would be associated with a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate 

(solid line) and a somewhat higher path of core inflation (dashed line) over coming years. 

The Effectiveness of Asset Purchases 

I will now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s program of longer-term securities 

purchases.  Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that asset prices and yields are 

affected not only by current securities purchases but also, importantly, by market 

expectations concerning future FOMC securities holdings.  This observation implies that 


 - 6 -

central bank communications pertaining to any important feature of the path of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet should influence financial conditions.   

Event studies can therefore be helpful in gauging the financial market effects of 

such communications.4  For example, table 1 reports the response of selected financial 

variables on several key dates associated with the FOMC’s purchases of longer-term 

securities.  In late November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase 

up to $600 billion in agency MBS and agency debt, and Chairman Bernanke provided 

further details in a speech one week later.  On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced 

that the program would be expanded by an additional $850 billion in purchases of agency 

securities and by $300 billion in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities.  Evidently, 

each of those communications was associated with substantial declines in longer-term 

nominal and real Treasury yields and in rates on agency MBS and corporate debt. 

Last August, the FOMC announced that it would begin reinvesting principal 

payments on agency MBS and agency debt into longer-term Treasury securities, and over 

the subsequent couple of months or so, the public remarks of Federal Reserve officials 

made note of the possibility of a further expansion of the portfolio.  Consequently, when 

the Committee announced in early November that it intended to purchase an additional 

$600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities, that decision was largely anticipated by 

financial market participants, and it occasioned only minimal market response.  However, 

taken together the movements in longer-term interest rates that occurred between the 

August and November FOMC meetings are strikingly similar to those on the prior 

                                                 
4 A burgeoning literature focuses on the experience with asset purchase programs of the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks; for example, see D’Amico and King (2010); Gagnon and others (2010); Hamilton 
and Wu (2010); and Joyce and others (2010).

announcement dates shown in the table, bolstering the judgment that these securities 

purchases contribute to more accommodative financial conditions. 

One complication that arises in evaluating the contribution of portfolio balance 

effects to the observed movements in longer-term rates is that news about large-scale 

asset purchases may also influence investors’ perceptions regarding the likely path of 

short-term interest rates.  Such effects may not have been very important, however, when 

the FOMC announced the expansion of its securities purchases in March 2009.  As 

shown in Figure 4, that announcement appeared to have only modest effects on the 

outlook of professional forecasters (left panel) and investors (right panel) regarding the 

likely trajectory of the federal funds rate.  Thus, the substantial decline in longer-term 

yields following this announcement appears to have mainly reflected the effect of the 

purchases in pushing down term premiums rather than a shift in the expected path of the 

funds rate.5  This evidence suggests that the portfolio balance channel of influence is not 

only operative but also fairly large.   

That said, as we saw in figure 2, the expected path of the federal funds rate does 

appear to have flattened for a time during the late summer and early autumn of last year.  

Even allowing for that change in near-term policy expectations, however, it seems 

reasonable to conclude that the announcement of additional securities purchases mainly 

affected financial conditions through the portfolio balance channel.  

                                                 
5 As noted earlier, in the March 2009 FOMC statement, the Committee did modify its forward guidance by 
indicating that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would likely be warranted “for an extended 
period” (rather than “for some time”, as in the December 2008 and January 2009 FOMC statements), but 
that modification does not appear to have substantially influenced professional forecasters’ expectations 
about the near-term path of the federal funds rate.  To the extent that the expanded asset purchases were 
expected to strengthen the economic recovery, the change in the forward guidance may have helped clarify 
that the FOMC did not intend to offset that effect by accelerating the initiation of policy firming; 
consequently, expectations for the trajectory of the federal funds rate were little changed on balance.

To assess the macroeconomic effects of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase 

program, I would like to highlight some findings from a recent study by four Federal 

Reserve System economists.6  As shown in figure 5, the authors constructed an 

illustrative baseline trajectory for the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over the 

course of this decade (solid line) as well as an alternative trajectory corresponding to a 

counterfactual scenario in which the FOMC never decided to initiate any securities 

purchases (dashed line).   

The baseline incorporates the first round of asset purchases--which brought the 

Federal Reserve’s securities holdings to a little more than $2 trillion.  It embeds an 

assumption that the FOMC will complete the purchases announced last November so that 

the balance sheet expands to about $2.6 trillion by the middle of this year.  From that 

point forward, the authors assume that the overall size of the portfolio will remain 

unchanged until mid-2012 and then shrink gradually at a rate sufficient to return it to its 

pre-crisis trend line by mid-2016, whereupon the Federal Reserve resumes expanding its 

holdings at the trend rate.  Full convergence of the composition of the portfolio is not 

complete until 2017, however, as the average maturity of the portfolio is still somewhat 

elevated in 2016.  It should also be noted that the trend line itself rises gradually over 

time as a consequence of steady growth in demand for U.S. currency.  

Of course, the baseline trajectory is purely illustrative:  The actual evolution of 

the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will depend on the decisions that the FOMC will 

make in light of economic and financial developments.  Nonetheless, the overall 

characteristics of this assumed trajectory seem broadly consistent with the sense of the 

Committee’s discussions last spring.  In particular, as reported in the minutes of the April 
                                                 
6 See Chung and others (2011).

2010 FOMC meeting, most Committee participants expressed a preference for 

renormalizing the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over a 

period of about five years that would commence following the initiation of policy 

firming. 

Figure 6 shows the results of simulations of the FRB/US model to gauge the 

effect of these asset purchases on the unemployment rate and core personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) inflation.  For this purpose, the baseline path (denoted by the dashed 

line in each panel) is constructed using historical data in conjunction with the latest set of 

consensus projections from the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  Then the staff model is used to simulate the 

counterfactual scenario in which the FOMC never conducts any asset purchases (denoted 

by the solid line in each panel).7  The pace of recovery under the baseline scenario is 

expected to be painfully slow.  But the counterfactual scenario suggests that conditions 

would have been even worse in the absence of the Federal Reserve’s securities purchases:  

The unemployment rate would have remained persistently above 10 percent, and core 

inflation would have fallen below zero this year.  Of course, considerable uncertainty 

surrounds those estimates, but they nonetheless suggest that the benefits of the asset 

purchase programs probably have been sizeable.   

My final observation concerning the FOMC’s asset purchase program pertains to 

the importance of clear and effective communications in the years ahead.  As I noted 

earlier, both theory and empirical evidence suggest that market prices and yields at any 

particular time reflect both the Federal Reserve’s current securities holdings and also 

                                                 
7 Because the latest release of the Survey of Professional Forecasters provided forecasts of the 
unemployment rate only through 2014, the authors extrapolated the forecasts through 2018 using the 
extended consensus forecasts reported in the October 2010 Blue Chip survey.

markets participants’ expectations for its future holdings.  Consequently, a shift in 

expectations concerning the trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could have 

an important effect on financial conditions going forward.   

In particular, financial conditions depend on market expectations not only 

concerning the amount of the FOMC’s purchases but also concerning the anticipated 

timing and pace of the eventual unwinding of those holdings.  For example, financial 

conditions would likely tighten immediately if market participants came to expect a more 

rapid renormalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In contrast, if market 

participants were to anticipate a more gradual renormalization, financial conditions 

would likely become more stimulative.   

To illustrate the potential importance of such changes in expectations, figure 7 

depicts a scenario in which markets come to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will 

shrink its balance sheet more rapidly than in the baseline scenario.  The left panel shows 

the assumed contour of an expected acceleration of asset sales that would renormalize the 

overall size of the portfolio within about two years (solid line), roughly twice as fast as 

under the baseline scenario (dashed line).  The announcement of such a strategy would 

cause a substantial rise in term premiums relative to the baseline scenario, and, assuming 

no offsetting change in the path of the federal funds rate, the resulting higher level of 

long-term interest rates would damp aggregate spending.  The right panel depicts the 

macroeconomic effects of the more rapid runoff of the balance sheet in terms of 

deviations from the baseline scenario:  The unemployment rate (solid line) is significantly 

higher, and core PCE inflation (dashed line) is somewhat lower.

Conclusion 

In conclusion, I believe that both forward guidance and large-scale asset 

purchases have been effective tools for providing additional monetary accommodation 

under circumstances in which conventional monetary policy has been constrained by the 

zero lower bound on the federal funds rate.  My colleagues on the FOMC and I are  

regularly reviewing the asset purchase program in light of incoming information, and we 

will adjust the program as needed to promote our statutory mandate of maximum 

employment and stable prices.  Recognizing the importance of market expectations to the 

effectiveness of unconventional policies, the Committee will continue to seek ways to 

enhance the clarity and effectiveness of our monetary policy communications.

     Note:  This figure depicts simulation results of the FRB/US model of the U.S. economy.  The left panel shows the path of the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings (in $ trillions) under an illustrative baseline scenario (solid line) and an alternative “rapid run-
off” scenario (dashed line).  The right panel shows the unemployment rate (solid line) and the core personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) inflation rate (dashed lines),  with results expressed as deviations of the alternative scenario from the baseline scenario.
