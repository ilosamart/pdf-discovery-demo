In the months ahead, my colleagues and I will continue to assess what policy path 

will best promote the sustained attainment of our goals.  With that in mind, I would like 

to start by describing the contours of today’s economy that will be particularly important 

in shaping the appropriate path of policy before reviewing recent developments.  These 

contours represent noteworthy departures from the “old normal” that prevailed in the 

decades prior to the financial crisis.  I would argue that policy today must rely less on the 

old normal as a guidepost and instead be sensitive to the contours that shape today’s 

“new normal.”1   

Key Features of the “New Normal” 

Because monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key 

features of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the 

economy and shape policy accordingly.  At a time when our assessment of the economy 

is evolving, several features of the “new normal”--some of which are interrelated--appear 

particularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations: 

1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened 

First, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical 

relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key 

guidepost for monetary policy.  The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack 

diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation 

would result.  However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both 

absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen
