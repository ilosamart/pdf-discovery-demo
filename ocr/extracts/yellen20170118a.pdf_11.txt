thermostat in a house:  You can’t just set the temperature at 68 degrees and walk away.  

And, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with long lags sometimes, 

we must base our decisions on our best forecasts of an uncertain future.  Thus, we must 

continually reassess and adjust our policies based on what we learn. 

That point leads me to repeat what I said when I began:  Like the Commonwealth 

Club, the Federal Reserve was created more than a century ago during an era of 

government reform to serve the public interest.  The structure established for the Federal 

Reserve back then intentionally insulates us from short-term political pressures so we can 

focus on what’s best for the American economy in the longer run.  I promise you, with 

the sometimes imperfect information and evidence we have available, we will do just that 

by making the best decisions we can, as objectively as we can. 

Thank you.  I welcome your questions.
