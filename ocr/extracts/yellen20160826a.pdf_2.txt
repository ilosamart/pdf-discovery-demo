The Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges 

for central banks around the world and spurred innovations in the design, 

implementation, and communication of monetary policy.  With the U.S. economy now 

nearing the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price 

stability, this conference provides a timely opportunity to consider how the lessons we 

learned are likely to influence the conduct of monetary policy in the future. 

The theme of the conference, “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks 

for the Future,” encompasses many aspects of monetary policy, from the nitty-gritty 

details of implementing policy in financial markets to broader questions about how policy

size and structure of the central bank’s balance sheet.  These topics are of great 

importance to the Federal Reserve.  As noted in the minutes of last month’s Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we are studying many issues related to policy 

implementation, research which ultimately will inform the FOMC’s views on how to 

most effectively conduct monetary policy in the years ahead.  I expect that the work 

discussed at this conference will make valuable contributions to the understanding of 

many of these important issues.   

My focus today will be the policy tools that are needed to ensure that we have a 

resilient monetary policy framework.  In particular, I will focus on whether our existing 

tools are adequate to respond to future economic downturns.  As I will argue, one lesson 

from the crisis is that our pre-crisis toolkit was inadequate to address the range of 

economic circumstances that we faced.  Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain
