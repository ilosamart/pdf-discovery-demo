do.  These younger generations are often seeking a rural lifestyle and a deeper connection to a 

smaller community--a community where they can have a lasting impact.  They are bringing with 

them the same innovative spirit they bring to so many industries.  For example, some of these 

young entrepreneurs and farmers are capitalizing on the recent trend for broader access to locally 

produced and sourced food.        

Which brings us back to our focus today:  agriculture is the foundation for many rural 

economies and it is the central topic for this conference.  Current conditions in agriculture appear 

to be stable, though at a low level of income, following sharp declines for several years from the 

peak in 2013.  The prices of major agricultural commodities have also remained low in early 

2019.   For example, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent less than it was from 2010 to 

2013.   

As noted in the Federal Reserveâ€™s latest Financial Stability Report, farmland values are at 

exceptionally high levels, though down from their 2016 peak.  And price-to-rent ratios are at 

historic highs.  At the same time, equity levels at many farms are higher than in the past.  We also 

see above-trend yields are helping to support many operators, though working capital at many 

farms has fallen along with incomes.  Although the increase in problem loans associated with 

lower incomes has been modest, the Federal Reserve is monitoring the risk that has emerged in 

recent years.   

One risk that we are actively monitoring is the recent and devastating flooding in the 

Midwest and its effect on both agriculture and rural communities across the region. Our thoughts 

and prayers are with all those who live in the areas affected by this disaster.  I would be especially 

interested to hear your thoughts on how the flooding may affect agricultural operations and how 

lenders are currently responding. 

The topics you are discussing today are integral to my role as governor.  On Thursday, I 

will be visiting with and speaking to farmers and community bankers in Deming, New Mexico.  

An important part of my job is to hear directly from leaders like you and others across this
