diminishing slack is helping return inflation to our objective.10  Second, our baseline 

projection rests on the view that inflation expectations will remain well anchored near 2 

percent and provide a natural pull back to that level.  But the strength of that pull in the 

unprecedented conditions we continue to face is something we must continue to assess. 

Finally, the FOMC is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise 

substantially above 2 percent.  At present, I rate the chances of this happening as 

significantly below the chances of inflation persisting below 2 percent, but we must 

always be prepared to respond to such unexpected outcomes, which leads us to my third 

question. 

What factors may push the recovery off track? 

Myriad factors continuously buffet the economy, so the Committee must always 

be asking, “What factors may be pushing the recovery off track?”  For example, over the 

nearly 5 years of the recovery, the economy has been affected by greater-than-expected 

fiscal drag in the United States and by spillovers from the sovereign debt and banking 

problems of some euro-area countries.  Further, our baseline outlook has changed as we 

have learned about the degree of structural damage to the economy wrought by the crisis 

and the subsequent pace of healing.   

Let me offer an example of how these issues shape policy.  Four years ago, in 

April 2010, the outlook appeared fairly bright.  The emergency lending programs that the

Moreover, with the share of long-term unemployed in total unemployment unusually elevated in recent 
years, there is an ongoing discussion about whether short- and long-term unemployment have differential 
effects on inflation.  See Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well:  Inflation and the
