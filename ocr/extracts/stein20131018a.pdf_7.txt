resilience of the banking system to as-yet-unknown shocks.6  I believe that it has been a 

very valuable addition to our toolkit in this regard, and will continue to be so. 

 However, I also believe that much of the promise of the CCAR framework lies in 

its potential to help us achieve a better outcome not just in normal times, but also in the 

important in-between times, in the early stages of a crisis.  In other words, when thinking 

about the design of CCAR, one of the questions I keep coming back to is this: Suppose 

we were granted a do-over, and it was late 2007.  If we had the CCAR process in place, 

how would things have turned out differently?  Would we have seen significantly more 

equity issuance at this earlier date by the big firms, and hence a better outcome for the 

real economy? 

 On the one hand, there is some reason for optimism on this score.  After all, the 

original stress tests—the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in May 

2009—provided the impetus for a significant recapitalization of the banking system.  

More than $100 billion of new common equity was raised from the private sector in the 

six months after the SCAP, and in many ways it was a watershed event in the course of 

the crisis. 

 Moreover, the current CCAR framework gives the Federal Reserve both the 

authority and the independent analytical basis to require external equity issues in the 

event that, under the stress scenario, a firm’s post-stress, tier 1 common equity ratio is
