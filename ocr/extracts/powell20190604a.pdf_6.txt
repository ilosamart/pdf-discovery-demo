The ELB problem also complicates the FOMCâ€™s efforts to achieve transparency 

and accountability.  The Fed, like most major central banks, is insulated from short-term 

political pressures.  In our democracy, that insulation carries with it an obligation for us 

to be transparent and publicly accountable.  When policy rates reached the ELB during 

the crisis, central banks resorted to what were then new, untested tools to pursue their 

mandated goals.  These tools are no longer new, but their efficacy, costs, and risks remain 

less well understood than the traditional approaches to central banking.  My FOMC 

colleagues and I are committed to explaining why the use of these tools in the wake of 

the crisis was a prudent and effective approach to pursuing our congressional mandate 

and why tools like these are likely to be needed again.  Our review is but one part of our 

efforts to engage with the public on these matters.   

Let me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions: 

1. Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its 

existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that 

aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?  

2. Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and 

maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the 

toolkit be expanded? 

3. How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and 

implementation be improved? 

These questions are quite broad, and my colleagues and I come to them with open 

minds.  We believe our current policy framework is working well, and we have made no 

decisions about particular changes.  In fact, the review is still in its early stages.
