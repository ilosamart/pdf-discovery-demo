However, a variety of data indicate that this feature of labor market dynamism has 

diminished.  Since the 1980s, internal migration in the United States over both long and 

short distances has declined.  To give an example, the rate of cross-state migration was 

less than half as large in 2011 as its average over the period from 1948 to 1971.7  And, 

while we still see the level of employment rising and falling over the business cycle, the 

gross flows of people between jobs and of jobs across firms that underlie the observed 

aggregate changes have fallen over the past 15 years.   

At this point, we do not have a full understanding of the factors contributing to the 

decline in labor market dynamism.  As a number of economists who have studied the 

issue have pointed out, some of the explanations may be benign or even positive.8  For 

instance, the aging of the population accounts for some of the decline in migration and 

job churning, as older individuals are less likely to move and change jobs; such 

demographic factors probably do not represent an adverse reduction in dynamism.  

Moreover, some of the decline in turnover could be the result of individuals and firms 

finding productive job matches more quickly than before.  For many employers and 

workers, the Internet has reduced the cost of posting job openings and the cost of 

searching for jobs.  This more efficient process could result in better matches between 

firms and workers and thus fewer separations.  Similarly, a reduction in firm uncertainty 

about the costs and benefits of investing could reduce firm-level churning in jobs.  In
