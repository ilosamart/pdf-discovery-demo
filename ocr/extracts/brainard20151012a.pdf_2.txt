The will-they-or-won’t-they drumbeat has grown louder of late.  To remove the 

suspense, I do not intend to make any calendar-based statements here today.  Rather, I 

would like to give you a sense of the considerations that weigh on both sides of that 

debate and lay out the case for watching and waiting.1  

The Outlook 

Domestic real activity has proven reassuringly resilient.  Most notably, the labor 

market has continued to improve this year, pushing the economy closer to full 

employment.  While monthly nonfarm payroll employment growth looks to have slowed 

over the past three months to a 167,000 monthly pace, so far this year it has averaged 

about 200,000.  With these gains more than sufficient to absorb trend growth in the labor 

force, they have led to gradual increases in resource utilization.  At 5.1 percent in 

September, the unemployment rate has declined ½ percentage point since December.  

Alternative broader gauges of unemployment--which include individuals who are 

marginally attached to the labor force and employees working part-time for economic 

reasons--have also shown steady improvement this year. 

Even so, a variety of evidence suggests there may be some distance to go to 

achieve full employment.  Although the unemployment rate is near longer-run norms, 

other measures of labor utilization are not.  The labor force participation rate remains 

materially below the pre-recession trend, even after adjusting for demographics.2   And

2 Much of the decline in recent years is due to the aging of the baby boom cohort.  But even holding 

demographics constant, the participation rate is considerably lower now than before the recession, 

suggesting it is cyclically depressed.  Aaronson and others (2014) find that demographics can explain only 

about half of the decline in the participation rate since the end of 2007. 

     Thus, it may be a while further before the participation rate fully reacts to the full amount of 

improvement in labor market conditions that we have seen thus far, since wage growth has remained low,
