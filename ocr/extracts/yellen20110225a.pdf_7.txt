central bank communications pertaining to any important feature of the path of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet should influence financial conditions.   

Event studies can therefore be helpful in gauging the financial market effects of 

such communications.4  For example, table 1 reports the response of selected financial 

variables on several key dates associated with the FOMC’s purchases of longer-term 

securities.  In late November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase 

up to $600 billion in agency MBS and agency debt, and Chairman Bernanke provided 

further details in a speech one week later.  On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced 

that the program would be expanded by an additional $850 billion in purchases of agency 

securities and by $300 billion in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities.  Evidently, 

each of those communications was associated with substantial declines in longer-term 

nominal and real Treasury yields and in rates on agency MBS and corporate debt. 

Last August, the FOMC announced that it would begin reinvesting principal 

payments on agency MBS and agency debt into longer-term Treasury securities, and over 

the subsequent couple of months or so, the public remarks of Federal Reserve officials 

made note of the possibility of a further expansion of the portfolio.  Consequently, when 

the Committee announced in early November that it intended to purchase an additional 

$600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities, that decision was largely anticipated by 

financial market participants, and it occasioned only minimal market response.  However, 

taken together the movements in longer-term interest rates that occurred between the 

August and November FOMC meetings are strikingly similar to those on the prior 

                                                 
4 A burgeoning literature focuses on the experience with asset purchase programs of the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks; for example, see D’Amico and King (2010); Gagnon and others (2010); Hamilton 
and Wu (2010); and Joyce and others (2010).
