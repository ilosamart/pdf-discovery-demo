shorter spells.  Nonetheless, the risk that continued high unemployment could eventually 

lead to more-persistent structural problems underscores the case for maintaining a highly 

accommodative stance of monetary policy.    

Putting all the evidence together, I see no good reason to doubt that our nationâ€™s 

high unemployment rate indicates a substantial degree of slack in the labor market.  

Moreover, while I recognize the significant uncertainty surrounding such forecasts, I 

anticipate that growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) will be sufficient to lower 

unemployment only gradually from this point forward, in part because substantial 

headwinds continue to restrain the recovery.  

One headwind comes from the housing sector, which has typically been a driver 

of business cycle recoveries.  We have seen some improvement recently, but demand for 

housing is likely to pick up only gradually given still-elevated unemployment, 

uncertainties over the direction of house prices, and mortgage credit availability that 

seems likely to remain very restricted for all but the most creditworthy buyers.  When 

housing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied 

dwellings and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow demand to be met for a

A second headwind comes from fiscal policy.  State and local governments 

continue to face extremely tight budget situations in light of the weak economy, 

depressed home prices, and the phasing out of federal stimulus grants, though overall tax 

revenues have been improving and that should continue as the economy expands further.  

At the federal level, stimulus-related policies are scheduled to wind down, while both real
