There are some good reasons why the capital rules have not yet been finalized--in 

particular, the need to carefully consider the thousands of comment letters on the proposed rules, 

many of which came from community banks.  Meanwhile, since Basel III sets a final deadline 

for implementation of 2019, one might ask why it is so imperative to act sooner.  

First, while it is important to get it right, this goal must be balanced with the costs 

imposed by delay.  Lending decisions and funding plans today are shaped by perceptions of 

business conditions in the future, and those conditions include the details of the final regulatory 

capital framework.  It seems obvious to me that uncertainty over that framework is weighing on 

the balance sheets of banks that will be affected by the rules.   

Second, while Basel III calls for full implementation by 2019, it also envisions a 

transition that must start years earlier.  Since the transition to the new rules will be gradual, with 

some elements of the rules proposed to come into effect earlier, the sooner that regulators 

finalize the rules, the sooner banks will be able to incorporate those rules into their capital 

planning efforts.   

 Now that banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have completed much of the 

analytical work in response to public comments on the proposed rules on Basel III, we must 

continue to work together to get on with the finalization of a regulatory capital framework.  So 

let me add my voice to those who believe that this work must be completed soon.  At a moment 

when the economy finally seems to be gaining some traction, I believe that finalizing a capital 

rule will minimize uncertainty related to capital requirements as well as promote safer and 

sounder banks.
