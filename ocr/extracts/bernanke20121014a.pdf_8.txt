Conclusion   

To conclude, the Federal Reserve is providing additional monetary 

accommodation to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  

This policy not only helps strengthen the U.S. economic recovery, but by boosting U.S. 

spending and growth, it has the effect of helping support the global economy as well.  

Assessments of the international impact of U.S. monetary policies should give 

appropriate weight to their beneficial effects on global growth and stability.
