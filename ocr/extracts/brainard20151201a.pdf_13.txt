stance of monetary policy is tighter than intended, unexpected policy restraint may prove 

difficult to offset later with more accommodative policy because the policy rate is already 

close to the zero lower bound. 

Finally, there is a risk that with persistently lower neutral rates, there may be 

greater pressures for investors to reach for yield, increasing the demand for risky assets.  

As a result, macroprudential policy may take on greater importance to guard against 

financial stability risks.  Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory 

agencies have implemented a number of new rules to strengthen capital, liquidity, and 

risk management at the largest financial institutions.  Many of these rules are “through 

the cycle” safeguards, meaning that they impose structurally higher standards.  In 

addition, when the risks to financial stability increase, the Federal Reserve, in 

consultation with the other banking agencies, can temporarily increase the amount of 

capital that large banks are required to hold in order to build resilience at these 

institutions and to restrain undue risk-taking on a cyclical basis.   

Conclusion 

A variety of evidence suggests that the longer-run neutral rate is lower now than it 

has been historically, and that the very low shorter-run neutral rate may adjust to it very 

slowly, due to a combination of weaker foreign demand growth, greater risk sensitivity as 

a result of the crisis, higher risk premiums for productive investment, and lower growth 

in potential output.  The lower neutral rate means the normalization of the federal funds 

rate is likely to follow a more gradual and shallower path than in previous cycles, 

although the actual path will be determined by economic conditions.  It also implies that 

the likelihood of the federal funds rate hitting the zero lower bound will be persistently
