almost ideal audience to provide that perspective, and I look forward to hearing your lectures in 

the future. 


                                                            
1 For example, the Garn-St. Germain Act of 1982, P.L. 97-320; 96 Stat. 1469, authorized banks to offer a deposit 
account with deregulated interest rates, and the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking & Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, 
P.L. 103-328; 108 Stat. 2338, substantially liberalized restrictions on interstate banking. 
2 Section 108 of Gramm-Leach-Bliley did mention financial stability, but in the context of requiring a study of 
potential subordinated debt requirements for large insured depository institutions and bank holding companies 
whose failure could adversely affect financial stability.   
3 DFA § 619. 
4 DFA § 622, adding Section 14 to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.). 
5 DFA §604(b), amending §5(c)(2) of the Banking Holding Company Act. 
6 Section 731, amending Commodities Exchange Act by adding new Section 4s – this is §4s(e)(3)(A). 
7 Others include the authority granted the SEC to require reporting of certain information by hedge funds (§ 404) 
and the creation of a new Federal Insurance Office, which is charged with “identifying issues or gaps in the 
regulation of insurance that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the United States 
financial system.”  31 USC 313 (c)(1)(A), as added by DFA §502. 
8 There are ten voting members and five non-voting members.  The voting members are the Secretary of the 
Treasury, who serves as the Chairperson of the FSOC; the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System; the Comptroller of the Currency; the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; the 
Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation; the Chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the Director of the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency; the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration Board; and an independent member 
with insurance expertise.  The non-voting members are the Director of the OFR, the Director of the Federal 
Insurance Office, a state insurance commissioner selected by the state insurance commissioners, a state banking 
supervisor chosen by the state banking supervisors, and a state securities commissioner designated by the state 
securities supervisors. 
9 DFA §120.  The FSOC is also required to issue an annual report to Congress assessing the impact of market and 
regulatory developments on, and threats to, the financial stability of the United States.  DFA§ 112(a)(2)(N). 
10 DFA §153 (a). 
11 DFA §111(2)(N) and §153(d). 
12 DFA §113(C)(1).   
13 DFA § 113(a)(2)(K). 
14 DFA §803 (6). 
15 For financial market utilities, unlike nonbank financial firms, the likelihood of becoming systemically important is 
enough to authorize designation. DFA §804 (a)(1).  This same provision allows designation of “payment, clearing, 
or settlement activities,” presumably regardless of who conducts those activities.   
16 DFA §805. 
17 DFA §803 (9). 
18 U.S. Department of the Treasury (2012). “Financial Stability Oversight Council Makes First Designations in 
Effort to Protect Against Future Financial Crises,” press release, July 18. (www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-
releases/Pages/tg1645.aspx) 
19 DFA §121(a). 
20 DFA §173. 
21 The two dealing with the acquisition of merger of banks simply require that each factor be “taken into 
consideration,” whereas the provision for acquisition of nonbanks requires consideration of the factors in the context 
of a determination of whether the proposed transaction “can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public 
that outweigh possible adverse effects.”12 USC 1843(j)(2)(A).  Somewhat confusingly, and a bit unaccountably, the 
wording of the financial stability factor also differs.  In the Bank Holding Company §4(j)(2)(A) and Bank Merger
