Despite these indicators of reduced demand, we continue to hear about difficulties 

experienced by small businesses in obtaining credit.  The number of complaints we hear is 

supported by data from the NFIB’s May survey indicating that the percentage of small 

businesses reporting tighter credit conditions than three months earlier was at levels comparable 

with its peaks of the early 1990s.  Moreover, as reported in the NFIB’s 2009 Credit Access Poll, 

among small businesses that attempted to borrow in 2009, only 50 percent got all or most of the 

credit they wanted.  An earlier NFIB poll found that, during the period from 2003 to 2006, 61 

percent of firms attempting to borrow got all of the credit they wanted and another 28 percent got 

most of the credit they wanted.  This suggests that credit conditions for small businesses today 

remain tight, especially compared with the 2003–2006 period.    

Of course, some of the difficulty that small businesses are currently experiencing in 

obtaining credit reflects their weakened economic condition.  Although the May NFIB survey 

shows an improvement in actual sales, they remain below pre-recession levels.  Furthermore, 

commercial real estate values have declined almost 40 percent during the downturn, and many 

small businesses rely on real estate as a source of capital or as collateral for other loans.  The 

NFIB reports that as of the end of 2009, 95 percent of small business owners owned personal, 

commercial, or investment real estate; 21 percent used proceeds from mortgages to finance 

business activities; and 11 percent used real estate as collateral for loans.  It is likely that most 

small business owners have seen a decline in the value of real estate owned, and many may have 

at least one property on which they owe more than the property’s value.   

 To better understand what is happening in the area of lending to small businesses, the 

Federal Reserve System is holding more than 40 meetings across the country to gather 

information that will help the Fed and others craft responses to the immediate as well as longer-
