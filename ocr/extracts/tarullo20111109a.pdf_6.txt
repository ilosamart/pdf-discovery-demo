intermediation, are still needed.  But the crisis reinforces the point that robust capital 

requirements should continue to be a central component of the financial regulatory system.  The 

U.S. banking agencies made reform of the capital regime a high priority.  

In response to the shortcomings of the pre-crisis capital regulatory regime, there have 

been three complementary threads of reform.  First is improvement of the traditional, individual-

firm approach to capital regulation.  This strand mostly originates in the work of the Basel 

Committee.  Basel 2.5 revised and strengthened the market risk requirements of Basel II.  Basel 

III upgraded the quality and increased the quantity of minimum capital requirements, created a 

capital conservation buffer, and introduced an international leverage ratio requirement.   

Second is the introduction of a macroprudential component of capital regulation.  

Although Basel III does contain a few features responsive to macroprudential concerns, it 

remains principally microprudential.  This second thread is linked both to the requirement in 

section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act for enhanced risk-based capital standards for large bank 

holding companies and to the Basel Committee's effort to develop a framework for the 

assessment of a capital surcharge based on the global systemic importance of the largest, most 

interconnected banking organizations. 

Third is establishment of regular stress testing and capital planning.  These 

complementary supervisory tools serve two related functions.  First, they make capital regulation 

more forward-looking by subtracting losses in asset values and earnings estimated to be 

sustained in an adverse macroeconomic scenario, in order to determine whether firms would 

have enough capital to remain viable financial intermediaries.  Second, they contribute to the 

macroprudential dimension of capital regulation by examining simultaneously the risks of all 

large financial institutions in the face of the adverse scenario.  This reform thread is sourced in
