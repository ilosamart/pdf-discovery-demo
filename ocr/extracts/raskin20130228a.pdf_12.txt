Consumer Finances suggests that the primary reason individuals do not have a transaction 

account is a simple dislike of dealing with financial institutions.

  If that dislike emanates from 

the reputation of the particular bank, or the reputation of the banking industry as a whole, 

policymakers and financial institutions will not be able to enhance financial inclusion without 

addressing the reputational context. 

Reputation and Innovation 


I’d like to imagine how the public’s sense of well-being might be enhanced by their 

interactions with financial institutions.  If we paid attention to the experiences of consumers as 

they interact with various segments of the financial marketplace, what could we learn?  If we see 

rigidities or imperfections in that interactive experience, what innovation might we imagine that 

would not only reduce reputational risk but create something new and potentially advantageous?   

Technological innovation was the subject of a recent award ceremony in San Francisco.  

The winners were companies with names like SoundCloud, GitHub, MakerBot, Techmeme, and 

Snapchat, all of which presumably do amazing things, although I don’t understand exactly 

what.

  But, evidently, the real buzz at the ceremony was over something much more mundane 

that I for one have no problem understanding.  That buzz was around a pedestrian item--a new 

and improved coffee cup lid.

  This lid, called FoamAroma, reportedly provides exactly the 

right set of openings to maximize aroma and recyclability, while minimizing the effects of coffee 

spurting out too fast.  The point here is that the innovator noticed something simple that others 

had not:  many coffee shop employees don’t drink their coffee from cups with plastic lids like 

their customers do, so there was a market need that had not been recognized and then addressed.
