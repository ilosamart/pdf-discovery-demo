career in that little bank.   

 The president of the bank was an old-fashioned community banker and a natural 

teacher.  He taught me everything he knew about banking, and that was plenty.  Fifteen 

years later, when he died suddenly of a massive heart attack, I had learned enough to take 

his place as chief executive officer.   

My banking education began with him as my mentor and with plenty of on-the-

job training.  Because the bank was just starting up, there were only 11 employees.  With 

lots of work to be done and not many people to do it, I was able to try my hand at nearly 

every job at the bank and to see the results of every action that was taken.  One of those 

early jobs was reconciling the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve and calculating the 

bank’s reserve position.   

Today, I spend a lot of my time thinking about the collective reserves held by all 

banks and how those reserves impact our economy.  My early experiences with making 

reserve decisions for a tiny community bank makes it much easier to connect the dots 

between Federal Reserve actions to add or withdraw reserves, bankers’ decisions to 

manage their reserve accounts, and the resulting impact on interest rates, which in turn 

influence economic activity. 

 The banking industry has a tradition of teaching basic concepts of bank 

management through in-house or industry-sponsored banking schools.  Once I realized 

that my talent for banking was much stronger than my natural acting ability, I started 

going to banking schools to learn about bank investments, lending, and bank 

management.  And I earned a masters in business administration while going to school at 

night.  I soon began teaching bank management in the same schools I had attended
