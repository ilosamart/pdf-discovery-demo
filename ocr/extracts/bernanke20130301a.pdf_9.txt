decline in the term premium might ultimately be attributed to the sluggish economic 

recovery, which prompted additional policy action from the Federal Reserve. 

Letâ€™s recap.  Long-term interest rates are the sum of expected inflation, expected 

real short-term interest rates, and a term premium.  Expected inflation has been low and 

stable, reflecting central bank mandates and credibility as well as considerable resource 

slack in the major industrial economies.  Real interest rates are expected to remain low, 

reflecting the weakness of the recovery in advanced economies (and possibly some 

downgrading of longer-term growth prospects as well).  This weakness, all else being 

equal, dictates that monetary policy must remain accommodative if it is to support the 

recovery and reduce disinflationary risks.  Put another way, at the present time the major 

industrial economies apparently cannot sustain significantly higher real rates of return; in 

that respect, central banks--so long as they are meeting their price stability mandates--

have little choice but to take actions that keep nominal long-term rates relatively low, as 

suggested by the similarity in the levels of the rates shown in chart 1.  Finally, term 

premiums are low or negative, reflecting a host of factors, including central bank actions 

in support of economic recovery.  Thus, while the current constellation of long-term rates 

across many advanced countries has few precedents, it is not puzzling:  It follows 

naturally from the economic circumstances of these countries and the implications of 

these circumstances for the policies of their central banks. 

How Are Long-Term Rates Likely to Evolve? 

So, how are long-term rates likely to evolve over coming years?  It is worth 

pausing to note that, not that long ago, central bankers would have carefully avoided this 

topic.  However, it is now a bedrock principle of central banking that transparency about
