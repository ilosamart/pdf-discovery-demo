required some judgment, not least on the question of how much we should try to minimize the 

chances of failure.  The requirements ultimately agreed upon by the Basel Committee were 

within the range we had estimated, though at the lower end of that range.  But the key point is 

that there was a single, reasonably persuasive approach to calibration around which regulators 

here and abroad converged.   

 When we move from the microprudential to macroprudential rationale for capital 

regulation, there is no such single accepted method for calibration.  We do want to reduce further 

the probability that a SIFI might fail under stress.  In that sense the exercise has some continuity 

with the microprudential approach – the percentage of required capital needs to be increased to 

achieve a smaller probability of failure based on the kind of loss history examined for Basel III 

purposes.  But the macroprudential rationale for enhanced capital standards is the amount of 

harm a SIFI failure will inflict on the rest of the financial system, not the amount of loss its 

shareholders and creditors will incur.  The calibration of the additional requirement needs to 

reflect this concern. 

Several different methodologies have been considered by the Basel Committee.  The 

“expected impact” approach tries to determine how much additional capital would be needed to 

reduce the probability of failure of a SIFI sufficiently to equalize the expected impact on the 

financial system of the failure of a SIFI and the failure of a banking firm just outside systemic 

status.  For example, if the loss to the financial system from the failure of a SIFI would be five 

times that resulting from failure of the non-systemic firm, then the SIFI would have to hold 

additional capital sufficient to make the expected probability of failure one-fifth that of the non-

SIFI.  The enhanced capital requirement implied by this methodology can range between about
