banking strategies.  Similarly, the Federal Reserve tailors its supervision of holding 

companies based on the size, complexity, and risk profile of each institution.  

Closing Remarks 

As I conclude, I would emphasize how crucial it is to balance effective regulation 

and supervision to ensure the safety and soundness of community banks while also 

ensuring that undue burden does not constrain the capacity of these institutions to support 

the communities they serve.  

As I previously noted, one of the most important aspects of my job, as I see it, is 

to have open lines of communication and feedback between regulators and community 

banks and bankers.  As a former community banker and state regulator, I understand how 

clear communication can help us all do our jobs better.  So, I encourage you--and 

everyone with a stake in this work--to share your thoughts on the impact of regulation on 

community banks and the communities they serve.  This dialogue is especially important 

as we continue to work to tailor our supervision and regulation to the size and risk profile 

of the institutions we oversee.  Although we have different responsibilities, I believe we 

can agree that we must keep our financial system strong, while maintaining the ability of 

community banks to fulfill their important role in our economy.
