  The announcement of this package did not stave off market pressures, and by then the 

concerns of investors had already moved well beyond Greece.  Doubts about the feasibility of the 

contemplated pace of Greek fiscal consolidation and concerns about the fiscal and financial 

situation in other vulnerable euro-area countries, especially Portugal and Spain, combined to move 

the situation closer to a crisis.  Pressures were also beginning to be felt in dollar funding markets 

in Europe.  Nascent signs of dollar shortages, a shortening of lending tenors on the interbank 

market, and increasing concerns about counterparty risk for many European financial institutions 

brought back memories of developments during the recent global financial crisis.  More visible 

was the sharp decline in the euro in foreign exchange markets and plunging stock markets 

worldwide.      

  In response to these rapidly deteriorating financial conditions, in the early hours of 

Monday, May 10, European leaders announced a much broader package of  stabilization measures 

than that previously announced for Greece alone.  

 One set of initiatives addresses sovereign risk.   The European leaders announced the 

establishment of a European Financial Stabilization mechanism that would be based on up to €60 

billion in European Commission funding and a special purpose vehicle that could raise up to €440 

billion in additional funds in capital markets with guarantees provided by member state 

governments.  Moreover, the IMF stated that it stood ready to cooperate with the EU, in 

accordance with established IMF lending programs and procedures, if requested by euro-area 

members.  According to the EU, total available support through loans and credit lines, including 

potential bilateral IMF loans to member countries, could be as large as €750 billion 

(approximately $900 billion).  In addition, the EU and the IMF announced final approval and 

funding for the earlier announced Greek rescue package in an effort to assuage concerns about the 

country’s financing needs.
