The first figure shows the effects of these four factors.  You will see that each 

factor is considered separately; there is no attempt to add them together.  That is because 

the broad factors we are considering here could well overlap--particularly the link 

between slower growth and the remaining three factors.  Still, the comparison gives us a 

notion of the relative importance of some of the leading explanations for the decline in 

interest rates.   

I started by noting the costs of low interest rates, including the limits on the ability 

of monetary policy to respond to recessions, and possible risks to financial stability.  Now 

that we have some notion of where lower interest rates might be coming from, I want to 

turn to the question of what might contribute to raising longer-run equilibrium interest 

rates.12   

One development that would boost the equilibrium interest rate would be a further 

waning in the investor precaution that seems to have been holding back investment--in 

Keynesian terms, an improvement in animal spirits.  The first bar in the second slide 

illustrates the effects on the longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate of an increase in 

business-sector investment equal to 1 percent of GDP.  As can be seen, such a rebound in 

investment would raise the equilibrium funds rate by 30 basis points, according to the 

FRB/US model.  In addition, higher investment would improve the longer-run growth 

prospects of the U.S. economy, although the effects in this particular case are fairly small, 

with real GDP growth about 0.1 percentage point higher on account of the higher 

investment.   

                                                 
12 By emphasizing “longer-run equilibrium” interest rates, I am excluding monetary policy (which is 
unlikely to have major effects on the equilibrium real interest rate), and thereby also relating to concerns 
about monetary policy being the only game in town.
