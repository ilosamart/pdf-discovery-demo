enhanced financial stability and reduced economic activity.  This will be an intellectually 

challenging exercise, but in itself does not entail any changes in policy.   

Monetary Policy and Financial System 

I have to this point described the possible need to balance longer-term financial 

stability and shorter-term economic growth considerations in the implicit context of a 

specific point in time, with the decision on use of supervisory, macroprudential, or 

monetary policy tools dependent on the level and nature of the potential systemic risk, the 

likely efficacy of each tool in containing that risk, and the expected side effects of each 

tool on growth.   But in thinking about the relationship between monetary policy and 

financial stability, it is also worth taking a view less focused on decisions at a specific 

point in time.   

Changes in financial technology, regulation, and perhaps the real economy over 

the past few decades have profoundly affected the channels by which credit is created in 

the economy, and thus the potential for financial instability.  The progressive integration 

of traditional lending and capital markets activities has created a fundamentally different 

financial system from that which existed from the mid-1930s through the mid-1970s, 

during which strict activities restrictions, limitations on competition, and deposit interest 

rate caps had shaped a banking system that was very stable and reasonably profitable, but 

not particularly innovative in meetings the needs of either savers or borrowers.  The 

extensive deregulation of banking in the 30 years preceding the crisis, while 

understandable as a response to the threat posed by capital markets and unregulated 

financial firms to the franchise of regulated firms, left the financial system without a 

basic framework to contain the risks posed in the new environment.
