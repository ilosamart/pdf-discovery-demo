shortfall faced by major banks.  It held the banks accountable for information on their 

capital adequacy and required them to fill the capital hole.   

The next big step for stress testing came with its integration with the Federal 

Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), beginning in 2011.  

One big change from the initial SCAP test was that stress tests were no longer a one-time 

emergency measure intended to restore confidence in major financial institutions.  

Instead, they became a recurring, ongoing process intended to maintain confidence in 

major institutions.  Second, stress tests were no longer a discretionary exercise by 

supervisors—under Dodd-Frank, they became the law of the land.  And third, when they 

were integrated into CCAR, stress tests became part of a comprehensive—it’s the first C 

in CCAR—framework for capital planning that more closely connected capital regulation 

to risk management of banks and overall supervision. 

These were changes, but with the effect of reinforcing the founding principles of 

the SCAP test.  Transparency was enhanced when stress tests became mandatory, 

recurring events and the public could depend on continuing to have access to information 

about banks’ capital adequacy.  Also, the independence of those judgments was enhanced 

when Congress made them a statutory responsibility for the Fed and when they were 

integrated into our CCAR framework. 

Further changes to stress testing have likewise reinforced the original goals.  

Stress testing scenarios have become richer and more challenging, providing more 

information about how banks would deal with a range of adverse developments and, for 

example, exploring the effects of more differentiated risks that are not tied to the business 

cycle.  Large trading banks now face an instantaneous shock to their trading assets, and
