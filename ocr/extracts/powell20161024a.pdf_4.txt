Market Infrastructures (PFMIs).2   The PFMIs overlap with our banking regulation in many 

areas; for example, both emphasize the need for sound risk management and the importance of 

resilience and recovery.  The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of 

financial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our work 

with Bank of New York Mellon regarding the transition.         

  Although our current task is to establish appropriate expectations for Bank of New York 

Mellon as a sole operator, that focus should not be taken as an indication that the Federal 

Reserve or other public authorities have pre-judged what the longer-term landscape for 

government securities settlement should look like.  In fact, we do not have a specific market 

design end state in mind.  Rather, we recognize the systemic importance of these activities and 

the need to ensure their continued availability in nearly all states of the world, regardless of the 

firms that offer them or the specific market structure.   

  The industry as a whole should play an important role in shaping the evolution of the 

settlement infrastructure.  Other firms may seek to enter this market. There have also been 

discussions over time of a settlement utility, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is 

currently considering a new variant of such a model.  Our focus is on the quality of the services 

offered -- their safety, resilience, and support of the market -- and not on the particular 

mechanism for offering them.  If new proposals come forward that are consistent with our goals 

of a safe and resilient settlement system, then they will receive fair consideration.
