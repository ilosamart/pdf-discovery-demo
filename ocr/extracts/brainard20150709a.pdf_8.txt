also required to maintain certain amounts of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics 

of their assets. 

As with assessments of capital, supervisors also evaluate liquidity at the largest firms in 

annual horizontal exercises called the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR).7   

In part because of these measures, the total amount of high-quality liquid assets held by the eight 

U.S. systemic banking institutions has increased by over 60 percent, or $1 trillion, since 2011 to 

$2.4 trillion currently.  And whereas these institutions were materially more reliant on short-term 

wholesale funding than deposits before the crisis, now the reverse is the case.  

Finally, the structure of incentive compensation also came under scrutiny post-crisis with 

the recognition that the heavy emphasis on stock options and bonuses created skewed incentives 

that provided substantial rewards for short-term risk taking going into the crisis. The logic of 

imposing tougher standards on large and complex institutions whose activities could pose risks 

to the broader financial system extends to requiring better alignment of the incentives of senior 

executives and senior risk managers with the longer-term fortunes of their banking institutions.  

Most simply, this calls for a greater share of compensation to be deferred for several years.  

Under the proposal issued by the Board and other federal financial regulatory agencies in 2011 to 

implement section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, at least 50 percent of incentive compensation of 

certain executive officers at financial institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or 

                                                            
7 Moreover, the component of the Board’s proposed risk-based capital surcharge linked to short-term wholesale 

funding is designed to help address the distinct financial stability risks posed by the systemic banking institutions’ 

reliance on less stable sources of funding. See www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-
