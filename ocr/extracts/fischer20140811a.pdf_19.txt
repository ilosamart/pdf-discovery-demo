The difficulty of coordinating among different independent regulators makes it 

likely that the degree to which macroprudential policies can be successful depends 

critically on the institutional setup of financial supervision in each country.  Different 

countries have structured their macroprudential policymaking institutions in different 

ways.  In the U.K., the Financial Policy Committee has been set up within the Bank of 

England, with the power to make financial policy--including macroprudential policy--

decisions.  In the U.S., the Financial Stability Oversight Council is a coordinating 

committee of the major regulators.  And in Sweden, responsibility for macroprudential 

oversight and financial stability lies with the Financial Supervisory Authority, which is 

separate from the Riksbank.   

Overall, it is clear that we have much to learn about both the effectiveness of 

different macroprudential measures, and about the best structure of the regulatory system 

from the viewpoint of implementing strong and effective macroprudential supervision 

and regulation.  And, while there may arise situations where monetary policy needs to be 

used to deal with potential financial instability, I believe that macroprudential policies 

will become an important complement to our traditional tools.  Learning how best to 

employ all of our potential policy tools, and arrive at a new set of best practices for 

monetary policy, is one of the key challenges facing economic policymakers.   

Concluding Remarks 

As we continue to move forward in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and 

the Great Recession, policymakers around the world are dealing with new challenges that 

these historically important events have raised.  In addition to the difficulties of assessing 

the relative importance of cyclical (short-term) versus structural (long-term) factors
