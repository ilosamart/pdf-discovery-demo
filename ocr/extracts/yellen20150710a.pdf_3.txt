which, as you well know, is important to Ohio.  The unemployment rate peaked at 10 

percent nationally, and it reached 11 percent here in Ohio.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls shrank 

by 8-1/2 million jobs during 2008 and 2009, or about 6 percent of the national workforce.  

Over that same period, Ohio lost more than 400,000 jobs, or 7-1/2 percent of the state’s 

employment. 

In response to the financial crisis, the severe recession, and the risk that inflation 

would fall persistently far below levels consistent with price stability, we at the Federal 

Reserve took forceful actions.  The FOMC aggressively cut our short-term interest rate 

target, the federal funds rate, from above 5 percent to near zero by the end of 2008 to 

lower borrowing costs and help spur household spending and business investment.  With 

short-term interest rates near zero, the FOMC provided further support to the economy 

through our large-scale asset purchases--buying large amounts of Treasury and mortgage-

related securities in the open market.  These purchases pushed down longer-term 

borrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses.  During the economic 

recovery, we put additional downward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates by 

explaining publicly that we intended to keep short-term interest rates low for a long time.  

Longer-term borrowing rates, such as those for mortgages and automobile loans, are 

lower if people expect short-term rates in the future to remain low or to rise only very 

gradually.  

Although evidence suggests that our policy actions were effective, the pace of the 

economic recovery has been slow.1  Growth in real GDP has averaged only about

long-term interest rates.  These include Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack
