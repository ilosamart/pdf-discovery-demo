the Committee indicated our expectation that economic conditions “are likely to warrant 

exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.”1  At our 

August meeting, the Committee decided to provide more-specific information about the 

likely time horizon by substituting the phrase “at least through mid-2013” for the phrase 

“for an extended period.”2  This clarification appears to have reduced market uncertainty 

about the Committee’s current policy expectations.   

The Committee’s guidance refers to a specific calendar date, which could be 

periodically revised by the Committee if appropriate.  However, it is explicitly framed as 

contingent on economic conditions, including “low rates of resource utilization and a 

subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run.”3  Importantly, it is not stated as an 

unconditional commitment to a specific course for the federal funds rate.  Market 

participants are naturally interested in gaining greater insight into how shifts in the 

economic outlook would affect the likely timing and pace of policy firming.  As noted in 

the minutes of the August and September FOMC meetings, the Committee has discussed 

possible approaches to enhance its forward guidance along these lines--that is, to provide 

greater insight concerning its “reaction function.”4    

One potentially promising way to clarify the dependence of policy on economic 

conditions would be for the FOMC to frame the forward guidance in terms of specific 

numerical thresholds for unemployment and inflation.  Such an approach was discussed 

by my colleague Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in a
