wealth have generally widened rather than narrowed over the past few decades.  Based on 

SCF data, median family wealth has grown much more rapidly for white families than for 

other families over the past few decades, while median family incomes have risen by 

about the same amount for white, black, and Hispanic families.   

As the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the 

sidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in 

employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.  

That said, the benefits of a lengthy recovery can only go so far, as the research points to 

some barriers to labor market outcomes for particular groups that appear to be structural.  

After controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these 

factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and 

informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support 

regarding employment opportunities.12  While the policy tools available to the Federal 

Reserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent 

disparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address 

them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.   

Geographic Disparities   

The Federal Reserve System benefits not only from our engagement with 

research, statistics, and surveys, but also from our presence in communities all across 

America.  This local presence, by design, provides valuable perspectives on how 

Americans in different communities are experiencing the economy and the varied 

                                                 
about $20,000 for black and Hispanic families. The larger gap in average income and wealth than median 
income and wealth reflects a greater concentration of income and wealth among the wealthiest white 
families than for other races and ethnicities.
