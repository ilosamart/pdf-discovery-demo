greater, as evidenced by persistently below target inflation in all of the major advanced 

economies.   

Monetary Policy 

In todayâ€™s circumstances, policy could usefully follow two simple guidelines.  

First, we should not take the strength in the U.S. labor market and consumption for 

granted.  Given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect 

and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the 

policy path.  Tighter financial conditions and softer inflation expectations may pose risks 

to the downside for inflation and domestic activity.  From a risk-management 

perspective, this argues for patience as the outlook becomes clearer.7 

Second, we should put a high premium on clear evidence that inflation is moving 

toward our 2 percent target.  Inflation has persistently underperformed relative to our 

target.  Moreover, measures of inflation compensation and some survey-based measures 

of inflation expectations suggest that inflation expectations may have edged lower.  

Given the currently weak relationship between economic slack and inflation and the 

persistent, depressing effects of energy price declines and exchange rate increases, we 

should be cautious in assessing that a tightening labor market will soon move inflation 

back to 2 percent.  We should verify that this is, in fact, taking place.  In this regard, core 

PCE inflation increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in January, a noticeable 

step-up from an increase of 1.3 percent over the preceding 12 months.8 

                                                 
7 To the extent that the neutral rate of interest--the rate that keeps output at its potential level and inflation 
at its target--has fallen in the United States and is low around the world, this may weigh on the policy path.

(2016), Del Negro and others (2015), Brainard (2015), and chapter 3 of World Economic Outlook 
(International Monetary Fund, 2014).   
8 Because the most recent 12-month change in core PCE prices includes several relatively large monthly 
increases in core PCE prices in the first part of 2015, it is possible that 12-month core PCE inflation will
