Thank you for this opportunity to show my support for the work all of you do on 

asset-building, and to say a few words on this vitally important topic.   

The financial crisis and the Great Recession demonstrated, in a dramatic and 

unmistakable manner, how extraordinarily vulnerable are the large share of American 

families with very few assets to fall back on.  We have come far from the worst moments 

of the crisis, and the economy continues to improve.  But the effects of the recession are 

still being felt by many families, particularly those that had very little in savings and 

other assets beforehand. 

To help make this point, I’d like to cite a few numbers from the Federal Reserve’s 

2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, published earlier this month.  The Survey is 

conducted every three years and this new edition provides one of the first good looks at 

how families in different economic circumstances have fared in the recovery. 

For lower-income families, what we find is sobering.  The median net worth 

reported by the bottom fifth of households by income was only $6,400 in 2013.  Among 

this group, representing about 25 million American households, many families had no 

wealth or had negative net worth.  The next fifth of households by income had median 

net worth of just $27,900.  These numbers represent declines from 2010.  One reason is 

that income has continued to fall for these families.   

Another likely reason for this decline in net worth is the lingering effects of the 

housing crisis.  Home equity accounts for the lion’s share of wealth for most families and 

many of these families have not yet recovered the wealth they lost in the housing crisis.  

The housing market is improving and housing will remain an important channel for asset 

building for lower and middle income families.  But one of the lessons of the crisis,
