practice in the field of mortgage finance and your country needs you to tackle it with the 

same vigor and energy that you have brought to other legal challenges in this housing 

crisis.  

Cicero said that “the safety of the people should be the highest law.”  Our people 

will not be financially safe until we re-examine and re-set the terms that define 

relationships in the housing market.  So we have a serious challenge ahead of us.  It’s a 

challenge that I have confidence we can meet with your help. 

Thank you, and I’m happy to take your questions and hear your comments.
