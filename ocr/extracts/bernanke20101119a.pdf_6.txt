declined noticeably since the business cycle peak, and further disinflation could hinder 

the recovery.  In particular, with shorter-term nominal interest rates close to zero, 

declines in actual and expected inflation imply both higher realized and expected real 

interest rates, creating further drags on growth.2

The Federal Reserveâ€™s policy target for the federal funds rate has been near zero 

since December 2008, so another means of providing monetary accommodation has been 

necessary since that time.  Accordingly, the FOMC purchased Treasury and agency-

backed securities on a large scale from December 2008 through March 2010, a policy 

that appears to have been quite successful in helping to stabilize the economy and support 

the recovery during that period.  Following up on this earlier success, the Committee 

announced this month that it would purchase additional Treasury securities.  In taking 

that action, the Committee seeks to support the economic recovery, promote a faster pace 

of job creation, and reduce the risk of a further decline in inflation that would prove 

damaging to the recovery. 

  In light of the significant risks to the 

economic recovery, to the health of the labor market, and to price stability, the FOMC 

decided that additional policy support was warranted.   

Although securities purchases are a different tool for conducting monetary policy 

than the more familiar approach of managing the overnight interest rate, the goals and 

transmission mechanisms are very similar.  In particular, securities purchases by the 

central bank affect the economy primarily by lowering interest rates on securities of 

longer maturities, just as conventional monetary policy, by affecting the expected path of 

short-term rates, also influences longer-term rates.  Lower longer-term rates in turn lead 

                                                           
2 Unexpectedly high realizations of real interest rates increase the real burden of household and business 
debts, relative to what was anticipated when the debt contracts were signed.  Higher expected real interest 
rates deter capital investment and other forms of spending.
