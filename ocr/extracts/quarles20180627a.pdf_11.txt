intended effects and supported by the global standards that the FSB and other 

international standard-setting bodies are able to establish and promote. 

In closing, I want to address an issue relevant to any international organization, 

which is sovereignty.  More specifically, we sometimes hear concerns that international 

bodies such as the FSB threaten our sovereignty by imposing rules on the United States, 

which would be a concern.   

Let me be clear: the FSB has no enforcement powers, no legal authority to 

command its members to do anything, and not even authority, as in some international 

organizations, to induce action based on contractual obligations.  The FSB does not 

impose obligations, it addresses problems--problems that are of great importance to the 

United States and which, because of the global nature of the financial system, we cannot 

address alone.  The United States and other governments created the FSB and participate 

in it because it is in our national interests to do so, and that is really the basis of its 

effectiveness.  The United States is not weaker or less independent by participating in the 

FSB or other standard-setting bodies.  On the contrary, when rightly structured our 

participation in these groups makes our financial system significantly stronger by 

ensuring that the U.S. perspective is part of the discussions and reflected in standards 

agreed to.  Our consumers and businesses are more secure and prosperous because the 

FSB helps make sure that all countries are doing their share in promoting financial 

stability and not gaining an unfair advantage.  

Like some other effective organizations, a source of the FSBâ€™s power is that it 

functions by consensus.  That can make reaching decisions more difficult, but it also 

yields decisions that can be truly effective solutions because all participants feel a stake
