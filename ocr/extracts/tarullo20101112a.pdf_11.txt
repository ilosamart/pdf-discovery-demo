The Basel Committee must be able to monitor effectively implementation of, and 

compliance with, these new capital standards.  A number of market analysts have noted that, 

even under current market risk capital rules, there is considerable apparent variation in the risk-

weightings apparently applied by different banks.  We are urging the Committee to explore 

mechanisms for ensuring that these strengthened capital standards lead to a consistency in 

application, as well as in the provisions of relevant domestic regulations. 

Along these lines, we have heard complaints from a few other countries that Basel II is 

not yet operative for our large, internationally active banking organizations in the United States.  

As we have explained, despite the substantial resources devoted by both banking organizations 

and supervisors to the tasks of developing and validating the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based 

Approach in those institutions, we continue to encounter significant difficulties.  The suggestion 

that U.S. banking organizations have thereby gained a competitive advantage is misplaced, 

however.  For one thing, we required significant capital increases as part of the SCAP and the 

Troubled Asset Relief Program repayment processes last year.  Also, we note that the required 

capital levels for some foreign banks adopting Basel II apparently declined from Basel I levels.  

In-depth oversight by the Basel Committee of implementation and compliance would 

allow supervisors from all member countries better to understand issues such as these.  I suspect 

it would also result in supervisors learning from one another and thus improving the quality of 

large institution capital regulation globally.  Although, fortunately, Basel III does not present 

nearly the degree of technical challenge posed by the advanced approach of Basel II, there will 

still be a good bit of opaqueness in how some of its components are implemented and thus a 

continuing need for significant monitoring by the Basel Committee.
