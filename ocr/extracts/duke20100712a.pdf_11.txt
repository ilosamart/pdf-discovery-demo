recovery, it is also important to the restoration of communities that have been hard-hit by 

foreclosures and job losses.  What we have accomplished is a good beginning.  We have 

identified some specific credit gaps and generated some ideas to tackle them.  We have 

brought together a network of people with different perspectives and resources but a 

shared commitment to improving credit conditions.  And we have sparked numerous 

research projects to further understanding of the current and ongoing credit needs of 

small businesses.  If we continue to work together, I am sure that we can alleviate some 

of the problems that small businesses face.  The more we do now, the better prepared our 

small businesses and lending institutions will be when economic growth and consumer 

demand pick up.  Thank you, again, for your participation today.
