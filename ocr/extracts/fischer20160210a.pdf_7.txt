to nonbanks, to provide liquidity to financial markets.  Indeed, during the financial 

crisis--which can be thought of as an old-fashioned bank run, but on the shadow banks--

the Fed’s credit facilities were used in an effort to stop the run in the shadow banking 

system.  Such broad-based facilities were instrumental in ensuring that money market 

mutual funds were able to liquefy their assets and so meet investor withdrawals, that the 

markets for critical short-term funding remained open, and that funding remained 

available for securitizations that were, in turn, funding loans to students, car buyers, small 

businesses, and others.  The facilities were many and varied, and developed as needed, 

because the U.S. financial system is complex and, as the crisis unfolded, the nature of the 

next phase was largely unforeseeable.  In several of these interventions, the Fed was 

lending to increase the liquidity of, or activity in, securities markets, in order to maintain 

the flow of essential credit to businesses and to households.5  Had that flow of credit 

ceased, the financial crisis, the severe recession that resulted, and the consequences for 

the U.S. economy, and thus every American, would have been far more serious. 

In November of last year, in a revision to its regulations reflecting the changes to 

the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority included in the Dodd-Frank Act, the 

Board spelled out how the Federal Reserve would design and operate such broad-based 

emergency lending facilities in the future.  Among other things, an emergency facility

(CPFF).  Under the CPFF, the Federal Reserve lent to a special purpose vehicle that in turn purchased top-
rated three-month commercial paper directly from eligible issuers.  And on November 25, 2008, the 
Federal Reserve and Treasury announced the creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF).  Under the TALF, the Federal Reserve extended loans to investors in certain triple-A-rated asset-
backed securities (ABS) to promote renewed issuance of ABS, thereby increasing the availability of credit 
to households and small businesses.  See Dietrich Domanski, Richhild Moessner, and William Nelson
