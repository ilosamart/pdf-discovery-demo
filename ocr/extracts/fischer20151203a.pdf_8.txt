In my view, the reduction in leverage and maturity transformation associated with 

better regulations leaves the financial system much more resilient -- even if such 

regulations have modestly affected market liquidity. 

What We Know and What We Do Not 

Despite my assessment of current vulnerabilities, conditions can change quickly.  

And important blind spots in our view of the financial system remain, in part owing to 

data gaps. When it comes to financial stability, what you do not know really can hurt 

you--and there remains a good bit we do not know.10  

This lack of data can impede the design of regulation.  There is a long history of 

data collection focused on banks, and supervisory data have contributed to our 

quantitative approach to regulation and supervision.  For example, when we examine the 

likely implications of the failure of an institution’s largest counterparty, we learn a great 

deal about the health of that institution and gain greater insight into its connections, 

through that counterparty, to other institutions. 

But data on a range of activities--including securities lending, bilateral repos, and 

derivatives trading--that create funding and leverage risks remain inadequate and hence 

could prove destabilizing if sufficiently large or widespread.  We gain some insight into 

these markets through our supervisory relationships with the largest bank holding 

companies, but the activities of important nonbank market participants, such as asset 

managers, and the interconnections across institutions remain more opaque.   

                                                   
10 The phrase “what you don’t know can’t hurt you” is well known.  According to the Oxford Dictionary of 
Proverbs, the oldest written version of this saying comes from 1576, in Petit Palace, by G. Pettie (as noted 
in Miller (2009)).  (I am indebted to Michael Kiley for this reference.)
