maturity distribution of our securities holdings is such that it will take some years for the 

size of our holdings to normalize via runoff.15   

The judgment that the downward pressure on term premiums will decline only 

gradually as we reduce the size of our balance sheet stands in sharp contrast to evidence 

suggesting that this pressure built up rather quickly when we were expanding our balance 

sheet.  To understand this contrast, remember that, unlike our plan to shrink our balance 

sheet, the various phases of our asset purchases had, to differing degrees, an element of 

surprise, with asset purchase announcements occasionally leaving a distinct imprint on 

the path of longer-term yields.  Moreover, each of our asset purchase programs resulted 

in a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period, whereas the 

normalization process will play out gradually over many years. 

I have focused thus far on the likely response of term premiums to our balance 

sheet reduction plan.  Let me turn my attention briefly to the likely response of longer-

term yields, which, as I have noted, reflect both a term premium component and 

expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates.  While the available evidence 

points to a strong reaction of longer-term yields to our asset purchases, it is conceivable 

that those yields will react much more modestly to our balance sheet reduction plan.   

Consider, for instance, a hypothetical scenario in which the FOMC has decided 

not to rely on balance sheet reduction to scale back accommodation, choosing instead to 

continue to reinvest indefinitely all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 

                                                 
15 Moreover, as the FOMC announced in June, the Committee decided to cap the monthly run-off in the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, making the balance sheet normalization process even more 
predictable and gradual.  The FOMC’s announcement is available on the Board’s website; see Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization 
Principles and Plans,” press release, June 14,
