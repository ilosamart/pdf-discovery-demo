economic growth and employment has been somewhat more muted than I might have 

expected.  Indeed, it seems plausible that the effectiveness of our policy tools is being 

attenuated by a number of unusual persisting factors, including an excess supply of 

housing and impaired access to credit for many households and small businesses.   

Under normal circumstances, residential construction is an interest-sensitive 

sector of the economy that has played an important role in contributing to previous 

economic recoveries--especially the brisk recovery that followed the steep downturn in 

1981 and 1982.  In the wake of the bursting of the housing bubble, however, the housing 

sector has remained exceedingly weak.  In effect, there is an excess supply of housing 

that seems likely to decline only gradually despite the record-low level of mortgage rates.  

Thus, in this crucial sector, one can argue that lower interest rates have not shown 

through to higher activity in the same way that would be expected under more usual 

recoveries. 

Consumer spending is also being restrained by the excess supply of housing, 

which has put downward pressure on home equity values and household wealth.  A 

substantial portion of homeowners now have negative home equity and are effectively 

unable to refinance at historically low mortgage rates.  Many more have seen a drastic 

decline in the value of their homes, which would typically serve as collateral for home 

equity lines of credit or second mortgages.   

The slow progress in repairing and restructuring householdsâ€™ balance sheets may 

also be lowering the normal responsiveness of consumer spending to a decline in market 

interest rates.  In particular, lenders continue to maintain relatively tight terms and 

standards on credit cards and, to a lesser extent, other consumer loans.  Consequently,
