measures during the crisis, so the runs and threats of runs on the shadow banking system brought 

forth government programs such as the Treasury's insuring of money market funds. 

 Reform measures to date are not wholly unrelated to the shadow banking system, and 

wholesale funding more generally.  Dodd-Frank addresses the associated issue of derivatives 

trading by requiring central clearing of all standardized derivatives and margining of non-cleared 

trades by major actors in over-the-counter derivatives markets.  Strengthened capital and 

liquidity standards for prudentially regulated institutions should help by giving increased 

assurance to counterparties about the soundness of these firms.  But in periods of high stress, 

with substantial uncertainty as to the value of important asset classes, questions about liquidity 

and solvency could still arise, even with respect to well-regulated institutions.  In fact, the 

supposed low-risk lending transactions--typically secured by apparently safe assets--that 

dominate the shadow banking system are likely to be questioned only in a period of high stress.  

It cannot be overemphasized that this systemic effect can materialize even if no firms were 

individually considered too-big-to-fail.    

 Interesting and productive academic debates continue over the sources of the rapid 

growth of the shadow banking system, the precise reasons for the runs of 2007 and 2008, and the 

possible sources of future problems.  The conclusions drawn from these debates could be 

important in eventually framing a broadly directed regulatory plan for the shadow banking 

system.  Domestically, among member agencies of the FSOC, and internationally, among 

members of the Financial Stability Board, policy officials are engaged in these debates and their 

implications for reform.  But policymakers cannot and should not wait for the conclusion of 

these deliberations to address some obvious vulnerabilities in today's shadow banking system.
