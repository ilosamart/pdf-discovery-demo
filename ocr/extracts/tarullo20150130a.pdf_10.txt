the firms that clear tri-party repo transactions.  But, as demonstrated in the years preceding the 

crisis, short-term wholesale funding can support a form of shadow banking outside the regulatory 

perimeter.  Indeed, one might expect that as regulatory and supervisory practice forces the 

internalization by regulated firms of the systemic costs of excessive dependence on runnable 

short-term funding, there will be increasing incentives for more leveraged credit intermediation 

to migrate outside the regulatory perimeter.   

One policy response that the Federal Reserve has advocated and that has now been 

proposed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), is for minimum margins to be required for 

certain forms of securities financing transactions (SFTs) that involve extensions of credit to 

parties that are not prudentially regulated financial institutions.6  This system of margins is 

intended to serve the macroprudential aim of moderating the build-up of leverage in the use of 

these securities in less regulated parts of the financial system and to mitigate the risk of 

procyclical margin calls by preventing their decline to unsustainable levels during credit booms.   

Given the ease with which such transactions may move across borders, it is particularly 

important that the FSB has proposed a framework that could be applicable in all major financial 

markets.  We will welcome comments on this proposal when, as I expect, the Federal Reserve 

issues a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement it domestically, probably by using the 

Federal Reserve’s authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to supplement our 

prudential regulatory authorities.  But it is also important to continue analysis of other 

macroprudential policy options that would address the risks associated with short-term wholesale
