housing prices and the equally dramatic rise in defaults.  At the same time, questions arose about 

the continued willingness and ability of sponsors to provide support to the SIVs, despite a history 

of their having done so on both contractual and discretionary bases.  A kind of run ensued, as 

investors realized that their instruments were not truly “equivalent” to cash and refused to roll 

over their short-term funding of the shadow banking intermediary.  Such SIVs are gone, but 

other forms of shadow banking continue in such well-established forms as money market funds 

and repo markets.    

The vulnerability of shadow banking to runs, as investors rapidly withdraw funding, can 

lead to systemic problems as consequential as those associated with classic runs on traditional 

banks.  If shadow banking intermediaries must rapidly liquidate longer-term assets that they can 

no longer fund, the impact extends across the financial system.  The resulting declines in asset 

prices trigger margin calls on other investors, who may then need to delever by selling their own 

holdings, accelerating the fire sale of these, and potentially other, assets.  In the worst case, the 

result can be the kind of generalized asset price decline and liquidity freeze observed at the 

height of the financial crisis.   

Dodd-Frank does include some significant provisions that, when implemented, could 

mitigate some of the risks associated with the shadow banking system and the potential for fire 

sales more generally.  Among these are the requirements for margining of over-the-counter 

derivatives, increased use of central clearing facilities for derivatives, and higher prudential 

standards for systemically important financial market utilities.  But Dodd-Frank does not fashion 

a far-reaching system of regulatory authority for the shadow banking system to parallel the one it 

creates for systemically important institutions, or even to address fully the significant 

connections - through implicit support and other channels - between the shadow banking system
