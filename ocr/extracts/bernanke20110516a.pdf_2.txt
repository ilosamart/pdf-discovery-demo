I am pleased to speak at this conference on new building blocks for jobs and 

economic growth.  The conference organizers have gathered an outstanding group of 

participants and have set an ambitious agenda.  The topics you will address today and 

tomorrow, bearing on innovation and intangible capital, are central to understanding how 

we can best promote robust economic growth in the long run. 

I won’t have to spend much time convincing this audience of the importance of 

long-run economic growth.  The Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert E. Lucas, Jr., 

wrote that once one starts thinking about long-run growth and economic development, “it 

is hard to think about anything else.”1  Although I don’t think I would go quite that far, it 

is certainly true that relatively small differences in rates of economic growth, maintained 

over a sustained period, can have enormous implications for material living standards.   A 

growth rate of output per person of 2-1/2 percent per year doubles average living 

standards in 28 years--about one generation--whereas output per person growing at what 

seems a modestly slower rate of 1-1/2 percent a year leads to a doubling in average living 

standards in about 47 years--roughly two generations.  Compound interest is powerful!  

Of course, factors other than aggregate economic growth contribute to changes in living 

standards for different segments of the population, including shifts in relative wages and 

in rates of labor market participation.  Nonetheless, if output per person increases more 

rapidly, the prospects for greater and more broad-based prosperity are significantly 

enhanced. 

Over long spans of time, economic growth and the associated improvements in 

living standards reflect a number of determinants, including increases in workers’ skills, 

rates of saving and capital accumulation, and institutional factors ranging from the
