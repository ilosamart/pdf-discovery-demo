account of a variety of risks to the financial system and in a way that reduces procyclical effects.7  

We vary the market shock over time to reduce the incentive for firms to correlate their asset 

holdings or adopt correlated hedging strategies that are treated relatively favorably under one 

particular market shock scenario.  And we do not allow firms to plan on a reduction in their 

balance sheets as a way to meet capital ratio requirements under stress. 

Still, as currently conceived and implemented, our stress testing regime emphasizes the 

direct risks to bank capital from a severe recession and associated market dislocation via the 

usual channels of reduced operating revenues combined with credit, market, counterparty, and 

operational losses.  However, as noted by some academics and policy analysts, a fully developed 

macroprudential dimension to stress testing would incorporate indirect risks to bank capital 

through channels such as market-wide funding and liquidity disruptions, fire sales, and so on.8  

These amplification effects are obviously particularly important for firms that have relatively 

larger trading books or that rely relatively more on short-term funding, or both.  Indeed, many of 

the academics with whom we discussed stress testing during our review emphasized the 

importance of building out the macroprudential elements of our stress testing program. 

The third topic we had identified for review was the nature of the qualitative assessment 

as it applied to the relatively smaller, less complex firms within the CCAR exercise.  While we 

had always explicitly differentiated our risk management and capital planning expectations for 

these firms, our supervisors had observed that many such firms seemed uncertain of whether 

they would nonetheless be held to the more stringent standards intended for the largest, most
