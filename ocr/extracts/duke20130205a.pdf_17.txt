 These statistics demonstrate the importance of community banks to small business and 

the corresponding importance of small business lending to the community banking business 

model.  In developing policies for small business lending, I think it is critically important for 

bank boards of directors to insist on appropriate risk management that retains the flexibility to 

use the bankers’ knowledge of their customers’ business to their best advantage.  And it is 

equally critical that supervisors develop tools to measure the overall effectiveness of risk 

management in small business lending without being overly prescriptive for individual loans. 

Conclusion 

 I would like to end where I began.  I think the future for community banking is bright.  I 

recognize that the regulatory changes underway are not without cost to community banks.  But I 

also know that we at the Federal Reserve are doing our best to avoid adding to regulatory burden 

wherever possible as we respond to the worst excesses of the financial crisis and make the U.S. 

financial system more resilient.  Research is helpful in this effort but it is also important to 

maintain an ongoing dialogue with community bankers and to actively solicit comment on 

regulatory proposals.  So I urge you to continue to communicate about the challenges that 

regulations pose for community banks.  

 More importantly, I know that the natural advantages found in community banks--deep 

community ties, daily interaction between senior managers of banks and their customers, and the 

dexterity to customize financial solutions--have not been diminished in any way.  Yes, the 

regulatory environment is challenging and the economy remains weak in many areas.  But all our 

research shows that with creative, engaged bankers and strong risk-management processes, 

community banks can continue to not only survive but to thrive.
