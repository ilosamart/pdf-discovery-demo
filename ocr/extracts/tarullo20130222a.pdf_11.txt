considered view of the role monetary policy might play in mitigating those concerns.

 Let me turn now to the way in which our shifts in policy approach should inform the 

agenda for international cooperation in financial regulation.  For obvious reasons, the monetary

obvious that the other two sets of policy changes are quite closely related to the international 

agenda. 

More than in most other areas, the financial sphere suffers from a basic lack of 

congruence between the authority to regulate and the object of regulation.  Thus we have a 

significantly internationalized financial system, in which shocks are quickly transmitted across 

borders, but a nationally-based structure of regulation.  Within countries, responsibilities may be 

divided between prudential regulators and market regulators, among regulators with similar 

mandates, or both.  Central banks may have exclusive prudential authority, share it with other
