true.  But the fact is that, when needed, Europe produced the monetary policy leadership 

it needed.   

What of the future?  What crises, what extremely difficult decisions, await the 

EU?  Some are already visible.  The decision to use the single currency to drive the 

European project forward was a risky one, and at some stage or probably in several 

stages, it will be necessary to put the missing fiscal framework into place.  And that, if it 

happens, will be another example of a crisis--the present crisis, one hopes--whose 

solution will have strengthened the European enterprise.  For success in this area must be 

one of the most difficult economic challenges facing the EU after the present crisis is 

over. 

Also awaiting the EU are the possibilities of major difficulties associated with the 

current Greek crisis and, later, with a potential British exit.  One can of course imagine 

many different types of future crises, including crises that could develop out of the 

worsening geopolitical situation in which the Western world finds itself.  And one could 

go on. 

Experience tells us that the best way to deal with future crises is to strengthen the 

economic framework in which they will be confronted.  That will require a great deal of 

thought about how to deal with future crises that could most easily be solved by an 

exchange rate adjustment, and it will also require developing a better mechanism to 

ensure that member states run responsible financial and budgetary policies.  It means also 

seeking solutions to the difficult demographics now confronting many European 

countries.
