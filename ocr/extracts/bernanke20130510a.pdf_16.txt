have been concentrated among wealthier households, while many households in the 

middle or lower parts of the distribution have experienced declines in wealth since the 

crisis.  Moreover, many homeowners remain “underwater,” with their homes worth less 

than the principal balances on their mortgages.  Thus, more detailed information clarifies 

that many households remain more financially fragile than might be inferred from the 

aggregate statistics alone. 

Conclusion 

 In closing, let me reiterate that while the effective regulation and supervision of 

individual financial institutions will always be crucial to ensuring a well-functioning 

financial system, the Federal Reserve is moving toward a more systemic approach that 

also pays close attention to the vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole.  Toward 

that end, we are pursuing an active program of financial monitoring, supported by 

expanded research and data collection, often undertaken in conjunction with other U.S. 

financial regulatory agencies.  Our stepped-up monitoring and analysis is already 

providing important information for the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee 

as well as for the broader regulatory community.  We will continue to work toward 

improving our ability to detect and address vulnerabilities in our financial system.
