Thank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you 

today.  I would like to offer my assessment of the U.S. economy, nearly six and half 

years after the beginning of the current economic expansion, and my view of the 

economic outlook.  I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal 

Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and stable prices 

and what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to 

evolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.  

The Economic Outlook 

The U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession.  The 

unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in 

October of this year.  At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC 

participants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1  The economy has 

created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total 

nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.  

Most recently, after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth, employers 

added an estimated 271,000 jobs in October.  This increase brought the average monthly 

gain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first 

half of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the 

labor market.   

Despite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the 

labor market has reached full employment.  Let me describe the basis for that view.
