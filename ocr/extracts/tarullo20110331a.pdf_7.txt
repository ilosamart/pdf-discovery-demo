model.  The potential for systemic problems would be essentially as great in an industry structure 

with many mid-sized funds as in one with a smaller number of large funds.   

Another consideration is that prudential standards designed for regulation of bank-

affiliated firms may not be as useful in mitigating risks posed by different forms of financial 

institutions.  Continuing with the money market fund example, the options for reform identified 

by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets show that these standards may not be 

the optimal form of regulation.3  Note, for example, that while money market funds engage in 

maturity transformation, they have essentially no leverage.   

All this suggests to me that the initial list of firms designated under section 113 of the 

Dodd-Frank Act should not be a lengthy one.  In part this is because some of the most obvious 

pre-crisis candidates--the large, formerly free-standing investment banks--have either become 

bank holding companies, been absorbed by bank holding companies, or gone out of existence.  

Any additional institutions so designated should probably present some combination of the first 

and second kinds of systemic effects discussed earlier and reflected in many of the factors 

enumerated in section 113.  That is, the emphasis ought to be on the direct consequences of the 

firm’s failure.  The potential for systemic risk from contagion effects really reflects the potential 

failure of an asset class or business model more than a firm.  These risks are, at least 

presumptively, more effectively addressed head-on.4   

Of course, just as the existence of a contagion effect depends on the economic and 

financial circumstances in which a firm’s failure arises, so the universe of firms whose failure 

would produce the first two effects will also vary.  When Drexel, Burnham failed in 1990, there 

were consequences in financial markets to be sure, but nothing approaching a systemic problem, 

whereas the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 sparked a conflagration in what was then the
