Indeed, the fact that the two most recent U.S. recessions stemmed principally from 

financial imbalances, not high inflation, highlights the importance of closely monitoring 

financial conditions.  Today I see U.S. financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate and 

broadly in line with their long-run averages.  While some asset prices are high by 

historical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage.  In 

addition, banks have far greater levels of capital and liquidity than before the crisis.   

Fourth, while persistently strong economic conditions can pose risks to inflation 

and perhaps financial stability, we can also ask whether there may be lasting benefits.  As 

I mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force.  In fact, as 

the labor market has tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off 

disability rolls.9  There could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth.  All 

told, though, the persistence of any such “positive hysteresis” benefits is uncertain, since, 

again, the historical evidence is sparse and inconclusive. 

Conclusion 

As is often the case, in the current environment, significant uncertainty attends the 

process of making monetary policy.  Today, with the economy strong and risks to the 

outlook balanced, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate 

remains strong and broadly supported among FOMC participants.
