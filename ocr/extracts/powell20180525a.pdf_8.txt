There is every reason to expect that technology and communications will continue 

to rapidly evolve, and to affect the financial system and financial stability in ways that we 

cannot fully anticipate.  While future innovations may well improve the delivery of 

financial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of 

potential future systemic vulnerabilities.  We will need to keep up with the pace of 

innovation, which will doubtless require changes to our approach to financial stability.  

As we consider such changes, it will remain critically important to provide transparency 

and accountability.  By doing so, we strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy 

that enables central banks to serve the needs of our citizens, in the long and proud 

tradition of the Riksbank.
