 Accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies, including the 

Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, have likely played some role in widening interest rate 

differentials and encouraging capital flows to EMEs.  But this role should not be 

exaggerated.  Other factors--including a reversal of the capital outflows from EMEs 

during the financial crisis and the EMEs’ longer-term favorable growth prospects--likely 

have also been important.  Moreover, it would be a mistake to portray these capital flows 

as an unmitigated negative for the EMEs.  A rebalanced global economy in which EMEs 

depend more on domestic demand for their growth will likely involve ultimately stronger 

and more sustained capital flows to these economies. 

 Finally, I would like to comment on the critique that our asset purchase program 

is meant to promote U.S. growth at the expense of other nations by depreciating the 

dollar and enhancing U.S. competitiveness.  That argument ignores the fact that 

stimulating growth in the United States is also likely to boost our demand for foreign 

goods and promote growth abroad.  This effect will provide an important offset to the 

other implication of U.S. monetary stimulus that I discussed earlier--that it may lead to 

moderate movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that tend to lower U.S. 

demand for foreign goods.  Whether foreign demand is ultimately boosted or diminished 

by U.S. monetary policy depends on the relative sizes of these two effects and is 

ultimately an empirical question.19  However, given the moderate exchange rate effects 

that we believe the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases have had, it seems likely to me that, 

as seems to be the case with conventional monetary easing achieved by lowering interest 

rates, our decision to purchase assets will not hinder foreign growth.  In particular, given 

                                                 
19 Kim (2001), Canova (2005), and Uribe and Yue (2006), among others, find that U.S. monetary stimulus 
affects aggregate output in emerging market and advanced foreign economies positively.
