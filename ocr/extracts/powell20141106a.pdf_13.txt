the fact that risks and losses, however well managed, do not simply disappear within a 

CCP but are ultimately allocated in some way to the various stakeholders in the 

organization--even if the risk of loss is quite remote.  This realization has generated a 

healthy debate among CCPs, members, and membersâ€™ clients and regulators that has 

provided fertile ground for new thinking about risk design, risk-management tools, and 

recovery planning.  To ensure that CCPs do not themselves become too-big-to-fail 

entities, we need transparent, actionable, and effective plans for dealing with financial 

shocks that do not leave either an explicit or implicit role for the government. 

Conclusion:  Realizing the Promise of Central Clearing  

A key question posed at this conference is whether the reforms instituted in 

response to the crisis have improved the strength and stability of the financial system.  In 

my view, the answer for OTC derivatives reform--and central clearing, in particular--is a 

positive one.  But final pronouncements are premature.  Post-crisis reforms and the rise of 

central clearing have started us down a path toward greater financial stability.  At the 

same time, central clearing brings with it a number of complexities that relate to the 

interaction between CCPs and the rest of the financial system, especially the global 

systemically important financial institutions that represent many of their largest clearing 

members.  Given the increasingly prominent role that central clearing will play in the 

financial system going forward, it is critical that we collectively get central clearing right.  

To do so, I have argued that it is imperative that we consider central clearing from a 

systemwide perspective, and that regulators will need to continue to work collaboratively 

with each other, both domestically and internationally.
