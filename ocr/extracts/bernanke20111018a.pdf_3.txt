run.  This broad framework is often called flexible inflation targeting, as it combines 

commitment to a medium-run inflation objective with the flexibility to respond to 

economic shocks as needed to moderate deviations of output from its potential, or “full 

employment,” level.  The combination of short-run policy flexibility with the discipline 

imposed by the medium-term inflation target has also been characterized as a framework 

of “constrained discretion.” 

 Many central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies consider 

themselves to be inflation targeters, prominent examples including those in Australia, 

Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  

Although they differ somewhat in the details of their policy strategies, policy tools, and 

communication practices, today virtually all inflation-targeting central banks interpret 

their mandate flexibly--that is, they treat the stabilization of employment and output in 

the short term as an important policy objective even as they seek to hit their inflation 

targets over the medium term.  Several other major central banks, such as the European 

Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank, do not label themselves as inflation 

targeters; however, they have incorporated key features of that framework, including a 

numerical definition of price stability, a central role for communications about the 

economic outlook, and a willingness to accommodate short-run economic stabilization 

objectives so long as these objectives do not jeopardize the primary goal of price 

stability. 

 How does the Federal Reserve fit into this range of policy frameworks?  The 

Federal Reserve is accountable to the Congress for two objectives--maximum 

employment and price stability, on an equal footing--and it does not have a formal,
