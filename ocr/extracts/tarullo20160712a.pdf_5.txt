pre-crisis period have now either converted to, or been absorbed into, bank holding companies 

subject to prudential capital and liquidity regulation.  New regulatory requirements have placed 

some constraints on the relationships between shadow banking and prudentially regulated 

banking organizations.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken some steps to 

strengthen its regulation of money market funds and other asset managers whose business 

models involve substantial amounts of liquidity transformation. 

But just because the levels of runnable funding are significantly lower than before the 

crisis does not necessarily mean they are at safe or optimal levels.  And it seems quite reasonable 

to expect that new forms of financial intermediation based substantially on runnable funding 

could develop in the future.  As liquidity standards, stress testing, and resolution planning 

evolve, regulators will continue to work on this issue with prudentially regulated firms.  But the 

conditions for destructive runs that threaten financial stability could exist even where no 

institutions that might be perceived as too-big-to-fail are immediately involved.  So I continue to 

believe that the post-crisis work to create a solid regime to protect financial stability cannot be 

deemed complete without a well-considered approach to regulating runnable funding outside, as 

well as inside, the regulatory perimeter. 

Again, taking advantage of my spot at the opening of the conference, let me note some 

key questions to be answered in fashioning such an approach.   

First, to what degree will it rely on uniform regulation of users of runnable funding no 

matter what the characteristics of the market actors and business models involved in the funding 

relationship?  The alternative would be continued reliance on a regulatory response tailored to 

different forms of financial intermediation and, perhaps, the relative market significance of the 

various actors.  The advantages of the former are that it minimizes at least one kind of regulatory
