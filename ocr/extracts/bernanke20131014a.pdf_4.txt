keep Treasury yields at low levels to reduce the cost of financing wartime deficits.  After 

the war, as inflation pressures rose, Federal Reserve policymakers wanted to return to 

independent rate setting, but the Treasury demurred, hoping to keep the cost of servicing 

the national debt low.  The conflict was resolved in 1951 through the Treasury-Fed 

Accord, an agreement that reestablished the Federal Reserve’s ability to set rates as 

dictated by the needs of the broader economy.  During the 1980s, under the leadership of 

Chairman Paul Volcker, the Fed further established its credibility and independence by 

taking the necessary steps to bring inflation under control.  As in Mexico, the benefits of 

central bank independence in the United States have included low inflation, 

well-anchored inflation expectations, and increased policy credibility, which contribute to 

a more stable overall economic environment.  Indeed, during the recent financial crisis 

and the ensuing recession, the Fed has been able to take aggressive monetary policy 

actions to help stabilize the economy without dislodging longer-term inflation 

expectations. 

We should recognize, though, that in democratic societies, central bank 

independence must be accompanied by accountability to the public and its 

representatives.  In this regard, transparency is key.  To ensure appropriate accountability, 

while also making monetary policy more effective, central banks in the United States, 

Mexico, and around the world have worked hard to increase their transparency over the 

past 20 years or so.  For example, in the United States, the Fed’s policymaking arm, the 

Federal Open Market Committee, releases a statement after each meeting explaining its 

decisions and reporting the vote, publishes detailed minutes three weeks after each 

meeting, and provides a quarterly summary of Committee participants’ economic and
