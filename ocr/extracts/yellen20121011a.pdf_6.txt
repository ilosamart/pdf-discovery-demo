fallen to near record lows.  Accordingly, Japan, like the United States, has the scope to 

carry out fiscal consolidation plans that address long-run sustainability issues without 

endangering near-term growth prospects.  Currently, policymakers in both Japan and the 

United States face the challenge of designing policies that provide a credible commitment 

to medium-term deficit reduction without disrupting the fragile recovery.  But once in 

place, such policies should help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business 

confidence.   

Japan would also benefit from measures to increase its potential growth, which is 

generally estimated to have fallen to less than 1 percent and could decline further as 

population aging progresses.  It is widely believed that easing regulations could promote 

faster productivity growth, particularly in the services sector.  Declines in the working-

age population also make it desirable to boost labor force participation.  Higher 

employment and faster productivity gains would help to boost economic activity, enhance 

fiscal sustainability, and restore Japanâ€™s contributions to global economic growth.     

Conclusion 

Growth in the advanced economies is still hampered by critical challenges and 

full recovery is likely to take several years.  Emerging market economies, particularly in 

Asia, have performed better, but both they and the global economy more generally would 

benefit by further rebalancing of their growth toward domestic demand.  Japan initially 

bounced back more quickly than other advanced economies from the global financial 

crisis, but its growth has slowed recently, and it also faces serious fiscal and structural 

challenges.  By addressing these challenges, Japan can enhance its long-term prospects 

and continue to play a leading role in Asia and the global economy.
