has grown from about 25 percent of GDP in 1960 to more than 300 percent today.  And, 

reflecting the greater integration of global financial markets, the correlation of U.S. and 

foreign equity and bond markets has trended broadly upward for several decades.3   

Channels of Transmission of Global Shocks to the U.S. Economy  

This increased integration I have described has heightened the exposure of the 

U.S. economy to external shocks.  But what are the channels of transmission of these 

shocks to the United States?   

For concreteness, let us consider the case of a negative demand shock originating 

abroad, such as a foreign recession.  First, this shock affects the United States through 

direct trade links, lowering demand for U.S. exports and, thus, lowering U.S. GDP.  

Second, the foreign recession leads to lower interest rates abroad and, other things 

being equal, raises the value of the dollar, which in turn lowers U.S. exports and boosts 

U.S. imports.  The dollar appreciation also puts downward pressure on U.S. import prices 

and, thereby, inflation.  The extent to which foreign worries lead to safe-haven flows may 

add to the dollarâ€™s strength.   

Finally, there is contagion to U.S financial markets.  Let me first elaborate on the 

exchange rate channel I just mentioned.  The traditional determinants of exchange rates--

that is, differentials in expected rates of return--apply to the United States as to other 

countries.  But the U.S. economy is different because of the special role of U.S. 

government bonds as global safe assets.  As a consequence, an adverse foreign shock that 

damped the demand for risky assets would be expected to trigger safe-haven flows that

the world, including through internationally integrated production as well as the increased financial 
linkages of the United States with the rest of the world.
