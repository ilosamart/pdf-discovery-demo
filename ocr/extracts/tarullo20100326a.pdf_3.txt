Program.  And the Federal Reserve had established a number of lending programs to 

provide liquidity to financial institutions in addition to its aggressive monetary policy 

actions.   

 Despite these actions, a great deal of uncertainty remained about future bank 

losses and solvency, which was only increased by the rapidly deteriorating 

macroeconomic conditions in early 2009.  The Treasury determined that confidence 

could best be restored by making additional capital available to banks that were unable to 

raise from private sources the amounts necessary for them to continue to function as 

effective financial intermediaries even if economic conditions worsened appreciably.  To 

evaluate how much capital individual institutions might require, U.S. bank supervisors, 

led by the Federal Reserve, undertook a stringent, forward-looking assessment of 

prospective losses and revenues--a stress test--for the 19 largest U.S. banks.  Using TARP 

funds, the Treasury established the Capital Assistance Program (CAP) to provide any 

needed capital. 

 Let me summarize the mechanics of the stress tests.  First, in February 2009, each 

of the SCAP banks was asked to perform a capital-adequacy stress test under two 

economic scenarios--baseline and more adverse--using specified assumptions for gross 

domestic product (GDP) growth, unemployment, and house prices.  The baseline scenario 

reflected the consensus expectation among professional forecasters on the depth and 

duration of the recession.  The more adverse scenario was designed to be severe but 

plausible, with a probability of roughly 10 to 15 percent that each of the macroeconomic 

variables could be worse than specified.  The banks were asked to provide projections of 

losses and revenues under the two scenarios.  Losses were to be projected over a two-year
