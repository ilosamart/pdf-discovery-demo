on- and off-balance sheet exposures under Basel III,6 our systemic banking institutions are 

required to meet a higher 5 percent leverage standard.  The higher leverage standard for the 

systemic banking institutions is designed as a backstop to the surcharge-enhanced risk-based 

capital standard, reflecting the higher potential losses to the system from the failure of systemic 

institutions.   

Fourth, in addition to the surcharge, regulatory minimum, and capital conservation 

buffer, starting in 2016 and phasing in through 2019, the U.S. banking agencies could require the 

largest, most complex U.S. banking firms to hold a countercyclical capital buffer of up to 

2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets when it is warranted by rising macroprudential risks. 

In sum, if the tailored capital framework that is under construction had been in place in 

2007, the largest, most complex banking institutions could have been required to hold common 

equity of up to 14 percent of risk-weighted assets on average, which is roughly double the 

amount of common equity they held at the time. 

Fifth, the crisis shined a harsh light on the severe inadequacies in the banking system not 

only in capital, but also with respect to liquidity risk management. At key moments of financial 

stress, run-like behavior in the short-term funding markets threatened the solvency of some large, 

complex banking organizations and compelled them to engage in asset fire sales.  As part of the 

enhanced prudential standards mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III liquidity 

reforms, large banking organizations are now required to maintain substantial buffers of high-

quality liquid assets calibrated to their funding needs in stressed financial conditions.  They are
