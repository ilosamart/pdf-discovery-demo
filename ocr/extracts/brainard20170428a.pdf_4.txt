Risks and Opportunities in an Increasingly Interconnected World 

There is every reason to expect financial services to make a similar transition to an 

increasingly interconnected digital world.  By now, we’ve all heard estimates of the thousands of 

fintech companies that have launched in the past few years and the billions of investment dollars 

that are flooding into this sector.7  But for all of the talk of “disruption,” I want to underscore an 

important point:  More often than not, there is a banking organization somewhere in the fintech 

stack.  Just as third-party app developers rely on smartphone sensors, processors, and interfaces, 

fintech developers need banks somewhere in the stack for such things as: (a) access to consumer 

deposits or related account data, (b) access to payment systems, (c) credit origination, or 

(d) compliance management.8  For instance, account comparison services rely on access to data 

from consumers’ bank accounts.  Savings and investment apps analyze transactions data from 

bank accounts to understand how to optimize performance and manage the funds consumers hold 

in those accounts.  Digital wallets draw funds from payment cards or bank accounts.  

Marketplace loans most often depend on loan origination by a bank partner.  And payment 

innovations often “settle up” over legacy payment rails, like the automated clearinghouse

the lending sector alone, Goldman Sachs estimates that $11 billion of annual profit is at risk of leaving the banking 
system.  Ryan M. Nash and Eric Beardsley, The Future of Finance Part 1: The Rise of the New Shadow Bank (New

Company estimates that there are over 2,000 fintech startups, which have attracted nearly $23 billion of venture 
capital and growth equity over the past five years. See Miklos Dietz, Somesh Khanna, Tunde Olanrewaju, and
