    Figure 1.  Real−Time Projections of Longer−Run Normal Values

     Note: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) data are quarterly, extend through June 2018, and are projections of longer−term normal. The Blue Chip          
data are biannual, extend through June 2018, and are projections for 6 to 10 years in the future.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) data are biannual and 
extend through August 2018. For the left two panels, the projections are for 10 years in the future; the right panel shows the natural rate projection for the current 
quarter at the time of the projection.  The neutral real interest rate is the three−month Treasury bill rate projection (Blue Chip and CBO) or the federal funds rate          
projection (FOMC) minus the source’s inflation projection. GDP is gross domestic product.

     Correction: In the original figure, CBO potential output growth as of August 2018 was incorrectly reported; the value has been corrected to 1.8 percent.
