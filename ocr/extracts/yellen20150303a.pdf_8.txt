our international colleagues to ensure that standards for systemically important financial 

firms are raised globally as well.  We have made significant progress on our regulatory 

reform agenda both domestically and internationally, but we still have work to do. 

I will briefly describe five regulatory changes that have been among the most 

important in helping the Federal Reserve improve its oversight of the largest institutions. 

First, all banks are required to hold significantly more capital, with higher 

standards applied to the largest, most systemically important firms.  Second, large 

institutions have also been required to substantially increase their liquidity.  The blueprint 

for these higher capital and liquidity standards is an international agreement known as 

Basel III, which establishes minimum standards for internationally active banks around 

the world; the United States, however, has gone even further to raise capital requirements 

for the largest firms.  Third, large firms are now required to show that they can continue 

to operate safely and serve their customers in stressful conditions similar to those that 

occurred during the crisis, an exercise known as stress testing.  Fourth, under the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), Congress 

authorized a new regime, known as “resolution,” to manage the failure of large firms in 

an orderly manner and reduce the chances that such a failure would threaten financial 

stability.  The Congress empowered the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) to require large firms to develop resolution plans.   

The fifth and final regulatory change I want to mention is that the Dodd-Frank 

Act also gave the Federal Reserve more explicit responsibilities for safeguarding 

financial stability.  As applied to large institutions, more stringent capital requirements
