The second principle reflected in recent changes to stress testing is simplicity.  

One important proposal—what we are calling the stress capital buffer—would simplify 

the Fed’s large bank capital rule by integrating the stress testing process with our 

traditional regulatory capital rules.  Our regulatory capital rule includes both minimum 

capital requirements and a buffer that sits on top of those minimum requirements.  The 

buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to supervisors, and it requires the firm to 

reduce its capital distributions as the firm approaches the minimum requirements. 

Integrating these two standards is a natural evolution of CCAR away from its origins 

during the crisis, when such tailoring was impractical and policy makers had not yet 

considered the approach of a regulatory capital buffer on top of a regulatory capital 

minimum.  The stress capital buffer would result in a more transparent and simplified 

system of regulatory capital requirements because a firm will be held to a single, 

integrated capital regime. 

The stress capital buffer would not reduce the stringency of the regulatory capital 

framework for large banks, but it would effect a substantial simplification of that 

framework.  By my math, the number of different capital requirements applicable to large 

banks would fall from 18 to eight and the number of different total loss absorbing 

capacity requirements for large banks would fall from 24 to 14.  I expect that we will 

move forward with a revised stress capital buffer proposal in the near future, reflecting 

many of the comments received on our original proposal. 

The third principle addressed by the recent changes is volatility.  When I think 

about volatility in stress testing, I want to distinguish what I consider to be useful 

variation in the tests, in the form of exploration of salient risks, from what I consider to
