The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: 

Overview of Results 

May 7, 2009 
I. Introduction and Summary 
A banking organization holds capital to guard against uncertainty. Capital reassures an 
institution's depositors, creditors and counterparties--and the institution itself--that an event such as an 
unexpected surge in losses or an unanticipated deterioration in earnings will not impair its ability to 
engage in lending to creditworthy borrowers and protect the savings of its depositors. During this 
period of heightened economic uncertainty, U.S. federal banking supervisors believe that the largest 
U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) should have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow 
them to meet the credit needs of their customers in a more severe recession than is anticipated. For 
this reason, the Federal Reserve and other bank supervisors embarked on a comprehensive 
simultaneous assessment of the capital held by the 19 largest U.S. BHCs in February of this year. 
This unprecedented exercise-known as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)-
allowed supervisors to measure how much of an additional capital buffer, if any, each institution would 
need to establish today to ensure that it would have sufficient capital if the economy weakens more 
than expected. Those BHCs needing to augment their capital coming out of this assessment will have a 
month to design a detailed plan, subject to supervisory approval, for the steps they will take to put the 
SCAP buffer in place, and then implement that plan by early November of this year. 
The unprecedented nature of the SCAP, together with the extraordinary economic and financial 
conditions that precipitated it, has led supervisors to take the unusual step of publically reporting the 
findings of this supervisory exercise. The decision to depart from the standard practice of keeping 
examination information confidential stemmed from the belief that greater clarity around the SCAP 
process and findings will make the exercise more effective at reducing uncertainty and restoring 
confidence in our financial institutions. To this end, a detailed white paper on the SCAP data and 
methodology was released on April 24th 1 [Footnote 1. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(2009) "The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation" white paper (Washington 
DC: Board of Governors, April 24). http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20090424a.htm.

This companion paper reports—for each of the 19 institutions individually and in the aggregate 
—the SCAP estimates of losses and loss rates across select categories of loans and securities; the resources 
available to absorb those losses; and the resulting necessary capital buffers. 
There are a number of points to keep in mind when interpreting the SCAP findings: 
• The estimates reported here are those of the teams of supervisors, economists, and analysts that 
conducted this exercise, and they may or may not line up with what the firms themselves or 
external analysts and researchers might have produced, even using a similar set of basic 
assumptions. These estimates benefit from the input of extremely detailed information 
collected from each of the 19 BHCs, the extensive review and analysis of that information by the
