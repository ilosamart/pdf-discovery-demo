40 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

devoted one of its five sessions to the question of defining identity theft.29 Variations in 
the definition of identity theft result in varying assessments of its frequency and 
significance. 

Discussions at the Philadelphia conference showed that law enforcement agencies usually 
employ what might be called a broad definition of identity theft. Such a definition 
encompasses any misconduct in the use of a consumer’s identifying information, 
including the theft or misuse of credit cards or card numbers, but it also includes frauds 
involving employment, government documents, and telecommunications and utilities. 
Under a definition of this kind, frauds arising from lost credit cards, inappropriate use of 
credit cards by relatives, or even the use of cards after a wallet theft or purse snatching 
could be considered identity theft. For law enforcement agencies, credit card fraud is 
sometimes associated with a violent robbery but usually not, and the subtleties of a 
narrower definition of identity theft are not typically necessary for their purposes. 

In contrast, financial institutions often use a narrower definition of identity theft that 
focuses on the acquisition of new credit accounts or the takeover of existing accounts by, 
for example, making unauthorized changes to the addresses on accounts and applying for 
new credit cards or personal identification numbers (PINs). Under this narrower 
definition, traditional payment fraud, such as fraud resulting from lost, stolen, or misused 
credit cards or card numbers, is not identity theft. Financial institutions prefer this 
narrower definition because their security forces and procedures employ different fraud-
prevention techniques to counteract different types of fraud-related behaviors. For 
financial institutions and their security officials, preventing “identity theft” under their 
definition involves controls on procedures when opening new accounts or changing 
consumer information such as addresses on existing accounts. On the other hand, 
traditional payment fraud is controlled by other means, such as requiring PINs at 
automated teller machines or using computer programs to monitor accounts for signs of 
unusual activity. 

Attending to the details of the definition are important because the different definitions 
produce substantially different estimates of the volume of identity theft. The Consumer 
Sentinel database developed and maintained by the FTC makes available to law 
enforcement agencies complaints about fraudulent activities received by the FTC and 
more than 100 other organizations.30 Under a broad definition of identity theft, this 
source suggests that about 42 percent of complaints of fraud posted to the database in 
2003 consisted of identity theft. The majority of these involved telephone or utilities 
fraud, employment fraud, government documents fraud, and other bank fraud. The
