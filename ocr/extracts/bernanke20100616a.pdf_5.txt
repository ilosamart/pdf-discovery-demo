major financial firms--including investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman 

Brothers and large insurance companies like American International Group--were able to 

avoid robust comprehensive supervision.  In the future, all firms that present systemic 

risks--regardless of whether they happen to own an insured depository institution--must 

be subject to a common, comprehensive framework of supervision and regulation.  The 

financial reform bills that were passed in both the House and the Senate would expand 

and strengthen consolidated supervision of firms whose failure would pose risks to the 

financial system. 

The report recommends that a single systemic regulator be assigned responsibility 

for overseeing the health of the overall financial system and, in particular, that this duty 

be assigned to the central bank.  We agree that the central bank--in the United States, the 

Federal Reserve--should be extensively involved in the collective effort to promote 

financial stability.  The reasons for this involvement include the central bankâ€™s breadth of 

expertise and its traditional roles in promoting financial stability and serving as a 

backstop liquidity provider to the financial system.  However, giving all macroprudential 

responsibilities to a single agency risks creating regulatory blind spots, as--in the United 

States, at least--the skills and experience needed to oversee the many parts of our 

complex financial system are distributed across a number of regulatory agencies.  Rather 

than concentrating all macroprudential authorities in a single agency, we prefer that all 

regulators be required to routinely factor macroprudential considerations into their 

supervision, thus helping ensure that risks to financial stability can be addressed 

wherever they arise.
