Pervasive and Problematic 

When the British Bankers’ Association standardized LIBOR in the 1980s for use 

in interest rate products, I doubt that anyone could have imagined how pervasive it would 

eventually become.  As I mentioned, there are an estimated $300 trillion in LIBOR 

contracts, roughly half which reference dollar LIBOR.  In the United States, dollar 

LIBOR is the reference rate used in most interest rate swaps and futures contracts, in 

most floating-rate mortgages, in many commercial loans, and in structured products such 

as mortgage- and asset-backed securities.  The list could go on and on, but the key point 

is that LIBOR touches a large number of U.S. households and businesses. 

Although LIBOR is currently used for all of these purposes, it is actually not 

ideally suited for some of them.  LIBOR is designed to measure the costs of bank 

borrowing for a panel of large banks.  The rate can be decomposed into a component that 

reflects the general level of risk-free rates and a component that reflects a risk premium 

related to the credit risk of the borrowing bank.  During the global financial crisis, the 

credit risk component of LIBOR fluctuated dramatically, which meant that LIBOR 

behaved quite differently from rates with no credit risk embedded in them, such as risk-

free rates.   

LIBOR is a less-than-ideal rate for most derivatives contracts and secured 

borrowing because movements in the credit risk component do not reflect well the 

underlying risks of those contracts.  However, LIBOR’s pervasiveness has become self-

reinforcing.  Firms use LIBOR in contracts, even when it is less than ideal, because they 

know they can hedge the resulting risk using highly liquid, LIBOR-based interest rate 

swaps or other derivatives contracts.  And those derivatives markets are so liquid because
