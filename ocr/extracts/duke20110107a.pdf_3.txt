 On a positive note, the recent news on production and spending offers some 

encouragement that the expansion may be gaining traction.  Manufacturing production, 

which rebounded sharply during the first year of the recovery, has continued to expand at 

a solid rate in recent months.  Importantly, while earlier gains in factory production were 

supported largely by the rebuilding of business inventories, the recent increases represent 

a strengthening in domestic demand for domestically produced goods.  Moreover, with 

the recovery in economic activity abroad, exports have also been providing a boost to our 

manufacturing sector.  

  Consumer spending, which rose at only a modest rate in the first year of the 

recovery, has strengthened in recent months.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 

adjusted for inflation, increased at an annual rate of 3-3/4 percent between June and 

November, with sales increasing across a relatively broad range of consumer goods and 

services.  The pickup included an increase in purchases of autos and light trucks that, in 

turn, prompted automakers to increase their assembly schedules for early this year.  And 

while we donâ€™t have December data yet, initial reports of holiday spending have been 

strong. 

Nonetheless, even with the recent pickup, consumer spending has not provided its 

usual cyclical boost to the recovery, as households have been restrained by the substantial 

loss of wealth they sustained during the financial crisis, persistently high unemployment, 

and reduced availability of credit.  The good news is that some of these restraints have 

been easing:  Rising stock prices have been helping rebuild household wealth, the ratio of 

debt to income has come down, and delinquency rates on consumer loans have been 

falling.  The supply of consumer credit has also improved somewhat over the past year,
