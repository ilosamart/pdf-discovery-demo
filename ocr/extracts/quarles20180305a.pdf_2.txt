Thank you very much to the Institute of International Bankers for inviting me to speak 

here today.  Among my first areas of focus when I was a very young lawyer starting out in my 

career well over 30 years ago was providing advice to foreign banks and financial firms 

operating in the United States, and I learned then just how integral, essential, and welcome a part 

your firms play in our domestic financial sector.  Non-U.S. firms serve as an important source of 

credit to U.S. households and businesses and contribute materially to the strength and liquidity of 

U.S. financial markets, so it is critical--not just as a matter of fairness but as a matter of our 

domestic interest--that we as regulators ensure that they operate in a fair and open financial 

services sector.  I view that as an important part of my job.  

So today I want to share my perspective on the appropriate regulatory environment for 

foreign banks operating in the United States, as well as some thoughts on specific elements of 

that regime.  Before doing that though, we should take stock of the pre-crisis history of foreign 

firms operating in the United States.   

First, the financial crisis revealed that in times of stress, international banking firms with 

large and complex local operations can contribute to instability in those local markets and can 

require extraordinary support from local authorities.  Second, a number of foreign financial 

institutions expanded the size and complexity of their U.S. operations at a rousing pace and scale 

prior to the crisis, and we did not adjust our local regulatory and supervisory approaches to 

address the increased risk associated with this expansion.  As a result, the difficulties faced by 

the U.S. operations of non-U.S. banks during the crisis mirrored that of their similarly sized 

domestic counterparts, underscoring a need for increased resiliency of both domestic firms and 

the U.S. operations of foreign banks.
