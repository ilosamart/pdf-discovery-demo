When I was asked to participate on this panel in the middle of last year, the 

prevailing metaphor regarding Federal Reserve balance sheet policy was “as boring as 

watching paint dry.”  Well, times have changed, and I commend the conference 

organizers for their foresight.  Today I would like to discuss some of the recent decisions 

that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made regarding the balance sheet 

and lay out a rough framework for some further issues that are on the horizon.1 

In January, after much discussion, including in previous meetings, the FOMC 

announced its intent to continue operating in a framework of ample reserves.2  In this 

regime, active management of the reserve supply is not needed.  The Federal Reserve 

controls the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates primarily 

through the use of administered rates, including the rate paid on reserve balances and the 

offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements.  This regime is sometimes 

referred to as a floor system, because the administered rates place a floor under the rate at 

which banks and others will lend in the federal funds market.  In adopting this 

framework, the Committee stated its intention to continue operating as it has for the past 

decade.   

The announcement was an important step in our normalization process.  And we 

are now set up to make further decisions on the eventual size and composition of our 

balance sheet.  Before providing more context on those decisions, let me first provide a
