review is to evaluate and assess ways in which our existing framework might be 

improved so that we can best achieve our dual mandate objectives on a sustained basis.  

That said, based on the experience of other central banks that have undertaken similar 

reviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not a revolution, in the way that 

we conduct monetary policy. 

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and 

price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.  The 

unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent 

objective.  We want to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our 

statutory goals in coming years.  In addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy tools 

and enhanced its communication practices in response to the Global Financial Crisis and 

the Great Recession, and the review will evaluate these changes.  Furthermore, the U.S. 

and foreign economies have evolved significantly since the experience that informed 

much of the pre-crisis approach. 

Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the 

United States and abroad.3  Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to 

persist for years.  The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, 

including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in 

technology growth.  These factors’ contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of 

their precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important.  All 

else being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy
