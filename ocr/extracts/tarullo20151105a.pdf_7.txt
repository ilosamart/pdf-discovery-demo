demand, or most needed to relieve stress, and minimizes compliance costs.  However, as has 

often been pointed out, the home country regulator will be most responsive to the impact of both 

regulation and distress of its banks on its own market.  In its regulatory and resolution activities, 

it is likely to undervalue the potential risks and costs for host countries.  In periods of stress, the 

home country regulator, accountable primarily to home country legislators or government 

officials, may concentrate on stabilizing its own financial markets and be more inclined to allow, 

or even demand, a sharp reduction in activity abroad.  The result would, at a minimum, be an 

abrupt decrease in intermediation at particularly sensitive times.  At worst, foreign operations 

could default on obligations and exacerbate financial stress.3   

 At first glance, it might seem that the home country and global regulatory approaches 

would yield similar substantive results, since in each case, there would be consolidated 

regulation and supervision.  A global regulator, however, would at least in theory take the 

interests of all jurisdictions into account in regulating, supervising, and resolving a global bank.  

Of course, how to balance those interests--particularly in the face of unanticipated 

circumstances--would be a difficult, and almost invariably political, judgment.  This reality 

raises the thorny issue of the accountability of a global regulator. 

The political factor is one of many reasons why jurisdictions are likely to remain 

unwilling to cede much authority to global, as opposed to international, financial institutions.  

                                                 
3 Mindful of the considerations lying behind the limitations of both models, Dirk Schoenmaker has offered his 
theory of the “financial trilemma,” which states that a jurisdiction can only have two of the three objectives of a 
stable financial system, international banking, and national regulatory policies. Professor Schoenmaker introduced 
his theory at a conference in 2008 and subsequently formalized it in Dirk Schoenmaker (2011), “The Financial 
Trilemma,” Economics Letters, vol. 111 (April), pp. 57–59; and Dirk Schoenmaker (2013), Governance of 
International Banking: The Financial Trilemma (Oxford: Oxford University Press). See also Richard J. Herring
