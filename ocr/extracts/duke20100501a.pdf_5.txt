o The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that median earnings for all women are 

$638 a week, compared to $798 for men--approximately 80 percent of what 

men earn on average.3  

o The Department of Labor reported in 2008 that less than half of working 

women participated in a pension or retirement plan. 

o Women are more likely to work in part-time jobs that don’t offer retirement 

plans.  

o The typical woman spends 10 years out of the workforce for caregiving, while 

the typical man spends just 2 years out of the workforce;  

 Nearly two-thirds of U.S. women ages 40 to 79 have already dealt with a major 

financial “life crisis,” such as job loss, divorce, the death of a spouse, or serious 

illness.4

compared to 38 percent in 1970.  While the overall civilian unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, the 

unemployment rate for women 20 years and older is 8.0 percent.5  And nearly one-third of 

married women workers now out-earn their husbands.
