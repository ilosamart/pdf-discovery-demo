is a nationally representative selection of 500 respondents. 

over the preceding six months. Only a small proportion of either group reported that the 
number of prescreened solicitations received per month during this period was one or 
zero. 

The survey also asked respondents about opting out of prescreened solicitations. About 
21 percent of respondents who have a credit card had heard of the opt-out law, and about 
20 percent of that group chose to opt out. Multiplying these proportions yields about 4 
percent of respondents with credit cards who said they had placed their names on the opt-
out list. Likewise about 17 percent of respondents who do not have a credit card had 
heard of the opt-out law, and about 33 percent of that small group chose to opt out. 
Multiplying these proportions yields about 5 percent of respondents without credit cards 
who said they had opted out. An opt-out rate of 4â€“5 percent is approximately the same 
(small) proportion of opt outs indicated by the CRA files. Because the survey found that 
only about 20 percent of consumers are aware of their right under federal law not to 
receive prescreened solicitations, it seems that if awareness of this right were higher, 
more consumers would opt out. 

For consumers who are aware of the law, a larger proportion of those with credit cards 
than those without credit cards (38 percent versus 14 percent) said that they had thought 
about placing their names on the list but had not yet done so. Although thinking about an 
action is not the same as undertaking it, this outcome is not inconsistent with the finding
