businesses, who generally do not have access to the broader capital markets and for whom credit 

extension is often based on private information acquired through repeated interactions over time.  

When existing lending relationships are broken, time may be required for other banks to 

establish and build such relationships, allowing lending to resume. 

Some banks may be overly conservative in their small business lending because of 

concerns that they will be subject to criticism from their examiners.  While prudence is 

warranted in all bank lending, especially in an uncertain economic environment, some potentially 

profitable loans to creditworthy small businesses may have been lost because of these concerns, 

particularly on the part of small banks.  Indeed, there may be instances in which individual 

examiners have criticized small business loans in an overly reflexive fashion.  As I will discuss 

later in my testimony, the Federal Reserve has worked with other bank and thrift supervisors to 

ensure that supervisory policy does not unnecessarily constrain credit to creditworthy borrowers. 

 The reduction in the availability of credit, however, is not the whole story.  There is also 

less demand for credit.  The most severe economic downturn since the Depression, resulting in 

high levels of unemployment and following significant increases in personal debt levels during 

the past decade, has suppressed demand for goods and services produced by all businesses, 

including smaller firms.  Many businesses are, in turn, reluctant to make new investments until 

they are confident that consumer demand will continue to strengthen.  Business inventories, a 

key component of gross domestic product over the business cycle, unexpectedly declined 0.2 

percent in December after rising by a revised 0.5 percent in November.  It is notable that banks 

report utilization rates of existing lines of credit to be at historic lows, despite the fact that, in 

many cases, this credit is already approved and generally priced attractively.
