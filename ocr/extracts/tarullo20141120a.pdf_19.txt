Despite this progress, and perhaps to some degree because of it, important issues remain.  

Liquidity regulation is still a relatively new undertaking, certainly in its present form that 

includes quantitative requirements.18  There is still need for conceptual work on such questions 

as how to specify the extent to which banks should be required to self-insure against liquidity 

risk by maintaining larger liquidity buffers and more closely matching assets with liabilities, and 

how to define the circumstances in which central banks should provide liquidity.   

It is also clear that liquidity regulation has the potential to generate unintended effects.  

For example, in periods of stress firms are likely to have multiple incentives to hoard 

accumulated liquidity, rather than to use it to relieve the funding needs of households and other 

firms.  The upshot would be to exacerbate systemic strains and cause a reduction in economic 

activity.  This tendency toward liquidity hoarding may be amplified by the very fact of 

quantitative liquidity requirements, since firms may fear that dipping below those levels even in 

a period of stress would project weakness to counterparties, investors, and market analysts.  That 

is, we may be more successful in enforcing the maintenance of liquid asset buffers in normal 

times for use in stress periods than we will be in encouraging their use when such a stress period 

arrives. 

For this reason we are working on a supervisory approach in which the remedy for falling 

below regulatory thresholds is context dependent.  That is, a firm that falls out of compliance 

with the LCR or NSFR during a period of generalized stress should not be subject to automatic 

18 Although, in recent decades, reserve requirements have been used to establish a stable demand for reserves for 
monetary policy implementation purposes, they were a form of liquidity requirement historically.  As originally 
constructed, they were a substantial percentage of a bankâ€™s liability base and were intended (at least in part) to 
ensure that banks could meet their obligations in a timely fashion.  (Some variations even distinguished between 
stable and volatile deposits, looking at turnover of different types of deposits to calibrate the appropriate reserve 
ratio.)
