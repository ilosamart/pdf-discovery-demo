the United States was itself aided by foreign capital at an early stage of its development.4  

That the advanced economies have achieved high standards of living, while at the same 

time embracing financial openness, suggests that such openness is likely to bring long-

term benefits for other countries as well.   

 Free capital markets support economic growth by allowing resources to move 

across borders to their most productive uses.  These flows should expand the 

opportunities for savers and, in the savings-rich countries, likely raise the return on 

domestic savings.  Capital inflows can lower the cost of capital to firms in capital-scarce 

countries, raising investment.  The result is more investment, more productive 

investment, and faster economic growth than would have occurred in the absence of such 

capital flows.  And these flows do not merely represent the wherewithal to finance 

investments--they potentially are accompanied by positive spillovers from technological 

transfer and the adoption of managerial and organizational best practices. 

 Second, opening up domestic financial markets to the rest of the world subjects 

domestic financial institutions to foreign competition.  Increased competition should 

make domestic financial institutions more efficient as well as more transparent and better 

governed.  Financial openness may also provide impetus for institutional reform within 

countries.  Such reforms might include a better legal system to enforce contracts and 

other property rights, better accounting and disclosure standards as domestic firms 

compete for foreign funds, and improved prudential supervision as domestic regulators 

observe the risk-management practices of foreign financial institutions.  In addition, some 

                                                 
4Bordo, Eichengreen, and Irwin (1999) note that in the 19th century most foreign investment in the United 
States and in other countries was directed to certain sectors of the economy, including railways, resource 
extraction, public utilities, and government.
