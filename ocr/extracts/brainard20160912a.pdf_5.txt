In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, 

and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go.  The share of 

employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained 

noticeably above its pre-crisis level.  Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force 

participation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/2 percentage points 

below its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains.  While it is possible that the 

current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot 

rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery 

in job opportunities and wages.6   

This possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth.  

Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this 

pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well 

below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7 

My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of 

accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the 

possibility of making further gains in the labor market.

7 Over the 12 months ending in August 2016, average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent.  Over the 

12 months ending in June, the employment cost index for private-sector workers also increased 2.4 percent.  

The more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of 

2.6 percent over the past eight quarters.  From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2014, these 

measures all increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent.  From the fourth quarter of 2003 to 

the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an 

average annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent.  Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available 

for this period.
