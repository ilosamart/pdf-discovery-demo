institution, about 3 percent were initiated using a personal or business credit card, and 

just 3 percent were initiated using a business loan from a bank or savings institution.  

Even smaller percentages of start-up small businesses appear to have received funding 

from credit unions, other institutions, or investors.  In short, our survey data suggest that 

the personal resources of entrepreneurs are the most important funding source for small 

business formation. 

The importance of personal resources in financing small businesses is supported 

by other recent survey evidence.  In our 2009 panel SCF, we found that families make 

loan guarantees for their businesses using personal assets as collateral, and that loans 

between business owners and their businesses are common in both directions.3  

Moreover, according to the most recently available data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 

Survey of Business Owners, 6 in 10 small business owners use personal savings or assets 

to finance or expand their businesses. 

These responses highlight the role personal wealth plays in business formation.  

Looking back at wealth outcomes in 2009, we found that 43 percent of families saw a 

wealth decline equal to or greater than six months of their usual income, and almost one-

third saw a loss greater than an entire year of the usual income.4  Such wealth declines 

would, of course, reduce the likelihood that such households would start a small business.

survey is based on follow-up interviews with participants in the 2007 SCF that update their information.
