Pro-growth policies also demand reform in the conduct of regulatory policy.  It would 

provide more timely, clear, and consistent rules so that firms--financial and otherwise--could 

innovate in a changing economic landscape.  It would allow firms to succeed or fail.  It would 

not protect the privileged perch of incumbent firms--no matter their size or scope--at the expense 

of their smaller, more dynamic competitors.  Regulators would be hostile to rent-seeking by the 

established.  And hospitable to the companies whose names we do not know. 

Finally, the creep of trade protectionism is anathema to pro-growth policies.  U.S. 

companies need access to foreign lands to grow exports.  No less important, U.S. companies are 

made better by global competition.  Adopting pro-growth trade policies would signal to the 

world that the United States is ready to resume its leading role on the world stage. 

So, how far does the economy find itself from our aspirations?  If policies could be 

moved in the right direction, we could close the gap between the new malaise and the new 

promise.  Policy need not be perfect, but it cannot be so growth-defeating.  The U.S. economy is 

capable of much more than it is delivering. 

Hence, the deleveraging by our household and business sectors is not a pattern to be 

arrested, but good prudence to be celebrated.  Larger, more liquid corporate balance sheets and 

higher personal saving rates are the reasonable and right responses to massive government 

dissaving and unpredictable government policies.  The steep correction in housing markets, 

while painful, lays the foundation for recovery--far better than the countless programs that 

sought to subsidize and temporize the inevitable repricing.  It is these transitions in our market 

economy--and the adoption of pro-growth fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies--that lay the 

essential groundwork for greater, more sustainable prosperity.
