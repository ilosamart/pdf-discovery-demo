inflation risk and liquidity premiums, as well as inflation expectations--remain extremely 

low.  For example, inflation compensation at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon is 

currently around 1.5 percent, 1-1/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to 

mid-2014.  Some survey-based measures of inflation expectations are also somewhat 

below historical norms.  Median 5- to 10-year inflation expectations in the University of 

Michigan Surveys of Consumers, for example, over the past year have been on average 

about 1/4 percentage point below the average over the 10 years from 2005 to 2014. 

Thus, although some signs point to a firming of inflation going forward, I view 

the persistently low level of inflation during the recovery together with some signs of a 

deterioration in inflation expectations as suggesting that the risks to the return of inflation 

to our 2 percent target over the medium term are weighted to the downside. 

Progress toward our goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation will depend 

importantly on solid growth in aggregate demand.  Following disappointing gross 

domestic product (GDP) growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 

this year that averaged only 1.1 percent, I have been very attentive to incoming data, 

especially on consumption, which point to a pick-up in growth this quarter.3  In 

particular, consumer expenditures rose a strong 0.6 percent in April, and auto sales edged 

higher in May.  These are encouraging signs, but the data relevant for second-quarter 

growth are still relatively sparse. 

In general, demand growth in recent quarters has benefited from a relatively 

strong household sector--buoyed by a recovering labor market, reduced oil prices, and 

                                                 
3 Growth in gross domestic income (GDI) has not slowed as much as GDP growth recently.  However, the 

average of GDP and GDI growth has still slowed recently from an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent 

from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015 to an average of 1-1/2 percent in the past two 

quarters.
