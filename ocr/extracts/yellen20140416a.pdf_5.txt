FOMC to form a more nuanced judgment about when the recovery of the labor market 

will be materially complete.  As the FOMC’s statement on longer-term goals and policy 

strategy emphasizes, these judgments are inherently uncertain and must be based on a 

wide range of indicators.3   

I will refer to the shortfall in employment relative to its mandate-consistent level 

as labor market slack, and there are a number of different indicators of this slack.  

Probably the best single indicator is the unemployment rate.  At 6.7 percent, it is now 

slightly more than 1 percentage point above the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of the 

Committee’s projections for the longer-run normal unemployment rate.  This shortfall 

remains significant, and in our baseline outlook, it will take more than two years to 

close.4   

Other data suggest that there may be more slack in labor markets than indicated 

by the unemployment rate.  For example, the share of the workforce that is working part 

time but would prefer to work full time remains quite high by historical standards.  

Similarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have 

been looking for work for more than six months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it 

remains as high as any time prior to the Great Recession.5  There is ongoing debate about 

why long-term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline

5 The share in CPS employment of persons working part time for economic reasons rose from 3 percent 
prior to the recession to 6.5 percent in November 2009, and it has since then declined only to 5 
percent.  The share in the labor force of those unemployed for more than 26 weeks rose from less than 1 
percent prior to the recession to 4.5 percent, and it has since declined to just below 2.5 percent; the previous 
peak for this series was 2.5 percent in 1983.  The records for long-term unemployed begin in 1948.
