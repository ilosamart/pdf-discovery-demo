performance, and whether community bank lending relationships in rural areas are 

fundamentally different from those in urban areas.  

Two research sessions are scheduled for tomorrow morning.  The first will 

consider community bank performance, with papers looking at the effect of financial 

derivatives on community bank profitability, the characteristics of community banks that 

recovered from significant financial distress, the effect of distance between merging 

banks on postmerger performance, and the determinants of differences in profitability 

across community banks.  The second session will consider issues of bank supervision 

and regulation, with papers discussing variations in the stringency of bank examination 

standards over time and their effect on lending, the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on 

community banks, the relationship between community bank capital ratios and the 

likelihood of failure, and an approach for rationalizing bank supervision and regulation. 

As you can see, the papers at this conference cover a variety of important topics, 

and I expect they will provoke spirited discussions among the many experts in 

attendance.  I must say that I am encouraged to see so many researchers from a wide 

range of academic and government institutions working on issues of great interest to both 

community bankers and their regulators.   

To close the conference, CSBS Chairman Charles Vice will present a report 

summarizing information gathered from more than 1,500 community bankers attending 

town hall sessions across the country over the past several months.  In addition, a panel of 

community bankers will share their own views on the state of community banking and 

prospects for the future.  

Thank you for being here.  I wish you an enjoyable and productive conference.
