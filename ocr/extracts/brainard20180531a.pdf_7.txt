The Yield Curve 

Even though longer-term Treasury yields have moved up, on net, since the 

beginning of the year, there has been growing attention of late to the possibility of an 

inversion of the yield curve--that is, circumstances in which short-term interest rates 

exceed long-term interest rates on Treasury securities.  Historically, yield curve 

inversions have had a reliable track record of predicting recessions in the United States.8  

Since 1960, there has only been one case where the 3-month Treasury yield has moved 

above the 10-year Treasury yield and a recession has not followed--in 1966.9   

This correlation between yield curve inversions and recessions might arise for a 

variety of reasons.  First, let us take a case where short-term rates rise relative to long-

term rates.  When the FOMC is undertaking a deliberate tightening in policy, short-term 

interest rates typically rise, as do expectations of short-term interest rates in the medium 

term, while interest rates in the distant future may be less affected.  For example, if short-

term interest rates were raised to stabilize temporary swings in the economy, the logic of 

the expectations hypothesis would suggest that long rates would not rise as much.  And if 

tighter monetary policy were to weaken the economy with a lag, this would lead to long 

rates not rising by as much or at all.   

Second, let us take a case where long-term rates decline relative to short-term 

rates, perhaps reflecting a flight to safety.  If market participants become concerned about 

                                                 
8 An earlier paper discussing the predictive power of the yield curve is Estrella and Mishkin (1997).  In 
more recent work, Bauer and Mertens (2018) emphasize that the predictive content of the yield curve is still 
largely intact.  Johansson and Meldrum (2018) and Favara and others (2016), however, argue that adding 
information about bond risk premiums reduces somewhat the predictive power of the yield spread. 
9 An earlier version of this speech stated that the 3-month Treasury yield did not move above the 10-year 
Treasury yield prior to the 1990 recession.  While that statement is true looking at monthly average interest 
rates, there were several days in mid-1989 when the 3-month Treasury yield was higher than the 10-year 
yield.
