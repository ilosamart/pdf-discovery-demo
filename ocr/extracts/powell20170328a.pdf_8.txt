The Board was the part of the System intended to be most directly accountable to 

the public (figure 7).  The Board is an independent agency within the federal government, 

and members of the Board--now called Governors--are appointed by the President and 

confirmed by the Senate.11  Governors serve 14 year terms that expire at 2-year intervals 

and are not linked to election cycles.  The Federal Reserve Board is charged with general 

oversight of the Reserve Banks. 

The Reserve Banks combine both public and private elements in their makeup and 

organization (figure 8).  Like the Board of Governors, the Reserve Banks operate with the 

public interest in mind.  Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve 

System are required to purchase stock in their District’s Reserve Bank.12  These shares 

are nontransferable and yield only limited powers and benefits.  Dividends are set by 

federal law.  The commercial bank shareholders elect two-thirds of the directors that 

oversee the Reserve Banks; the Board in Washington appoints the remaining one-third.  

Only three bankers can serve on a Reserve Bank’s board of directors, and only one of 

those can be from a large commercial bank in the District.  The remaining six directors 

represent the interests of the public.  The Federal Reserve System benefits enormously 

from the insights and support of the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks and their 

                                                 
11 As originally enacted, Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act required that the President, in nominating 
Board members, “have due regard to a fair representation of the different commercial, industrial and 
geographical divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, § 10, 38 Stat. 260 (1913), p. 12, 
www.federalreservehistory.org/Media/Material/Event/10-58).  In 1922, this representational requirement 
was expanded to its current form, which provides, in Section 10(1), that the President “have due regard to a 
fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical 
divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 241 as amended by an act of June 3, 1922 
(42 Stat. 620), paragraph on appointment and qualification of members, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section%2010.htm).  In addition, Section 10(1) provides that 
no two members of the Board may be from the same Reserve Bank District. 
12 All national banks chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency are required to be members of the 
Federal Reserve System, and state-chartered banks may choose to become members.
