effects that may affect broader financial stability--which occurs when banks that fund 

long-term or illiquid assets with short-term deposits from financial intermediaries like 

pension funds and money market mutual funds need to rapidly sell less-liquid assets to 

maintain their operations. 

Outside of the G-SIB surcharge framework, the Board has employed a measure of 

nonbank activities in certain rulemakings.  These activities, which are conducted outside 

of a regulated depository institution, represent another source of complexity for large 

banks.  For example, some nonbank entities engage in complex trading that is not 

permitted in depository institutions because of their risk. 

Banks with Assets Greater Than $250 Billion 

In addition to thinking about how we will tailor our regulation and supervisory 

programs for firms with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, I believe the Board 

should also review the requirements applicable to the firms with more than $250 billion 

in total assets but below the G-SIB threshold.  This review should ensure that our 

regulations continue to appropriately increase in stringency as the risk profiles of firms 

increase, consistent with our previously stated tailoring goals and the new legislation.  

The supervision and regulatory framework for these firms should reflect that there are 

material differences between those firms that qualify as U.S. G-SIBs and those that do 

not.  For example, we know that non-G-SIBs with more than $250 billion in assets are 

generally less complex and less interconnected than U.S. G-SIBs and thus pose relatively 

less risk to financial stability.  G-SIBs, on the other hand, have more complex activities, 

are more interconnected, and pose a far greater risk to financial stability should they fail.  

Yet at the moment, many aspects of our regulatory regime treat any bank with more than
