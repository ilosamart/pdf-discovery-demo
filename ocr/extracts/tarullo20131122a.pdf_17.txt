or long-term periods that include times of stress.  While minimum haircut levels should not be 

set as high as the haircuts lenders demanded at the depths of the crisis, setting numerical floors in 

proportion to those levels might be reasonable.  A third alternative would be to set numerical 

floors for SFT haircuts at levels that are commensurate with the amount of capital a banking 

organization would need to hold against the security if it held the security in inventory.  Such an 

approach could be viewed as an indirect way of extending bank capital requirements to the 

shadow banking system, and would reduce the current bank regulatory incentive to lend against a 

security rather than hold it directly.  

 Finally, it is worth noting that, while a framework of universal margin requirements for 

SFTs could not be evaded through the disintermediation of regulated entities, it might be evaded 

through the use of alternative transactional structures.  If margin requirements for cash SFT 

transactions are significantly higher than margin requirements for creating the same economic 

exposures using synthetic SFT transactions, a framework of minimum margins for SFTs could 

push market participants to rely more heavily on derivatives that are the functional equivalent of 

cash SFTs.  Moreover, market participants might attempt to arbitrage margin floors through 

arrangements whereby the lender effectively lends the SFT borrower the minimum excess 

margin amount.  These and similar issues will need to be addressed as options for minimum 

margins are further developed. 

Conclusion 

 If we think back to the rapid growth of the shadow banking system in the pre-crisis 

period, we are reminded of some glaring vulnerabilities:  Large firms that could themselves be 

considered shadow banks and that relied on the shadow banking system for a significant 

proportion of their funding--a group that included the “free-standing” investment banks--were
