intensity of resource utilization in the economy--as approximated, for example, by the 

gap between the actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the 

shortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from potential output.  This 

relationship--which likely reflects, among other things, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise 

as utilization rates increase--represents an important channel through which monetary 

policy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is 

modest and gradual.  Movements in certain types of input costs, particularly changes in 

the price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its 

trend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.17  Finally, a nontrivial fraction 

of the quarter-to-quarter, and even the year-to-year, variability of inflation is attributable 

to idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18   

What about the determinants of inflation’s longer-term trend?  Here, it is 

instructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation 

shown earlier in figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of long-

run inflation, as is done in figure 5.  Theory suggests that inflation expectations--which 

presumably are linked to the central bank’s inflation goal--should play an important role 

in actual price setting.19  Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which 

                                                 
17 Another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the 
pass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see 
Hooker, 2002; Clark and Terry, 2010). 
18 Some of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare 
reimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account.  (Both of these 
factors are included in the services component of the PCE price index, but not the consumer price index 
(CPI).)  However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant 
fraction represents unpredictable “noise.” 
19 Most theoretical versions of the Phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on short-run inflation 
expectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data 
better.
