international trade is a very positive development for the global economy; for the United 

States, improving export markets are an important reason that manufacturing has been a 

leading sector in the recovery.  Like others, we were surprised by the sharp deterioration 

in the U.S. trade balance in the second quarter.  However, that deterioration seems to 

have reflected a number of temporary and special factors.  Generally, the arithmetic 

contribution of net exports to growth in the gross domestic product tends to be much 

closer to zero, and that is likely to be the case in coming quarters.  

 Overall, the incoming data suggest that the recovery of output and employment in 

the United States has slowed in recent months, to a pace somewhat weaker than most 

FOMC participants projected earlier this year.  Much of the unexpected slowing is 

attributable to the household sector, where consumer spending and the demand for 

housing have both grown less quickly than was anticipated.  Consumer spending may 

continue to grow relatively slowly in the near term as households focus on repairing their 

balance sheets.  I expect the economy to continue to expand in the second half of this 

year, albeit at a relatively modest pace. 

 Despite the weaker data seen recently, the preconditions for a pickup in growth in 

2011 appear to remain in place.  Monetary policy remains very accommodative, and 

financial conditions have become more supportive of growth, in part because a concerted 

effort by policymakers in Europe has reduced fears related to sovereign debts and the 

banking system there.  Banks are improving their balance sheets and appear more willing 

to lend.  Consumers are reducing their debt and building savings, returning household 

wealth-to-income ratios near to longer-term historical norms.  Stronger household
