the investment-equals-saving curve.  And because we are considering the long-run 

equilibrium interest rate, we are looking at the interest rate that equilibrates investment 

and saving when the economy is at full employment, as it is assumed to be in the long 

run.    

I will look at four major forces that have affected the balance between saving and 

investment in recent years and then consider some that may be amenable to the influence 

of economic policy.   

The economy’s growth prospects must be at the top of the list.  Among the factors 

affecting economic growth, gains in productivity and growth of the labor force are 

particularly important.  Second, an increase in the average age of the population is likely 

pushing up household saving in the U.S. economy.  Third, investment has been weak in 

recent years, especially given the low levels of interest rates.  Fourth and finally, 

developments abroad, notably a slowing in the trend pace of foreign economic growth, 

may be affecting U.S. interest rates.   

To assess the empirical importance of these factors in explaining low long-run 

equilibrium interest rates, I will rely heavily on simulations that the Board of Governors’ 

staff have run with one of our main econometric models, the FRB/US model.  This 

model, which is used extensively in policy analyses at the Fed, has many advantages, 

including its firm empirical grounding, and the fact that it is detailed enough to make it 

possible to consider a wide range of factors within its structure.    

Going through the four major forces I just mentioned, I will look first at the effect 

that slower trend economic growth, both on account of the decline in productivity growth 

as well as lower labor force growth, may be having on interest rates.  Starting with
