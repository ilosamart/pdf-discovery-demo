models, such as the workhorse new-Keynesian model, did not predict the crisis, nor did 

they incorporate very easily the effects of financial instability. Do these failures of 

standard macroeconomic models mean that they are irrelevant or at least significantly 

flawed?  I think the answer is a qualified no.  Economic models are useful only in the 

context for which they are designed.  Most of the time, including during recessions, 

serious financial instability is not an issue.  The standard models were designed for these 

non-crisis periods, and they have proven quite useful in that context.  Notably, they were 

part of the intellectual framework that helped deliver low inflation and macroeconomic 

stability in most industrial countries during the two decades that began in the mid-1980s. 

That said, understanding the relationship between financial and economic stability 

in a macroeconomic context is a critical unfinished task for researchers.  Earlier work that 

attempted to incorporate credit and financial intermediation into the study of economic 

fluctuations and the transmission of monetary policy represents one possible starting 

point.  To give an example that I know particularly well, much of my own research as an 

academic (with coauthors such as Mark Gertler and Simon Gilchrist) focused on the role 

of financial factors in propagating and amplifying business cycles.  Gertler and Nobuhiro 

Kiyotaki have further developed that basic framework to look at the macroeconomic 

effects of financial crises.13

  More generally, I am encouraged to see the large number of 

recent studies that have incorporated banking and credit creation in standard 

macroeconomic models, though most of this work is still some distance from capturing
