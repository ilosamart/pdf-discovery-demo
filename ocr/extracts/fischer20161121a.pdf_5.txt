I will conclude by reiterating one aspect of the low interest rate and low 

productivity growth problems that I have mentioned previously--the fact that, for several 

years, the Fed has been close to being “the only game in town,” as Mohamed El-Erian 

described it in his recent book.5  But macroeconomic policy does not have to be confined 

to monetary policy.  Certain fiscal policies, particularly those that increase productivity, 

can increase the potential of the economy and help confront some of our longer-term 

economic challenges.  While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies 

would be, some combination of improved public infrastructure, better education, more 

encouragement for private investment, and more effective regulation all likely have a role 

to play in promoting faster growth of productivity and living standards.  By raising 

equilibrium interest rates, such policies may also reduce the probability that the economy, 

and the Federal Reserve, will have to contend more than is necessary with the effective 

lower bound on interest rates.
