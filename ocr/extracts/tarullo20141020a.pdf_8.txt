“monitor adherence to the original product approval criteria, especially where the product is 

growing rapidly and/or is generating extraordinary profits.” 

These particular ideas may or may not be best for specific firms.  The point, though, is 

that some concrete organizational systems are needed for firms to carry into effective action the 

goals or values that they nominally espouse. 

Before leaving this topic, I want to observe that regulators can unwittingly reinforce what 

I have termed a mere compliance mentality.  I would first note that the detail of many regulations 

means that attention to narrow issues of compliance is sometimes wholly understandable and, 

indeed, essential.  Banks, like other regulated entities, need to be able to determine how a 

regulation actually applies to them.  Beyond that kind of unavoidable focus on narrow 

compliance, however, management and line employees are more likely to adopt a mere 

compliance mentality where regulations appear to them to have been poorly drafted or 

implemented.   

Sometimes this too is unavoidable, since regulators may simply conclude that the public 

interest requires a form of regulation opposed by the firm and most of its employees.  Sometimes 

regulated firms are really complaining about the type or purpose of regulation, even when they 

say they are only criticizing its specifics.  But in cases where those inside a firm would stipulate 

the stated objective of the regulation and still find a regulation badly conceived or implemented, 

there will be less possibility of internalization or integration into a broader set of firm norms and 

expectations.  This is an outcome that regulators can avoid, and something with which the 

regulated firms themselves can assist by pointing out what they would regard as more sensible 

methods for achieving stated regulatory purposes.
