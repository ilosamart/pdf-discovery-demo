Shifting Stars during Normalization     

In December 2013, the FOMC began winding down the final crisis-era asset 

purchase program.  Asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in December 2015, 

the FOMC began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day.  As 

normalization has proceeded, FOMC participants and many other private- and public-

sector analysts regularly adjusted their assessments of the stars (figure 1).  Many 

projections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as 

did assessments of the neutral interest rate.  Estimates of the potential growth rate of GDP 

slipped about 1/2 percentage point.   

These changing assessments have big implications.  For example, the 1 

percentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was 

considerably closer to its longer-run normal and, hence, that policy was less 

accommodative than thought at the beginning of normalization.  The 1 percentage point 

fall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million more 

people would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer-run level.  These shifts in the 

stars generally reflect analysts’ attempts to square their estimates with arriving 

macroeconomic data.  For example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then 

below, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up.  When inflation 

instead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than 

previously thought.  Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one might 

have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well-known 

relationship between output and unemployment known as Okun’s law.  Put another way, 

labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether
