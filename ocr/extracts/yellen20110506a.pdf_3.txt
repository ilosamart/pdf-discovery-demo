concerns about potential overheating and leading authorities in a number of countries to 

impose capital controls in an attempt to manage these flows.   

 As I will discuss today, these issues are complicated, but I continue to believe that 

open capital markets offer significant benefits in terms of greater efficiency and improved 

standards of living, and that they represent a long-run goal to which policymakers should 

remain committed.  That said, recent experience suggests that reaping the full benefits of 

capital mobility requires prerequisites, including a sound legal and institutional 

infrastructure, solid prudential supervision and regulation, and appropriate incentives for 

risk management by domestic financial institutions.  Suffice it to say that the achievement 

of these objectives takes time.  In the interim, countries may need to employ a variety of 

tools to effectively manage capital flows.  Such tools may include macroeconomic 

policies, exchange rate flexibility, liberalization of capital outflows, and, perhaps in some 

particularly challenging instances, constraints on capital inflows.  Nevertheless, while 

successfully managing sizable capital inflows may require a range of policy responses, 

the need to make these responses is not cause to abandon the pursuit of financial 

openness as an objective over the longer term. 

The Case for Financial Openness 

 To start off, the arguments in favor of countries being open to financial flows are 

compelling.  First, countries that open their markets to capital flows can be expected to 

reap stronger economic growth.  Indeed, the economic history of a number of small, open 

advanced economies, such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, points to a notable 

role for foreign capital, especially from the United Kingdom and the United States.3  And
