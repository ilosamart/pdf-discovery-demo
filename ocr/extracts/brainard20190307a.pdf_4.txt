projections have been revised down repeatedly more recently.2  The slowdown of foreign 

growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed, with growth likely 

running below potential for most of last year.   

Economic activity slowed noticeably in the second half of 2018 in China, where 

policymakers have been trying to achieve a balance between restraining very elevated 

levels of domestic debt, on the one hand, and maintaining strong aggregate growth, on 

the other.  The protracted trade conflict with the United States has further complicated 

that challenge.   

Concerns about Chinaâ€™s slowdown are reverberating globally, as was true in 

2015-16, although the incidence is somewhat different.  While Germany had appeared to 

be weighed down primarily by transitory factors late last year, some of the weakness in 

industrial production now appears likely to be more persistent, in part reflecting 

spillovers from China.  The euro area is also seeing slowing in some other large member 

economies.  Global weakness in trade and manufacturing has also weighed on Japan. 

The slowdown in foreign demand spills over into the United States through a 

variety of channels.  Although the dollar has weakened somewhat lately, its earlier 

appreciation and slowing foreign growth contributed to a decline in exports and a fall in 

import prices over the second half of last year.  In contrast, the recent step-down in long-

term rates and easing in the dollar have lessened pressures on yields in emerging markets 

and provided more policy space in some cases.
