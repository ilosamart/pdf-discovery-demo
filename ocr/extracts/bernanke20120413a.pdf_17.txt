Conclusion 

 The financial crisis of 2007-09 was difficult to anticipate for two reasons:  First, 

financial panics, being to a significant extent self-fulfilling crises of confidence, are 

inherently difficult to foresee.  Second, although the crisis bore some resemblance at a 

conceptual level to the panics known to Bagehot, it occurred in a rather different 

institutional context and was propagated and amplified by a number of vulnerabilities that 

had developed outside the traditional banking sector.  Once identified, however, the panic 

could be addressed to a significant extent using classic tools, including backstop liquidity 

provision by central banks, both here and abroad. 

 To avoid or at least mitigate future panics, the vulnerabilities that underlay the 

recent crisis must be fully addressed.  As you know, this process is well under way at 

both the national and international levels.  I will have to leave to another time a 

discussion of the extensive changes in regulatory frameworks, as well as the changes in 

the Federal Reserveâ€™s own organization and practices, that have been or are being put in 

place.  Instead, I will close by noting that the events of the past few years have forcibly 

reminded us of the damage that severe financial crises can cause.  Going forward, for the 

Federal Reserve as well as other central banks, the promotion of financial stability must 

be on an equal footing with the management of monetary policy as the most critical 

policy priorities.
