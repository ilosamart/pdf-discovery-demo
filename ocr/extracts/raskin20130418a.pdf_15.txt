the implications of those changes for the overall economy, are regular features of 

business cycles, then even an aggregate model without an explicit focus on distributional 

issues would capture those historical regularities.   

However, the narrative I have emphasized places economic inequality and the 

differential experiences of American families, particularly the highly adverse experiences 

of those least well positioned to absorb their “realized shocks,” closer to the front and 

center of the macroeconomic adjustment process.  The effects of increasing income and 

wealth disparities--specifically, the stagnating wages and sharp increase in household 

debt in the years leading up to the crisis, combined with the rapid decline in house prices 

and contraction in credit that followed--may have resulted in dynamics that differ from 

historical experience and which are therefore not well captured by aggregate models.  

How these factors have interacted and the implications for the aggregate economy are 

subject to debate, but I have laid out some possible channels through which there could 

be effects and that I believe represent some particularly fruitful areas for continued 

research. 

Implications for Monetary Policy 

The arguments that I have laid out suggest that paying attention to the experiences 

of different types of households may be important for the way we understand and 

interpret the macroeconomic events of the past several years.  As a consequence, these 

differential experiences may also have implications for the conduct of monetary policy.  

Arguably, the FOMC’s conduct of monetary policy in recent years has in part been 

designed to address this particular landscape.  In response to continuing low levels of 

resource utilization, the FOMC has kept monetary policy highly accommodative by
