even after our September decision, I believe U.S. monetary policy remains 

accommodative.  The funds rate is just now--for the first time in a decade--above the 

Fed’s inflation objective, but the inflation-adjusted real funds rate remains below the 

range of estimates for the longer-run neutral real rate, often referred to as r*,  computed 

from the projections submitted by Board members and the Reserve Bank presidents.   

This longer-run r*, like the natural rate of unemployment, is both unobserved and 

time varying--and thus must be inferred as a signal extracted from noisy macro and 

financial data.  That said, and notwithstanding the imprecision with which r* is estimated, 

it remains to me a relevant consideration as I assess the current stance and best path 

forward for policy.  The reason for this is because, as Milton Friedman argued in his 

classic American Economic Association presidential address, a central bank that seeks to 

consistently keep real interest rates below r* will eventually face rising inflation and 

inflation expectations, while a central bank that seeks to keep real interest rates above r* 

will eventually face falling inflation and inflation expectations.3  My own and others’ 

research suggests that the failure of the Fed to respect this principle contributed to the 

Great Inflation of the 1970s, while the incorporation of this principle into Fed policy in 

the 1990s and 2000s contributed to the achievement of stable and low inflation during 

and since those years.4  So, even though estimates of r* are imprecise, I do not believe
