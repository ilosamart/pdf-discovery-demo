importing of technologies does not happen automatically or without preparation.  For 

example, strong educational systems producing increasingly skilled workforces have 

proven crucial for climbing the technological ladder.  In the United States, substantial 

increases in educational attainment from the beginning of the 20th century through the 

period following World War II were instrumental in driving economic growth.11  

In the emerging market world, India’s information technology (IT) services 

industry has thrived in large part because of the country’s large supply of well-educated, 

English-speaking workers.  And it is not just higher education that matters.  Encouraging 

basic levels of literacy is critical as well.  Promising programs in some emerging market 

countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, provide modest amounts of money to poor families 

(generally to women) on the condition that their children attend school regularly and 

receive basic health care.  The evidence suggests that these programs enhance the quality 

of the economy’s labor force while addressing social goals such as reducing gender and 

income inequality.    

Many emerging market economies have also harnessed international trade as an 

engine of technical progress.  Openness to trade has allowed these countries to import 

state-of-the-art capital goods, and vigorous international competition has increased the 

efficiency of domestic firms and facilitated the transfer of skills and knowledge.  

International trade has also helped shift these economies away from basic agriculture 

toward manufacturing, with substantial benefits for average productivity.  These benefits 

                                                            
11 Research by Goldin and Katz (2001) emphasizes the importance of the U.S. high school system in 
driving the country’s growth during the first decades of the 20th century.  The state-supported university 
system and the educational subsidies of the G.I. Bill boosted educational attainment and growth after World 
War II.  (See, for example, Altschuler and Blumin (2009).)  It should be noted that increasing the share of 
the public budget devoted to education was advocated by the Washington Consensus.
