when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy 

still needs further monetary policy accommodation.   

Does this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional 

tools to be used again?  Not necessarily.  Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of 

the federal funds rate appears to be much lower than it was in previous decades.17  

Indeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer-run value of the neutral federal 

funds rate as only 2-3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4-1/4 percent just a few 

years ago.18  With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for 

the FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn, 

raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance 

and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation.19   

Of course, substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of 

short-term interest rates.  In this regard, there is an important asymmetry to consider.  If 

the neutral rate turns out to be significantly higher than we currently estimate, it is less
