problems at one clearinghouse could have significant effects on others, even in the 

absence of explicit operational links.  The need for strong risk management and oversight 

will only increase as we go forward. 

Conclusion 

 Clearinghouses around the world generally performed well in the highly stressed 

financial environment of the recent crisis.  However, we should not take for granted that 

we will be as lucky in the future.  Past crises, including the financial panic of 1907 and 

the 1987 stock market crash, led to significant reforms and improvements in clearing and 

settlement that paid off in subsequent periods of financial stress.  Given the growing 

interdependencies among clearinghouses, along with the new mandates for central 

clearing, now is a good time to reflect on the lessons of the recent crisis and consider 

whether further improvements are possible. 

 For more than a century, financial stability has depended on the resilience under 

stress of clearinghouses and other parts of the financial infrastructure.  As we rely even 

more heavily on these institutions in the United States and around the world, we must do 

all that we can to ensure their resilience, even as our financial system continues to evolve 

rapidly and in ways that we cannot fully predict.  In short, I think Puddâ€™nhead Wilson 

would agree that that is one important basket.
