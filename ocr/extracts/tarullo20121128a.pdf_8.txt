minimum capital levels were too low, the quality standards for required capital were too weak, 

the risk weights assigned to certain asset classes did not reflect their actual risk, and the potential 

for liquidity strains was seriously underappreciated.    

But some risks are more closely tied to the specifically international character of certain 

global banks, both here and in some other parts of the world.  The location of capital and 

liquidity proved critical in the resolution of some firms that failed during the financial crisis.  

Capital and liquidity were in some cases trapped at the home entity, as in the case of the 

Icelandic banks and, in our own country, Lehman Brothers.  Actions by home-country authorities 

during this period showed that while a foreign bank regulatory regime designed to accommodate 

centralized management of capital and liquidity can promote efficiency during good times, it also 

increases the chances of ring-fencing by home and host jurisdictions at the moment of a crisis, as 

local operations come under severe strain and repayment of local creditors is called into 

question.  Resolution regimes and powers remain nationally based, complicating the resolution 

of firms with large cross-border operations. 

The large intra-firm, cross-border flows that grew rapidly in the years leading up to the 

crisis also created vulnerabilities.  To be fair, the ability to move liquidity freely throughout a 

banking group may have provided some financial stability benefits during the crisis by enabling 

banks to respond to localized balance-sheet shocks and dysfunctional markets in some areas 

(such as the interbank and foreign exchange swap markets) and by transferring resources from 

healthier parts of the group.  Nevertheless, this model also created a degree of cross-currency 

funding risk and heavy reliance on swap markets that proved destabilizing.
