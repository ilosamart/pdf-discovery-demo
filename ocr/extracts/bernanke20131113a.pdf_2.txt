Thank you for that introduction.  Tonight marks the third time in just a little over 

three years that the Federal Reserve System has hosted a teacher town hall, and I am very 

pleased to have this opportunity to speak with educators, both those of you here in 

Washington, D.C., and those watching at Reserve Bank gatherings around the country.  I 

look forward to your questions in a few moments.  But let me begin by briefly discussing

today and in the future, a second reason to mark the centennial is the opportunity it 

affords to educate young people about the Federal Reserve and its important role in 

promoting a healthy economy and stable financial system.  When I was an educator, I
