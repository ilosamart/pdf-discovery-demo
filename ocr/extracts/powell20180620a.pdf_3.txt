Current Labor Market Conditions 

At 3.8 percent, the unemployment rate is below most estimates of its long-run 

level, which are now clustered in the mid-4s.  Many other labor market indicators also 

suggest an economy near full employment.  To name just a few, these indicators include 

an elevated level of job vacancies.  For the first time since the Labor Department began 

collecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people 

counted as unemployed.  In addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is 

elevated, a sign that workers are able to find another job when they seek one.  And 

surveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies, and that households 

perceive jobs as plentiful.   

Some other indicators are less clear.  The labor force participation rate of prime-

age workers has moved up in recent years but remains below pre-crisis levels.3  In 

addition, wage growth has been moderate, consistent with low productivity growth but 

also an indication that the labor market is not excessively tight.    

Looking ahead, the job market is likely to strengthen further.  Real gross domestic 

product in the United States is now reported to have risen 2-3/4 percent over the past four 

quarters, well above most estimates of its long-run trend.  Expansionary fiscal policy is 

expected to add to aggregate demand over the next few years.  Many forecasters expect 

the unemployment rate to fall into the mid-3s and to remain there for an extended period.  

If that comes to pass, it will mean the lowest unemployment in the United States since the 

late 1960s. 

                                                 
3 The labor force participation rate is defined as the number of people either with a job or who have actively 
looked for work within the past four weeks, as a share of the total population.  Prime-age refers to 
individuals from 25 to 54 years old.
