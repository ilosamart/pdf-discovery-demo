significant increase to already very high levels of capital, the FPC undertook a one-time 

adjustment to its other capital buffers in order to offset part of this increase.  The effect of 

the policy is that the buffer can be varied--both up and down--in line with the changing 

risks that the banking system faces over time.  This approach is an interesting deviation 

from the idea in the original Basel discussions and the framework adopted in many other 

jurisdictions, in which structural capital requirements are set at levels aimed to deliver the 

desired level of resilience, with the CCyB raised to positive values only at times when 

vulnerabilities are above normal. 

In practice, the U.K. framework appears to have provided the FPC with additional 

flexibility, as it has adjusted the CCyB with evolving financial risks associated with, for 

example, Brexit.  As I examine this experience, systems similar to the United Kingdomâ€™s, 

where the CCyB is positive during normal times, may allow policymakers to react more 

quickly to economic, financial, or even geopolitical shocks that occur amid otherwise 

normal conditions, without relying on the slow-moving credit aggregates contemplated in 

the original Basel proposal.  Moreover, this setting of the CCyB permits more gradual 

adjustments in the CCyB, especially in periods with a high degree of uncertainty about 

the level of financial vulnerabilities.  Another possible benefit of a system that has 

additional flexibility is the ability to coordinate the setting of the CCyB with the setting 

of monetary policy in situations where such coordination is valuable.  At the same time, I 

would not expect such situations to be the norm, as the objectives and governance of 

monetary policy and macroprudential policies are separate for good reasons.
