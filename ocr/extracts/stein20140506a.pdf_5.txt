So what gives?  One hypothesis is that going into the May-June period, there was 

a wide divergence of opinion among market participants as to the future of the asset 

purchase program.  In particular, however reasonable the median expectation, there were 

a number of “QE-infinity” optimists who expected our purchases to go on for a very long 

time.  And, crucially, in asset markets, it is often the beliefs of the most optimistic 

investors--rather than those of the moderates--that drive prices, as they are the ones most 

willing to take large positions based on their beliefs.  Moreover, this same optimism can 

motivate them to leverage their positions aggressively.

In this setting, a piece of monetary policy communication that merely “clarifies” 

things--that is, one that delivers the median market expectation but truncates some of the 

more extreme possibilities--can have powerful effects.  Highly levered optimists are 

forced to unwind their positions, which then must be absorbed by other investors with 

lower valuations.  This effect is likely to be amplified if the preannouncement period was 

one with unusually low volatility, as was the case in early May 2013, when the implied 

volatility on long-tenor swaptions was near historical lows.  To the extent that some of 

the optimists are operating subject to value-at-risk constraints, low volatility is likely to 

induce them to take on more leverage.  If volatility rises sharply in the wake of an 

announcement, this increase will tend to exacerbate the unwind effect. 

To be clear, I am not saying that monetary policy communications should have 

been different during this period.  Rather, the point is that in some circumstances there 

are very real limits to what even the most careful and deliberate communications strategy
