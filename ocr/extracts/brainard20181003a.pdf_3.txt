safe, efficient, and widely accessible payment infrastructure has been a crucial aspect of the 

Fed’s mission from its founding in 1913.  By creating a new core infrastructure for clearing and 

settling checks, the Fed was able to boost confidence in banks and America’s payment system, 

ensure Americans received the full value of their checks, and speed up payments.  

That was the first, but not the last, time that the Fed played a central role in transforming 

America’s retail payment system.  By the 1970s, the payment system was staggering under the 

weight of paper checks.  In 1973, Governor Jeffrey Bucher of the Federal Reserve Board 

described the exponential growth in check volume and the time-consuming and expensive 

process to clear paper checks as a “time bomb.”3  The Federal Reserve and payment system 

stakeholders faced a choice:  continue making incremental changes to manage the growing 

avalanche of checks, or look to technology to facilitate transformational change.     

Working with the private sector, the Federal Reserve chose transformation, and the effect 

was dramatic.  In partnership with the private sector, the Federal Reserve supported the 

implementation of the automated clearinghouse, or ACH system, to process payroll payments for 

individuals, bill payments for households, and vendor payments for businesses.  Before the 

advent of the ACH, it would typically take a week for an employee to be able to access the funds 

from a paycheck.  It would require first a trip to the bank during business hours to deposit the 

paycheck and then several business days for that bank to complete the time-consuming process 

of collecting the funds from the employer’s bank.4  With the advent of ACH, an employee could 

expect to access their pay from their bank on the same day it was deposited electronically by
