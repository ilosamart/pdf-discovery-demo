requirements seemed a promising way to protect the public's interest in the stability of financial 

institutions that had access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation insurance.  Capital requirements promised to provide a buffer against

of equal or greater relevance in countries with universal banking models.  Some support also 

developed for the proposition that minimum capital levels could, by maintaining a material

In the ensuing quarter century, banking regulators around the world focused considerable 

attention toward elaborating capital requirements to reflect more precisely the particular risks 

faced by a financial institution.  Capital requirements had, to a considerable extent, become the 

dominant prudential regulatory tool.  

The financial crisis showed that this concentrated, almost all-consuming regulatory focus 

on refining bank capital requirements in Basel II had come at the expense of attention to other 

risks in the financial system.  In particular, banking regulators failed to appreciate fully the 

implications of the growth--in size, leverage, and maturity transformation levels--of the shadow 

banking system for the balance sheets of commercial banks and for overall financial stability.

what this prudential instrument can achieve.  The Basel I and Basel II capital requirements relied 

almost exclusively on capital ratios that were essentially snapshots of balance sheets and thus all 

too often a lagging indicator of a bank's condition.   Declines in asset values--particularly of non-
