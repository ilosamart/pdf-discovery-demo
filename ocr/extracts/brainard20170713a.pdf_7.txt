policy to return output to potential.  If the central bank chooses to use the short-term 

interest rate as its active policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, the current and 

expected path of short-term interest rates rises, putting upward pressure on long-term 

bond yields and causing the real exchange rate to appreciate.  The stronger currency 

coupled with some initial expansion of domestic demand in turn cause a deterioration in 

real net exports.   

Turning to the effects abroad, the decline in domestic real net exports corresponds 

to an increase in foreign net exports, which will tend to boost foreign GDP, other things 

being equal.  How this affects a particular foreign economy will depend on its 

circumstances and the corresponding policy response of the foreign central bank.  In the 

case where the foreign economy is pinned at the effective lower bound, the increase in 

net exports will provide a welcome boost to aggregate demand.  By contrast, if foreign 

output is already near potential, the foreign central bank will need to respond by 

tightening policy in order to keep its economy in balance.   

Now, letâ€™s instead consider tightening through the balance sheet.  If the same 

amount of policy tightening in the country experiencing a positive demand shock is 

achieved exclusively through a reduction in the balance sheet, while keeping the policy 

rate unchanged, the exchange rate would appreciate to a smaller degree, reflecting the 

lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to the term premium than to policy rates.  

Net exports would decline by less--reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation 

and the smaller rise in domestic demand--and similarly this would result in smaller cross-

border spillovers to foreign GDP.
