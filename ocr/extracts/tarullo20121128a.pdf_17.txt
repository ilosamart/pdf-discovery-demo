in the wake of the crisis and of subsequent stresses, many foreign banks have modified their 

funding practices and business models.  In revamping our approach, we will both be guarding 

against a return to pre-crisis practices and, more generally, ensuring that foreign banking 

operations in the United States that pose potential risks to U.S. financial stability are regulated 

similarly to domestic banking operations posing similar risks. 

Conclusion 

 The imperative for change in our foreign bank regulation is clear and, indeed, mandated 

by Dodd-Frank.  Of course, I have provided only an outline of the three key measures that will 

best navigate the middle course I have suggested.  The all-important details are under discussion 

at the Board.  I anticipate that in the coming weeks we will complete our work and issue a notice 

of proposed rulemaking that will elaborate the basic approach I have foreshadowed.  I look 

forward to hearing your general reactions today and more specific feedback after the Board has 

adopted a proposed rule.
