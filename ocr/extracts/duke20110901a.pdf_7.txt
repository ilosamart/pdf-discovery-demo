4. Mortgage insurers.  Similarly, some mortgage insurers will not agree to 

reunderwrite their policies despite presumably diminished default risk after 

the refinancing. 

The common theme in all of these frictions is that, in each case, the parties to the 

transaction are applying standard risk-management tools that would normally apply to 

low- or no-equity loans--but they are applying them to risk they already own.  The 

economics of the situation suggests that if the first mortgage becomes more affordable, 

the existing risk exposure of all credit risk holders actually decreases.  Moreover, to the 

extent that more widespread refinancing reduces the overall volume of distressed 

mortgages, it likely reduces pressures on house prices which would, in turn, lead to lower 

losses on sales of foreclosed properties across all mortgage portfolios.  And finally, 

removal of barriers to refinancing would boost the impetus to recovery provided by lower 

long-term interest rates.  Thus, finding different approaches to the policies that are 

hindering refinancing would likely provide some support to the economic recovery while 

improving the circumstances of homeowners and reducing the overall level of credit risk 

borne by the various holders of the risk. 

Converting Real Estate Owned to Rental 

Let me turn now to the effect on the housing market of properties acquired by 

creditors through foreclosure, commonly called real estate owned, or REO.  An estimated 

1 million or more properties will likely pass through REO inventory in 2011, with 

another million or so per year expected in both 2012 and 2013. 

REO properties are weighing heavily on the market for owner-occupied houses in 

at least three ways.  First, REO properties increase the total inventory of properties for
