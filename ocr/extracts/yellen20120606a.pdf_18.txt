dynamics.  As a result, the economy’s equilibrium real federal funds rate--that is, the rate that 

would be consistent with full employment over the medium run--is probably well below its 

historical average, which the intercept of simple policy rules is supposed to approximate.  By 

failing to fully adjust for this decline, the prescriptions of simple policy rules--which provide a 

useful benchmark under normal circumstances--could be significantly too restrictive now and 

could remain so for some time to come.  In this regard, I think it is informative that the Blue 

Chip consensus forecast released in March showed the real three-month Treasury bill rate 

settling down at only 1-1/4 percent late in the decade, down 120 basis points from the long-run 

projections made prior to the recession. 22 

Looking Ahead 

Recent labor market reports and financial developments serve as a reminder that the 

economy remains vulnerable to setbacks.  Indeed, the simulations I described above did not take 

into account this new information.  In our policy deliberations at the upcoming FOMC meeting 

we will assess the effects of these developments on the economic forecast.  If the Committee 

were to judge that the recovery is unlikely to proceed at a satisfactory pace (for example, that the 

forecast entails little or no improvement in the labor market over the next few years), or that the 

downside risks to the outlook had become sufficiently great, or that inflation appeared to be in 

danger of declining notably below its 2 percent objective, I am convinced that scope remains for 

the FOMC to provide further policy accommodation either through its forward guidance or 

through additional balance-sheet actions.  In taking these decisions, however, we would need to 

balance two considerations.
