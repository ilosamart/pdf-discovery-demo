reinvestment activities provide a significant amount—in some cases, all—of the compensation to 

the securities lender associated with participating in the lending program.

The custodian banks all but universally provided a contractual indemnification to the 

securities lender that required them to absorb any losses to the securities lenders if the securities 

were not returned.  But the investment returns, and risk of loss on the reinvestment of cash 

collateral that would have to be returned to the borrowers of securities, generally were not 

covered by such indemnifications.  Nonetheless, a number of securities lenders seemed to 

believe otherwise, and in many cases their expectations were fulfilled as custodian banks agreed 

during the financial crisis to bear at least some of the losses from cash collateral reinvestment 

programs.  

Although the experiences of money market funds, triparty repos, and securities lending 

vary in the details, they all share a common underlying pathology:  Offering documents with 

stern warnings notwithstanding, explicit and implicit commitments combined with a history of 

discretionary support to create an assumption, even among sophisticated investors, that low-risk 

assets were free of credit and liquidity risk – effectively cash, but with a slightly higher return.  

This risk illusion led to pervasive underpricing of the risks embedded in these money-like 

instruments and made them an artificially cheap source of funding.  The consequent oversupply 

of these instruments contributed importantly to systemic risk.   

Reliance on private mechanisms to create seemingly riskless assets generally worked in 

the relatively calm years leading up to the financial crisis and, to some extent, well into the crisis.  

But, in many cases, discretionary support came into question at the time of acute financial-

market stress, precisely when it was needed most, as questions arose about the ability or

 Much of the attention devoted to securities lending in the wake of the crisis focused on the program run by AIG.  

In addition to general issues involving the reinvestment of cash collateral, AIG’s securities lending program had 

more specific and fundamental flaws that go beyond the concerns discussed here.
