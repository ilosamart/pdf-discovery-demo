It is clear, then, that consolidated supervision is not intended to displace host-country 

supervision.  Instead, as the Basel Committee has regularly noted, the two are intended to be 

complementary, so as to assure effective oversight of large, internationally active banks.  

Similarly, the stated purpose of the Basel Committee in requiring consolidated capital 

requirements is not to remove from host countries any responsibility or discretion to apply 

regulatory capital requirements, but to “preserve the integrity of capital in banks with 

subsidiaries by eliminating double gearing.”

  Likewise, and contrary to suggestions that are 

sometimes made, the capital accords and frameworks developed by the Basel Committee have 

always been explicitly minimum requirements.  They are floors, not ceilings.   

Finally, it is worth noting that, in establishing a post-crisis framework for domestic 

systemically important banks (D-SIBs), the Basel Committee made clear that a host country may 

in appropriate circumstances designate domestic operations of a foreign bank as systemically 

important for that country, even if the parent foreign bank has already been designated a global 

systemically important bank (G-SIB).

  The idea informing the newly created concept of a D-SIB 

is that an entity whose stress or failure could destabilize a domestic financial system might 

thereby indirectly destabilize the international financial system.  Thus, the D-SIB category 

carries along with it higher loss-absorbency requirements than are generally applicable to 

domestic banks, although perhaps not as high as requirements for G-SIBs.  Of course, our 

regulation for foreign banking organizations (FBOs) does not entail D-SIB designation or require 

higher than generally applicable loss absorbency.  But I cite this feature of the D-SIB framework 

that permits designation of the domestic operations of foreign G-SIBs because it reflects rather
