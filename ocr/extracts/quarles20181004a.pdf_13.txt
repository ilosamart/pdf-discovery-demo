cash checks and make loans--they also place ads in small town newspapers, donate to 

local nonprofits, and sponsor local Little League teams.  As towns lose banks and 

bankers, they also lose important local leaders.   

We will continue to conduct these listening sessions across the country 

throughout the fall.  In fact, one of these listening sessions will take place next week just 

two hours down the road in Reynolds County, Missouri.  We look forward to sharing the 

collective results of our efforts in a report that should be published in early 2019. 

 Conclusion 

To sum up, the numbers of urban and rural community banks have been declining 

over the past 20 years, but community banks continue to play an important role in both 

types of markets.  Urban and rural community banks face different challenges, but, on 

average, both seem to be faring well in the post-crisis period.  And the average rural 

banking market has not seen any decline in the number of banks or bank branches over 

recent years.  For the local areas where the availability of banking services has declined, 

we are in the process of assessing the effects of this decline on the people who live and 

work in those communities.  I look forward to continuing to engage in this area and 

monitor the developments in this most vital part of the banking ecosystem.
