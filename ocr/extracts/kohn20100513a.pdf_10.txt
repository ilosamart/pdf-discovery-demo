institutions that would potentially receive emergency discount window credit, it would need an 

ongoing and collaborative relationship with the supervisor.  The supervisor should ensure that 

any institution with potential access to emergency discount window credit maintained 

conservative liquidity policies.  The supervisor would also provide critical insight into the 

financial condition of the borrower and the quality of the available collateral and, more 

generally, whether lending was necessary and appropriate.  Most importantly, no such institution 

should be considered too big or too interconnected to fail, and any losses should be shouldered 

by shareholders and other providers of capital, by management, and, where consistent with 

financial stability, by creditors as well.     

Third, the United States needs a resolution facility for systemically important institutions 

that meets the criteria I just enunciated.  That authority must have access to liquidity to stabilize 

situations where necessary, but the fiscal authorities, not the central bank, should be the ones 

deciding whether to take on the credit risk of lending to troubled institutions in order to forestall 

financial instability. 

Fourth, transparency about unusual liquidity facilities is critical.  The public 

appropriately expects that when a central bank takes innovative actions--especially actions that 

might appear to involve more risk than normal lending operations--then it will receive enough 

information to judge whether the central bank has carried out the policy safely and fairly.  The 

required degree of transparency might well involve more-detailed types of reporting than for 

normal, ongoing, lending facilities.    

Finally, the problem of discount window stigma is real and serious.  The intense caution 

that banks displayed in managing their liquidity beginning in early August 2007 was partly a 

result of their extreme reluctance to rely on standard discount mechanisms.  Absent such
