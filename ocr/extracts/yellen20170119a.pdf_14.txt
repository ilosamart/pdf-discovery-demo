to a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation.  Other things being equal, 

this factor argues for a more gradual approach to raising short-term rates.17   

Lastly, simple rules ignore important risk-management considerations that have 

influenced the Committee’s decisions in recent years.  With the federal funds rate still 

near zero, the Committee recognizes that, should the economy unexpectedly weaken in 

the next year or two, there would likely be only limited scope to respond by lowering 

short-term rates.  But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push 

inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond 

through tighter monetary policy.  Such asymmetric risks arguably call for a more gradual 

path of rate increases than indicated by the prescriptions of a simple policy rule. 

The academic literature on policy rules has studied many alternatives to the 

Taylor rule, and the FOMC regularly reviews a number of them.18  These rules embed 

differing but valuable perspectives, and there is no consensus among central bankers or 

academics about the relative utility of various rules.  One such alternative is the 

“balanced approach” rule, illustrated by the purple short-dashed line in figure 8.  This 

rule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource 

                                                           
17 Based on estimates generated using the term-structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the 
procedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015), 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities continue to 
put considerable downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  However, this pressure is estimated to 
be gradually easing as the average maturity of the portfolio declines and the end-date for reinvestment 
draws closer.  Over the course of 2017, this easing could increase the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by 
about 15 basis points, all else being equal.  Based on the estimated co-movement of short-term and long-
term interest rates, such a change in longer-term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has 
historically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate.

inflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at
