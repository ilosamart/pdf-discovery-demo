Federal hesarve Policy with hespect to the 
Proposed International Monetary *und and Bank 
____ for Reconstruction and Development._____

(Bretton woods - June «¿8, 1945.)

Statement by Chairman Eccless
Before I was designated as a member of the American delegation 

the Boc-rd of Governors had taken no position with respect to the tentative 
plans which were then in the course oi feeing drafted as a basis for estab­
lishment of the proposed international Monetary fund and International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development. Memoers of the staff, however* had 
informally given their assistance arid advice to the members of the Treasury 
staff who were engaged in this work and had kept the Board informed. In 
addition, the proposed plans had been the subject of a considerable amount 
of discussion, both inside and outside the Federal neserve Bystem, and it 
was recognised that there had been differences of opinion among the officers 
and directors of the Federal heserve banks. From time to time the *>oard 
received communications from the Federal ¿'mbserve Banks on the subject and 
the Board*a conference with representatives oi the Presidents’ and Chair­
men’s conferences and others on June 6, 1944» brought out very clearly some 
of these different views. Following this conference, the Board in­
vited such further advice as the officers and directors of the *>ar*ks might 
wish to submit.

Towards the last of May I was advised informally by the ¿secretary 
of the Treasury that the President wished me to serve as a member of the 
American Delegation, which would attend arid participate in the United Nations 
Monetary and Financial Conference to be held at Brotton feoods, beginning 
July 1, for the purpose of considering the proposed plcois. It was mad© 
clear, as I would naturally assume anyhow, that the President's request was 
addressed to me in my official capacity as Chairman of the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve bystem in recognition of the Board’s responsibility 
as an agency of Congress in the field of national credit and monetary policy. 
Therefore, I took the matter up with the Board ¿aid it was pointed out in 
the discussion that the only reason I could present for not accepting the 
appointment would be a position on the part of the Bo^rd that it w*s opposed 
to the plan and did not want to be represented at the conference. It was 
felt, however, that this would be very difficult to explain <*nd that it would 
indicate a fundamental cleavage between the System and the Treasury.
Moreover, it would very likely result in the complete exclusion of the Board 
thereafter from any participation in the development of the plan or in its 
workings if it were put into effect. After careful consideration, the Board 
expressed the opinion that the adoption of a plan within the framework of the 
joint statement would be desirable and that 1 should attend the conference 
as a representative of the Board of Governors, at the conclusion of the dis­
cussion the Board approved my attendance at the international conference at 
Bretton Woods as a member of the American Delegation representing the Board
of Governors, accordingly, I accepted the invitation and subsequently re­ceived from the Secretary of State formal advice of the President’s approval,
