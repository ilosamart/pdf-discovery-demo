collapse proved a major source of the financial and economic stresses of the past two 

years.  Proponents of this view typically argue for a substantially greater role for 

monetary policy in preventing and controlling bubbles in the prices of housing and other 

assets.  In contrast, others have taken the position that policy was appropriate for the 

macroeconomic conditions that prevailed, and that it was neither a principal cause of the 

housing bubble nor the right tool for controlling the increase in house prices.  Obviously, 

in light of the economic damage inflicted by the collapses of two asset price bubbles over 

the past decade, a great deal more than historical accuracy rides on the resolution of this 

debate. 

 The goal of my remarks today is to shed some light on these questions.  I will first 

review U.S. monetary policy in the aftermath of the 2001 recession and assess whether 

the policy was appropriate, given the state of the economy at that time and the 

information that was available to policymakers.  I will then discuss some evidence on the 

sources of the U.S. housing bubble, including the role of monetary policy.  Finally, I will 

draw some lessons for future monetary and regulatory policies.1 

U.S. Monetary Policy, 2002-2006 

 I will begin with a brief review of U.S. monetary policy during the past decade, 

focusing on the period from 2002 to 2006.  As you know, the U.S. economy suffered a 

moderate recession between March and November 2001, largely traceable to the ending 

of the dot-com boom and the resulting sharp decline in stock prices.  Geopolitical 

uncertainties associated with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion
