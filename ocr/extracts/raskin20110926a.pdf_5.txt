accommodation also tends to raise household wealth by boosting the stock market and 

prices of other financial assets.  

With greater household wealth and cheaper borrowing rates, consumers tend to 

increase their purchases of houses, cars, and various other goods and services.  In 

response, businesses ramp up their production to meet the increased level of sales.  

Moreover, with lower costs of financing new equipment and structures, businesses may 

be inclined to increase their own spending on investment projects that they might 

previously have seen as only marginally profitable.  In the near term, firms can meet 

increased demand by resorting to temporary and part-time workers, but over time they 

have strong incentives to increase the number of regular full-time employees.  

Consequently, the monetary accommodation leads to greater job creation, though 

sometimes with substantial time lags. 

The Federal Reserve has used this policy tool aggressively since the onset of the 

financial crisis.  In particular, the federal funds rate target, which stood at 5-1/4 percent in 

mid-2007, was subsequently reduced to a range of 0 to 1/4 percentage point by the end of 

2008, and that target range has been maintained since then.  Indeed, because currency has 

an implicit interest rate of exactly zero, economists generally agree that a zero interest 

rate is the effective lower bound for the federal funds rate because investors could simply 

choose to hold cash if a central bank tried to drive short-term interest rates significantly 

below zero.  In effect, therefore, the FOMC has been deploying its conventional policy 

tool to the maximum extent possible since late 2008. 

Rather than reviewing the vast academic literature regarding the effect of 

conventional monetary policy, I will simply pose the counterfactual question:  What
