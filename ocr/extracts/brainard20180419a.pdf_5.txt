businesses, including during times of stress. Indeed, the common equity capital to risk-weighted 

assets ratio of the bank holding companies participating in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis 

and Review has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12 percent in 

the fourth quarter of 2017.3 

We now regularly conduct comprehensive stress tests of the largest banking firms to help 

ensure that their capital distribution plans are consistent with their ability to lend and withstand 

severe macroeconomic and financial stress like that observed during the financial crisis.  One 

key benefit of our stress testing program is that it promotes a dynamic forward-looking 

assessment of a bank’s capital adequacy in the face of severe stress.  It is critical to maintain a 

dynamic capital regime that anticipates rapidly changing risks and business conditions.  Without 

such a dynamic focus, there is a risk that regulators and banking institutions end up spending too 

much time looking in the rear-view mirror and not enough time looking ahead for emerging 

risks.  The stress testing capital regime applied to Fannie and Freddie before the crisis offers a 

sobering reminder of the dangers of failing to update stress tests in the face of changing market 

practices and emerging risks. 

The Federal Reserve has also imposed risk-based and leverage capital surcharges on the 

most systemic banking firms to ensure they internalize the costs their failure would have on the 

financial system and to provide an incentive to reduce their systemic footprint.  We have recently 

released a proposal for comment to introduce a “stress capital buffer” or SCB that would

risk-based capital statistics for 2009 report tier 1 common equity, and for 2017 report Basel III common equity tier
