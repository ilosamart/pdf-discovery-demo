the groups that have historically borne the brunt of downturns in the labor market.  

During recessions, the young, the less educated, and minorities are more likely to 

experience flat or declining wages, reduced hours, and unemployment.9  While this 

disparity is not a new phenomenon, dealing with a loss in labor income during the most 

recent recession was a heightened challenge to households that had mortgage obligations 

and no other forms of wealth to cushion the blow.  The adverse developments in the labor 

market added to the difficulty most households were having in repaying their existing 

debts and in accessing credit in the recession. 

These low- to middle-income households that bore the strains in both housing and 

labor markets, and had little wealth cushion, had more difficulty making payments on 

their mortgages and other consumer credit debt.  For example, among the mortgages 

originated from 2004 to 2008, almost 25 percent of those in low-income neighborhoods 

were foreclosed on or in serious delinquency as of 2011, more than twice the rate of 

mortgages originated in higher-income neighborhoods.  Higher-income households had 

also taken on debt and were affected by declines in asset prices.  But these households 

entered the recession with a larger wealth buffer and higher incomes, so they generally 

were still able to service their debts.  The sharp rise in defaults and delinquencies put 

extraordinary stress on most households’ finances, intensified the financial crisis, and 

exacerbated the effect of the initial economic shocks.  Indeed, a rapid downward spiral of 

tighter credit, declines in asset prices, rising unemployment, and falling demand caused
