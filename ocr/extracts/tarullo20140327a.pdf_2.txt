The financial crisis exposed, in painful and dramatic fashion, the shortcomings of 

existing regulatory and supervisory regimes.  In both the United States and the European Union 

(EU), the crisis also revealed some particular vulnerabilities created by foreign banking 

operations.  This evening I would like to focus on these vulnerabilities and on how best we 

should address them.   

Let me note at the outset the now commonplace observation that we have a quite 

integrated international financial system, with many large, globally active firms operating within 

a system of national government and regulation or, in the case of the EU, a hybrid of regional 

and national regulation.  I add the equally commonplace observation that there is no realistic 

prospect for having a global banking regulator and, consequently, the responsibility and authority 

for financial stability will continue to rest with national or regional authorities.

  The question, 

then, is how responsibility for oversight of these large firms can be most effectively shared 

among regulators.  This, of course, is the important issue underlying the perennial challenge of 

home-host supervisory relations. 

 Another introductory observation is that--at least in a world of nations with substantially 

different economic circumstances, different currencies, and banking and capital markets of quite 

different levels of depth and development--there will be good reason to vary at least some forms 

of regulation across countries.  Presumptively, at least, nations should be able to adjust their 

regulatory systems based on local circumstances and their relative level of risk aversion as it 

pertains to the potential for financial instability.  Although the financial systems and economies 

of the United States and the EU are more similar to one another than they are to those of many 

other jurisdictions, they are hardly identical.  Even between these two, for example, there may be

 I would add, in passing, the observation that I am not at all sure it would be desirable to have a single global bank 

regulator even if it were remotely within the realm of political possibility.
