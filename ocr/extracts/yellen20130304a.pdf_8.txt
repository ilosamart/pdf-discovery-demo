provide as much accommodation as conventional policy rules suggest would be 

appropriate, given the weakness in aggregate demand.  I’ve previously argued that, in 

such circumstances, optimal policy prescriptions for the federal funds rate’s path diverge 

notably from those of standard rules.

  For example, David Reifschneider and John 

Williams have shown that when policy is constrained by the effective lower bound, 

policymakers can achieve superior economic outcomes by committing to keep the federal 

funds rate lower for longer than would be called for by the interest rate rules that serve as 

reasonably reliable guides for monetary policy in more normal times.

  Committing to 

keep the federal funds rate lower for longer helps bring down longer-term interest rates 

immediately and thereby helps compensate for the inability of policymakers to lower 

short-term rates as much as simple rules would call for.   

I view the Committee’s current rate guidance as embodying exactly such a “lower 

for longer” commitment.  In normal times, the FOMC would be expected to tighten 

monetary policy before unemployment fell as low as 6-1/2 percent.  Under the new 

thresholds guidance, the public is informed that tightening is unlikely as long as 

unemployment remains above 6-1/2 percent and inflation one to two years out is 

projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-

run goal.

  The evidence suggests that the evolution I’ve described in the Committee’s 

forward guidance, particularly the new thresholds, has shifted the market’s view of how 

forceful the FOMC intends to be in supporting the recovery.  In the Federal Reserve Bank

 Setting the threshold above the unemployment rate’s longer-run normal level recognizes the fact that 

monetary policy affects real activity and inflation with a lag so that, assuming inflation is near the 

Committee’s long-run target, it will likely be necessary to begin the process of removing accommodation 

before the longer-run normal rate is reached.
