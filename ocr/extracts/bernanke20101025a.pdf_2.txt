Good morning.  It’s my pleasure to welcome you to this joint conference of the 

Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Our 

program over the next two days will highlight policy-oriented research on U.S. housing 

and mortgage markets.  I would like to thank the many talented people throughout the 

Federal Reserve System and at the FDIC who have worked together to make this 

conference a reality.  

Before I address the specific topics of this conference, I would like to note that we 

have been concerned about reported irregularities in foreclosure practices at a number of 

large financial institutions.  The federal banking agencies are working together to 

complete an in-depth review of practices at the largest mortgage servicing operations.  

We are looking intensively at the firms’ policies, procedures, and internal controls related 

to foreclosures and seeking to determine whether systematic weaknesses are leading to 

improper foreclosures.  We take violations of proper procedures seriously.  We anticipate 

preliminary results of the review next month.  In addition, Federal Reserve staff members 

and their counterparts at other federal agencies are evaluating the potential effects of 

these problems on the real estate market and financial institutions. 

Any discussion of housing policy in this country must begin with some 

recognition of the importance Americans attach to homeownership.  For many of us, 

owning a home signaled a passage into adulthood that coincided with the start of a career 

and family.  High levels of homeownership have been shown to foster greater 

involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, and greater 

neighborhood stability.
