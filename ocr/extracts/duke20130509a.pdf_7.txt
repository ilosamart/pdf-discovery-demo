Other factors holding back mortgage credit, however, may be slower to unwind.  

As the SLOOS results indicate, lenders remain concerned about putback risk.  The ability 

to hold lenders accountable for poorly underwritten loans is a significant protection for 

taxpayers.  However, if lenders are unsure about the conditions under which they will be 

required to repurchase loans sold to the GSEs, they may shy away from originating loans 

to borrowers whose risk profiles indicate a higher likelihood of default.  The Federal 

Housing Finance Agency launched an important initiative last year to clarify the 

liabilities associated with representations and warranties, but, so far, putback risk appears 

to still weigh on the mortgage market. 

Mortgage servicing standards, particularly for delinquent loans, are more stringent 

than in the past due to settlement actions and consent orders.  Servicing rules recently 

released by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will extend many of these 

standards to all lenders.

  These standards remedy past abuses and provide important 

protections to borrowers, but also increase the cost of servicing nonperforming loans.  

This issue is compounded by current servicing compensation arrangements under which 

servicers receive the same fee for the routine processing of current loans as they do for 

the more expensive processing of delinquent loans.  This model--especially in 

conjunction with higher default-servicing costs--gives lenders an incentive to avoid 

originating loans to borrowers who are more likely to default.  A change to servicer 

compensation models for delinquent loans could alleviate some of these concerns.
