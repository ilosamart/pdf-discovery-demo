We should not make the mistake of believing that we have put an end to financial 

crises.  We can strengthen the financial system, and reduce the frequency and the severity 

of financial crises.  But we lack the capacity of imagining, anticipating and preventing all 

future financial sector problems and crises.  That given, we need to build a financial 

system that is strong enough to withstand the type of financial crisis we continue to

handled much better than the financial crisis of the Great Depression.  But it still imposed 

massive costs on the people of the United States and those of other countries that were 

badly hit by the crisis. 

No-one should underestimate the costs of the financial crisis to the United States and 

the world economies.  We are in the seventh year of dealing with the consequences of 

that crisis, and the world economy is still growing very slowly.  Confidence in the 

financial system and the growth of the economy has been profoundly shaken.   There is a 

lively discussion going on at present as to whether we have entered a period of secular 

stagnation as Larry Summers argues, or whether we are seeing a more frequent 

phenomenon – that recessions accompanied by financial crises are typically deep and 

long, as Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff’s research implies.  Ken Rogoff calls this a 

“debt supercycle”.   

It may take many years until we know the answer to the question of whether we are in 

a situation of secular stagnation or a debt supercycle.  Either way, there is now growing 

evidence that recessions lead not only to a lower level of future output, but also to a 

persistently lower growth rate.  Some argue that it was the growth slowdown that caused
