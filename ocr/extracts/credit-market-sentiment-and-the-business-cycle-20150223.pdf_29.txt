How About Corporate Leverage?

•  Does credit-market sentiment forecasts economic activity because of its 
impact on future credit spreads?

•  Do frothy credit-market conditions forecast economic activity because 
they lead to higher corporate leverage?

•  Our approach:
• 1929-2013: control for changes in aggregate measures of corporate 

leverage
Graham, Leary & Roberts (2014)

• 1952-2013: control for changes in leverage at different points of the 
cross-sectional distribution (i.e., most highly leveraged firms)
