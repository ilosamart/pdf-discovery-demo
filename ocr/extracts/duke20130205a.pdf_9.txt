Expansion of deposit insurance during the crisis likely helped all banks retain deposits 

and may have changed competition somewhat.  Deposit insurance has now been permanently 

increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, but the unlimited deposit insurance for 

noninterest-bearing transaction accounts was allowed to expire at the end of 2012.  We are 

watching deposit movement carefully, but so far have seen little evidence of deposits moving out 

of the banking system or, as some had feared, moving from smaller banks to larger banks 

perceived as “too big to fail.”  My own expectation is that, given all of the enhanced regulatory 

requirements that apply to larger banks, those larger banks will focus their efforts on large urban 

markets and that community banks will be even more competitive and more vital to the 

economic well-being of rural, suburban, and small urban markets. 

Characteristics of Thriving Community Banks 

 Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis took a different approach to 

measuring community bank success.

  Studying banks with total assets less than $10 billion, the 

researchers attempted to identify the differences between banks that they classified as “thriving” 

and those that they classified as “surviving.”  Banks were identified as “thriving” if they 

maintained the highest supervisory rating, a composite CAMELS “1,” continuously from 2006 

through the end of 2011.

  Approximately 700 banks met this condition.  The roughly 4,500 

banks in the study that did not qualify as thriving and did not fail or merge out of existence 

during the period were classified as “surviving.”

 CAMELS is the supervisory rating system for banks and other depository institutions, used by federal and state 

banking agencies to communicate to financial institutions their assessment of the institution and to identify 

institutions that raise concern or require special attention.  CAMELS is an acronym for the six components of the 

rating system that examiners evaluate and take into account when assigning an overall composite rating: capital 

adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.  See Board of Governors of 

the Federal Reserve System (1996), Supervision and Regulation Letter 96-38, “Uniform Financial Institutions 

Rating System,” December 27, http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/1996/sr9638.htm.
