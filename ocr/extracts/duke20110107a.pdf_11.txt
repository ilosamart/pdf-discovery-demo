Committee decided to expand its holdings of securities by purchasing an additional

 After considering the costs and benefits of the action and recognizing that taking 

no action would have its own risks, I believe that the expansion of securities holdings was 

worth implementing to support the economy and make the recovery more durable.  I 

don’t want to overpromise.  This action is not a panacea.  While it is still premature to 

judge the overall efficacy of the program, I believe that by exerting downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates, it has provided and will continue to provide support for a 

vulnerable recovery.  At the same time, I believe the risks associated with this action are 

manageable, that we have the safeguards in place to monitor evolving conditions, and, 

most importantly, that we have the conviction to act when necessary.   

Based on our own research and that of others, evidence is accumulating that 

purchases of longer-term assets have been successful in exerting downward pressure on 

longer-term rates.1  Consistent with research on the effects of asset purchases, between 

August, when Chairman Bernanke in a speech first publicly suggested the Federal 

Reserve might take additional action, and November, when the action was taken, longer-
