creation of the requirement for enhanced prudential standards.vii  More fundamentally, the 

likelihood of systemic impact does not change regardless of whether firms have to meet 

enhanced capital standards.  And moral hazard is already undermining market discipline on firms 

that are perceived to be too-big-to-fail.  Higher capital standards will help offset the existing 

funding advantage for SIFIs. 

 A fourth objection is that a SIFI surcharge is unnecessary because Basel III and the 

Dodd-Frank Act have already put in place an adequate set of safety and soundness protections.  I 

have already explained that Basel III is largely a microprudential tool, which does not fill the 

important macroprudential function of containing systemic risk.  Provisions of Dodd-Frank such 

as the Volcker rule and the requirement for standardized derivatives to be centrally cleared are 

directed at specific activities believed by Congress to give rise to particular risks.  It is important 

to recognize, first, that the diminution of such risks will carry some reduction in capital 

requirements and, second, that a crucial role of capital regulation is to provide a buffer against 

loss from all activities of a banking organization.  As to the first, the cessation of proprietary 

trading and the limiting of private equity activities will directly reduce risk-weighted assets and 

thus capital requirements.  Similarly, centrally cleared derivatives will carry lower capital 

charges.   

As to the second point, the history of financial regulation over the last thirty years 

suggests that, when certain activities are restricted, firms will look for new areas in which to take 

more risk in the search for return.  Capital regulation is the supplest and most dynamic tool we 

have to keep pace with the shifting sources of risk taken by financial firms.  It is far from a 

panacea, subject as it is to arbitrage and dependent as it is on supervisory rigor.  That is perhaps 

why Congress has also required enhanced prudential standards in other areas such as liquidity,
