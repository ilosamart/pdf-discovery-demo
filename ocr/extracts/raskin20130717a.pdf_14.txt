circumvented when financial activities migrate into less regulated parts of the financial 

system, parts likely farther from the protections of deposit insurance and the lender of last 

resort. Consequently, credit extension and associated vulnerabilities can increase outside 

of the heavily regulated banking system. In our current system of financial regulation--

one that is diffuse and without a single, central regulator --the antidote to such differences 

in regulatory approach is to put a premium on a high level of cooperation and 

coordination among relevant financial regulators. 

Comprehensive financial regulation is required, but comprehensive financial 

regulation is not the same as unified financial regulation.  Looking around this audience 

today, I see evidence of the fragmented American financial regulatory system. For 

example, we have representatives of banks regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of 

the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve, many 

in tandem with state bank regulators; we have bank holding companies regulated by the 

Fed; we have broker-dealers regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we 

have exchanges regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; we have 

consumer financial products regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and 

we have insurance companies regulated by the state insurance commissioners. I could go 

on.  Needless to say, itâ€™s a complicated regulatory system. And such a fragmented 

structure itself demands unusual and extensive degrees of coordination and cooperation 

among financial regulators so as to maximize the potential for comprehensive and 

harmonized regulation. Without such coordination and cooperation, there will be 

regulatory gaps and overlaps.
