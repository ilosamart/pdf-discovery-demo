the Banking Act of 1933, which did not use the terms “financial stability” or “systemic risk,” but 

which specified the Glass-Steagall rule separating commercial from investment banking, limited 

transactions of banks with their affiliates, and established the federal deposit insurance system to 

prevent banking runs and panics.  While statutory modifications and considerable administrative 

implementation of course followed over the years, the key elements of the regulatory scheme for 

financial stability were contained within the original legislation itself.   

 In contrast, there are relatively few Dodd-Frank provisions that more or less directly 

effect the policy changes intended to reduce risks to financial stability.  Even the so-called 

Volcker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading by banks, bank holding companies, and their 

affiliates,3 will require considerable regulatory build-out before its constraints will be clear. 

Provisions that require only modest administrative interpretation, such as the limit on 

acquisitions that would bring a financial firm’s consolidated liabilities to more than 10 percent of 

the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies,4 are not central elements of the 

legislation.  At the risk of some oversimplification, one can classify most uses of the financial 

stability concept in Dodd-Frank into four categories: (1) as a goal for a new regulatory authority, 

(2) as an instruction for ongoing analysis and monitoring, (3) as a direct legal standard, and (4) 

as a factor for consideration in decisions on applications for various proposed actions subject to 

regulatory approval.    

First, financial stability is used as a stated goal motivating a new regulatory or 

supervisory authority without itself being the standard used in the realization of that authority.  

For example, Dodd-Frank reverses the restrictions that Gramm-Leach-Bliley placed on the 

powers of the Federal Reserve Board to examine subsidiaries of bank holding companies 

regulated by other agencies by referring explicitly to the Board’s need to be informed of risks
