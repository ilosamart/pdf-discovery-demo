in to assume the liquidity risk of such assets--that is, the risk that assets can only be sold in the 

near term at fire sale prices.  And their ability to substitute for private-sector intermediation in a 

panic is unlimited since they create reserves.  For the most part, the Federal Reserve priced these 

facilities to be attractive when markets were disrupted but not economical to potential borrowers 

as market functioning improved.   

Importantly, lending against good collateral to solvent institutions supplies liquidity, not 

capital, to the financial system.  To be sure, limiting a panic mitigates the erosion of asset prices 

and hence capital, but central banks are not the appropriate authorities to supply capital directly; 

if government capital is necessary to promote financial stability, then that is a fiscal function.  

This division of responsibilities presented challenges in the crisis.  The securitization markets 

were impaired by both a lack of liquid funding and by concerns about the value of the underlying 

loans, and broad-based concerns about the integrity of the securitization process.  To restart these 

markets, the Federal Reserve worked with the Treasury in establishing the Term Asset-Backed 

Securities Loan Facility (TALF):  The Federal Reserve supplied the liquid funding, while the 

Treasury assumed the credit risk.  The issue of the appropriate role of the central bank and fiscal 

authority was present in other contexts as well.  We were well aware that we were possibly 

assuming a risk of loss when we lent to stabilize the systemically important firms of Bear Stearns 

and American International Group (AIG).  Unfortunately, at the time, alternative mechanisms 

were not available and we lent with the explicit support of the Secretary of the Treasury, 

including a letter from him acknowledging the risks.   

 An important task before us now is to assess the effectiveness of these actions.  Not 

surprisingly, rigorous studies that evaluate the extent to which the emergency liquidity facilities 

contributed to improved financial conditions are just beginning to emerge.  Nonetheless, market
