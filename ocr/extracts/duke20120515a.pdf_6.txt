Demand for Housing 

Notwithstanding these signs of improvement in the housing market, demand for 

owner-occupied housing remains stubbornly tepid.  An important driver of housing 

demand is household formation.  Although household formation typically falls during 

economic downturns, it has been especially weak this time around.  Since 2007, 

household formation has been running at three-fourths of its normal rate of about 

1 million households per year.  In addition, many potential homebuyers are delaying 

home purchases because they are worried about their income or employment prospects.  

Others look at declining house prices and either conclude that they can wait and buy at a 

lower price or fear that if they do buy, they might lose their home equity.  Even so, the 

drag of these factors on housing demand should begin to wane as the gradual recovery in 

the labor market progresses and house prices stabilize. 

Unfortunately, some buyers who would like to purchase a home are unable to do 

so because they are unable to obtain a mortgage.  According to the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), 

underwriting standards for residential mortgages tightened steadily from 2007 to 2009, 

and they do not appear to have eased much since then.2 

This tightening of credit standards is apparent in the credit scores of borrowers 

who obtain mortgages.  For newly originated mortgages, the median credit score of prime 

borrowers rose from about 700 in 2006 to more than 760 in 2009, where it remains today.  

Moreover, a large swath of borrowers who likely had access to credit a few years ago 

appear to be essentially excluded from the mortgage market under current prevailing 

standards.  Indeed, in an indication of the minimum credit score required to obtain credit,
