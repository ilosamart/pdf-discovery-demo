 Of course, there are risks to the outlook that may affect the timing and pace of 

monetary policy firming.  In my view, however, even additional large and persistent 

shocks to commodity prices might not call for any substantial change in the course of 

monetary policy as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored and measures of 

underlying inflation continue to be subdued.  As I noted earlier, a surge in commodity 

prices unavoidably impairs performance with respect to both aspects of the Federal 

Reserveâ€™s dual mandate:  Such shocks push up unemployment and raise inflation.  A 

policy easing might alleviate the effects on employment but would tend to exacerbate the 

inflationary effects; conversely, policy firming might mitigate the rise in inflation but 

would contribute to an even weaker economic recovery.  Under such circumstances, an 

appropriate balance in fulfilling our dual mandate might well call for the FOMC to leave 

the stance of monetary policy broadly unchanged.  

 That said, in light of the experience of the 1970s, it is clear that we cannot be 

complacent about the stability of inflation expectations, and we must be prepared to take 

decisive action to keep these expectations stable.  For example, if a continued run-up in 

commodity prices appeared to be sparking a wage-price spiral, then underlying inflation 

could begin trending upward at an unacceptable pace.  Such circumstances would clearly 

call for policy firming to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly 

anchored. 

Conclusion 
 
 In summary, the surge in commodity prices over the past year appears to be 

largely attributable to a combination of rising global demand and disruptions in global 

supply.  These developments seem unlikely to have persistent effects on consumer
