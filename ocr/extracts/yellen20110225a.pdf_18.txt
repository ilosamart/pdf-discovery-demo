     Note: The table displays basis point changes from close of business on the day before the announcement to close of business on  
the day of the announcement, with the exception of the final row, which shows the change from close of business on the day before 
the Aug. 10, 2010, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting through the close of business on the day of the Nov. 3, 2010,

off-the-run Treasury coupon securities.  Changes in the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are computed 
by staff using a smoothed inflation-indexed yield curve.  Changes in the yield on 30-year mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are 
computed using Bloomberg data on securities issued by Fannie Mae.  Changes in the yield on 10-year BBB-rated corporate bonds are 
computed using a smoothed yield curve estimated by staff using Merrill Lynch data.
