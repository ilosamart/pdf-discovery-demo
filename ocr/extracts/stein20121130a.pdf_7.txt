influence the underlying incentives for short-term debt issuance.  And these incentives 

are in turn shaped by the structure of rates and term premiums in the market.   

As I noted earlier, a natural response for any firm facing an unusually low term 

premium is to adjust its capital structure by issuing cheap long-term debt to replace its 

shorter-term debt.  It is therefore not surprising that the average debt maturity of large 

nonfinancial firms has increased notably over the past few years.  Moreover, the same 

pattern shows up among large financial firms--they too have been significantly 

lengthening their average debt maturity.  

The current cheapness of long-term debt contrasts with the pre-crisis 

configuration, where frequently a pronounced premium favored issuers not at the long 

end of the yield curve, but at the very short end.  In other words, the fact that the yield 

curve often tended to be steeply upward sloping at the front end gave financial firms a 

strong incentive to issue overnight paper.  Thus I suspect that LSAPs have, by changing 

the structure of term premiums in the market, helped encourage an extension of debt 

maturity by both financial and nonfinancial firms.  All else being equal, this development 

is a good thing from a financial stability perspective. 

To conclude:  A corporate finance perspective on LSAPs suggests that when 

monetary policy works by moving term premiums, as opposed to moving expectations 

about the future path of short rates, the transmission to the real economy may be altered 

in important ways.  These differences can have implications for how we think about the 

benefits of a policy action, its costs, and even its consequences for financial stability.   

Thanks very much, and I look forward to your questions.
