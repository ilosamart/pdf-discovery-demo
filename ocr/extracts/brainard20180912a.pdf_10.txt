Like many of you, I am attentive to the historical observation that inversions of 

the yield curve between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury rates have had a relatively 

reliable track record of preceding recessions in the United States.16  But unlike these 

historical episodes, today the current 10-year yield is very low at around 3 percent, which 

is well below the average of 6-1/4 percent during the decades before the crisis.   

Part of the reason the 10-year Treasury yield is unusually low is that market 

expectations of interest rates in the longer run are themselves quite low, as discussed 

earlier.  Another important reason the 10-year Treasury yield is very low is that the term 

premium has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards.  According to one 

estimate from Federal Reserve staff, the term premium has been slightly negative until 

very recently and remains very low.17  By contrast, it was close to 100 basis points when 

the spread between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields was at its peak of 325 basis 

points in early 2010.  This may temper somewhat the conclusions that we can draw from 

historical yield curve relationships characterized by a substantially higher term premium.  

If the term premium remains very low, any given amount of monetary policy tightening 

will lead to an inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led 

to an inversion historically could do so today. 

One reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed 

correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected 

inflation outcomes.18  The other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is
