The director of the Board’s Division of Monetary Affairs then kicks off the policy 

discussion with a presentation of monetary policy alternatives.  For each alternative, he talks us 

through the rationale for choosing it and the anticipated financial market response if the action 

were taken.  Following questions, we begin the monetary policy go-round.   

Interestingly, all of the previous “Come with Me” speeches highlight the way the 

Chairman influences the outcome of the meeting through his leadership rather than domination 

or dictatorship.  In 1967, the staff made recommendations for participants to consider.  Chairman 

William McChesney Martin generally spoke at the end of the single go-round, which included 

both the economic outlook and policy.  According to Governors Meyer and Olson, Chairman 

Greenspan did not speak during the economic go-round but would begin the policy go-round 

with his views about what the policy decision should be.  Participants would then follow after 

him and respond to his proposal.  As I said, Chairman Bernanke speaks at the end of the 

economic go-round.  Then in the policy go-round, he usually waits until everyone else has stated 

their views before he shares his own opinion and suggests a path forward.  After a bit more 

discussion, the Committee votes, confirms the date of its next scheduled meeting, and then the 

meeting adjourns. 

I came out of my first FOMC meeting—which began just half an hour after I was sworn 

in at the Fed—pumped full of adrenaline but also exhausted from the intense level of my 

concentration as I tried to follow everyone’s comments.  Most importantly, I came out with an 

understanding that the meeting itself was just the tip of the iceberg, the culmination of thousands 

of hours of work and thought leading to a single policy statement, a process that would be 

repeated for each FOMC meeting.  Even after two years on the Committee, I still leave feeling 

impressed by the level of preparation for, and the focus and intensity at, these meetings.
