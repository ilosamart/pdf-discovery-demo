actions that avoid or mitigate threats to financial stability.  However, because the largest 

and most interconnected firms likely would benefit the most, it seems appropriate that 

these firms should bear a proportionally larger share of any costs that cannot be recouped 

from the failing firm itself.  To avoid pro-cyclical effects, such assessments should be 

collected over time. 

Establishing a resolution regime with these characteristics is, I would suggest, one 

of the most important financial regulatory reforms for every country that does not already 

have such a mechanism in place.  It would lend substance to the idea that market 

discipline can be a solid third pillar of financial regulation, along with stronger prudential 

requirements and improved supervisory oversight.  Still, as is implicit in the foregoing 

discussion, an untested regime will probably not acquire complete credibility until it is 

actually applied successfully.  For this reason, among others, it is important to ensure that 

other regulatory tools will help compensate for the uncertainties associated with an 

essentially untested mechanism. 

International Efforts on Resolution Issues 

The looming or actual failure of a large, internationally active financial firm 

inevitably complicates the already challenging process of resolution.  Mismatches in the 

amounts and maturities of assets and liabilities held by the firm in the various countries in 

which it operates can lead host governments to take special action to protect the interests 

of depositors and creditors.  And different insolvency regimes apply to separately 

incorporated subsidiaries across the world.  Some of those regimes may be substantively 

inconsistent with one another, or may not account for the special characteristics of a large 

international firm.
