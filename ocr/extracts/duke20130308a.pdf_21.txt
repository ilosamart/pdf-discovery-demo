Finally, the statement of exit strategy principles provided in the June 2011 FOMC 

minutes contemplates the sale of MBS once the Committee has begun to remove policy 

accommodation in order to return the System Open Market Account to an all-Treasury 

portfolio.14  As our holdings of MBS become larger in both absolute terms and in relation 

to the overall supply of agency MBS outstanding, we could reach a point where market 

functioning concerns begin to outweigh the efficacy of such purchases.  Or we might 

conclude that sales of MBS in volumes sufficient to meet the parameters of the exit 

strategy principles might create significant market disruptions.  In either case, I think we 

should consider alternatives, such as holding the securities for longer or allowing them to 

roll off more gradually. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion, I am optimistic that the housing recovery will continue to take root 

and expand.  While low mortgage rates are helping support the recovery, I believe it will 

be the pent-up demand of household formation unleashed by improving economic 

conditions that will provide real momentum.  However, the strength of this momentum 

will be determined by credit availability to these new households, an availability that may 

be much slower to return as mortgage market participants assess the regulatory, market, 

and economic environment.  I think that if such credit is not readily available, the housing 

recovery will still continue, but the mix of owner-occupied and rental housing and the 

level of mortgage originations might be quite different.
