I support efforts to improve the efficacy of the Volcker rule while preserving its 

underlying goal of prohibiting banking firms from engaging in speculative activities for which 

federal deposit insurance and other safeguards were never intended.  The interagency regulation 

implementing the Volcker rule is not the most effective way of achieving its very laudable and 

important goal.  We are exploring ways to streamline and simplify the regulation to reduce costs 

without weakening the key objectives.  We should be able to provide firms and supervisors with 

greater clarity about what constitutes permissible market-making.  We should also identify ways 

to further tailor the Volcker compliance regime to focus on firms with large trading operations 

and reduce the compliance burden for small banking entities with limited trading operations.  

I also support moving forward with minimum haircuts for securities financing 

transactions (SFTs) on a marketwide basis to counter the growth of volatile funding structures 

outside the banking sector.  International agreement on a regulatory framework for minimum 

SFT haircuts was reached by financial regulators in 2015, and it is important to follow through 

on this work plan.  While current market practices in this area may well exhibit much better risk 

management than pre-crisis, past experience suggests we cannot rely on prudent practices to 

remain in place as competitive and cyclical pressures build.  Regulatory minimum haircuts 

calibrated to be appropriate through the cycle could help ensure that repo, securities lending, and 

securities margin lending and related markets do not become a source of instability in periods of 

financial stress through fire sales and run-type behavior.   

Here, I have focused primarily on the reforms that are most important for the resilience of 

the large interconnected banking organizations at the core of our system.  Outside of this group, I 

favor better tailoring the regulatory framework for our smaller banking firms so as to decrease 

regulatory burden.  While we have taken some important steps to reduce burden on smaller
