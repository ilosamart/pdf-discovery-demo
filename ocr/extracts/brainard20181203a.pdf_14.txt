represent only about 4 percent of total daily volume, with the rest concentrated primarily 

on one-day settlement.  Same-day settlement volumes since the inception of TRACE 

have never exceeded roughly 10 percent of the daily total.  Fortunately, we have not 

recently observed a large liquidation of Treasury holdings for cash at the end of the same 

day.  But we cannot rule out that this will always be the case.  It is not clear from the 

TRACE data whether the market could accommodate a large sale of Treasury securities 

later in the day, perhaps associated with a need to raise cash quickly to settle outstanding 

positions, without causing a substantial move in prices.  It will be important to follow 

closely how the market evolves in light of the potential risks and resilience issues 

identified in the recent TMPG white paper on clearing and settlement in the secondary 

market for U.S. Treasury securities.16 

Before I conclude, let me discuss one other step the Board is planning to take to 

help us keep up with the changing nature of markets.  The TRACE data are indispensable 

in the IAWG’s ability to track and understand this market.  However, FINRA’s 

collections are limited only to its members.  The Federal Reserve is close to finalizing an 

agreement with FINRA to act as our agent in expanding the collection of Treasury 

transactions to key banks that are also active in this market.  In addition, in light of recent 

changes in the market, the Board has decided to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to 

seek public comment on collecting agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt 

transactions as well.  This collection will help round out the IAWG’s view of these
