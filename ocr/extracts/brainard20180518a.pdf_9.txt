the agencies should be thoughtful about how to make the areas in which we evaluate CRA 

performance more meaningful to both banks and low- and moderate-income communities.  For 

community banks that rely on branches to serve their customers, the current assessment area

broader area and to encourage them to spread their investments and services to underserved 

areas.   

The CRA regulations should be updated in a way that is appropriate for different business

communities through additional channels, it is important they receive due consideration, while 

CRA revisions should also continue to recognize the importance of sustaining branches in 

communities where they are needed.

community services are not just good business short-term, but also good investments long-term 

as residents improve their economic standing and use more banking services.  Streamlining the 

CRA regulations and clarifying the performance measures could create stronger incentives for
