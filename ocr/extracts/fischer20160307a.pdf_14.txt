component began a rapid decline.  For these reasons, although the United 

States has remained an oil importer, the decrease in the world price of oil had 

a mixed effect on U.S. gross domestic product.  There is reason to believe that 

when the price of oil stabilizes, and U.S. shale oil production reaches its new 

equilibrium, the overall effect of the decline in the price of oil will be seen to 

have had a positive effect on aggregate demand in the United States, since 

lower energy prices are providing a noticeable boost to the real incomes of 

households. 

7. Secular stagnation:  During World War II in the United States, many 

economists feared that at the end of the war, the economy would return to 

high pre-war levels of unemployment--because with the end of the war, 

demobilization, and the massive reduction that would take place in the defense 

budget, there would not be enough demand to maintain full employment.   

Thus was born or renewed the concept of secular stagnation--the view that the 

economy could find itself permanently in a situation of low demand, less than 

full employment, and low growth.10  That is not what happened after World 

War II, and the thought of secular stagnation was correspondingly laid aside, 

in part because of the growing confidence that intelligent economic policies--

                                                 
10 I am distinguishing in this section between secular stagnation as being caused by a deficiency of 
aggregate demand and another view, that output growth will be very slow in future because productivity 
growth will be very low.  The view that future productivity growth will be very low has already been 
discussed, with the conclusion that we do not have a good basis for predictions of its future level, and that 
we simply do not know whether future productivity growth will be extremely low or higher than it has been 
recently.  There is no shortage of views on this issue among economists, but the views to some extent 
appear to depend on whether the economist making the prediction is an optimist or a pessimist.
