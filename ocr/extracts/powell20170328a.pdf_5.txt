“free silver” movement grew in response to these economic forces.  Its most famous 

advocate, William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, sought 

an increase in the money supply--by the coining of silver in addition to gold--as a 

solution to reversing this deflation (figure 5).5 

The Founding of the Fed 

By the beginning of the 20th century, the debate about monetary policy and the 

nation’s financial system had been going on for over a century.  Increasingly, the 

shortcomings of the existing system were causing too much harm to ignore.  Like a 

drumbeat, the country experienced one serious financial crisis after another, with major 

crises in 1839, 1857, 1873, 1893, and finally in 1907.6  These panics paralyzed the 

financial system and led to deep and extended contractions in the economy. 

These episodes exposed the weakness of our 19th century financial system, which 

repeatedly failed to supply the money and credit needed to meet the economy’s demands.  

The financial system came under severe stress when the demand for liquidity surged.7  A 

                                                 
5 For a sense of the regionalism of this debate, believe it or not, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been 
interpreted as an allegory for 19th century regional monetary problems, though there is little evidence about 
the intentions of its author, L. Frank Baum, in conveying this allegory.  Dorothy was from Kansas, a farm 
state, but after a cyclone, she found herself in a world dominated by gold, with a yellow brick road and the 
Land of Oz--the abbreviation for an ounce.  The story has four witches--from the West, East, North, and 
South.  Remember that the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately met her demise when she melted on 
contact with water, a symbol for the end of a drought that contributed to the economic hardships of western 
farmers.  But the most powerful change was brought about by Dorothy’s shoes, which were originally 
owned by the Wicked Witch of the East.  Importantly, these shoes were silver in the original book, not red 
as in the movie, symbolizing the power of bimetallism as a solution to western problems.  See Hugh

7 Contemporaries blamed these crises on the seasonality in demand for currency and credit related to 
planting and harvesting of crops in the spring and fall.  Modern scholars place more weight on other 
sources of financial tightness.  Some point to poor harvests that depressed net exports, particularly failed 
cotton harvests.  Net exports were an important source of increases in the money supply in this period.  In 
the context of the gold standard, poor money supply growth in the United States triggered certain 
expectations by international capital market participants that interest rates in the United States would rise
