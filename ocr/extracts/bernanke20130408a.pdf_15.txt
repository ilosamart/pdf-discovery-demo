account for these risks as best they can.  Of course, unforeseen events are inevitable, 

which is why maintaining a healthy level of capital is essential. 

Conclusion  

As I have discussed today, the banking system is much stronger since the 

implementation of the SCAP four years ago, which in turn has contributed to the 

improvement in the overall economy.  The use of supervisory stress tests--a practice now 

codified in statute--has helped foster these gains.  Methodologically, stress tests are 

forward looking and focus on unlikely but plausible risks, as opposed to “normal” risks.  

Consequently, they complement more conventional capital and leverage ratios.  The 

disclosure of the results of supervisory stress tests, coupled with firms’ disclosures of 

their own stress test results, provide market participants deeper insight not only into the 

financial strength of each bank but also into the quality of its risk management and 

capital planning.  Stress testing is also proving highly complementary to supervisors’ 

monitoring and analysis of potential systemic risks.  We will continue to make 

refinements to our implementation of stress testing and our CCAR process as we learn 

from experience.  

 As I have noted, one of the most important aspects of regular stress testing is that 

it forces banks (and their supervisors) to develop the capacity to quickly and accurately 

assess the enterprise-wide exposures of their institutions to diverse risks, and to use that 

information routinely to help ensure that they maintain adequate capital and liquidity.  

The development and ongoing refinement of that risk-management capacity is itself 

critical for protecting individual banks and the banking system, upon which the health of 

our economy depends.
