unemployed achieve less in school and appear to have reduced long-term earnings 

prospects.

In addition, unemployment--especially long-term unemployment--imposes 

important economic costs on everyone, not just the unemployed themselves.  Elevated 

unemployment strains public finances because of both lost tax revenue and the payment 

of increased unemployment benefits and other income support to affected families.  

People unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those 

experiencing shorter spells of unemployment, perhaps because their skills erode, they 

lose relationships within the workforce, or they acquire a stigma that deters firms from 

hiring them.  Loss of skills and lower rates of employment reduce the economy’s overall 

productive capacity over the longer term.  In the shorter term, because the process of 

matching the long-term unemployed to jobs typically takes more time, the currently high 

level of long-term unemployment might in itself be a reason that further progress in 

reducing the unemployment rate, and thus in achieving a more complete recovery, could 

be slow.

A pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing, 

particularly the longer-term unemployment, is structural in nature, reflecting factors such
