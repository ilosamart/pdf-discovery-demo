also has been assigned new responsibilities for financial stability, including supervisory 

authority over nonbank financial institutions that are designated as systemically important 

by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and new backup authorities for systemically 

critical financial market utilities. 

The Integration of Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Policies 

 As I noted earlier, in the decades prior to the crisis, monetary policy had come to 

be viewed as the principal function of central banks; their role in preserving financial 

stability was not ignored, but it was downplayed to some extent.  The financial crisis has 

changed all that.  Policies to enhance financial stability and monetary policy are now seen 

as co-equal responsibilities of central banks.  How should these two critical functions fit 

together? 

At an institutional level, as I have already suggested, the two functions are highly 

complementary.  Monetary policy, financial supervision, and lender-of-last-resort 

policies all benefit from the sharing of information and expertise.  At the Federal 

Reserve, for example, macroeconomists help design stress-test scenarios used by bank 

supervisors, while supervisors provide information about credit conditions to 

macroeconomic forecasters.  Threats to financial stability, and their potential implications 

for the economy, are thoroughly discussed at meetings of the FOMC. 

An important debate for the future concerns the extent to which it is useful for 

central banks to try to make a clear distinction between their monetary and financial 

stability responsibilities, including designating a separate set of policy tools for each 

objective.  For example, throughout the crisis the ECB has maintained its “separation 

principle” under which it orients changes in its policy interest rate toward achieving price
