pharmacy technician.  Such programs can especially benefit adults looking for a new 

career.  The Community College Workforce Alliance also works closely with 

unemployment centers throughout the region to provide just-in-time training programs in 

sectors as diverse as education, the green industry, and skilled trades.  

Workforce development organizations also support entrepreneurship and the 

creation of small businesses.  The Alliance’s “Growing America Through 

Entrepreneurship” program, which helps displaced workers start their own companies, is 

one example.  Your efforts to open these opportunities to your students, and similar 

efforts across the country, contribute tremendously to maintaining a strong and capable 

workforce. 

After this session closes, I look forward to speaking with students who have 

participated in community college training programs, and succeeded as a result.  Their 

insights will be very helpful as we collectively think about workforce development 

issues.  

We will have no easy resolution to the challenges we face in restoring jobs and

thoughtful discussion you engaged in today and the collaborative work you will
