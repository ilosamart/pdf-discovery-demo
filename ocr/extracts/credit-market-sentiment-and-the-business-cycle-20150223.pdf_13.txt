Roadmap

• Warmup: predictive OLS regressions of economic activity on changes 
in credit spreads and stock returns (1929-2013).

• Regressions of economic activity on changes in credit spreads and stock 
returns due to changes in market sentiment:

(a) Baseline results (1929-2013).
(b) Robustness: different subsamples/horizons and activity measures.
(c) Additional measures of credit-market sentiment.
(d) Controlling for leverage and credit growth.

• Inspecting the mechanism:
(a) A simple model.
(b) Evidence on the mechanism: response of financing mix and investment to 

changes in credit-market sentiment.

• Policy implications.
