structural unemployment during the recession, closer examination reveals that they 

explain less of this increase than might first appear.     

One such labor market feature is the sharp reduction in employment in sectors 

related to the housing bubble, such as residential construction and some parts of financial 

services.  The contention is that the skills of workers in these sectors do not readily 

transfer to other sectors, and thus they will have a particularly difficult time finding new 

jobs.  But in every recession, certain industries and occupations are hit particularly hard, 

resulting in significant permanent job losses.  Yet previous recessions do not seem to 

have been accompanied by notable increases in structural unemployment.  Thus, those 

who believe the mismatch problem specifically created by the recession--as distinguished 

from more-secular trends--is either more prevalent or more persistent now than in the 

past would need to identify some additional source of rigidity that has further hampered 

labor market adjustment. 

Some have also pointed to the high level of long-term unemployment as evidence 

that mismatch is a major factor keeping the unemployment rate high.  The claim is that 

those without the skills sought by employers will take longer, on average, to find new 

employment.  However, the data do not back this claim, at least to date.  If high 

unemployment durations were the result of mismatch, the probability of finding a new 

job should have declined proportionately more for the long-term unemployed than for the 

recently unemployed.  In fact, reemployment probabilities during the recession fell by 

similar amounts for all durations of unemployment and have edged up by similar 

increments in the recovery.  Again, this pattern is more consistent with weak aggregate 

demand being the most important cause of high unemployment.
