Large-Scale Asset Purchases and Related Communication 

Because of the severity of the recession and the disruptions in financial markets, 

and because short-term interest rates were near the zero lower bound, it became clear 

early on that more monetary accommodation would be needed than could be provided 

through the management of short-term rates alone, even with guidance that those rates 

would be kept low well into the future.  Accordingly, at about the same time that the 

FOMC reduced its target for the federal funds rate close to zero, it began supplementing 

its rate policies and forward rate guidance with large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs)--

specifically, open market purchases of longer-term U.S. Treasury securities and securities 

issued by the government-sponsored enterprises, primarily mortgage-backed securities 

(MBS). 

Both LSAPs and forward guidance for the federal funds rate support the economy 

by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, but they affect longer-term 

rates through somewhat different channels.  To understand the difference, it is useful to 

decompose longer-term interest rates into two components:  One reflects the expected 

path of short-term interest rates, and the other is called a term premium.  The term 

premium is the extra return that investors require to be willing to hold a longer-term 

security to maturity compared with the expected yield from rolling over short-term 

securities for the same period.   

As I have noted, forward rate guidance affects longer-term interest rates primarily 

by influencing investorsâ€™ expectations of future short-term interest rates.  LSAPs, in 

contrast, most directly affect term premiums.  As the Federal Reserve buys a larger share 

of the outstanding stock of longer-term securities, the quantity of these securities
