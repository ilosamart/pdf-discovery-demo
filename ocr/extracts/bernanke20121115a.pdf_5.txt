homeowners often being the hardest hit.  Importantly, foreclosures can inflict economic 

damage beyond the personal suffering and dislocation that accompany them.  Foreclosed 

properties that sit vacant for months (or years) often deteriorate from neglect, adversely 

affecting not only the value of the individual property but the values of nearby homes as 

well.  Concentrations of foreclosures have been shown to do serious damage to 

neighborhoods and communities, reducing tax bases and leading to increased vandalism 

and crime.  Thus, the overall effect of the foreclosure wave, especially when concentrated 

in lower-income and minority areas, is broader than its effects on individual homeowners.  

A strengthening housing market will help to gradually undo that damage, but the process 

has only begun. 

Homeownership rates have also declined because fewer households have chosen, 

or have been able, to become new homeowners in recent years.  Buying a home usually 

means obtaining a mortgage, and the data show that the pace of mortgage lending has 

fallen considerably on a national basis; the extension of first-lien mortgages to purchase 

homes fell by more than half from 2006 to 2011 and now stands at the lowest level since 

1995.

  Again, the contraction in mortgage originations has been particularly severe for 

minority groups and those with lower incomes:  Since the peak in mortgage lending in 

2006, the number of home-purchase loans extended to African Americans and Hispanics 

has fallen more than 65 percent, whereas lending to non-Hispanic whites has fallen less 

than 50 percent.  Home-purchase originations in lower-income neighborhoods have fallen 

about 75 percent, compared with around 50 percent for middle- and upper-income 

neighborhoods.
