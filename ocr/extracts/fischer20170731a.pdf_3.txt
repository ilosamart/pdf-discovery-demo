lows, with the same being true in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan 

(figure 1).  Yields have also declined in many emerging markets, with interest rates 

falling almost 400 basis points in Korea since the financial crisis and by a similar amount 

in Israel.  As shown in figure 2, the decline has been less apparent in Brazil and South 

Africa, though interest rates in both countries remain well below previous peaks.  

In this talk, I will address two questions:  Why are interest rates so low?  And why 

has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?1 

Global Real Interest Rates Have Declined 

Lower inflation explains a portion of the decline in nominal interest rates.  

Longer-term interest rates reflect market participants’ expectations of future inflation as 

well as the expected path of real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates.  And while lower 

realized inflation and credible central back inflation targets have likely stabilized 

expected inflation at relatively low levels compared with much of the 20th century, 

inflation-adjusted yields have also notably decreased. 

The decline in interest rates also does not appear to be primarily an outcome of 

the economic cycle.  Longer-term interest rates in the United States have remained low 

even as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the short-term 

federal funds rate by 100 basis points and as the unemployment rate has declined below 

the median of FOMC participants’ assessments of its longer-run normal level.   

Rather, it appears as though much of the decline has occurred in the equilibrium 

level of the real interest rate--also known as the natural rate of interest or, alternatively,
