taking.9  The question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking 

through the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through 

misallocation of capital.  That question is particularly important today.  Historically, 

recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.  More recently, 

with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.  

Core PCE inflation remained close to or below 2 percent during both the late-1990s stock 

market bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble that led to the financial crisis.  Real 

short- and long-term rates were relatively high in the late 1990s, so financial excess can 

also arise without a low-rate environment.  Nonetheless, the current extended period of 

very low nominal rates calls for a high degree of vigilance against the buildup of risks to 

the stability of the financial system.   

If we look at the channels listed here, the picture is mixed, but the bottom line is 

that there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or 

broadly unsustainable asset prices.   

Low long-term interest rates have weighed on profitability in the financial sector, 

although firms have so far coped with those pressures.  As shown in the next slide, net 

interest margins (NIMs) for most banks have held up surprisingly well.  NIMs have 

moved down for the largest banks.  Return on assets, shown to the right for both groups, 

has recovered but remains below pre-crisis levels.  Life insurers have substantially 

underperformed the broader equity market since 2007, suggesting that investors see the 

low-rate environment as a drag on profitability for the industry.  Even so, data on asset 

                                                 
9 See Dellâ€™Ariccia, Laeven, and Suarez (forthcoming), which finds evidence for a risk-taking channel of 
monetary policy based on supervisory ratings of U.S. bank loans.  Bekaert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca (2013) 
find that accommodative monetary policy shocks lead to a decline in the VIX, a measure of implied 
volatility, by lowering both expected volatility and the risk premium.
