policy interest rate and some increase in the term premium.

  A rise of more than 200 

basis points in a year is at the upper end of what is implied by the mean paths and 

uncertainty measures shown in charts 4 and 5, but these measures still admit a substantial 

probability of higher--and lower--paths. 

Overall, then, we anticipate that long-term rates will rise as the recovery 

progresses and expected short-term real rates and term premiums return to more normal 

levels.  The precise timing and pace of the increase will depend importantly on how 

economic conditions develop, however, and is subject to considerable two-sided 

uncertainty.  

Managing Risks Associated with the Future Course of Long-Term Interest Rates 

As I noted when I began my remarks, one reason to focus on the timing and pace 

of a possible increase in long-term rates is that these outcomes may have implications for 

financial stability.  Commentators have raised two broad concerns surrounding the 

outlook for long-term rates.  To oversimplify, the first risk is that rates will remain low, 

and the second is that they will not.  In particular, in an environment of persistently low 

returns, incentives may grow for some investors to engage in an unsafe “reach for yield” 

either through excessive use of leverage or through other forms of risk-taking.  My Board 

colleague Jeremy Stein recently discussed how this behavior may arise in some financial 

markets, including credit markets.

  Alternatively, we face a risk that longer-term rates 

will rise sharply at some point, imposing capital losses on holders of fixed-income

 The two components were intertwined, as measures of uncertainty about the path of policy moved up 

sharply, likely contributing to a rise in term premiums.  Notably, in this episode, the rise in rates created 

some stress in financial markets but did not lead to serious financial instability, nor did it significantly 

impair economic activity.  However, one would not want to conclude from that one case that sharp rises in 

rates do not pose risks.
