I will turn to a consideration of the challenges that remain, with a few suggestions on how we 

might make more progress.   

Benefits and Risks of International Banking  

It is worth at least briefly reminding ourselves of some of the more salient advantages 

and risks associated with cross-border banking as they help inform development of regulatory 

options.1   

 Among the potential advantages are facilitating productive capital flows, diversifying 

risks associated with growth in host countries, diversifying the earnings and thus the stability of 

the global bank, offering counter-cyclical lending through support from the parent when host 

country economic conditions constrain domestic banking operations, enhancing efficiency in 

financial intermediation in host countries, providing specialized financial services,2 and 

providing price or product competition for banking services in host countries.  The magnitude of 

these benefits obviously differs from country to country, depending on a variety of factors.  

Some of these benefits can be greater if foreign banks have the freedom to deploy capital and 

liquidity to whatever markets offer the most attractive opportunities, whereas others are 

achievable simply through the bank’s expertise, existing business relationships, and range of 

services.   

                                                 
1 By “cross-border banking,” I mean to refer broadly to activities carried on outside of a bank’s home country 
through subsidiaries and branches.  I do not include direct lending or other financial transactions across national 
borders, whether or not facilitated by an agency in the country of the bank’s customer or counterparty.  While such 
activities can raise concerns pertaining to investor protection, the volatility of financial flows, or foreign exchange 
policies, relevant prudential considerations will generally be limited to the country(ies) from which the bank is 
initiating the transaction and raising any funds needed to fund it.  

For references to many individual studies examining one or more the advantages or risks, see Stijn Claessens and 
Neeltje van Horen (2014), “The Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Banking Globalization,” IMF Working 
Papers 14/197 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, October). 
2 For an example, see Stijn Claessens, Omar Hassib, and Neeltje van Horen (2015), “The Role of Foreign Banks in 
Trade,” mimeo, (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and De Nederlandsche Bank, 
March).
