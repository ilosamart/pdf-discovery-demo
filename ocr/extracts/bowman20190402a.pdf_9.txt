are the building blocks of a strong nation.  They provide safety, education and economic 

opportunities, and help define the values we hold dear.  Community banks are vital to the 

success of communities.  They help us save and plan for a better future.  The credit they 

extend helps preserve farming as a way of life for American families, and provides the 

means for small businesses to start and to thrive, which is so important to the health of 

communities.   

This is not an abstract notion for me.  As a community banker, I have seen how 

access to credit and support from a financial institution with deep roots in a community 

can make a direct and immediate difference in people’s lives.  I continued to feel that 

way when I did the job you do, as a state banking commissioner, helping ensure that 

families and communities have access to financial services that are so important to their 

success.  I enjoyed being a community banker, and I hope you know I’ve enjoyed 

working closely with all of you as a banking commissioner, and I now look forward to 

building a stronger partnership between all of you and the Federal Reserve Board. 

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I hope to see you soon in 

your states, and I wish you a productive and enjoyable visit to Washington.
