it is impossible for the central bank to know when an asset class is overvalued, the risks 

to the economy associated with overvaluation are presumably greater when 

intermediaries are highly levered.9   

In my view, these are generally sensible arguments, and an approach of the sort 

that Woodford outlines may well turn out to be fruitful.  At the same time, this leverage-

centric approach also has some drawbacks, which suggest that there is likely to be value 

in a parallel exploration of other tracks.  For one thing, the effective degree of leverage in 

the financial system is not easy to measure in a comprehensive fashion.  One can 

certainly look at things like banks’ capital ratios, but some of the important action, from a 

financial stability perspective, is likely to be in subtler forms of leverage that are either 

outside of the traditional banking sector or more prone to shape shifting.  More to the 

point, recall that, for the purposes of informing monetary policy, one wants to focus on 

those sources of financial vulnerability that are least effectively dealt with via regulation.  

And the more reliably a form of leverage can be measured, the better a candidate it is for 

being handled with a regulatory or supervisory approach.  In other words, if we were to 

see signs that banks’ capital ratios were in danger of eroding, we would certainly want to 

do something, but it is hard for me to imagine that the something should involve 

monetary policy--the obvious first line of defense in this case would be to turn to our 

regulatory and supervisory tools.  

                                                 
9 Woodford (2012) writes, “It is important, I believe, to realize that the real issue is not identifying whether 
one type of asset or another is currently overvalued.  Instead, what central banks (and potentially other 
‘macro-prudential’ regulators) need to be able to monitor is the degree to which the positions taken by 
leveraged institutions pose a risk to financial stability. . . .  A central bank need not be able to identify asset 
over-valuations in order to recognize situations in which the probability of simultaneous financial distress 
at several institutions is non-trivial.”
