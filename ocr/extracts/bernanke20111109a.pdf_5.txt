businesses. Through research and analytical efforts, we are working to deepen our 

understanding of credit market conditions facing small and new businesses, particularly 

the frictions that impede the flow of credit to creditworthy borrowers.  In addition, some 

of our community development offices conduct regional surveys to obtain a better 

understanding of the characteristics and financing needs of small business owners in their 

areas.  You will hear more about their findings during the second panel today. 

The Federal Reserve also continues to encourage bank examiners to adopt a 

balanced approach to reviewing banks’ lending to small businesses.  We hold training 

sessions for examiners and extend outreach to lenders to promote awareness about both 

the credit environment and available lending guidance and resources.  We would like to 

foster an environment in which lenders do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy 

borrowers while maintaining appropriately prudent underwriting standards. 

Closing Observations 

The issues you will be discussing today and tomorrow are critical to everyone 

with an interest in the success of our nation’s small firms and entrepreneurs, and, by 

extension, of our economy as a whole.  Based on the wide variety of perspectives 

represented at today’s conference, I feel sure you won’t agree on the answers to all the 

many questions that will be raised.  But the dialogue itself is of great value.  We at the 

Federal Reserve have found that conferences such as this one help us to more effectively 

conduct our outreach and analytical work.  We hope that each of you will find this 

experience worthwhile as well.  Thank you in advance for sharing your insights about the 

challenges for small businesses, and I look forward to seeing the results of your work.
