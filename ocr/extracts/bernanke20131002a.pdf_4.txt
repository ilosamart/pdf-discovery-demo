colleagues back home.  Our meetings with the council have been extremely informative 

and have improved our ability to understand and respond to community bank concerns. 

Of course, understanding those concerns is of limited value unless we use what

banking helps guide our thinking on regulatory matters and on broader economic trends.  

In particular, the Boardâ€™s subcommittee on community banking is regularly briefed on 

relevant research being conducted across the System.  Thus, research findings inform 

policy, and policy concerns guide research.  In fact, after learning about several research 

projects, the subcommittee suggested that the staff hold a community banking research 

conference--a suggestion that brought all of us to St. Louis today.   

The range of topics that will be covered over the next day and a half is 

impressive.  The first research session this afternoon will focus on the role of community 

banks in our financial and economic system.  Papers in this session examine whether 

community banks influence new-firm survival, whether equipment finance is a potential 

growth area for community banks, how community bank failures affect local economic
