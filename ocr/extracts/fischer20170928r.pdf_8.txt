beginning, the Inflation Report was intended to increase transparency about the U.K. 

monetary policy reaction function--that is, the connection between policy instruments and 

economic variables, including the goal variables.17 After independence, the Inflation 

Report presented the MPC’s inflation forecast.  Furthermore, alongside other Bank 

statements, the Inflation Report provides a publicly available analysis of the economy 

and of economic implications of developments like Brexit.  The content reflects the

Bank’s change in focus--from markets in the pre-inflation-targeting era to 

macroeconomic implications of financial and other developments.18

The Bank expanded its policy communications after 1997, publishing MPC 

analogues to the FOMC releases (some of them only recent innovations by the Fed),

namely, postmeeting MPC statements and meeting minutes.  And an innovation of 

Mervyn King in the early years of inflation targeting that has continued in the era of 

independence is the Inflation Report press conference.  Here, senior Bank figures discuss 

the MPC’s forecast and the state of the economy.  This innovation was a forerunner of 

the Federal Reserve Chair’s press conference, begun in 2011, in which the Chair 

describes the latest policy decision together with the Summary of Economic Projections 

(SEP) of FOMC participants.

17 See Crockett (1994, p. 183). The desire to be explicit about the reaction function has continued to be a 
theme of policymaker statements in the era of the MPC.  See, for example, King (2002), Allsopp (2002), 
Tucker (2007), and Bean (2009).
18 The MPC arrangements also require that a letter be written from the Bank Governor to the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer in the event of an overshoot or undershoot of the inflation target that is in excess of 1 
percent.  As well as providing accountability, this arrangement gives the Bank an opportunity to emphasize 
the longer-term nature of the inflation goal and the consideration given in MPC policy decisions to the 
stabilization of real economic activity.  For example, Carney (2016) outlined, among other things, “the 
horizon over which the MPC judges it appropriate to return inflation to the target” and “the trade-off that 
has been made with regard to inflation and output variability in determining the scale and duration of any 
expected deviation of inflation from the target.”
