In summary, the string of soft data in the first quarter raises some questions about 

the contours of the outlook.  While it is possible that residual seasonality and temporary 

factors were responsible, it would be difficult, based on the data available today, to 

dismiss the possibility of a more significant drag on the economy than anticipated from 

foreign crosscurrents and the negative effects of the oil price decline, along with a more 

cautious U.S. consumer.  This possibility argues for giving the data some more time to 

confirm further improvement in the labor market and firming of inflation toward our 

2 percent target.  But while the case for liftoff may not be immediate, it is coming into 

clearer view.  When that time comes, the policy path will be highly attuned to incoming 

data and not on a preset course, and it is important to be mindful of the possibility of 

volatility as markets adjust to a change in the stance of policy.  Thus, the FOMC will 

continue communicating as clearly as possible regarding the outlook and the factors 

underlying its policy determinations.
