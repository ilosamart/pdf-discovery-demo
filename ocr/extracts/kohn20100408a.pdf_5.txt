reasons, part of the increase in unemployment over the past two years may be structural, and this 

part would tend to reverse only slowly. 

Even if a portion of the rise in unemployment is structural, however, most appears to be 

cyclical, suggesting that the economy is operating well below its productive potential.  This 

conclusion is supported by other measures of slack, such as capacity utilization in 

manufacturing, and by the ongoing deceleration in wages and prices.   

Although headline consumer price inflation has been boosted in recent quarters by an 

increase in energy prices, a substantial deceleration has been observed in measures of prices that 

exclude such volatile elements.  For example, the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy rose 1.3 percent over the 12 months to February, 

down 1/2 percentage point from a year earlier and down more than a full percentage point from 

the start of the recession in late 2007.  Other measures of underlying inflation trends also show 

substantial deceleration; for example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallasâ€™s trimmed mean 

measure of PCE inflation, which excludes the most extreme price changes in a month, was only 

1.0 percent in the 12 months to February, compared with 2.4 percent in the preceding 12-month 

period. 

Labor costs have also decelerated.  The employment cost index--a broad measure of wage 

and benefit costs in private industry--rose only 1.2 percent in the 12 months to December after 

hovering around 3 to 4 percent for most of the preceding two decades.  Other measures of labor 

compensation show comparable slowdowns and, when coupled with the acceleration in 

productivity, imply the largest four-quarter drop in unit labor costs in decades.  This 

development also should work to restrain price inflation.
