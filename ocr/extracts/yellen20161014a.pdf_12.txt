alternatively, limited ability--of firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees, which 

could help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and 

after the recession?19 

Another gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns 

expectations.  Although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be 

most closely related to short-run inflation expectations, as an empirical matter, measures 

of long-run expectations appear to explain the data better.20  Yet another unresolved issue 

concerns whose expectations--those of consumers, firms, or investors--are most relevant 

for wage and price setting, a point on which theory provides no clear-cut guidance.  More 

generally, the precise manner in which expectations influence inflation deserves further 

study.21 

Perhaps most importantly, we need to know more about the manner in which 

inflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them.  Ultimately, 

both actual and expected inflation are tied to the central bank’s inflation target, whether 

that target is explicit or implicit.22  But how does this anchoring process occur?  Does a 

central bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before 

inflation expectations completely conform?  Can policymakers instead materially 

                                                 
19 For an early discussion of the potential macroeconomic effects of downward nominal wage rigidity, see 
Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996).  More recently, Daly and Hobijn (2014) develop a model in which the 
reluctance or inability of firms to cut nominal wages (or both) creates important nonlinearities in the 
relationship between labor utilization and wage inflation.  Finally, Fallick, Lettau, and Wascher (2015) 
review the evidence for downward nominal wage rigidity in recent years and explore the ways in which it 
has interacted with labor market stress over time.  
20 Specifically, survey measures of long-run inflation expectations are broadly correlated with estimates of 
inflation’s longer-term trend.  See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013, who make a 
related point in the context of inflation forecasting. 
21 As Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Moller, and Stock (2014) conclude from their exhaustive survey, empirical 
estimates of the New Keynesian inflation equation are “unable to pin down the role of expectations in the 
inflation process sufficiently accurately for the results to be useful for policy analysis” (p. 172). 
22 For a discussion of the theoretical and empirical influence of monetary policy on inflation in the context 
of a formal inflation-targeting regime, see Bernanke and others (1999b).
