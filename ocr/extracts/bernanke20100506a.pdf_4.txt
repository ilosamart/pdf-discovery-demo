across firms.  By statistically analyzing the relationship of loss estimates to portfolio 

characteristics, for example, supervisors were able to estimate potential losses for each 

firm, which could then be compared to independent examiner judgments and the firms’ 

own estimates.  

The assessment found that if the economy were to track the specified “more 

adverse” scenario, losses at the 19 firms during 2009 and 2010 could total about 

$600 billion.  After taking account of potential resources to absorb those losses and 

capital that had already been raised or was contractually committed, and after 

establishing the size of capital buffers for the end of the two-year horizon that we 

believed would support stability and continued lending, we determined that 10 of the 

19 institutions would collectively need to raise an additional $75 billion in common 

equity.  Firms were asked to raise the capital within six months, by November 2009.  

Importantly, we publicly released our comprehensive assessments of each of the firms’ 

estimated losses and capital needs under the more-adverse scenario.  Our objective in 

releasing the information was to encourage private investment in these institutions, and 

thus bolster their lending capacity.  If private sources of capital turned out not to be 

forthcoming, however, U.S. government capital would be available.  

Effect of the Stress Assessment on Confidence in the Banking System 

Early last year, when the stress assessment was getting started, some observers 

had warned that the assessment and, in particular, the public disclosure of the results 

might backfire.  As it turned out, we now can see that the assessment in fact met its 

objectives of reducing uncertainty about losses and ensuring sufficient capital in the 

largest banking firms, and that the public disclosure was an important reason for its
