dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a 

particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness 

to the U.S. economy.11   

In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these 

exchange rate movements.  In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that 

the nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from June 2014 to January of this year 

could be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis 

point increase in the federal funds rate.  Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed 

through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, 

while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by 

depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors. 

4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time  

Fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that 

the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before 

the crisis.  Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the 

additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has 

averaged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only 

1-1/2 percent.  Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that 

prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation 

would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy.  To reconcile these 

developments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate 

is less accommodative today than it would have been 10 years ago.  Put differently, the
