 It is important to note that incorporating financial stability considerations into monetary 

policy decisions need not imply the creation of an additional mandate for monetary policy.  The 

potentially huge effect on price stability and employment associated with bouts of serious 

financial instability gives ample justification. 

 Here I want to mention some comments by my colleague Jeremy Stein a couple of weeks 

ago.1  After reviewing the traditional arguments against using monetary policy in response to 

financial stability concerns and relying instead on supervisory policies, Governor Stein offered 

several reasons for keeping a more open mind on the subject.  First, regulation has its own limits, 

not the least of which is the opportunity for arbitrage outside the regulated sector.  Second, 

whatever its bluntness, monetary policy has the advantage of being able to "get in all the cracks" 

of the financial system, an attribute that is especially useful if imbalances are building across the 

financial sector and not just in a particular area.  Finally, by altering the composition of its 

balance sheet, central banks may have a second policy instrument in addition to changing the 

targeted interest rate.  So, for example, it is possible that a central bank might under some 

conditions want to use a combination of the two instruments to respond to concurrent concerns 

about macroeconomic sluggishness and excessive maturity transformation by lowering the target 

(short-term) interest rate and simultaneously flattening the yield curve through swapping shorter 

duration assets for longer-term ones. 

 To be clear, I do not think that we are at present confronted with a situation that would 

warrant these kinds of monetary policy action.  But for that very reason, it seems that now is a 

good time to discuss these issues more actively, so that if and when we do face financial stability
