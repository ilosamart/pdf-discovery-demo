be less useful variation, in the form of unexpected swings in capital requirements that 

don’t have any particular relationship to changing risks at individual firms.  In addition, 

one source of volatility in the tests comes from the fact that banks are forced to do their 

capital planning before they get the results of our tests.  I will address each of these 

concerns in turn. 

In distinguishing useful from less useful volatility, one option to address the year-

over-year volatility of the tests would be to average the results of the tests from the 

previous year or years.  This would not affect the overall stringency of the tests but, 

mathematically, would mean that no single year could have an outsized influence on the 

amount of capital that a bank is required to maintain.  The potential downsides to this 

approach include the reduced risk sensitivity that a bank may experience to a particular 

test and potential technical challenges associated with changes to a bank’s balance sheet 

and earnings.  Bearing in mind these potential challenges, I believe more thinking and 

discussion of this issue would be fruitful. 

With respect to the second concern, as I have said before, I believe it more 

rational and logical for firms to be able to plan for their capital needs with the benefit of 

the results of our tests.  Given the huge strides that the banks have made in their capital 

planning and in meeting our expectations, I view the risk of banks backsliding in this 

regard to be minimal because it would be evident in the next test.  Our capital-planning 

expectations will not decline, and we will continue to use the supervisory process to 

enforce these expectations.  It is my hope that greater transparency can play a role in 

other parts of our supervisory process—for example, by allowing other aspects of bank 

supervision to benefit from public input.  Greater transparency for supervision is in
