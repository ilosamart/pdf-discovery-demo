response to the financial crisis.     

Lowering Interest Rates 

 During more normal times, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking is focused on 

short-term interest rates, our main tool for steering the economy.  The Fed influences the 

costs of borrowing to buy everything from cars to condos to computers by controlling 

short-term interest rates.  Interest rates can be lowered to stimulate borrowing and 

spending when demand is otherwise weak or raised to damp demand and curb inflation. 

 Before I arrived, the Fed had already responded to the weakening in the economy 

by aggressively lowering its federal funds rate target from 5-1/4 percent in September 

2007 to 2 percent.  Two percent is extremely low for interest rates, but as the financial 

crisis intensified and the economic outlook grew more dire in the fall of 2008, the Fed 

continued to cut rates.  For more than a year now, our policies have pushed down short-

term interest rates close to zero.   

 Once our main short-term interest rate lever was effectively at zero, we moved 

beyond traditional monetary policy to push down longer-term interest rates.  In 

November 2008, the Fed began purchasing large volumes of longer-term, U.S. 

government debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, eventually increasing the 

commitment to more than $1.7 trillion.  The added demand for these securities pushed up 

their prices, thus lowering their yields, and put downward pressure on other long-term 

rates, including those for home mortgages and corporate bonds. 

 Such actions by the Federal Reserve have led to lower borrowing costs for 

consumers and businesses, including on business lines, credit cards, mortgages, and car
