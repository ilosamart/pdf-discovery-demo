the median market expectation.  Once Chairman Bernanke affirmed the median 

expectation, these optimists had to quickly unwind their trades, with consequent sharp 

movements in asset prices.     

Where does that leave us?  The problem, to quote Jeremy at length, “is that in

of the balance sheet.11  Question:  How concerned should we be about a repeat of the 

taper tantrum as we move through this new inflection point?   

We should start answering such a question by recognizing that there is always a 

chance of some market volatility.  Nonetheless, we need to take into account that the 

New York Fed’s Open Market Desk enhanced its information-gathering efforts after and,

Survey of Market Participants, going some way to addressing concerns that primary 

dealers alone were not providing sufficient coverage of market beliefs.12  Second, more
