     Note:  This figure depicts simulation results of the FRB/US model of the U.S. economy.  The left panel shows the path of the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings (in $ trillions) under an illustrative baseline scenario (solid line) and an alternative “rapid run-
off” scenario (dashed line).  The right panel shows the unemployment rate (solid line) and the core personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) inflation rate (dashed lines),  with results expressed as deviations of the alternative scenario from the baseline scenario.
