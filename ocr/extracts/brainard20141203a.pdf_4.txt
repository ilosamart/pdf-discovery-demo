financial system, and borrowing by households and businesses.  

The research that informs this work, by helping to identify financial patterns 

likely to be associated with rising risks of financial crisis, continues to grow.  But its 

predictive power is still limited; it remains difficult to identify ahead of time credit booms 

that are likely to cause severe damage, such as the subprime housing crisis, from those 

that do not, such as the high-tech boom, in part because risk-taking by financial market 

participants cannot always be well-observed.3 

Over time, our and others’ surveillance will benefit as the Office of Financial 

Research established by the Dodd-Frank Act, makes progress in facilitating the sharing of 

previously siloed data sets among the independent regulators and as international 

impediments are overcome, allowing more comprehensive analysis of financial 

transaction flows across different types of financial intermediaries and activities.  

This regular, systematic surveillance of financial vulnerabilities is buttressed by 

three other valuable types of analysis.  First, we use the detailed information gathered 

through bank examinations and loan reviews that are the regular work of our supervisors 

to assess emerging risky practices; these reviews helped identify deteriorating 

underwriting standards in the leveraged loan market.  Second, we undertake periodic 

analyses of potential systemwide consequences of possible, particularly salient shocks, 

such as a sharp rise in the level or volatility of interest rates, including possible 

3 According to the International Monetary Fund, only about one in three credit booms have historically 
ended in some form of financial crisis.  See Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, Deniz Igan, Luc Laeven, Hui Tong, Bas
