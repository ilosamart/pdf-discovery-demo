markets.  As a result, early in the recovery governments began to withdraw fiscal 

stimulus, and, in most cases, fiscal policy became a net drag on economic growth.  This 

outcome was most evident in the euro-area periphery, where skyrocketing bond yields 

and deepening concerns about default left governments with little choice about whether 

to rein in stimulus.  In Spain, for example, the OECD estimates that fiscal consolidation 

has subtracted an average of 1-1/2 percentage points from GDP growth each year since 

2009.  But fiscal policy also turned contractionary in countries facing less market 

pressure, such as the United Kingdom and the United States.  Governments in both 

countries embarked on fiscal consolidation programs over the past four years, sharply 

reducing their structural deficits, and, as a consequence, creating headwinds that slowed 

the recovery.  

 With fiscal drag weighing on growth and with private-sector deleveraging also 

holding back consumption and investment, monetary policy bore the brunt of supporting 

the economy.  With policy rates at or approaching zero, central banks of necessity turned 

to unconventional policy tools such as large-scale asset purchases and enhanced forward 

guidance about the future path of policy rates.  These unconventional tools have, in my 

view, served to support a recovery in domestic demand and, as a consequence, global 

economic growth. 

Even so, the recovery in most advanced nations has proceeded more slowly than 

policymakers would have hoped.  This sluggishness has been due in part to the severity 

of the financial shock associated with the crisis and the persistent headwinds to recovery 

in its aftermath.  But the lack of fiscal support for demand in recent years also helps
