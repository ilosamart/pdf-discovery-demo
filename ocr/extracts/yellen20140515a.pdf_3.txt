One of the reasons I wanted so much to be here this evening was to be able to 

acknowledge these important contributions.  America has come a long way since the dark 

days of the financial crisis, and small businesses deserve a considerable share of the 

credit for the investment and hiring that have brought that progress.  Although we have 

come far, it is also true that we have further to go to achieve a healthy economy, and I am 

certain that small businesses will continue to play a critical role in reaching that 

objective.  

I am honored to be addressing the owners of 53 small businesses whose 

excellence exemplifies the enormous contributions that millions of small businesses 

collectively make to our economy.  You come from different places and have achieved 

success in a wide variety of ways, but you all share the entrepreneurial spirit that has 

always been central to our nation’s prosperity.  We at the Federal Reserve are keenly 

aware of your vital role, and we pledge to continue to do our part in promoting the 

recovery so that you can continue to help America grow and prosper.  

Thank you.
