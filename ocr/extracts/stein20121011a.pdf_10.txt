weaker is likely to be the response of aggregate spending to further downward pressure 

on long-term rates.11  

The corporate-finance example is also consistent with what we have observed in 

markets in recent months.  Issuance of both investment-grade and high-yield bonds has 

been robust.  Indeed, domestic nonfinancial corporate bond issuance is on pace to set a 

record in 2012, and the speculative-grade segment may also register a new high for the 

year.  At the same time, a large fraction of issuance has been devoted to refinancing--

either to retiring existing debt or to payouts to equity holders via dividends and share 

buybacks.  These uses of proceeds have accounted for about two-thirds of all issuance by 

speculative-grade firms so far this year.  Such patterns are what one would expect in a 

world of segmented markets and negative term premiums.12 

This caveat about the diminishing effectiveness of LSAPs can be thought of as a 

specific version of Goodhart’s law.13  It may be that under normal circumstances, 

changes in 10-year rates have significant explanatory power for economic activity, 

perhaps because they are a proxy for the expected future path of short rates or other 

aspects of financial conditions.  But it doesn’t follow that when one sets out to influence 

                                                 
11 If the term premium starts out significantly positive, so that long-term rates are well above expected 
future short rates, an initial reduction may indeed spur further investment among financially constrained 
firms who need to issue long-term bonds to fund new investment.  However, once the term premium 
becomes negative, we hit a corner where the financial constraint no longer binds and the relevant 
opportunity cost becomes the option to invest in short-term securities or repurchase shares.  Baker, Stein, 
and Wurgler (2003) model an analogous diminishing-returns effect for stock prices and corporate 
investment. 
12 As borrowing costs have fallen, Federal Reserve staff estimates of the expected return on the stock 
market (using a model based on analysts’ earnings expectations) remain near historic highs.  It is this 
divergence in the costs of debt and equity that is likely to make debt-financed repurchases of equity 
attractive.   
13 Goodhart’s original formulation is that “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once 
pressure is placed on it for control purposes.”  See Goodhart (1975).
