benefits, there is no presumption that the optimal tax should be large, only that it may be 

non-zero, and that it may make sense for it to differ across asset classes.   

Can Existing Regulatory Tools Be Used to Tax SFTs Efficiently? 

With this last observation in mind, my next step is to run through a number of our 

existing regulatory instruments, and in each case ask: to what extent can the instrument at 

hand be used efficiently to impose a Pigouvian tax on an SFT, either one of the dealer-as-

principal type or one of the dealer-as-intermediary type? As will become clear, the 

answer can depend crucially on both the structure of the transaction as well as the nature 

of the underlying collateral involved.   Also, I should emphasize that nothing in this 

exercise amounts to a judgment on the overall desirability of any given regulatory tool. 

Obviously, even if risk-based capital requirements are not particularly helpful in taxing 

SFTs, they can be very valuable for other reasons.  I am asking a different question: to 

what extent can the existing toolkit be used—or be adapted—to deal with the specific 

problem of fire-sale externalities in SFTs? 

1. Risk-based capital requirements 

Current risk-based capital requirements are of little relevance for many types of 

SFTs.  In my Example 1, where the dealer firm holds a corporate bond as a principal and 

finances it with repo borrowing, there would be a capital charge on the corporate bond, 

but this capital charge is approximately independent of whether the corporate bond is 

financed with repo or with some other, more stable, form of funding.  So there is no tax 

on the incremental fire-sale risk created by the more fragile funding structure.9   

                                                 
9 To be more precise, under Basel III capital rules, there is a small risk-based capital requirement on the 
repo liability.  This requirement is driven by counterparty credit risk, not liquidity risk, and is independent 
of the term of the repo borrowing.  The basic idea is that the repo borrower has to hold a little bit of capital
