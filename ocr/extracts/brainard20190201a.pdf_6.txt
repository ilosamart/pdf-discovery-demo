afternoon, I look forward to hearing the conversation on the effectiveness of the CRA, past, 

present, and future. 

I have had opportunities to hear directly from stakeholders in a variety of settings, 

kicking off with a community development visit in Baltimore last April and most recently in 

Denver, at our first regional roundtable.4  The Denver roundtable was attended by state member 

banks and was hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  I appreciated the robust 

conversation among knowledgeable individuals whose work touches on the CRA every day.  

Sitting around a table together provided an opportunity for me to hear community bankers reflect 

on what has worked well for their communities and what they see as challenges, and to provide 

thoughtful suggestions on what they think might work best going forward.  It was also helpful to 

be exposed to some differences of views.  The best approach to implementing the CRA in 

today’s environment is a complex issue, so I value hearing a wide range of suggestions.   

In closing, I want to reiterate my own commitment to strengthening the CRA, which is 

widely shared across the Federal Reserve System.  We aim to promote more CRA activity, not 

less.  We think that simplifying and clarifying the regulations while strengthening local 

community engagement will help us accomplish that goal.  Thank you for your help in this 

process.
