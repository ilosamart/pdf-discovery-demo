quality ratings if it was applied to different portfolios. 

Ratings upgrades 

 I also believe that when conditions warrant a change in CAMELS ratings, the update 

should take place as quickly as possible.  It is always important to promptly identify problem 

banks and make use of all supervisory tools to foster their recovery.  But I believe that as a bank 

stabilizes and demonstrates improvement, we should ensure that examiners move just as 

promptly to assign ratings that reflect the improved financial and managerial condition of the 

bank and free it from restrictions that could delay the bank’s return to prudent lending activity.  

Encouraging Creative Supervisory Approaches to Emerging Problems 

 So far, I have talked mainly about making adjustments to conventional supervisory 

approaches.  In some cases, however, I think it might make sense to challenge some of our 

traditional thinking. 

 The first area that I think could benefit from a fresh approach is our requirement for the 

active marketing for sale of properties acquired in foreclosure, often called real estate owned, or 

REO, properties.  While existing statutes and regulations do not prohibit financial institutions 

from renting REO properties, supervisory guidance encourages sales as the primary disposition 

tool.  The problem with this requirement in the current environment is that having banks, 

servicers, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration all following the 

same approach with thousands of properties on the market at the same time may actually be 

exacerbating the slump in housing prices.   

 Our research suggests that if lenders were permitted in some cases to rent residential 

REO property rather than sell it at fire-sale prices, it could better balance rental and owner-
