firms are forced to lay off workers who, in turn, lacking financial reserves, sharply cut 

their own spending.  Financial stress in the nonfinancial sector--for example, higher 

default rates on mortgages or corporate debt--can also damage financial institutions, 

creating a potential adverse feedback loop as they reduce the availability of credit and 

shed assets to conserve capital, thereby further weakening the financial positions of 

households and firms. 

The vulnerabilities of the nonfinancial sector can potentially be captured by both 

stock measures (such as wealth and leverage) and flow measures (such as the ratio of 

debt service to income).  Sector-wide data are available from a number of sources, 

importantly the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds accounts, which is a set of aggregate 

integrated financial accounts that measures sources and uses of funds for major sectors as 

well as for the economy as a whole.

  These accounts allow us to trace the flow of credit 

from its sources, such as banks or wholesale funding markets, to the household and 

business sectors that receive it.   

The Federal Reserve also now monitors detailed consumer- and business-level 

data suited for picking up changes in the nature of borrowing and lending, as well as for 

tracking financial conditions of those most exposed to a cyclical downturn or a reversal 

of fortunes.  For example, during the housing boom, the aggregate data accurately 

showed the outsized pace of home mortgage borrowing, but it could not reveal the 

pervasive deterioration in underwriting that implied a substantial increase in the 

underlying credit risk from that activity.
