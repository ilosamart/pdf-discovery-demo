• Registered securities of the U.S. government
and federal agencies thereof;

• Securities that have not been assigned CUSIP
numbers; and,

• Bond coupons.

Securities exempt from the inquiry require-
ments are:

• Securities received directly from the issuer or
its agent at issuance;

• Securities received from another reporting
institution or from a Federal Reserve Bank or
branch;

• Securities received from a customer of the
reporting institution in the name of the cus-
tomer or nominee; and,

Reporting Lost, Missing, Stolen or
Counterfeit Securities

Form X-17F-1A must be filed with the SIC
within one business day after the discovery of:

• A theft or loss of any security, when there is a
substantial indication of criminal activity;

• A security that has been lost or missing for
two business days; or

• A security that is counterfeit.

The form must be filed within two business
days of notification of nonreceipt when
(1) delivery of securities sent by the branch is
made by mail or by draft and payment is not
received within ten business days and confirma-
tion of nondelivery has been made by the
receiving institution and (2) delivery is made in
person and no receipt is maintained by the
branch. If securities sent by the branch, either in
person or through a clearing agency, are lost in
transit and the certificate numbers of the secu-
rities can be determined, the branch must supply
the receiving institution with the certificate num-
bers of the securities within two business days
from the date of the request from the receiving
institution. The delivery of lost or missing
securities to the branch must be reported within
one business day after discovery and notification
of certificate numbers. Securities that are con-
sidered lost or missing as a result of counts or
verifications must be reported no later than ten

business days after discovery or as soon as
certificate numbers can be ascertained.

Copies of all reports required to be filed under
17 CFR 240.17F-1 must also be submitted to the
registered transfer agent for the issue being
reported and, if criminal activities are suspected,
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Copies of
filed or received Forms X-17F-1A must be
maintained in an easily accessible place for
three years.

CONSUMER COMPLIANCE
REGULATIONS

Since the late 1960s, Congress has enacted a
number of consumer protection and civil rights
laws directly related to the activities of financial
institutions. Traditionally, these laws have been
enforced by the domestic institution’s primary
federal regulator; for example, the Board of
Governors conducts consumer compliance
examinations for state member banks. More
recently, as part of the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991,
Congress expanded the authority of the Board
and other federal banking agencies to enforce
consumer statutes for certain types of FBOs.

Specifically, the Federal Reserve System is
responsible for enforcing consumer laws in the
case of state-licensed agencies and state-licensed
uninsured branches of FBOs, commercial lend-
ing companies owned or controlled by FBOs
and organizations operating under section 25 or
25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (Edge Act and
Agreement corporations). In addition, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency is respon-
sible for conducting these examinations for
federally-licensed, uninsured branches of FBOs
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
is responsible for federally-insured branches of
FBOs.

The scope of a typical compliance examina-
tion for these institutions includes the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collec-
tion Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the
Expedited Funds Availability Act. The degree to
which FBOs operating in the U.S. conduct
activities covered by these laws and regulations
vary, but often these institutions conduct far
fewer such activities than a typical domestically-
chartered bank.
