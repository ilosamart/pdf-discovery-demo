     Note:  This figure depicts simulation results of the Federal Reserve Board staff’s FRB/US model of the U.S. economy.  The left 
panel shows the path of the federal funds rate under the baseline scenario corresponding to market expectations (solid line) and under 
an alternative “later lift-off” scenario (dashed line).  The right panel shows the unemployment rate (solid line) and the core personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate (dashed lines), expressed as deviations of the alternative scenario from baseline.
