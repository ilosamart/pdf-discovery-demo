Conclusion 

The combination of technologies that put vast computing power, rich data sets, and 

artificial intelligence onto simple smartphone apps together with important research into 

consumer financial behaviors has great potential to help consumers navigate their complex 

financial lives more effectively, but there are also important risks.  I am hopeful that fintech 

developers, data aggregators, bank partners, consumers, and regulators will work together to 

keep consumers in the driverâ€™s seat as we move forward with these new technologies.  If we 

work together effectively toward this goal, the fintech stack may be able to offer enormous 

benefits to the consumers they aim to serve, while appropriately identifying and managing the 

risks.
