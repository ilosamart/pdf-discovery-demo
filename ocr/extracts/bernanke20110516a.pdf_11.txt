research to commercial application to the ultimate economic benefits can be very long.  

The Internet revolution of the 1990s was based on scientific investments made in the 

1970s and 1980s.  And today’s widespread commercialization of biotechnology was 

based, in part, on key research findings developed in the 1950s.  Thus, governments that 

choose to provide support for R&D are likely to get better results if that support is stable, 

avoiding a pattern of feast or famine.19   

Government support for R&D presumes sufficient national capacity to engage in 

effective research at the desired scale.  That capacity, in turn, depends importantly on the 

supply of qualified scientists, engineers, and other technical workers.  Although the 

system of higher education in the United States remains among the finest in the world, 

numerous concerns have been raised about this country’s ability to ensure adequate 

supplies of highly skilled workers.  For example, some observers have suggested that 

bottlenecks in the system limit the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in 

science and engineering:  Surveys of student intentions in the United States consistently 

show that the number of students who seek to major in science and engineering exceeds 

the number accommodated by a wide margin, and waitlists to enroll in technical courses 

have trended up relative to those in other fields, as has the time required to graduate with 

a science and engineering degree.20  Moreover, although the relative wages of science 

and engineering graduates have increased significantly over the past few decades, the 

share of undergraduate degrees awarded in science and engineering has been roughly 

stable.21  At the same time, critics of K-12 education in the United States have long 

argued that not enough is being done to encourage and support student interest in science
