clearing and settlement process involved employees from 60 banks crisscrossing each 

other’s paths through the city streets to present checks, a time-consuming process filled 

with “confusion, disputes and unavoidable blunders.”1  The establishment of the 

clearinghouse improved the situation almost immediately, resulting in significant savings 

in time, effort, and financial costs.2  By the late 19th century, check clearinghouses had 

been established across the United States.3  Large segments of the financial system came 

to rely on the efficiency and integrity of daily settlements by the clearinghouses.  Indeed, 

as these institutions developed, the roles of clearinghouses and clearinghouse 

associations--the groups of firms that used and supported individual clearinghouses--went 

well beyond purely operational functions:  In the years prior to the establishment of the 

Federal Reserve, to increase public confidence in banks, clearinghouse associations at 

times took on quasi-governmental supervisory functions--for example, by examining the 

financial condition of members rumored to be experiencing difficulties--and even served 

at times as lender of last resort to individual clearinghouse members. 

 In the securities and derivatives markets, the story unfolded a bit later and was 

more complex than in the case of checks.  Nevertheless, many of the essential themes are 

the same.  In 1892, on the centennial of the famous Buttonwood Agreement, the New 

York Stock Exchange took its first steps to improve clearing and settlement by creating a
