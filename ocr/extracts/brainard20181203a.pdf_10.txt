Before the collection of the TRACE data, there was limited insight into this area of the 

market, which made it difficult to assess the significance of such innovations.   

No doubt there are other innovations that have yet to be assessed.  Recently, the 

debate over liquidity has turned toward the participation of proprietary trading firms in 

the off-the-run segment of the market, an area outside of their traditional domain.  All-to-

all and direct-streaming platforms are also attempting to establish a foothold in the off-

the-run segment by offering new services.  I look forward to further analysis as the 

structure of the market continues to evolve. 

Keeping Up 

As the Treasury market has evolved, the public sector has had to evolve as well in 

order to keep up.  Many of the recommendations in the Joint Staff Report have now been 

implemented.  Our colleagues at Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 

FINRA deserve credit for the work to begin collecting Treasury transaction data on 

FINRA’s TRACE system.  My hope is that you will take away from my remarks, along 

with those of my colleagues from other agencies, a comprehensive picture of how all of 

the IAWG agencies are using the data to work through the many issues that intersect with 

our various policy missions and mandates. 

As the market continues to innovate and the broader financial environment 

continues to shift, we will maintain our focus on the resilience of the Treasury market 

specifically and the financial system more broadly.12  In this regard, the staff at the 

Federal Reserve continues to work on important issues raised by the events of October 

                                                 
12 Flash events that have occurred in recent years include, but are not limited to, the first “flash crash” in 
U.S. equity markets on May 6, 2010; the Treasury flash rally of October 15, 2014, the flash event in U.S. 
equity markets on August 24, 2015; the pound flash crash on October 7, 2016; and the turbulence in U.S. 
equity and VIX markets on February 5, 2018.
