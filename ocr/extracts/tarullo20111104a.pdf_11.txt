international agreement like Basel III.  But for this very reason, it is important that there be 

ongoing attention to the issue, in order to share ideas for action and monitor the steps various 

jurisdictions are taking to mitigate the risks.   

For example, we in the United States need to move forward with changes to money 

market funds and triparty repo markets to ensure that they do not serve as a trigger for wholesale 

funding runs.  We also need to address further the issues raised by the dependence of some 

foreign banking institutions on large amounts of wholesale dollar funding.  The responses to 

these issues may themselves involve a mix of national and international measures.   

 A third priority is the area of OTC derivatives, where strong capital standards alone are 

not enough to contain systemic risks.  We know that OTC derivatives dealers, as a byproduct of 

that business model, become part of a global network of interconnected exposures.  When one 

dealer in the network fails, as we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers, fear of losses at other 

dealers in the network can cause systemic stress.  Capital, which covers only a fraction of 

exposure, cannot alone prevent this contagion. 

To reduce the systemic risk of OTC derivatives, the Group of Twenty (G-20) leaders 

have agreed to mandate that standardized OTC derivatives must be cleared through a central 

counterparty.  Work in the United States is well under way to implement mandatory clearing.  

Other countries have begun this work as well, but progress abroad has been slow to date.  To 

help ensure that a global move toward central clearing of derivatives actually reduces systemic 

risk, it is critical that central counterparties in the derivatives market be very sound and stable.  

Therefore, it is essential that the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the 

International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) complete their important work 

on strengthening the oversight of central counterparties as soon as possible.
