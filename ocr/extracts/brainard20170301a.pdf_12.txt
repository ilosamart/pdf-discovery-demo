effect of the balance sheet on the economy during and after the Global Financial Crisis.8  

Thus, the subordination strategy will likely be appropriate in most circumstances, but we 

cannot completely rule out special circumstances in which the complementary use of both 

tools may prove compelling.   

 Assuming that a subordination strategy is adopted, and the balance sheet is set to 

shrink passively and predictably once reinvestment ceases or is phased out, there is some 

uncertainty around the size of the balance sheet when it returns to normal, which the 

Committee has described as “no larger than necessary for the efficient and effective 

implementation of monetary policy.”   

There are good reasons to expect a normalized balance sheet to be considerably 

smaller than its current size but larger than its pre-crisis level.  Most obviously, trend 

growth in the demand for currency gradually pushes up the size of the balance sheet over 

time, but there are also other reasons to expect the post-crisis new normal to be larger 

than pre-crisis levels.  The structural demand for reserves may be considerably larger 

now than prior to the financial crisis because of a number of changes, including new 

regulations that favor safe liquid assets and changes in financial institutions’ attitudes 

toward risk.9  If the demand curve for reserve balances has shifted out, then a greater 

supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.  Moreover, the 

supply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to 

accommodate unexpected shocks to the demand and supply of reserves.  To accomplish
