while the Upwork study finds that freelancing is more prevalent among the young.  The 

earnings experiences of contingent workers appear to span a wide range.  Katz and 

Krueger find that those engaged in contingent work tend to be concentrated in the highest 

income quintiles.  But while independent contractors and contract workers earn relatively 

high wages, on-call and temporary-help work tends to occur among workers in lower 

wage quintiles.  

One common theme that emerges is the desire to earn extra money, which is a 

primary motivation for 74 percent of part-time, and 68 percent of full-time, freelancers in 

the Upwork survey.  Similarly, in the EIWA survey, 65 percent of informal workers 

reported that earning income was their main reason for engaging in informal and 

contingent work, and the EIWA provides many examples that corroborate this result.11  A 

full-time restaurant cook in his 50s, reports that he does yard work and sells items both 

online and offline to earn extra income and to help family members.  He averages 60 

hours per month from side and gig work and reported that these earnings constitute 75 

percent of his householdâ€™s monthly earnings.  Similarly, a respondent in her 20s works 

part time as a dental hygienist and supplements this employment with about 8 hours per 

month of additional gig work.  She said that the gig work somewhat mitigated the effect 

of the Great Recession, which found her working fewer hours, with stagnant wages and a 

loss of benefits. 

For others, work-life balance considerations seem to play a significant role in 

choosing contingent work arrangements.  For example, a mother in her 20s reported 

spending 12 hours per month selling self-crafted items online, babysitting, and 

                                                 
11 The responses to the survey were anonymous and confidential.
