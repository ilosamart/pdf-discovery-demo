issue, in part, through appropriate disclosure about the supervisory stress test.  We have 

published information about the overall framework employed in various aspects of the 

supervisory stress test, but not the full details that banks could use to manage to the test.  

This--making it easier to game the test--is the potential negative consequence of transparency 

that I alluded to earlier. 

We also value different approaches for designing scenarios and conducting stress tests.  

In the United States, in addition to supervisory stress testing, large financial firms are required to 

conduct their own stress tests, using their own models and stress scenarios that capture their 

unique risks.3  In evaluating each bank’s capital planning process, supervisors focus on how well 

banks’ internal scenarios and models capture their unique risks and business models.  We expect 

firms to determine the risks inherent to their businesses, their risk-appetite, and to make business 

decisions on that basis.  

And that is a good place to stop.   

Thank you. 

                                                           
3 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that are 
supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency are required to conduct an annual company-run stress 
test.  However, only bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to the 
supervisory stress test and an evaluation of their capital planning process.
