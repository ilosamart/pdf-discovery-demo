I are honored to carry this message forward.  The economy benefits when we successfully tap 

into the underutilized potential of more of our fellow Americans.5  

Thank you, Janet, for everything that you accomplished as Chair and over a lifetime of 

public service that thankfully continues today.  And congratulations, Ariel, for what you have 

accomplished in service to others, which has made you such a deserving recipient of this award.
