understanding the challenges Americans face and why a multitude of voices and approaches are 

needed to address them.  

In my remarks today, I’d like to focus on the consumer protection and credit accessibility 

aspects of financial inclusion, and some of the ways that the Federal Reserve promotes a fair and 

transparent consumer financial services marketplace.  In recent speeches, I have emphasized my 

view that we should aim for an effective safety and soundness regulatory approach that is as 

efficient, transparent, and simple as feasible.2  I consider these principles to apply equally to our 

consumer protection supervision program; that is, we should also strive to promote consumer 

protection with as much efficiency, transparency, and simplicity as possible.  I believe that a 

commitment to these principles is not only compatible with financial inclusion, but in fact helps 

promote it.  Regulatory burden can make it harder for institutions to serve their customers and 

communities.  This is especially the case for community banks and minority depository 

institutions (or MDIs), which play an important role in serving the needs of their local 

communities, including historically underserved populations.  I’d also like to share some 

thoughts on an area to which I have devoted a good portion of my career: the importance of 

small business access to credit, which is a critical part of financial inclusion and a catalyst for 

economic growth in local communities.   

Financial Inclusion 

Let me start with the foundation of why financial inclusion is important.  In broad terms, 

financial inclusion means access to affordable financial products and services that meet the needs
