To review, all in all, the state of the economy is good.  The question now is how 

persistent this step-up in growth will prove to be.  In the FOMC’s most recent Summary 

of Economic Projections, released in December, growth was expected to remain fairly 

solid in 2018 before moving down toward a longer-run rate of 1-3/4 percent.3  I do not 

view this forecast as particularly optimistic, but it is as reasonable as any other if one 

conjectures that the factors that have held back growth in recent years will remain in 

effect.  But now that the economy is coming off several quarters of relatively robust 

growth, I would like to examine the appropriate level of confidence in this conjecture 

and, in particular, identify what we might look for if, in actuality, some of the factors that 

have held back growth over the past decade begin to dissipate.  Before doing so, let me 

first quickly review some of the most frequently cited explanations for the slow pace of 

growth in the post-crisis period. 

Why Has Growth Been So Slow through Much of the Post-crisis Period?       

Why has growth been so slow over much of the past decade?  I will break down 

the explanations into two broad categories:  those related to the lingering after-effects of 

the crisis--for example, increased uncertainty and precaution--and those that are more 

structural and less clearly linked to the crisis, such as demographics and low productivity 

growth.   

It is certainly true--as pointed out most notably by Reinhart and Rogoff in 2009--

that recoveries from severe financial crises can be very prolonged and painful.4  In the

have on economic growth.
