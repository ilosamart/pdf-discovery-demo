safety and soundness examination process is continuous, and anti-money-laundering and BSA 

compliance is incorporated into the examination process.  

When we find that a bank has not adopted a program and procedures that properly meet 

the bank’s BSA obligations, the matter is discussed with bank management and noted in the 

institution’s report of examination.  The Federal Reserve’s enforcement actions under the BSA 

typically are aimed at correcting deficiencies in an organization’s policies and procedures for

Federal Reserve cooperates with other agencies in various enforcement actions, including by
