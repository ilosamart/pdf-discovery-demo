 Beginning in the 1970s, the separation of traditional lending and capital markets activities 

began to break down under the weight of macroeconomic turbulence, technological and business 

innovation, and competition.  The dominant trend of the next 30 years was the progressive 

integration of these activities, fueling the expansion of what has become known as the shadow 

banking system, including the explosive growth of securitization and derivative instruments in 

the first decade of this century.   

 This trend entailed two major, and related, changes.  First, it diminished the importance 

of deposits as a source of funding for credit intermediation in favor of capital market instruments 

sold to institutional investors.  Over time, these markets began to serve some of the same 

maturity transformation functions as the traditional banking systems, which in turn led to both an 

expansion and alteration of traditional money markets.  Ultimately, there was a vast increase in 

the creation of so-called cash equivalent instruments, which were supposedly safe, short-term, 

and liquid.  Second, this trend altered the structure of the industry, both transforming the 

activities of broker-dealers and fostering the emergence of large financial conglomerates. 

 Though motivated in part by regulatory arbitrage, these developments were driven by 

more than regulatory evasion:  Such factors as the growth and deepening of capital markets and 

the rise of institutional investors as guardians of household savings accelerated the fracturing of 

the system established in 1933.  Whatever the relative importance of these causal factors, 

however, one thing is clear:  Neither the statutory framework for, nor supervisory oversight of, 

the financial system adapted to take account of the new risks posed by the broader trend.  On the 

contrary, regulatory change for the 30 years preceding the crisis was largely a deregulatory 

program, designed at least in part to address the erosion of banksâ€™ franchise value caused by the 

rapid growth of credit intermediation through capital markets.
