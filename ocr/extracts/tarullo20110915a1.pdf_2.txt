In previous speeches I have called on researchers to devote more attention to 

investigating economies of scale and scope in financial services.  This conference provides the 

ideal occasion and audience for me to elaborate on that request and, indeed, to expand it by 

suggesting a broader range of topics on which the questions and perspectives of Industrial 

Organization (IO) may be relevant to financial economists probing the nature of systemic risk 

and the causes of financial crises.  Before addressing this subject directly, let me take a few 

minutes to place it in the context of the changes in regulatory focus motivated by the financial 

crisis. 

The familiar, ―microprudential‖ approach to regulation focuses on risk within individual 

firms.  The ability to borrow at a risk-free rate conferred by deposit insurance, combined with the 

limited liability that is standard in corporate structures, presents banks with incentives to take on 

socially inefficient risks.  This well-known moral hazard problem traditionally has been 

addressed through regulation and supervision directed specifically at protection of the deposit 

insurance fund.  Thus, for example, traditional bank holding company regulation was actually 

fairly narrowly defined:  It sought to protect insured depository institutions from the risks of their 

uninsured affiliates and to limit use of insured deposits to fund activities in other parts of the 

holding company.  The potential effects of an individual bank’s behavior on the financial system 

as a whole--much less that of a bank holding company or unregulated financial firm--were 

generally not addressed in prudential regulatory laws and only unevenly considered in 

supervisory practice. 

Of course, the picture was not quite so monolithic as I have just portrayed it.  The moral 

hazard associated with too-big-to-fail institutions, which worried some researchers and a handful 

of supervisors, was a concern that touched upon the stability of the financial system more
