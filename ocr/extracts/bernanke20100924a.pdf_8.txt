factor of 2-1/2 in the four years before the crisis, and a good deal of this expansion 

reportedly funded holdings of relatively less liquid securities. 

In the historically familiar bank run during the era before deposit insurance, retail 

depositors who heard rumors about the health of their bank--whether true or untrue--

would line up to withdraw their funds.  If the run continued, then, absent intervention by 

the central bank or some other provider of liquidity, the bank would run out of the cash 

necessary to pay off depositors and then fail as a result.  Often, the panic would spread as 

other banks with similar characteristics to, or having a financial relationship with, the one 

that had failed came under suspicion.  In the recent crisis, money market mutual funds 

and their investors, as well as other providers of short-term funding, were the economic 

equivalent of early-1930s retail depositors.  Shadow banks relied on these providers to 

fund longer-term credit instruments, including securities backed by subprime mortgages.  

After house prices began to decline, concerns began to build about the quality of 

subprime mortgage loans and, consequently, about the quality of the securities into which 

these and other forms of credit had been packaged.  Although many shadow banks had 

limited exposure to subprime loans and other questionable credits, the complexity of the 

securities involved and the opaqueness of many of the financial arrangements made it 

difficult for investors to distinguish relative risks.  In an environment of heightened 

uncertainty, many investors concluded that simply withdrawing funds was the easier and 

more prudent alternative.  In turn, financial institutions, knowing the risks posed by a run, 

began to hoard cash, which dried up liquidity and significantly limited their willingness 

to extend new credit.3
