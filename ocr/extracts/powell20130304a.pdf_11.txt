Assessing Progress on Too Big to Fail 

It seems to me that efforts by U.S. and global regulators to fight too big to fail are 

generally on the right track.  The Basel III and Dodd-Frank reforms designed to reduce the 

probability of failure of large banking firms are sensible and, for the most part, targeted at the 

causes of the crisis.  They are being implemented thoughtfully and effectively.   And I believe 

that those Financial Stability Board and Dodd-Frank reforms designed to permit the resolution of 

systemic firms without taxpayer exposure or undue disruption are very promising.  That said, 

much of the work lies ahead. 

The critics also deserve a fair hearing.   

Criticism of the current U.S. and global anti-too-big-to-fail policies generally takes one of 

two tacks.  Some of the criticism argues that Dodd-Frank--particularly the OLA mechanism-- 

enshrines taxpayer bailouts.  I do not believe that it does.  OLA requires by its terms that the 

losses of any financial company placed into FDIC receivership be borne by the private sector 

stockholders and creditors of the firm.  Single point of entry can work without exposing 

taxpayers to loss.

the Financial Stability Board in November 2011 as a new international standard that sets out the core elements of an 

effective special resolution regime for systemically significant financial firms.
