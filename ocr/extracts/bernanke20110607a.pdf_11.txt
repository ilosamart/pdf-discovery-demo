conditions are currently hurting the wheat crop in Kansas.  Over the past year, droughts 

have also afflicted Argentina, China, and France.  Fortunately, the lag between planting 

and harvesting for many crops is relatively short; thus, if more-typical weather patterns 

resume, supplies of agricultural commodities should rebound, thereby reducing the 

pressure on prices. 

Not all commodity prices have increased, illustrating the point that supply and 

demand conditions can vary across markets.  For example, prices for both lumber and 

natural gas are currently near their levels of the early 2000s.  The demand for lumber has 

been curtailed by weakness in the U.S. construction sector, while the supply of natural 

gas in the United States has been increased by significant innovations in extraction 

techniques.5  Among agricultural commodities, rice prices have remained relatively 

subdued, reflecting favorable growing conditions. 

In all, these cases reinforce the view that the fundamentals of global supply and 

demand have been playing a central role in recent swings in commodity prices.  That 

said, there is usually significant uncertainty about current and prospective supply and 

demand.  Accordingly, commodity prices, like the prices of financial assets, can be 

volatile as market participants react to incoming news.  Recently, commodity prices seem 

to have been particularly responsive to news bearing on the prospects for global 

economic growth as well as geopolitical developments.   

As the rapid growth of emerging market economies seems likely to continue, 

should we therefore expect continued rapid increases in the prices of globally-traded 

commodities?  While it is certainly possible that we will see further increases, there are 

                                                 
5 As natural gas is difficult to transport overseas, the increased supplies of natural gas in North America 
have not translated into significantly lower prices abroad.  In the first quarter of 2011, natural gas prices in 
the United States were less than half of those in Germany.
