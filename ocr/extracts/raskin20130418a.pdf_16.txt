keeping its primary policy instrument, the federal funds rate, at an exceptionally low 

level; by supplementing this move with forward guidance about the funds rate; and by 

initiating unconventional policy actions such as large-scale asset purchases.  One channel 

through which these policies operate is by putting downward pressure on longer-term 

interest rates, thereby encouraging firms to invest in plants and equipment and helping 

enable households to purchase cars and other durable goods and also to refinance their 

mortgages.  Lower interest rates also support the prices of homes and other assets, which 

can lead to additional spending.  The resulting boost to demand leads firms to hire and 

invest further, strengthening the economy as a whole.  To be sure, every household is 

different, and the particular mix of assets, skills, and opportunities that each has will 

determine how much it is able to share in the recovery.  But accommodative monetary 

policy that lifts economic activity more generally is expected to increase the odds of good 

outcomes for American families.  

Of course, it is also relevant to consider whether the unusual circumstances--the 

outsized role of housing wealth in the portfolios of low- and middle-income households, 

the increased use of debt during the boom, and the subsequent unprecedented shocks to 

the housing market--may have attenuated the effectiveness of monetary policy during the 

depths of the recession.  Households that have been through foreclosure or have 

underwater mortgages or are otherwise credit constrained are less able than other 

households to take advantage of the lower interest rates, either for homebuying or other 

purposes.  In my view, these effects likely clogged some of the channels through which 

monetary policy traditionally works.  As the housing market recovers, though, I think it is 

possible that accommodative monetary policy could be increasingly potent.  As house
