activity.  In contrast, experience using the balance sheet as an active tool has been very 

limited and largely confined to a highly unusual period around the Global Financial 

Crisis, when short-term interest rates were constrained by the zero lower bound.  

Predictability, parsimony, precision, and clarity of communications all would seem to 

argue in favor of focusing policy on a single active tool that is most familiar.  In short, it 

makes sense to focus policy on the tool whose effects are better understood by both 

policymakers and the public in circumstances where the tools are largely substitutes for 

one another.   

Even with this subordination strategy, however, there may be limited 

circumstances in which the balance sheet might be employed in a manner that is 

supportive of the short-term rate.  Most obviously, during the period when the balance 

sheet is running down, if the economy encounters adverse shocks, it may be appropriate 

to commence the reinvestment of principal payments again in order to preserve 

conventional policy space if the federal funds rate were to drop below some threshold 

level, perhaps similar to the “well under way” threshold. 

More broadly, although the two tools can achieve roughly similar effects, they are 

different, and we cannot rule out that there may be special circumstances in which these 

differences may be particularly valuable.  In particular, these differences may be an 

important consideration in circumstances when the transmission of changes in the short-

term rate to long-term rates and other financial market variables and the real economy is 

impeded.  In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the 

balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-

term rate.  Some observers believe that such signaling was an important contributor to the
