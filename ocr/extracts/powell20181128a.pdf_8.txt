A New Framework for Monitoring Systemic Risks  

Innovation and risk-taking contribute to the dynamism of our financial system and 

our economy.  As Hyman Minsky emphasized, along with the many benefits of 

dynamism comes the reality that the financial system will sometimes evolve toward 

excess and dangerous imbalances.6  This reality underscores the vital importance of the 

second part of post-crisis reform:  monitoring for emerging vulnerabilities.  

As laid out in our new Financial Stability Report, we have developed a 

framework to help us monitor risks to stability in our complex and rapidly evolving 

financial system.  The framework distinguishes between shocks, that is, trigger events 

that can be hard to predict or influence, and vulnerabilities, defined as features of the 

financial system that amplify shocks.  The report is organized around four broad 

vulnerabilities that have been prominent in financial crises through the centuries.  Each of 

these vulnerabilities is often found to some degree even in healthy market-based systems, 

and there is not, at present, any generally accepted standard for assessing at what level 

the vulnerabilities begin to pose serious stability risks.  In lieu of such a standard, we flag 

cases in which the vulnerabilities rise well beyond historical norms, and then form 

judgments about the stability risks those cases present.  

The first vulnerability is excessive leverage in the financial sector.7  If a highly 

leveraged segment of the financial system is buffeted by adverse events, the affected 

entities may all need to deleverage at the same time by selling assets, leading to what is 

called a “fire sale.”  Both the resulting decline in asset prices and the impaired ability of 

the segment to play its role in the economy can amplify the effects of a downturn.  We
