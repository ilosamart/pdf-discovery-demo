community banks.  None of this matters, however, if this lending poses a risk to the health of the 

institutions or to the consumers who are their customers.  Community bankers argue that they 

never engaged in the sort of lending practices that led to the financial crisis.  And I think that in 

most cases, the evidence supports their claims.  However, as I mentioned earlier, data from the 

HMDA and Call Reports indicate that community bank lending does share some characteristics 

with subprime lending.  For example, community banks appear to charge higher rates on their 

mortgage loans.  And the maturity data in the Call Reports are consistent with variable-rate 

lending or balloon maturities on community banks’ mortgage loans.  

But looking for signs of stress in the performance of the loans reveals a stark difference 

between mortgage loans held by community banks and subprime loans.  Over the last several 

years as mortgage delinquencies reached record levels, the serious delinquency rate of mortgages 

held by community banks did not go much over 4 percent, far lower than the serious delinquency 

rates that climbed to almost 22 percent for subprime, fixed-rate loans and more than 46 percent 

for subprime, variable-rate loans.  In fact, over the last several years, on average, mortgages held 

by community banks outperformed even fixed-rate, prime loans, the best performing mortgage 

category.  I think this statistic by itself is a strong testament to the responsible lending practices 

of community banks. 

Balancing Regulatory Costs and Benefits 

 Community bankers tell us repeatedly that they didn’t engage in the problem lending that 

led to the recent crisis and shouldn’t be punished with expensive regulation.  I think the data I 

have presented here support the first claim that their lending didn’t cause the problem.  But 

crafting regulations to address the real problems that occurred in subprime lending without 

creating punitive burdens on community banks may prove to be quite difficult.
