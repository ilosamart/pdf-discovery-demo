their rounded net asset value (NAV) feature and the low risk tolerance of their investors.  

Options for further reforms being considered by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) include a mandatory floating NAV to mute the incentive for investors 

to be the first to redeem, capital buffers to allow funds to deal better with actual and 

potential losses while sustaining a stable NAV, and limits on redemptions both to provide 

more time for fund managers to address problems and to emphasize to investors that 

money market funds do not guarantee bank-like liquidity.3 

The triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market also continues to exhibit 

important vulnerabilities.  In particular, the settlement process for triparty repo trades 

continues to rely on massive amounts of intraday credit and, as a result, remains 

vulnerable to a decision by a clearing bank to withhold funding from a market participant 

in default or perceived as facing distress.  The FSOC has recommended reforms to deal 

with these problems, and an industry task force has taken some key initial steps in that 

direction--for example, by coordinating the implementation of a robust confirmation 

process for triparty trades.  But more needs to be done.  Indeed, given the centrality of 

this market to the financial system, taking further steps to reduce its vulnerabilities should 

be given a high priority.  

In addition to addressing the unfinished business from the financial crisis, 

financial stability authorities and market participants need to be alert to new structures 

and products, not just those that caused problems in the past.  New financial products--for 

example, exchange-traded funds and collateralized commercial paper--may foster more
