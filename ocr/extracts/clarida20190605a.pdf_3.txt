improved and inflation has remained quiescent.2  The paper by Professors Abraham and 

Haltiwanger provided us with an innovative search-and-matching model to estimate labor 

market slack—which complements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps 

and Phillips curve relationships.  On that same general topic, the panel discussion of 

national and community leaders moderated by Governor Brainard provided a valuable 

perspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from the aggregate 

statistics we often consult. 

Of course, notwithstanding what is taught in many U.S. macroeconomics courses, 

the United States is not a closed economy but is one of many nations engaged in global 

finance and economic commerce.  Professor Obstfeld’s paper examined the ways that 

global economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest—or r*—and 

the role played by the U.S. dollar in transmitting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy 

to other countries. 

In our final session yesterday, Professors Cecchetti and Schoenholtz assessed the 

Federal Reserve’s communication practices.  Based on interviews and conversations with 

market participants, academics, and former policymakers, Professors Cecchetti and 

Schoenholtz offered concrete suggestions for improving our most important 

communications vehicles. 

Our program today will feature papers by Lars Svensson on alternative monetary 

policy strategies, by Eric Sims and Cynthia Wu on the policy toolkit, and by Anil 

Kashyap and Caspar Siegert on the interplay between financial stability considerations 

                                                 
2 In January 2009, when longer-run projections were added to the Summary of Economic Projections, the 
midpoint of the central tendency for the longer-run normal unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.  In March 
2019, the median of the longer-run normal unemployment rate was 4.3 percent.
