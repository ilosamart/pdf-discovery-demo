only 1-1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and modest growth in revenue at the state 

and local level suggest continued limited gains going forward.  In addition, spending 

restrictions in the Budget Control Act and the winding down of defense spending related 

to Afghanistan and Iraq have led to restraint at the federal level, although there is some 

uncertainty on the federal budget outlook.   

In contrast to the considerable progress in the labor market, progress on the 

second leg of our dual mandate has been elusive.  To be clear, I do not view the 

improvement in the labor market as a sufficient statistic for judging the outlook for 

inflation.  A variety of econometric estimates would suggest that the classic Phillips 

curve influence of resource utilization on inflation is, at best, very weak at the moment.  

The fact that wages have not accelerated is significant, but more so as an indicator that 

labor market slack is still present and that workersâ€™ bargaining power likely remains 

weak. 

Overall inflation has been subdued, running persistently below our 2 percent 

target.  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased only 0.3 

percent over the 12 months ending in August.  Much of the weakness in this index can be 

explained by the drop in oil and energy prices over the past year.  Assuming energy 

prices stabilize going forward, as futures markets suggest, then energy should be a neutral 

or perhaps even a small positive influence on inflation next year.   

But inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy prices.  Over the 12 

months ending in August, core PCE prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of 

food and energy, increased 1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been 

around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since the beginning of 2013.
