It is a pleasure to be in Detroit.  I started my career working here in the Motor 

City, and I have followed the fortunes of this area with interest ever since.  A few years 

ago, I visited some of Detroit’s neighborhoods with our local officials at a time when 

damage from the crisis was still pervasive.  While challenges remain in many of the city’s 

neighborhoods, since that time the metropolitan area overall has seen signs of a rebound 

in business activity and investment, and the unemployment rate has continued to trend 

downward, recently falling to 4.3 percent.1 

This is similar to the nation’s economy more broadly.  While challenges remain 

for many, aggregate growth is strong, and the economy is meeting our full employment 

and inflation objectives.  Given the outlook, it comes as no surprise that the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) has been gradually raising interest rates from crisis-era lows 

and sees further gradual increases as likely to be appropriate in its most recent statement.2  

Before discussing the outlook, it might be useful to first explore some concepts that are 

important in informing the path of rates.    

What Is the Neutral Rate of Interest? 

In thinking about how we should set the federal funds rate, many policymakers 

and economists find the concept of the neutral rate of interest to be a useful frame of 

reference.  So, what does the neutral rate mean?  Intuitively, I think of the nominal 

neutral interest rate as the level of the federal funds rate that keeps output growing around 

its potential rate in an environment of full employment and stable inflation.3

savings are equilibrated at full employment--is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.
