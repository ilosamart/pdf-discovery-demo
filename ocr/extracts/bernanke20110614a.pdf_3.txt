expected to be about 69 percent at the end of this fiscal year, would under that scenario 

rise to 87 percent in 2020 and 146 percent in 2030.2  One reason the debt is projected to 

increase so quickly is that the larger the debt outstanding, the greater the budgetary cost 

of making the required interest payments.  This dynamic is clearly unsustainable. 

The nationâ€™s long-term fiscal imbalances did not emerge overnight.  To a 

significant extent, they are the result of an aging population and fast-rising health-care 

costs, both of which have been predicted for decades.  The Congressional Budget Office 

projects that net federal outlays for health-care entitlements--which were 5 percent of 

GDP in 2010--could rise to more than 8 percent of GDP by 2030.  Even though projected 

fiscal imbalances associated with the Social Security system are smaller than those for 

federal health programs, they are still significant.  Although we have been warned about 

such developments for many years, the difference is that today those projections are 

becoming reality. 

A large and increasing level of government debt relative to national income risks 

serious economic consequences.  Over the longer term, rising federal debt crowds out 

private capital formation and thus reduces productivity growth.  To the extent that 

increasing debt is financed by borrowing from abroad, a growing share of our future 

income would be devoted to interest payments on foreign-held federal debt.  High levels 

of debt also impair the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to future economic 

shocks and other adverse events.   

Even the prospect of unsustainable deficits has costs, including an increased 

possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis.  As we have seen in a number of countries recently, 

                                                 
2 The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (2010) projects federal debt to be 89 percent of GDP in 
2020 and 127 percent of GDP in 2030.
