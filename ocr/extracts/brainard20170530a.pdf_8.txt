another key measure--the prime-age employment-to-population ratio--remains more than 

1 percentage point below pre-crisis levels, and further improvement there would be 

welcome. 

The Outlook 

Looking at economic activity more broadly, although first-quarter gross domestic 

product (GDP) was soft, the data so far suggest a rebound in the second quarter.  The 

weak Q1 reading follows a recurring pattern in recent years, with the first quarter of the 

year often weaker than subsequent quarters.  Moreover, below the top-line number, there 

were some encouraging signs of strength:  Residential construction posted a double-digit 

increase and contributed 1/2 percentage point to first-quarter GDP growth.  Drilling for 

oil and natural gas is rebounding sharply, and nonresidential construction contributed 

3/4 percentage point to first-quarter GDP growth.  Business spending on equipment and 

intangibles, which fell slightly in 2016, rebounded to a 7 percent annualized increase in 

the first quarter and contributed another 3/4 percentage point to the overall increase.   

A key reason overall GDP was so weak last quarter was consumer spending, 

which rose only 0.6 percent at an annual rate.  Nonetheless, there are good reasons to 

think that the first-quarter weakness in consumer spending will not persist.  Household 

incomes should continue rising with the continued strengthening in employment and 

wages, home prices should be contributing through improved household balance sheets, 

and consumer sentiment remains upbeat.   

Recent changes in financial conditions have, overall, been supportive of further 

gains in the real economy.  The S&P 500 index is up almost 8 percent since the start of 

the year.  At the same time, a broad measure of the exchange value of the dollar is down
