colleagues on the FOMC and I are committed to just such an approach. 

In closing, the Federal Reserve’s mandate, like those of other central banks, is 

focused on the pursuit of domestic policy objectives.  This focus is entirely appropriate.  

Yet, experience has shown that the fortunes of the U.S. economy are deeply intertwined 

with those of the rest of the world.  Economic prospects for the United States are 

importantly influenced by the course of the world economy, and, by the same token, 

prosperity around the globe depends to a significant extent on a strong U.S. economy.  In 

order for the Federal Reserve to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and maximum 

employment, we must take account of these international linkages.  Indeed, the Federal 

Reserve has a long and varied history of doing so, including our actions during the global 

financial crisis.  There is every reason to expect that to continue.15  

Thank you.  I’ll be happy to take a few questions or comments.
