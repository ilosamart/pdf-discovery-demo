exchange rate systems among emerging market and developing economies.  However, 

none of us should underestimate the difficulties of managing the exchange rate and of 

developing knowledge about when and how much to allow the exchange rate to move in 

response to domestic and external economic shocks.   

Even beyond the management of the exchange rate, central banks in developing 

countries face difficult challenges in developing their monetary policy frameworks.  For 

many years, the standard International Monetary Fund approach to monetary policy--

which embodied the monetary approach to the balance of payments--emphasized money 

targets.  But this approach has become less tenable as economies have evolved and 

matured.  As you know, the effectiveness of such a framework depends, among other 

things, on the stability of the money demand function and on the structural relationship 

between monetary aggregates and macroeconomic variables.  These relationships tend to 

shift as the financial system develops, making money targeting frameworks less 

effective--as we know from the historical experience of monetary policies in advanced 

economies. 

For this reason, advanced economies abandoned them, and some emerging market 

economies followed suit, generally, in favor of inflation targeting frameworks, with 

short-term interest rates as the main instruments and the use of open market operations to 

control the liquidity in the economy.  However the conditions necessary for full-blown 

inflation targeting achieved through adjustment of policy interest rates may not be present 

in some of these economies.     

In the advanced economies and some emerging market economies, financial 

systems are relatively well developed, deep, and diversified, which facilitates the conduct
