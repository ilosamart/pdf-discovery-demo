levels for an “extended period,” the FOMC likely was able to keep long-term interest rates lower 

than would otherwise have been the case.   

To provide the public with more context for understanding monetary policy decisions, 

Board members and Reserve Bank presidents agreed in late 2007 to prepare more frequent 

forecasts covering longer time spans and explain those forecasts.  In January 2009, the 

policymakers also added information about their views of the long-run levels to which economic 

growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate were likely to converge over time.  The additional 

clarity about the long-run level for inflation, in particular, likely helped keep inflation 

expectations anchored during the crisis.  Had expectations followed inflation down, real interest 

rates would have increased, restraining spending further.  Had expectations risen because of 

concern about the Federal Reserve’s ability to unwind the unusual actions it was taking, we 

might have needed to limit those actions and the resulting boost to spending.   

Given the severity of the downturn, however, it soon became clear that lowering short-

term policy rates and attempting to shape expectations would not be sufficient alone to counter 

the macroeconomic effects of the financial shocks.  Indeed, once the Federal Reserve reduced the 

federal funds rate to zero, no further conventional policy easing was possible.  The Federal 

Reserve needed to use alternative methods to ease financial conditions and encourage spending.  

Thus, to reduce longer-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, the Federal Reserve initiated 

large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, specifically Treasury securities, agency 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency debt.  All told, the Federal Reserve purchased 

$300 billion of Treasury securities, about $175 billion of agency debt obligations, and $1.25 

trillion of agency MBS.  In the process, we ended up supplying about $1.2 trillion of reserve
