support during these early years, a child is ultimately more likely to drop out of school, 

earn lower wages, depend on government programs, or be incarcerated.1 

Consistent with this research, early childhood education programs aim to nurture 

healthy development from the earliest years.  Programs that provide enriched experiences 

for children and that also involve parents have shown to benefit children from all 

backgrounds, but they have the strongest influence on children from disadvantaged 

environments.2  Importantly, state preschool assessments have shown that early 

childhood education programs make children better prepared for school, a precursor of 

future success.3   

The benefits of early childhood programs are not just short-term in nature.  

Careful studies demonstrate that early interventions can have a positive effect on young 

children from low-income families that lasts well into adulthood.  For example, analysis 

of one program showed that children who attended a high-quality half-day preschool 

program at ages 3 and 4 were, at age 40, more economically successful--for example, 

more likely to own their own homes--than nonparticipants in a control group.4  In other
