preference for inflation either to be the only goal variable or to be lexicographically 

emphasized over unemployment.  But I do not regard that difference as very significant.  

There is no central bank that--in Mervyn King’s terminology--is an “inflation nutter.”10

Instrument independence is necessary because, without it, the central bank is 

unable to set the stance of monetary policy that it believes to be most consistent with 

achievement of the statutory mandate.  That said, there are, to be sure, degrees of 

instrument independence, and one can easily envisage central banks with considerable 

instrument independence whose actions on their instruments are constrained by law or by 

decisions by the treasury.  For example, in a country that has committed its central bank 

to enforce an exchange rate band (with the exchange rate free to move within the band),

the central bank will not be fully instrument independent, though it may have a 

substantial amount of independence with respect to the precise settings of the policy 

interest rate and other monetary tools.  

Historically, central banks were frequently created to finance public spending.  

However, these banks--such as those in Sweden and the United Kingdom--were later 

sometimes given their operational independence in part to create a greater separation of 

monetary policy from fiscal policy--in particular, in order to ensure that they would not 

be vulnerable to pressure to finance the government budget (that is, to monetize public 

spending). Around the world, the fear of the central bank losing its ability to meet its 

price stability goal may well have been the prime reason for governments to implement 

instrument independence.11
