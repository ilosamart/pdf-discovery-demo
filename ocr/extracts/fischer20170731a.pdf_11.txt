suggest that falling U.S. demand for foreign savings has precipitated the narrowing of the 

U.S. current account deficit.  U.S. demand likely decreased for the reasons discussed 

earlier, including slowing growth, demographics, and weak investment demand. 

Does the marked narrowing of the U.S. current account deficit post-crisis suggest 

that the United States has been the primary source of downward pressure on global 

interest rates over the past decade?  Certainly, if the United States had maintained its 

previous deficit, interest rates would likely be higher around the world.  However, the 

financial crisis revealed that the U.S. capacity to absorb global savings at the pace 

observed prior to the crisis was unsustainable.17  Rather, an alternative explanation would 

be that the sharp decline in global interest rates post-crisis reflects factors that were likely 

well in train before the financial crisis.  The downward trend in interest rates would have 

been more pronounced earlier in the decade had not elevated, and ultimately 

unsustainable, borrowing in the United States slowed the decline in interest rates in the 

years immediately preceding the crisis.  This narrative is consistent with empirical 

evidence that suggests that the slowdowns in global productivity growth and labor force 

growth, both key factors in the slowing pace of global growth and the downward pressure 

on interest rates, predate the global financial crisis.18 

It is notable in figure 6 that the euro area has also seen a sizable increase in its 

current account position post-crisis, suggesting that developments in Europe have also 

played a role in pushing down interest rates.  The increase in the euro-area current 

                                                 
17 This is not to suggest that the global saving glut was the only factor leading to the financial crisis.  
Rather, excessive risk-taking on the part of U.S. households and financial firms, along with structural 
defects in the structure of regulation and failures in supervision on the part of government regulators, also 
played a role.
