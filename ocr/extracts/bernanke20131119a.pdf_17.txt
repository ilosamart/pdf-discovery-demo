To the extent that this third factor--a perceived reduction in the Fed’s commitment 

to meeting its objectives--contributed to the increase in yields, it was neither welcome nor

the high degree of monetary accommodation needed to meet its objectives, as Committee 

participants emphasized in subsequent communications. 

At its September 2013 meeting, the FOMC applied the framework communicated

purchases was appropriate and fully consistent with the earlier guidance.  The Committee 

was looking for evidence that job market gains would continue, supported by a pickup in 

growth.  As it happened, the implications for the outlook of the evidence reviewed at the 

September meeting were mixed at best, while the ongoing fiscal debates posed additional 

risks.  The Committee accordingly elected to await further evidence supporting its 

expectation of continued improvement in the labor market.17  Although the FOMC’s 

decision came as a surprise to some market participants, it appears to have strengthened 

the credibility of the Committee’s forward rate guidance; in particular, following the 

decision, longer-term rates fell and expectations of short-term rates derived from

for continued gains.  We have seen meaningful improvement in the labor market since 

the latest asset purchase program was announced in September 2012.  At the time, the
