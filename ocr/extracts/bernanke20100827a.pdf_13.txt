stage is not whether we have the tools to help support economic activity and guard 

against disinflation.  We do.  As I will discuss next, the issue is instead whether, at any 

given juncture, the benefits of each tool, in terms of additional stimulus, outweigh the 

associated costs or risks of using the tool.  

Policy Options for Further Easing 

Notwithstanding the fact that the policy rate is near its zero lower bound, the 

Federal Reserve retains a number of tools and strategies for providing additional 

stimulus.  I will focus here on three that have been part of recent staff analyses and 

discussion at FOMC meetings:  (1) conducting additional purchases of longer-term 

securities, (2) modifying the Committee’s communication, and (3) reducing the interest 

paid on excess reserves.  I will also comment on a fourth strategy, proposed by several 

economists--namely, that the FOMC increase its inflation goals. 

 A first option for providing additional monetary accommodation, if necessary, is 

to expand the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.  As I noted earlier, 

the evidence suggests that the Fed’s earlier program of purchases was effective in 

bringing down term premiums and lowering the costs of borrowing in a number of 

private credit markets.  I regard the program (which was significantly expanded in March 

2009) as having made an important contribution to the economic stabilization and 

recovery that began in the spring of 2009.  Likewise, the FOMC’s recent decision to 

stabilize the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings should promote financial conditions 

supportive of recovery. 

 I believe that additional purchases of longer-term securities, should the FOMC 

choose to undertake them, would be effective in further easing financial conditions.
