consistently applied.  And it is important that compensation arrangements, including clawback 

and forfeiture provisions, cover risks associated with market conduct and consumer protection, 

as well as credit and market risks.  These kinds of improvements would give more precise 

signals to employees as to the risk calculus expected of them in making decisions that affect the 

firm.  I hope the long-awaited interagency final rule implementing section 956 of the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will be forthcoming in the not-too-

distant future, so as to provide a common objective baseline for incentive compensation 

programs. 

Beyond regulatory and supervisory requirements, however, there is obviously more that 

firms can do to use their compensation practices to encourage certain practices and conduct by 

employees.  For example, firms might reward employees with increased compensation or 

promotion not just for increasing revenues, but also for forestalling losses, such as by identifying 

non-obvious risks in proposed transactions or products.  In order to be effective signals, though, 

the fact of these rewards, and the standards under which they were granted, need to be 

transparent. 

Punishment systems provide the complement of negative incentives to the positive 

incentives created by compensation and promotion practices (even where qualified by clawback 

or similar provisions).  Here the role of the government differs.  With respect to positive 

incentives, regulators affect individuals only by way of requirements or expectations for firms.  

When it comes to disincentivizing egregious bad behavior, however, the government can play a 

more direct role.  Because of the required standard of proof and other constitutional protections, 

criminal prosecutions of individuals are harder to bring successfully than criminal prosecutions 

of firms.  But, as I think was learned decades ago when individuals were criminally prosecuted
