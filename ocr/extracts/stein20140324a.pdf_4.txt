   Both the Fundrise and Calvert 

Foundation examples hint at the potential of scaling up crowdfunding for community 

development.   

Many of you may be wondering, “Why is the Fed interested in this topic?”  First, 

at a fundamental level, it’s important for us to keep our finger on the pulse of financial 

innovation and the changing dynamics of the financial services industry--even in those 

parts of the industry where we do not have a direct regulatory role.  We know that 

financial innovation can offer both opportunities and pitfalls; by carefully and even-

handedly studying each new product or service at an early stage in its lifecycle, we can 

hope to better understand both the potential benefits, as well as any risks for adverse 

impacts on households and communities. Also, through convenings like today’s event 

and by sharing promising practices, the Federal Reserve System has a longstanding 

history of supporting local and regional community and economic development efforts 

that contribute to economic growth and employment.  To the extent that crowdfunding 

has the potential to bring new capital into low- and moderate-income communities, we 

want to be involved in helping the learning process along.   

As I mentioned earlier, many people associate crowdfunding with tech startups 

and art initiatives.  However, there may be ways that this new form of fundraising can be 

adapted to community development investing.  Given how wide open the issues are, 

today’s event is a working meeting with discussion groups.  We appreciate your 

willingness to share your time with us, and we look forward to benefiting from your 

insights. 

Thank you.
