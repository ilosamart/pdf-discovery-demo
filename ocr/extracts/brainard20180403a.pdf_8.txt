conditions.  Similar to the capital buffers, the liquidity buffers are greatest for those 

financial institutions that pose the greatest risks. Indeed, banks are holding buffers of 

HQLA in excess of their liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements. Our largest 

banking firms have increased their holdings of HQLA from 13 percent of assets in 2011 

to 20 percent in 2017 and have reduced their reliance on short-term wholesale funding 

from 36 percent of liabilities in 2011 to 29 percent in 2017.7

Just as our strengthened policy framework helps modulate vulnerabilities in the 

financial sector that could make the economy more vulnerable to shocks, so, too, our 

quarterly surveillance is intended to identify rising vulnerabilities early enough to be able 

to act to prevent disruptions that could damage the economy. In particular, the quarterly 

assessment of financial stability is a critical input into the Board’s processes for adjusting

the supervisory scenarios used in the stress test and the setting of the countercyclical 

capital buffer--the two tools that permit the Board to respond to vulnerabilities that build 

over time.

The supervisory stress test is intended to ensure that large banking institutions 

will be able to continue to function normally even under severely adverse 

macroeconomic conditions. It also assesses the resilience of the largest trading firms to 

risks of a large disturbance to global financial markets and the failure of the firms’ largest 

counterparty. These components reflect some of the key linkages through which the 

distress or failure of one firm could affect others, including direct credit losses as well as 

the severe financial disruptions that would be expected to accompany fire sales and an 

increase in risk aversion.
