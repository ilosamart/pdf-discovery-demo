Network analysis, yet another promising tool under active development, has the 

potential to help us better monitor the interconnectedness of financial institutions and 

markets.  Interconnectedness can arise from common holdings of assets or through the 

exposures of firms to their counterparties.  Network measures rely on concepts used in 

engineering, communications, and neuroscience to map linkages among financial firms 

and market activities.  The goals are to identify key nodes or clusters that could 

destabilize the system and to simulate how a shock, such as the sudden distress of a firm, 

could be transmitted and amplified through the network.  These tools can also be used to 

analyze the systemic stability effects of a change in the structure of a network.  For 

example, margin rules affect the sensitivity of firms to the conditions of their 

counterparties; thus, margin rules affect the likelihood of financial contagion through 

various firms and markets. 

Shadow Banking 

Shadow banking, a second area we closely monitor, was an important source of 

instability during the crisis.  Shadow banking comprises various markets and institutions 

that provide financial intermediation outside the traditional, regulated banking system.  

Shadow banking includes vehicles for credit intermediation, maturity transformation, 

liquidity provision, and risk sharing.  Such vehicles are typically funded on a largely 

short-term basis from wholesale sources.  In the run-up to the crisis, the shadow banking

from firms’ credit default swap spreads and equity prices to measure the implied cost of insuring a given 

firm against broader financial distress--an indicator of the vulnerability of the firm to systemic instability; 

see Xin Huang, Hao Zhou, and Haibin Zhu (2009), “A Framework for Assessing the Systemic Risk of 

Major Financial Institutions,” Journal of Banking and Finance, vol. 33 (November), pp. 2036-49.  The 

systemic expected shortfall uses firm equity prices, leverage, and volatility to measure the propensity of a 

firm to be undercapitalized given a marketwide decline in equity prices; see Viral V. Acharya, Lasse H.
