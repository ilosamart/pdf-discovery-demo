I am pleased to join the fourth annual conference on the evolving structure of the 

U.S. Treasury market.  Four years ago, the Treasury “flash rally” served as a wake-up 

call for regulators and market participants alike that the structure of the Treasury market 

had changed radically from the conventional view.  Since the surprising sharp spike in 

Treasury prices on October 15, 2014, the public sector has devoted significant effort and 

resources to monitoring the ongoing changes in the Treasury market.  The interagency 

working group’s (IAWG) Joint Staff Report on the events of October 15, the Treasury 

Department’s request for information on the report’s recommendations, and the 

subsequent collection of transactions data by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 

(FINRA) through its Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) system have 

offered us a much better understanding of this market.1   

But the market is not resting, and neither can we.  Even in the past year, much has 

changed in the Treasury market, and technology is continuing to drive rapid 

transformation in the competitive landscape.  I would like to talk about the changes we 

are seeing, what we are learning from the TRACE data, and emerging developments that 

are important to monitor.  In particular, I want to highlight an initiative that the Federal 

Reserve is considering to expand the public sector’s access to transactions data in order to 

help ensure the IAWG is able to keep up with the market.
