Thank you to Professor Scott for inviting me to join this discussion on cross-border 

resolution and risks of fragmentation.  Like many of my international counterparts in the 

audience, I maintain a deep commitment to cross-border banking and efficient movement of 

capital and liquidity, which are important contributors to long-term economic growth.  And it is 

with that commitment in mind that I have considered the topic of today’s conference: “ring-

fencing,” beginning with some reflections on what the term means.  Many here use the term to 

describe local capital and liquidity requirements, which are imposed ex ante on local subsidiaries 

and designed to protect those entities and their creditors from losses.  The term is also used to 

refer to disruptive actions taken by host regulators to seize assets in the moment of crisis.1  This 

type of ring-fencing occurs suddenly and unilaterally. 

Both uses of the term are associated with the risk arising from the stress or failure of a 

global financial institution; however, whether ring-fencing as I first defined it--prepositioning--is 

helpful or harmful in minimizing this risk depends on one’s perspective.  The views of different 

stakeholders tend to vary depending on whether one is seeking to maximize efficient allocation 

of resources in good times or minimize losses in stress and, importantly, whether one is a home 

or host regulator.  

Before the financial crisis, much of our collective orientation was on maximizing the 

efficient flow of capital across the globe.  This should remain a paramount goal.  Yet in the wake 

of the financial crisis, global regulators have understandably also focused on minimizing the cost 

of the failure of a global financial institution by mitigating the impediments to cross-border 

resolution.  The single-point-of-entry (SPOE) and bail-in concepts hold particular promise for 

                                                           
1  “Home regulator” refers to the prudential regulatory agency of the parent bank, and “host regulator” refers to the 
prudential regulatory agency of a foreign branch or subsidiary of the parent bank.
