not looking for further credit or (2) are more familiar with the opt-out process or both. 
Such individuals may be more familiar with the opt-out process because they have 
received more prescreened solicitations and, therefore, have had more opportunities to 
read the opt-out notice included in such solicitations. 

The Benefits and Costs of Receiving Written Offers 

The benefits to consumers of receiving prescreened written offers of credit or insurance 
are significant. Prescreened offers help consumers more quickly identify those credit and 
insurance products for which they likely qualify. (Because prescreened offers must be 
“firm offers” of credit or insurance, a consumer generally will receive prescreened 
solicitations for only those products for which he or she likely qualifies.) These 
prescreened offers also contain pricing and product information, often in a form easily 
comparable to accounts currently held. 

Consumer survey data analyzed by the Board indicate that consumers seem generally 
familiar with the type of content in written prescreened solicitations, even if they do not 
always open, read, or study each offer. When consumers do review the prescreened 
solicitations, they are most interested in the pricing information. The widespread 
availability of such pricing and product information contained in prescreened offers helps 
to make markets for these products more competitive, an advantage that benefits all 
consumers. 

The ability of creditors and insurers to tailor offers of credit or insurance to consumers’ 
pricing and product preferences at relatively low cost enhances competition and 
marketing efficiency. Also, by having access to credit record information for the 
purposes of prescreening, creditors and insurers are better able to control certain risks 
related to offering these products. 

In a competitive market, cost savings for creditors and insurers translate into lower prices 
and wider credit and insurance availability for consumers, possibly benefiting those 
consumers who have traditionally been underserved. Additionally, because prescreened 
solicitations are widely used and must be “firm” offers of credit, consumers gain better 
awareness of available credit products and rates. 

Written prescreened solicitations for credit and insurance carry some potential costs, 
including the inconvenience of receiving unwanted mail, the possibility of identity theft, 
the possible loss of privacy, and the potential for additional debt burden. Although these 
issues are important considerations, it does not appear that restricting written offers of 
credit or insurance would mitigate these problems, and the alternatives to prescreening 
may even exacerbate some of them. For example, restricting the ability of creditors and 
insurers to send prescreened solicitations to qualified applicants could result in the receipt 
of more unsolicited and unwanted mail by consumers as companies are forced to use less-
efficient mechanisms to acquire customers.
