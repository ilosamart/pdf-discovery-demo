a disqualification.  Even those needing her skills and experience preferred less qualified 

workers without a long spell of unemployment.  That career, that part of Dorine’s life, 

had ended.   

For Dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant 

closures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage 

reductions.4  Jermaine Brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction 

worker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for 

odd jobs and temporary work.  He is doing better now, but still working for a lower wage 

than he earned before the recession.  

Vicki Lira lost her full-time job of 20 years when the printing plant she worked in 

shut down in 2006.  Then she lost a job processing mortgage applications when the 

housing market crashed.  Vicki faced some very difficult years.  At times she was 

homeless.  Today she enjoys her part-time job serving food samples to customers at a 

grocery store but wishes she could get more hours.   

Vicki Lira is one of many Americans who lost a full-time job in the recession and 

seem stuck working part time.  The unemployment rate is down, but not included in that 

rate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a full-time 

job.  As a share of the workforce, that number is very high historically.
