largest institutions to withstand economic stress (chart 14).  Bank deposits have grown 

substantially, thereby allowing many banks to reduce their dependence on more 

volatile wholesale funding (chart 15).  And, although loan balances have increased in 

recent months, they remain well below their peak levels, leaving banks with 

substantial liquidity.  Measures of credit stress such as reductions in nonperforming 

assets, delinquencies, and charge-off rates show steady improvement in credit quality.   

As a result, most banks are now actively seeking loan growth to improve their 

profitability.  In fact, competition for loans, along with an improving outlook for the 

economy, has caused lenders to ease their standards from the stringent ones applied 

during the recession.  In the area of business lending, the Federal Reserve’s latest 

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) (chart 16) 

and the Survey of Terms of Business Lending (chart 17) indicate improving conditions 

for corporate borrowers.1  To a lesser extent, but still showing some easing, are 

standards for small business and commercial real estate loans. 

In the household sector, I believe that high profile problems in the mortgage 

market may have distracted attention from a noticeable improvement in some 

measures of the household debt burden.  The total debt owed by households as a share 

of their income, which was rising through 2007, has been falling since then (chart 18).  

In addition, the ratio of household debt payments to income has dropped precipitously 

in recent years.  In a sign that consumers who still have debt are having less difficulty 

making their payments, delinquency and charge-off rates on credit card and auto loans
