the liquidity of the already illiquid underlying assets deteriorates even further.  Investors 

may not anticipate or recognize this problem until it is too late--the so-called liquidity 

illusion. 

Bank loan funds, which attract retail investors and offer daily liquidity, now total 

about $150 billion, or 20 percent of institutional leveraged loans outstanding (figure 11).  

The liquidity transformation provided by these funds has not created problems so far 

despite recent outflows from bank loan funds, but supervisors and market participants 

have raised valid concerns that stressful times could well bring large-scale redemptions 

and threaten runs (figure 12).  Chair Mary Jo White has made liquidity concerns 

regarding open-ended mutual funds a priority for the SEC.13  

While it is possible to observe the characteristics of cash market investments, it is 

far more challenging to assess comparable positions in the derivatives and secured 

lending markets.  Investors may take highly leveraged positions in leveraged loans 

through total return swaps and secured funding transactions, and a substantial buildup of 

these positions could present run and fire-sale risks if asset values started to fall.  Today, 

the evidence suggests that such positions are fairly limited, but challenges in

While some of these conditions evoke the pre-crisis bubble period and thus raise
