requirements for swaps transactions recognize this important point by allowing for 

delayed reporting of large “block trades” where immediate reporting could reveal and 

undermine a participant’s position and ultimately discourage market transactions, depth, 

and liquidity.  In this way, enhanced reporting and transparency requirements are being

effective systemic risk management demands more, and not less, data disclosure.

and the founding of the Federal Reserve.  A lesson from that episode, as relevant today as

weaknesses it revealed, governments around the globe are acting to improve financial 

stability and reduce the risks posed by a highly interconnected financial system.  These 

efforts, of course, must account for the costs of new rules and ensure that these costs are
