support--one of the conditions being that Heinze and his board step down.  These steps 

were largely successful in stopping runs on the New York banks.   

But even as the banks stabilized, concerns intensified about the financial health of 

a number of so-called trust companies--financial institutions that were less heavily 

regulated than national or state banks and which were not members of the Clearinghouse.  

As the runs on the trust companies worsened, the companies needed cash to meet the 

demand for withdrawals.  In the absence of a central bank, New York’s leading 

financiers, led by J.P. Morgan, considered providing liquidity.  However, Morgan and his 

colleagues decided that they did not have sufficient information to judge the solvency of 

the affected institutions, so they declined to lend.  Overwhelmed by a run, the 

Knickerbocker Trust Company failed on October 22, undermining public confidence in 

the remaining trust companies.   

To satisfy their depositors’ demands for cash, the trust companies began to sell or 

liquidate assets, including loans made to finance stock purchases.  The selloff of shares 

and other assets, in what today we would call a fire sale, precipitated a sharp decline in 

the stock market and widespread disruptions in other financial markets.  Increasingly 

concerned, Morgan and other financiers (including the future governor of the Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York, Benjamin Strong) led a coordinated response that included 

the provision of liquidity through the Clearinghouse and the imposition of temporary 

limits on depositor withdrawals, including withdrawals by correspondent banks in the 

interior of the country.  These efforts eventually calmed the panic.  By then, however, the 

U.S. financial system had been severely disrupted, and the economy contracted through 

the middle of 1908.
