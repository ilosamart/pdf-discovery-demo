has been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, 

as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices.  If the dollar and oil prices remain 

broadly stable going forward, inflation should move up over time to our 2 percent 

objective.   

When I was first exposed to macroeconomics in college, more than four decades 

ago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by the amount of slack in the 

economy.  But the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially 

over the years.  In addition, inflation depends importantly on the inflation expectations of 

workers and firms.  A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during 

the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in inflation, but 

are fairly constant, or anchored.  For both these reasons, inflation has become less 

responsive to cyclical changes in the economy.  We measure inflation expectations 

through surveys of forecasters and the general public, and also through market readings 

on inflation swaps and “breakevens,” which represent inflation compensation as 

measured by the difference between the return offered by nominal Treasury securities and 

that offered by TIPS.  Since mid-2014, these market-based measures have declined 

significantly to historically low levels.  Some of this decline probably represents lower 

risk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for much more heavily traded 

nominal Treasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation.  Some survey 

measures of inflation expectations have also trended down.  Given the importance of 

expectations for determining inflation, these developments deserve, and receive, careful 

attention.  While inflation expectations seem to me to remain reasonably well anchored, it
