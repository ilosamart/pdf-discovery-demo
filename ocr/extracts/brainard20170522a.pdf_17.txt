Conclusion 

We all have our work cut out for us in helping to understand the state of 

opportunity and inclusion for different groups and communities across our country, and 

ensuring that policy is informed by those important insights.  At the Federal Reserve, we 

will continue to navigate the recovery to ensure we reach and sustain our long-term goals 

of maximum employment and price stability.  We will remain attentive to the financial 

health of vulnerable households.  And we will remain committed to helping illuminate 

the specific challenges faced by low- and moderate-income communities around the 

country and to supporting banks and other financial institutions as they partner in 

strengthening these communities.  In all of these efforts, our work will be greatly 

strengthened by the cutting-edge research and policy insights of the outstanding group 

gathered here tonight.
