The final catalyst leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve was the severe 

Panic of 1907, which caused inflation-adjusted gross national product to decline by 12 

percent, more than two times the decline recorded during the Great Recession of 2007 to 

2009.9  After the panic ended, there was a broad sense that reform was needed, although 

consensus on the exact nature of that reform was elusive.  Some called for an institution 

similar in structure to the Bank of England at the time, with centralized power, owned 

and operated by the banking system.  Some wanted control to be lodged with the federal 

government in Washington instead.  Others proposed that power be distributed to 

regional bodies with no central or coordinating board.  Still others resisted any sort of 

central bank.10  This debate reflected the many and diverse interests in the United States--

farmers, laborers, businessmen, small-town bankers, big-city bankers, technocrats, 

populists, and more--that experienced different conditions across a large geographic 

expanse. 

The resulting institution was a compromise, created by the Federal Reserve Act in 

1913.  The Federal Reserve was not structured to be entirely private in its ownership and 

operation.  It was also not structured to have a single headquarters in Washington or New 

York with branches across the country, a structure that was proposed but failed to attract 

enough political support.  Instead, a more federated system was created, establishing the 

Federal Reserve Board in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks located around the 

country.
