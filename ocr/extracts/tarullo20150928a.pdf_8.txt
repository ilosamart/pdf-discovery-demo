Tailoring Capital Regulation 

 With only modest simplification of the always complex world of financial regulation, one 

can say that while capital requirements traditionally have differed significantly for different types 

of financial intermediaries, they have been relatively uniform for all firms classified as a 

particular type of intermediary.  As I mentioned at the outset, the variations in capital 

requirements might run contrary to the intuition that the risk of loss of a given portfolio of assets 

is the same no matter who owns them.  Of course, the direct explanation for the variations lies in 

part in institutional history, with different regulatory bodies having been given authority over 

different types of financial intermediaries.  Still, as we have seen, differences in the liability side 

of the balance sheet can in fact provide a good policy justification for having varying capital 

requirements among different types of financial intermediaries.   

Yet, as I will suggest in a moment, even if conventional differences are at least broadly 

justifiable (which, of course, is not to say that certain differences in any particular jurisdiction 

have been well-formulated in all their specifics), the fact that so many intermediaries have 

moved well beyond their traditional practices, products, and scope may warrant some 

qualification of conventional practice.  Conversely, the conventional regulatory principle of 

imposing more or less uniform capital requirements on a given form of intermediary might have 

seemed intuitively correct.  But one lesson regulators around the world have drawn from the 

crisis is that macroprudential considerations can sometimes argue for varying capital 

requirements among the same kind of intermediaries.   

 Let me address, then, some implications of the liability-side perspective on capital 

requirements for different forms of financial intermediaries.  Despite the focus of this session of 

the conference on nonbanks, I want to begin by noting how post-crisis changes in the Basel
