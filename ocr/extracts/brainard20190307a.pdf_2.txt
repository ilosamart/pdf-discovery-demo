While our economy continues to add jobs at a solid pace, demand appears to have 

softened against a backdrop of greater downside risks.  Prudence counsels a period of 

watchful waiting--especially with no signs that inflation is picking up.  With balance 

sheet normalization now well advanced, it will be appropriate to wind down asset 

redemptions later in the year.1 

The Modal Outlook 

Let me start by discussing prospects for the U.S. economy.  Policymakers tend to 

distinguish the most likely path, which I will refer to as the “modal” outlook, from risks 

around that path--events that are not the most likely to happen, but that have some 

probability of happening and that, if they do materialize, would have a one-sided effect.  

Both the modal outlook and the risks around it have important implications for monetary 

policy, but in somewhat different ways. 

Let me first discuss the modal outlook.  While the economy performed very well 

last year, I have revised down my modal outlook for this year, in part reflecting some 

softening in the recent spending and sentiment data. This softening could be a harbinger 

of some slowing in the underlying momentum of domestic demand.  In the initial 

estimate released last week, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a 2.6 percent 

annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2018.  However, the latest report on retail sales 

showed a sharp decline.  Analysts note that there is some reason to be skeptical of that 

report; it is subject to revision, and other data sources suggest a more muted 

movement.  Although the magnitude of the drop may be revised smaller, coming in the
