the involved branch and/or individual(s). In
addition, management should be reminded that
civil money penalties may be assessed or other
enforcement proceedings may be initiated against
regulatory report filers who are chronically late
or repeatedly file seriously inaccurate reports.

Branches should maintain efficient internal
systems and procedures to ensure that reporting
is made in accordance with the appropriate
regulatory requirements. They should develop
clear, concise, and orderly workpapers to sup-
port the compilation of data. Preparation of
proper workpapers not only provides a logical
tie between report data and the branch’s finan-
cial records but also facilitates accurate report-
ing and verification.

A branch’s internal control program for regu-
latory reports should ensure that all required
reports are submitted on time and are accurate.
The specific internal controls employed by a
branch to meet those objectives depend largely
on the volume of reports, the scope of a branch’s
operations, and the complexity of its accounting
system.

REQUIRED REGULATORY
REPORTS

This section describes the regulatory reports
required to be submitted by the branch to the
Federal Reserve. In addition to the list of reports
outlined below, the examiner should also review
the reports that monitor compliance with asset
maintenance requirements, which are applicable
under state law or are required for federally-
licensed or -insured branches. For additional
information on state requirements, refer to the
Summary of Key State Statutes in the appendix
of this manual.

Report of Assets and Liabilities of
U.S. Branches & Agencies of Foreign
Banks (FFIEC 002 and 002S)

All branches are required to file a report of
assets and liabilities (known as the call report),
as of the last day of each calendar quarter.
Details of the appropriate reporting guidelines,
along with the specific report form to be filed,
are found in the Instructions for Preparation
of the Report of Assets and Liabilities of

U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks
(FFIEC 002).

The branch should submit the completed call
reports to the appropriate supervisory agencies
no more than 30 calendar days after the report
date. The Federal Reserve acts as the collecting
and processing agent of the call report for the
federal supervisory authorities.

The examiner should carefully review the
report to ensure that all pertinent data has been
reported and is properly categorized in accor-
dance with the call report instructions. To review
a particular branch’s call report, the examiner
must first understand the branch’s accounting
methods and the information located in, and the
relationships between, the branch’s general led-
ger and subsidiary ledgers. Workpapers used in
the preparation of the report and supplementary
schedules will aid the examiner in understand-
ing the branch’s system.
