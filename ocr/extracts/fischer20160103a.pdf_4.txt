What determines r*?  Fundamentally, the balance of saving and investment 

demands does so.  A very clear systematic exposition of the theory of r* is presented in a

2015 paper from the Council of Economic Advisers.  Several trends have been cited as 

possible factors contributing to a decline in the long-run equilibrium real rate.  One a

priori likely factor is persistent weakness in aggregate demand.  Among the many reasons 

for that, as Larry Summers has noted, is that the amount of physical capital that the 

revolutionary IT firms with high stock market valuations have needed is remarkably 

small. The slowdown of productivity growth, which has been a prominent and deeply 

concerning feature of the past four years, is another factor reducing r*.6 Others have 

pointed to demographic trends resulting in there being a larger share of the population in 

age cohorts with high saving rates.7 Some have also pointed to high saving rates in many 

emerging market countries, coupled with a lack of suitable domestic investment 

opportunities in those countries, as putting downward pressure on rates in advanced 

economies--the global savings glut hypothesis advanced by Ben Bernanke and others at 

the Fed about a decade ago.8

Whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the long-run 

equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future episodes in which 

monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB will be higher than in the past.  Prior to the 

crisis, some research suggested that such episodes were likely to be relatively infrequent

front during a period of historically slow growth.
