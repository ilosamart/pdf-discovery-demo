exchanges and their clearing through central counterparties.10  Because clearinghouses 

are themselves subject to risk from counterparties and are important linchpins in the 

financial system, they must be regulated to ensure that they operate safely. 

Since the implementation of macroprudential supervision is a work in progress, I 

want to highlight several important design considerations.  The first relates to the 

appropriate balance between fixed rules and discretion--a question familiar from 

monetary and fiscal policy.  In both cases, we have learned that fixed rules offer distinct 

advantages.  In fiscal policy, automatic stabilizers have proven helpful in mitigating the 

amplitude of cyclical fluctuations.  They trigger fiscal support when needed in a timely 

and predictable way.  In the realm of monetary policy, the Fed and other central banks 

commonly vary policy in a manner that researchers and market participants find 

predictable and systematic.  Indeed, guidance from policy rules is increasingly used in 

actual decisionmaking since rule-based recommendations create a sensible starting point 

for deliberations.  Rule-like behavior also aligns the expectations of markets and 

policymakers so that policy is transmitted quickly and effectively to the economy.  

Nevertheless, neither fiscal nor monetary policymakers rely on fixed rules alone. 

Discretionary fiscal policy has been helpful, even essential, in some instances in 

responding to economic fluctuations resulting from large shocks.  Similarly, in the realm 

of monetary policy, the Fed and other central banks certainly don’t slavishly follow 

prescriptions from any rule.  They retain discretion to deviate from such prescriptions 

when responding to severe shocks, unusually strong headwinds, or significant 

asymmetric risks.
