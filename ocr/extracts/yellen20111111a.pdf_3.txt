have created a new office called the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, 

which plays a key role in monitoring financial risks, analyzing the implications for 

financial stability, and identifying approaches for mitigating identified risks.      

Overview of the Macroprudential Approach 

The explicit incorporation of macroprudential considerations into our structure for 

financial regulation and oversight represents a major innovation in our thinking about 

how financial stability is most effectively achieved.  In contrast to the traditional, or 

“microprudential,” approach to regulation and supervision, which focuses on the safety 

and soundness of individual financial institutions, markets, and infrastructures, the 

macroprudential approach also calls for attention to the financial system as a whole.   

In particular, financial institutions are typically linked together in a complex web 

of relationships, and hence the sudden failure of a single institution can generate spillover 

effects on other firms and potentially place the entire financial system at risk.  Such 

externalities are most evident for very large institutions and financial market utilities but 

may also arise within a set of small or medium-sized firms that are engaged in activities 

with highly correlated returns.  Therefore, the macroprudential approach focuses on 

achieving financial stability by reducing systemic risk--that is, the risk of a financial 

disruption that is severe enough to inflict significant damage on the broader economy.  

Ideally, this approach is done through preemptive policies that restrain risks to the 

financial system before they develop into crises.   

Macroprudential policies address several forms of systemic risk.  One form of risk 

can be described as structural--such as the presence of systemically important financial 

institutions (SIFIs) or systemically important payment, clearing, or settlement
