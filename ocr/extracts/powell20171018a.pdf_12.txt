Summary 

Rapidly changing technology is providing a historic opportunity to transform our 

daily lives, including the way we pay.  Fintech firms and banks are embracing this 

change, as they strive to address consumer demands for more timely and convenient 

payments.  A range of innovative products that seamlessly integrate with other services is 

now available at our fingertips.  It is essential, however, that this innovation not come at 

the cost of a safe and secure payment system that retains the confidence of its end users.  

The examples I have drawn upon today highlight that fintech firms and banks must each 

play a role in assuring that enhancements to convenience and speed do not undermine 

safety and security.  More broadly, the Faster and Secure Payments Task Forces 

demonstrate the importance of broad and diverse stakeholder input, which are essential if 

the United States is to implement safe, ubiquitous real-time retail payments.  Working 

together, we can achieve a safe and fast payments system that meets the evolving needs 

of consumers and our dynamic economy.
