the leadership of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of the Dutch National Bank will be directing a 

considerable amount of energy to developing a cutting-edge framework for the identification and 

assessment of financial vulnerabilities.  Again, the principles of transparency and engagement 

will shape the work of the group.  It is important that a wide spectrum of financial participants be 

brought into the process, from banks and nonbank financial institutions to financial regulators to 

national authorities and multilateral standard-setting bodies and the broad academic community.  

This task is essential to the mission of the FSB; financial developments move at a rapid pace, and 

being able to quickly and accurately assess vulnerabilities is essential if we are to take action to 

prevent future crises.  

Analysis 

Finally, the FSB members must employ a critical eye toward the effects of the regulations 

that have been put in place.  Many of the reforms have been in place long enough for them to be 

evaluated.  We can judge whether reforms are having their intended effects and making the 

financial system more resilient.  Are any regulatory reforms causing unintended, adverse effects?  

Can we achieve the same, strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient, 

simple, transparent, and tailored?  The FSB must champion efficient and effective regulation in 

order to maintain public support for the progress we have made.  

Key Pieces of the FSB’s Work Plan 

Now I would like to turn to three prominent issues on the FSB’s agenda in 2019.  I will 

start with two relatively new issues that continue to evolve and grow in sophistication: nonbank 

financing and fintech, and then I will turn to the important work we are beginning on evaluating 

the effects of reforms aimed at ending too big to fail.
