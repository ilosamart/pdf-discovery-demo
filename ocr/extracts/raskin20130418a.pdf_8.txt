for, one reason may have been that many households in the middle and lower end of the 

income distribution, whose wage earnings were stagnant, did not recognize the long-run 

and persistent trends underlying their lack of income growth.5  If households thought they 

were merely going through a rough patch, it would have been quite reasonable for them 

to borrow money to smooth through it--to make home improvements, for example, or to 

send a child to college.6  At the same time, many people believed that the sharp increases 

in their home values had made them permanently richer and that house prices would 

never turn down, a belief that appears to have been shared by many households in the 

upper part of the income distribution as well.  In fact, purchasing a house using debt was 

a profitable investment in the early 2000s.  While it is hard to know with any certainty 

what these individual households believed at the time, it seems quite plausible to me, as 

others have argued, that stagnant wages and rising inequality, in combination with the 

relaxation of underwriting standards, led to an increase in the use of credit unsupported 

by greater income.7   

                                                 
5 In a separate line of inquiry on the social dynamics of spending, Bertrand and Morse (2013) find that 
moderate-income households spend more if they live in states with rapid spending growth among high-
income households, which suggests another channel for inequality to increase debt.  See Marianne Bertrand 
and Adair Morse (2013), “Trickle-Down Consumption,” NBER Working Paper Series 18883 (Cambridge, 
Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, March). 
6 In fact, recent research shows that these trends in annual inequality are mostly due to rising disparities in 
the component of a household’s income that is stable over time, rather than rising disparities in the 
component that varies from year to year.  See Jason DeBacker, Bradley Heim, Vasia Panousi, and Ivan 
Vidangos (2011), “Rising Inequality:  Transitory or Permanent?  New Evidence from a U.S. Panel of 
Household Income 1987-2006,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2011-60 (Washington:  Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December),

7 For example, Rajan (2010) has argued that rising inequality resulted in the relaxation of credit standards, 
which led to the financial crisis, and Kumhof and Ranciere (2011) present a model with such features.  
However, Bordo and Meissner (2012) look at data from 14 advanced countries and do not find a general 
relationship between inequality and credit booms.  Meanwhile, Bhutta (2011, 2012) finds that federal 
programs aimed at increasing homeownership only modestly increased the availability of mortgage credit 
to lower-income borrowers.  See Raghuram Rajan (2010), Fault Lines:  How Hidden Fractures Still 
Threaten the World Economy (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press); Michael Kumhof and Romain 
Ranciere (2011), “Inequality, Leverage and Crises,” CEPR Discussion Paper 8179 (London: Centre for 
Economic Policy Research, January), www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=8179.asp; Michael D.
