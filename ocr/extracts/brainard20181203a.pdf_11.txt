15, 2014.  Markets have been able to weather several episodes of short-lived market 

turbulence well in the past few years.  But the fact that sharp market movements--some 

on the order of seven or eight standard deviations outside the norm--can occur even in the 

absence of clear news drivers remains a concern and highlights the potential risks to 

financial stability posed by the high-speed transmission of price and liquidity shocks 

across multiple markets and trading venues.   

The TRACE data now allow us to monitor events when equity and bond markets 

move sharply.  For instance, take the turbulence in equity and bond markets on February 

5, 2018.  While trading volumes in both the electronic IDB and DTC market segments 

were markedly higher than average, some metrics of liquidity, such as market depth near 

the top of the order book on major electronic IDB platforms, deteriorated and remained 

low through the week.  The pattern of a spike in trading volumes followed by a persistent 

decline in market depth has been characteristic of three recent market turmoil episodes:  

(1) the Treasury flash rally on October 15, 2014; (2) the flash crash in the British pound 

on October 7, 2016; and (3) the spike in the VIX on February 5, 2018.13 Figure 6 shows 

this pattern for February 5, 2018.  These seemingly contradictory dynamics are easier to 

reconcile if the prevalent role played by high-speed electronic trading in the Treasury 

market is taken into account, particularly under stressed conditions.  As previously noted 

in the Joint Staff Report, high-speed market makers are able to manage perceived risks 

from sudden adverse price moves by greatly reducing the sizes of orders placed on 

electronic execution venues while, at the same time, increasing order placement rates as
