  These studies still leave 

open the possibility of considerable heterogeneity across firms, and that some firms are able to 

add considerable value in a given line of business by being very big, even if the average firm in 

the population is not.  And such heterogeneity alone is enough to create significant drawbacks to 

quantity-based regulation.  

 Consider the following example.  There are three banks:  A, B, and C.  Banks A and B 

both have $1 trillion in assets, while C is smaller, with only $400 billion in assets.  Bank A 

actually generates significant economies of scale, so that it is socially optimal for it to remain at 

its current size.  Banks B and C, by contrast, have very modest economies of scale, not enough to 

outweigh the costs that their size and complexity impose on society.  From the perspective of an 

omniscient social planner, it would be better if both B and C were half their current size.  

 Now let’s ask what happens if we impose a size cap of say $500 billion.  This size cap 

does the right thing with respect to Bank B, by shrinking it to a socially optimal size.  But it 

mishandles both Banks A and C, for different reasons.  In the case of A, the cap forces it to 

shrink when it shouldn’t, because given the specifics of its business model it actually creates a 

substantial amount of value by being big.  And in the case of C, the cap makes the opposite 

mistake.  It would actually be beneficial to put pressure on C to shrink at the margin--that is, to 

move it in the direction of being a $200 billion bank instead of a $400 billion one--but since it 

lies below the cap, it is completely untouched by the regulation. 

 Suppose instead we attack the problem by imposing capital requirements that are an 

increasing function of bank size.  This price-based approach creates some incentive for all three 

banks to shrink, but lets them balance this incentive against the scale benefits that they realize by 

staying big.  In this case, we would expect A, with its significant scale economies, to absorb the
