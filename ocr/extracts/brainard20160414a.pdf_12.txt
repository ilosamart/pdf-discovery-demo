Key Challenges Going Forward 

 Today, many industry participants are experimenting with distributed ledger 

technology in controlled, permissioned environments.  If some of these experiments bear 

fruit, it will be important to address the challenge of how they would scale and achieve 

diffusion.  In addition, determining exactly how the different distributed ledger 

technologies interoperate with each other, and legacy systems, will be critical.  New and 

highly fragmented “shared systems” may create unintended consequences even as they 

aim to address problems created by today’s siloed operations.  Since distributed ledgers 

often involve shared databases, it will also be important to effectively manage access 

rights as information flows back and forth through shared systems.  There may well be a 

tradeoff between the privacy of trading partners and competitors on the one hand, and the 

ability to leverage shared transactions records for faster and cheaper settlement on the 

other hand.  And of course, development of sound risk-management, resiliency, and 

recovery procedures will be necessary to address operational risks.  The Federal Reserve 

will continue to engage actively with the industry, stakeholders, and our regulatory 

colleagues as the industry works through these challenges and the technology evolves. 

I want to close by remembering a simple point that central bankers and markets 

have learned through hard lessons over many years.  The daily operation of markets and 

their clearing and settlement functions are built on trust and confidence.  Market 

participants trust that clearing and settlement functions and institutions will work 

properly every day.  Confidence has built over time that when market participants trade, 

accurate and timely clearing and settlement will follow.  Any disruption to this 

confidence comes at great cost to market integrity and financial stability.  This is a matter
