Bord of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  

Simple Rules may understate the case 
for keeping policy accommodative 


• Rules don’t adjust for a long period of policy 
restraint due to the zero lower bound. 

• Rules ignore the persistent headwinds that 
have been holding back recovery.   

– These headwinds imply an abnormally low 
equilibrium real funds rate.
