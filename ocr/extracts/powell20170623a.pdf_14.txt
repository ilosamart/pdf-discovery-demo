Other CCPs are also actively engaged in efforts to increase their efficiency.  FICC is 

looking at potential solutions using distributed ledger technology to clear both legs of overnight 

repo trades, which could allow for greater netting opportunities and thereby reduce potential 

liquidity needs.13  Several CCPs are also looking at ways to expand central clearing to directly 

include more buy-side firms, which could also offer greater netting opportunities.  Doing so 

could also offer new sources of liquidity if the new entrants are able to take part in the CCP’s 

committed liquidity arrangements.  Diversification of sources of liquidity would offer tangible 

benefits--CCPs would avoid relying on the same limited set of clearing members for all of their 

liquidity needs.  As one example, the Options Clearing Corporation established an innovative 

pre-funded, committed repurchase facility with a leading pension fund.   

As regulators, we should encourage innovations that increase clearing efficiency and 

reduce liquidity risks where they meet the PFMI and our supervisory expectations.   


Central Bank Accounts 

As I discussed earlier, CCPs have a complicated set of decisions on how and where to 

hold their cash balances.  Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Federal Reserve to 

establish accounts for DFMUs, and we now have accounts with each of the eight institutions that 

the Financial Stability Oversight Council has so designated.  These accounts permit DFMUs to 

hold funds at the Federal Reserve, but not to borrow from it.14  Allowing DFMUs to deposit

discount window only in unusual and exigent circumstances and only upon a majority vote of the Board of 
Governors following consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.
