slope of the relationship is as expected--countries in which current accounts worsened 

and capital inflows rose (shown in the left half of the figure) had greater house price 

appreciation over this period.18  However, in contrast to the previous slide, the 

relationship is highly significant, both statistically and economically, and about 

31 percent of the variability in house price appreciation across countries is explained.19  

This simple relationship requires more interpretation before any strong conclusions about 

causality can be drawn; in particular, we need to understand better why some countries 

drew stronger capital inflows than others.  I will only note here that, as more 

accommodative monetary policies generally reduce capital inflows, this relationship 

appears to be inconsistent with the existence of a strong link between monetary policy 

and house price appreciation. 

Conclusions and Policy Implications 

 My objective today has been to review the evidence on the link between monetary 

policy in the early part of the past decade and the rapid rise in house prices that occurred 

at roughly the same time.  The direct linkages, at least, are weak.  Because monetary 

policy works with a lag, policymakers’ response to changes in inflation and other 

economic variables should depend on whether those changes are expected to be 

temporary or longer-lasting.  When that point is taken into account, policy during that 

period--though certainly accommodative--does not appear to have been inappropriate, 

given the state of the economy and policymakers’ medium-term objectives.  House prices 

began to rise in the late 1990s, and although the most rapid price increases occurred when 

short-term interest rates were at their lowest levels, the magnitude of house price gains
