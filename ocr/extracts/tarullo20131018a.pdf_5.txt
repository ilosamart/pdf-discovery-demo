A final point is that a financial firm, through the operation of one or both of these 

dynamics, can shift from viable to non-viable in quite a short period of time.  And, once the 

confidence of counterparties and customers is shaken, and funding withdrawn, the game is 

essentially over.  Of course, matters are made worse if the firm did not maintain adequate capital 

levels or relied too heavily on short-term funding, as was the case with many of the firms that 

failed or came under severe pressure in 2008.  However, it is important to note that the nature of 

financial intermediaries means that even firms compliant with more rigorous capital and liquidity 

requirements could be faced with these dynamics in a tail event.   

To be credible, then, a resolution mechanism for large financial firms must be capable of 

dealing with these characteristics of financial markets.  This is the premise underlying Title II of 

Dodd-Frank, and I think it has also been the premise of thoughtful commentators who have 

proposed amendments to the Bankruptcy Code for application to large financial firms.3  There 

are three key features of Title II and, modified in certain respects, some of these Bankruptcy 

Code proposals reflect recognition of the peculiarities of financial markets in a way the current 

Bankruptcy Code does not.  

The first key feature of Title II, simply put, is speed.  It is vital that a resolving authority 

be able to move very quickly from non-resolution to resolution status, while maintaining 

continuity of operations.  As many of you will recall, during the financial crisis the makeshift 

arrangements crafted by governments in an effort to avoid large negative effects on financial 

markets were usually completed over a weekend.
