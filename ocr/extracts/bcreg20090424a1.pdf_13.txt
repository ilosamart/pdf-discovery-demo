supporting information supplied by the firms as part of the SCAP exercise. This work was informed by 

supervisory information and knowledge of the on-site examination teams at each of the participating 

BHCs. The objective was to evaluate the projections submitted by the firms and the approaches used to 

generate those numbers. A key aspect of this analysis was to understand the particular parameters and 

assumptions employed and their consistency with the macroeconomic scenarios provided, as well as the 

models and methodologies used to generate the loss and resource estimates. 

Aside f rom a direct review of the assumptions and models used in loss and resource projections 

submitted by the participating BHCs, the agencies developed independent benchmarks against which to 

evaluate the submissions. One set of benchmarks was the indicative loan loss rate ranges provided to 

firms prior to their preparing assessments of potential losses in their accrual loan portfolios under each 

macroeconomic scenario for the categories of loans on the SCAP template. The ranges are based on loss 

rate estimates calculated by the different supervisory agencies participating in the SCAP, using 

methodologies both currently in use by the agencies and some especially designed for this assessment. 

All the ranges are estimates, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the likely loss experience of large 

banking companies in stressful economic environments. 

The agencies used a variety of approaches to calculate indicative loss rates across the different 

types of loans. These approaches for residential mortgages included "micro" models of default and loss-

given-default built on information about individual loans, models based on the performance of regional 

mortgage loan portfolios, and analysis of mortgages held by failing banks. For other consumer loans and 

for commercial lending (including various types of commercial real estate lending), the agencies 

estimated loss rates using techniques such as regressions of historical charge-off or default data against 

macroeconomic variables such as home price appreciation and the unemployment rate and analysis of 

loan-level data derived f rom supervisory sources. A variety of other statistical analyses were applied to 

the historical experience at large BHCs to estimate loss rates and resource availability. 

These indicative loss rate ranges, although useful as general guides to aggregate banking sector 

losses, do not reflect important differences across firms that could affect performance and losses in 

significant ways. Thus, the agencies also developed more detailed benchmarks for losses and resources 

incorporating granular, firm-specific information on factors such as past performance, portfolio 

composition, origination vintage, borrower characteristics, geographic distribution, international 

operations, and business mix. These benchmarks were intended to provide a common background in 

discussions with the firms about their analysis and as additional information to help supervisors 

determine where results should be adjusted. 

As with the indicative loss rate ranges, these benchmarks also made use of models and 

approaches already in use to monitor risk and f irm condition as part of the on-going supervisory 

oversight process, as well as methods developed specifically for the SCAP exercise. These estimates 

drew on much of the same data provided by the participating BHCs as part of their SCAP submissions 

and were provided in response to specific requests from the supervisory teams. These supervisory 

benchmarks provided important information to the teams evaluating the BHC submissions, since the 

benchmarks were calculated using consistent methodologies across firms, while still incorporating 

detailed firm-specific information about the BHCs. 

The intent of the overall process was to bring together as much information as possible about 

the specific f i rm and empirical evidence on loss rates and resource availability in order to provide the 

best judgment on potential losses and revenues in economic conditions that are weaker than expected.
