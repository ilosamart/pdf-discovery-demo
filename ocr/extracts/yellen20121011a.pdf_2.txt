participate in this session on Japan’s role in the global economy.  Today, I will offer 

some reflections on factors holding back the recovery in advanced economies, the 

contribution that emerging Asia can make in boosting global growth, and the challenges 

facing Japan.  

We have seen marked differences in the strength of countries’ recoveries from the 

global financial crisis.  Most advanced economies are growing very slowly and operating 

well short of potential.  By historical standards, their performance is even more anemic 

that we would have expected, given the nature of the previous recession.  This shortfall 

likely reflects the unusually limited scope for fiscal stimulus at present, which very 

accommodative monetary policies have not been able to fully offset.  The recovery from 

the global recession of emerging market economies, especially in Asia, has been more 

robust, but even these economies are slowing in the face of weak global demand, and 

they would benefit from further progress toward a more balanced model of growth led by 

domestic demand.  Finally, until its tragic earthquake and tsunami, Japan was also 

recovering more rapidly than the other advanced economies.  But it, too, faces issues with 

the longer-run sustainability of its debt as well as other structural challenges that need to 

be addressed.   

The Weakness of the Recovery in the Advanced Economies 

The global financial crisis resulted in the most severe worldwide recession since 

the Great Depression.  Historically, such crises tend to leave persistent scars on the real 

economy, and the current weak recovery in the advanced economies appears to be no 

exception.   Economists at the Federal Reserve Board have added to the growing body of
