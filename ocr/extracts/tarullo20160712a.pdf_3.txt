financial activities and institutions that are most likely to pose risks to financial stability and to 

the economy more generally.1  Front and center among these risks is that of runnable liabilities.2  

As has been frequently observed, the recent financial crisis began, like most banking crises, with 

a run on short-term liabilities by investors who had come to doubt the value of the assets they 

were funding through various kinds of financial intermediaries.  The difference, of course, was 

that the run was not principally on depository institutions, as in the 1930s, but on asset-backed 

commercial paper programs, broker-dealers, money market funds, and other intermediaries that 

were heavily dependent on short-term wholesale funding.   

Lacking enough liquidity to repay all the counterparties who declined to roll over their 

investments, these intermediaries were forced into fire sales that further depressed asset prices, 

thereby reducing the values of assets held by many other intermediaries, raising margin calls, and 

leading to still more asset sales.  Those financial market actors who did have excess liquidity 

tended to horde it, in light of their uncertainty as to whether their balance sheets might come 

under greater stress and their reluctance to catch the proverbial falling knife by purchasing assets 

whose prices were plummeting with no obvious floor.

Runnables,” FEDS Notes, September 3, 2015, www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/the-
runnables-20150903.html: 

We define “runnables” as “pay-on-demand” transactions which embed defaultable promises made by 
private agents or state and local governments without explicit insurance from the federal government. A 
transaction is considered “pay-on-demand” if its term to maturity is short or the claimholder of the long-
term debt has a put option that can be exercised on short notice. In general, the pay-on-demand feature 
implies that in the event of stress--caused by credit-risk concerns, large swings in short-term interest rates, 
or deteriorations in market liquidity--investors may exhibit bank-run-like behavior by redeeming their 
shares, unwinding their transactions, or deciding not to roll over their positions.
