imposing increasingly higher haircuts, cutting the effective amount of funding available 

to borrowers.  In other contexts, lenders simply pulled away, as in a deposit run; in these 

cases, some borrowers lost access to repo entirely, and some securities became 

unfundable in the repo market.  In either case, absent sufficient funding, borrowers were 

frequently left with no option but to sell assets into illiquid markets.  These forced sales 

drove down asset prices, increased volatility, and weakened the financial positions of all 

holders of similar assets.  Volatile asset prices and weaker borrower balance sheets in 

turn heightened the risks borne by repo lenders, further boosting the incentives to demand 

higher haircuts or withdraw funding entirely.  This unstable dynamic was operating in 

full force around the time of the near failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008, and again 

during the worsening of the crisis in mid-September of that year.

Classic panic-type phenomena occurred in other contexts as well.  Early in the 

crisis, structured investment vehicles and many other asset-backed programs were unable 

to roll over their commercial paper as investors pulled back, and the programs were 

forced to draw on liquidity lines from banks or to sell assets.

  The resulting pressure on 

the bank liquidity providers, evident especially in the market for dollar-denominated 

loans in short-term funding markets, impeded the functioning of the financial system 

throughout the crisis.  Following the Lehman collapse and the “breaking of the buck” by
