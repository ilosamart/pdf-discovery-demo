inflation.  These actions were intended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest 

rates, support mortgage markets, and, more broadly, help foster financial conditions that 

would provide more support to economic growth. 

At the January FOMC meeting, with our current projections for economic activity 

and inflation in mind, the Committee decided that more accommodative financial 

conditions would be appropriate to help bring both inflation and unemployment back, 

over time, to levels viewed as consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run objectives 

mandated by the Congress.  The FOMC judged that economic conditions, including the 

outlook for low rates of resource utilization and subdued inflation over the medium run, 

are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 

2014, more than a year later than it had indicated in the postmeeting statements starting 

last August.  Extending the horizon of the forward guidance appeared to shift down 

investors’ expectations regarding the future path of the target federal funds rate.  If this 

expectation for low rates is realized, the federal funds rate will have remained near zero 

for a total of about six years, a historically unprecedented occurrence in the United States.  

Moreover, assuming that the FOMC follows the plans that we outlined in June 2011 for 

winding down the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, any initial sales of our securities 

holdings presumably would not begin until 2015, sometime after the first increase in the 

target federal funds rate.  

The Effects of Monetary Policy on Savers 

This extended period of depressed levels of economic activity and low interest 

rates will continue to have important implications for household income flows.  In 

particular, critics of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy are correct 

that the low level of interest rates represents a strain on households who rely on income
