The conference organizers have sorted through the many research questions that 

will be addressed today and tomorrow and have taken away three key observations that 

are fundamental to addressing the challenges related to the middle class.  

The first observation is to note the long-term decline in relative income growth 

and upward economic mobility for those in the middle.  According to a number of 

measures, income has grown more slowly for middle-class households since the 1970s 

than for those with higher incomes, resulting in wider income inequality.  The kind of 

generational improvements in living standards that were long the hallmark of the 

American middle class have steadily diminished.  In the 1950s, better than 80 percent of 

children born in middle-class households grew up to out-earn their parents, but more 

recently only around half do.  One factor in this decline is the increase in income 

inequality I just noted, and another is slower productivity growth.  This conference will 

touch on other possible reasons for this decline in upward mobility and relative income, 

such as changes in the prospects for career advancement that vary by occupation and 

location.   

The second observation is the widening gap in economic status and prospects 

between those with a college degree and those without one.  In the 1960s, well over 

90 percent of working-age men held a job, and there was very little difference in 

employment between those with or without a college degree.  While the share of college-

educated working-age men with a job has fallen from more than 95 percent in 1967 to 

around 90 percent in 2017, it has plunged for others.  Ninety-five percent of male high 

school graduates were working in 1967, but only about 80 percent of them were working 

as of 2017.  Among working-age men without a high school diploma, about 90 percent
