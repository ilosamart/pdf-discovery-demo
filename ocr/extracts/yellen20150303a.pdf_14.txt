increase of almost $500 billion in the strongest form of capital held by these companies.12  

Likewise, the Federal Reserve’s increased focus on liquidity has contributed to 

significant increases in firms’ liquidity.  The high-quality liquid assets held by these eight 

firms has increased by roughly one-third since 2012, and their reliance on short-term 

wholesale funding has dropped considerably.  

Beyond these very tangible gains, we see some evidence of improved risk 

management, internal controls, and governance at large firms.  But large firms still have 

room for improvement in this area, and supervisors will be watching closely.  The 

compliance breakdowns in recent years that I mentioned earlier in my remarks undermine 

confidence in large firms’ risk management and controls, which has implications for 

financial stability.  The Fed has taken and will continue to take swift and meaningful 

action to ensure that firms focus on their risk-management practices and continue to 

strengthen them. 

Both the Federal Reserve and the large firms we oversee have become more 

forward looking in evaluating these firms’ capacity to withstand significant financial 

stress, which has enhanced financial stability.  Much of this new perspective has come 

through our capital and liquidity reviews, which require both firms and supervisors to 

make financial projections into the future rather than simply relying on current and past 

performance.  Likewise, requiring firms to plan for their possible demise and orderly 

resolution has forced them to think more carefully about the sustainability of their 

business models and corporate structures.
