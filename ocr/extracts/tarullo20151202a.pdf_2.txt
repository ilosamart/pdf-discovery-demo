 On behalf of the Federal Reserve Board, let me join my colleagues from the other bank 

regulatory agencies in welcoming you to this sixth and final outreach meeting being held as part 

of the interagency review process under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork 

Reduction Act (EGRPRA).  As you know, EGRPRA requires the federal banking agencies to 

conduct a decennial joint review of our regulations to identify those that are outdated, 

unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.   

At the third outreach meeting this past spring, I suggested that we could regard the 

EGRPRA review as a success only if it leads to significant reduction in regulatory burden for 

smaller banks.  Over the course of this year, there has been a wide range of comments on a wide 

range of regulatory practices.  But many have been concentrated in what are obviously a few key

smaller community banks; modifying the information collected by Consolidated Reports of 

Condition and Income, the so-called “Call Report”; and updating certain regulations and

framework requires a degree of categorization, recordkeeping, and reporting that can be 

particularly costly for smaller community banks.  As I have publicly stated before, I believe that 

it is possible to develop a simpler set of capital requirements for smaller banks that will be
