maximum employment part of our dual mandate is straightforward:  The Congress has 

directed us to achieve the highest level of employment—and thus the lowest level of 

unemployment—that is consistent with price stability. 

While the Congress has specified the goals for monetary policy and a set of tools 

or authorities to pursue them, it has allowed the FOMC to determine how to best go about 

achieving those goals.   

Reviewing How We Conduct Monetary Policy

is at a 50-year low.  We are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to 

meet our goals for many years to come. 

We also want to make sure that the way we are setting monetary policy is keeping 

up with the way the economy is changing, which I have been referring to as the “new 

normal.”3  There are a few key features of that new normal.  For example, interest rates 

have stayed very low in recent years not only in the United States, but also in many other 

advanced economies.  For a variety of reasons, it seems likely that equilibrium interest 

rates will remain low in the future.  Low interest rates present a challenge for the 

traditional ways of conducting monetary policy.  That is especially true in recessions 

when, in the past, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage 

points in order to support household spending and business investment.  But when
