The financial crisis revealed important weaknesses in many areas of our financial 

system.  In response, governments around the world have undertaken a variety of far-

reaching regulatory reforms that, I would argue, can be grouped into three categories:  

those intended to strengthen institutions; those aimed at strengthening financial markets; 

and those that take steps to reinforce and, in some cases, build new market 

infrastructures. 

The reform effort seeks to address each of these areas in a comprehensive manner 

that recognizes the interplay among them.  For instance, enhanced capital and liquidity 

regulations will strengthen the ability of financial institutions to withstand both credit 

losses and liquidity shocks.  Stronger financial institutions, along with enhanced risk 

management and supervision, will strengthen market infrastructures.  And new rules to 

improve the functioning of markets, such as those that require greater transparency of 

over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets through trade repositories and swap 

execution facilities, will strengthen financial institutions and infrastructures alike.  

Moreover, greater post-trade transparency will improve competition and make it easier 

for market participants to make informed choices about which OTC derivatives are best 

suited to their needs. 

Today I will focus on the third aspect of this effort--reforms intended to 

strengthen financial market infrastructures.  Specifically, I will look at measures to 

improve the clearing of OTC derivatives through the expanded use of central 

counterparties (CCPs) and the introduction of margin requirements for those OTC 

derivatives that remain bilateral.  In the United States, several agencies are working 

together to implement these reforms.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
