with the public in December.  One of the themes that we hear in our interactions with community 

bankers is concern that the regulatory environment could be tailored more effectively for 

community banks, and the EGRPRA process gives all interested parties a voice in identifying 

areas where regulatory requirements may be disproportionate to risk.  I therefore encourage you 

to participate in this important process and hope you will raise any concerns and ideas you have.  

The Federal Reserve is committed to tailoring its supervisory practices as appropriate for 

community banks to reduce unnecessary burden, while still ensuring that community banks 

continue to operate in a safe and sound manner. 

I am looking forward to our conversation today and, in particular, am interested in 

hearing about topics that are of importance to you as you work to serve your customers, meet the 

credit needs of your communities, and thrive.
