undertaken by Upwork and the Freelancers Union that also uses an expansive definition 

of contingent work finds that 35 percent of the labor force engages in freelance work.9   

The Upwork survey provides further insight by subdividing the 35 percent of the 

labor force who have done some form of informal work over the past 12 months into five 

categories.  In the categories most comparable with the Katz and Krueger CWS 

categories, roughly 12 percent of the workforce identify as independent contractors who 

do not have an employer and engage in project-by-project work, whereas between 2 and 

3 percent are traditional contract or temporary workers who have a single employer or 

project at a time and whose work status is temporary.  By contrast, roughly half of the 

Upwork respondents do informal work in addition to traditional employment 

relationships; almost 10 percent derive their income from multiple different types of 

arrangements, including both traditional employment relationships and freelancing, while 

about 9 percent report having a full-time traditional job and “moonlighting” to gain 

additional income on top of that.  The group that derives income from multiple different 

types of jobs has evidenced the fastest growth over the last few years covered by the 

survey.  In addition, 2.5 percent identify as business owners. 

                                                 
     Some informal workers in the EIWA would not meet the definition of employment in the Current 

Population Survey (CPS) either because they did not do work in the CPS reference week (the EIWA asks 

about activities over the past six months, not during the reference week) or because they would not 

categorize the covered activities (such as the occasional selling of goods or renting of property) as work.  
9 The Upwork survey encompasses an expansive set of contingent work arrangements, even if only 

intermittent, over the past 12 months, and the EIWA encompasses a similar scope over the past 6 months, 

while Katz and Krueger confine their focus to the Current Population Survey reference week, similar to the 

BLS CWS.  In addition, the Upwork definition is similar to the EIWA in counting as informal workers 

those individuals with traditional full- or part-time work who also engage in some informal work, in 

contrast to Katz and Krueger and the BLS CWS, which try to differentiate those workers who 

predominantly engage in contingent work.
