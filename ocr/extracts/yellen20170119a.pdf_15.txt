utilization.19  The prescriptions of the balanced-approach rule in this figure, as with the 

solid red Taylor-rule plot, assume that R* equals 1 percent, consistent with the medians 

of the latest FOMC projections.  Because participants on average anticipate a modest 

undershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer-run level, the 

balanced-approach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several 

years than the Taylor rule.   

Figure 8 also reports results for a “change” rule, shown as the green long-dashed 

line.  As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal 

funds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to 

quarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well 

as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level.20  In 

contrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the 

longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of 

error.  Instead, it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that 

in theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R* is unknown.  Because both 

gaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so, the change rule 

calls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few 

years given the current outlook. 

                                                           
19 The balanced-approach rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋∗) + 1.0𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where all terms are defined as in 
the Taylor rule.  (See note 12 for details.)  As noted by Taylor (1999), research suggests that this rule may 
do a better job than the Taylor rule in stabilizing real activity and inflation. 
20 The change rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1 + 1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 2) + 2.0(𝑈𝑈∗ − 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡), where R is the federal funds rate, π is four-
quarter rate of core PCE inflation, U* is the projected longer-run unemployment rate, and U is the current 
unemployment rate.  In computing the prescriptions for the change rule shown in figure 8, the midpoint of 
the target range for the federal funds rate prior to the December 2016 FOMC meeting, 0.38 percent, is used 
as the starting point.  For a discussion of this rule (and of policy rules in general), see Taylor and Williams 
(2010).
