fiscal position may also constrain the flexibility of fiscal policy to respond to current 

economic conditions.  Accordingly, steps taken today to improve the countryâ€™s longer-

term fiscal position would not only help secure longer-term economic and financial 

stability, they could also improve the near-term economic outlook.  

Our fiscal challenges are especially daunting because they are mostly the product 

of powerful underlying trends, not short-term or temporary factors.  Two of the most 

important driving forces are the aging of the U.S. population, the pace of which will 

intensify over the next couple of decades as the baby-boom generation retires, and rapidly 

rising health-care costs.  As the health-care needs of the aging population increase, 

federal health-care programs are on track to be by far the biggest single source of fiscal 

imbalances over the longer term.  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 

projects that the ratio of federal spending for health-care programs (principally Medicare 

and Medicaid) to national income will double over the next 25 years, and continue to rise 

significantly further after that.3

The aging of the U.S. population will also strain Social Security, as the number of 

workers paying taxes into the system rises more slowly than the number of people 

receiving benefits.  This year, there are about five individuals between the ages of 20 and 

64 for each person aged 65 and older.  By 2030, when most of the baby boomers will 

have retired, this ratio is projected to decline to around 3, and it may subsequently fall yet 

  The ability to control health-care costs as our population 

gets older, while still providing high-quality care to those who need it, will be critical not 

only for budgetary reasons but for maintaining the dynamism of the broader economy as 

well.
