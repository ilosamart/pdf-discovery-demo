First, as in the case of servicing, contracts in private-label mortgage 

securitizations varied considerably from deal to deal, and there was no consistent 

language or standard for representations and warranties.  Therefore, a poorly 

underwritten mortgage loan could breach the representations and warranties of one deal’s 

contract but not be a violation of representations and warranties in another very similar 

deal; this discrepancy would only be apparent following a careful reading and nuanced 

comparison of the differences in drafting between the two contracts.  Given the volume 

of transactions investors were considering, it is not surprising that they may not have 

conducted a thorough analysis of the different risks each set of representations and 

warranties presented.  Second, the lack of standardization of representations and 

warranties gives rise to greater opportunity for parties in a failed securitization 

transaction to argue over the interpretation of contract terms, increasing legal uncertainty 

and making effective resolution of investor claims more difficult.  Finally, in order to 

enforce their representations and warranties, investors may need to band together in 

groups representing 25 percent or more of the voting rights in order to make certain 

demands upon the securitization trustee.  Investors may be dispersed and have difficulty 

coordinating their actions. 

The flaws in the representations and warranties provisions of the PSAs appear to 

be widely recognized.  For example, many key players in the securitization industry have 

worked through Project RESTART, an initiative of the American Securitization Forum 

(ASF), to create an industry standard for representations and warranties that covers 

prudent practices and is commonly understood by all market participants.
