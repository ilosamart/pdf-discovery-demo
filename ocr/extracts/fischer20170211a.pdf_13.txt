And what do I take from this episode?  The interest rate decision taken in August 

2011 was unusual in that a decision was made about the likely path of future interest 

rates.  Most often, the FOMC is deciding what interest rate to set at its current meeting.  

Either way, in reaching its decision, the Committee will examine the prescriptions of 

different monetary rules and the implications of different model simulations.  But it 

should never decide what to do until it has carefully discussed the economic logic that 

underlies its decision.  A monetary rule, or a model simulation, or both, will likely be part 

of the economic case supporting a monetary policy decision, but they are rarely the full 

justification for the decision.  Sometimes a monetary policy committee will make a 

decision that is not consistent with the prescriptions of standard monetary rules--and that 

may well be the right decision.  Further, in modern times, the policy statement of the 

monetary policy committee will seek to explain why the committee is making the 

decision it is announcing.  The quality of those explanations is a critical part of the policy 

process, for good decisions and good explanations of those decisions help build the 

credibility of the central bank--and a credible central bank is a more effective central 

bank. 

The Bottom Line 

As the August 2011 meeting illustrates, the eureka moment I thought I had 

50-plus years ago was a chimera.  Why is that?  First, the economy is very complex, and 

models that attempt to approximate that complexity can sometimes let us down.  A 

particular difficulty is that expectations of the future play a critical role in determining 

how the economy reacts to a policy change.  Moreover, the economy changes over time--

this means that policymakers need to be able to adapt their models promptly and
