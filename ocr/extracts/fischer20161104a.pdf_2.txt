With today’s data in the news, I will first say a few words about labor market 

conditions before moving on to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy.1  

The labor market has, by and large, had a pretty good year.  Including this 

morning’s release for October, payrolls have increased an average of 181,000 per month 

this year, a slower pace than last year but enough to keep the unemployment rate flat at 

about 5 percent.  The unchanged unemployment rate reflects a positive, though perhaps 

transitory, development--mainly a pickup in labor force participation.  The rise in 

participation may reflect the effects of the modest pickup in wages we are now seeing, 

with the rate of increase in the employment cost index having risen from an annual rate of 

about 2 percent last year to 2-1/4 percent so far this year.      

Over the course of the past two years, a variety of negative shocks have affected 

the U.S. economy, but employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary 

slowdown:  This recovery has been and continues to be powerful in terms of one of our 

two main targets--employment--and it is my view that the labor market is close to full 

employment. 

It is nonetheless interesting to ask what level of payroll gains would maintain an 

unemployment rate of roughly 5 percent.  Unsurprisingly, the level of payroll gains 

consistent with an unchanged unemployment rate is highly dependent on developments in 

labor force participation.  If labor force participation was to remain flat, job gains in the 

range of 125,000 to 175,000 would likely be needed to prevent unemployment from 

creeping up.  However, if labor force participation was to decline, as might be expected
