to the growth of the money supply because banks are required to hold a percentage of 

some types of deposits as reserves with the Federal Reserve.  Thus, the total amount of 

reserves in the banking system acts to cap maximum reservable deposits.  It is important 

to note that it is deposits, not reserve balances, that are included in the monetary 

aggregates used to measure the money supply.  For example, M1 is made up of currency, 

travelerâ€™s checks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits, while M2 is made up of 

M1 plus savings, small time deposits, and retail money market mutual funds.   

Moreover, the linkage between the level of reserve balances and the monetary 

aggregates in the current environment is quite weak.  You were probably taught, as I was, 

that the broad monetary aggregates increase when reserve balances increase because the 

larger volume of reserves supports increased lending, which in turn leads to a larger 

volume of reservable deposits.  While that argument might hold in normal circumstances, 

in the current environment excess reserves are many multiples of required reserves, and 

adding reserves is unlikely to spark a further increase in the volume of deposits.  As a 

result, the textbook linkage between reserve balances, bank loans, and transaction 

deposits just is not operative at present.  Fundamentally, the levels of M1 and M2 are 

determined by the strength of the economy and the preferences of businesses and 

consumers for money, which depend on the yields on monetary instruments and 

competing assets.   

Recent experience has again illustrated the difficulty in identifying a reliable 

relationship between reserve balances and the monetary aggregates.  Even though Federal 

Reserve actions to fight the financial crisis and support the economic recovery added
