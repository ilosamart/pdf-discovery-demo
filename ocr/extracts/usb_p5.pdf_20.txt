Other Compliance Matters
Effective date July 1997 Section 5070.1

FBOs are subject to various other federal and
state laws and regulations not discussed else-
where in this manual. Similar to domestic bank-
ing organizations, FBOs operating in the United
States are required to be knowledgeable of these
laws and regulations and to establish policies,
practices, procedures, and internal controls to
ensure compliance.

The following discussion is divided into two
sections: Safety and Soundness Rules and Regu-
lations and Consumer Compliance Regulations.
State-licensed branches should refer to their
state statutory codes for specific statutes that
may apply. Additionally, federally-insured
branches are subject to the wide variety of laws
and regulations applicable to all federally-
insured depository institutions.

On January 17, 1978, the three federal bank
supervisory agencies issued a joint policy state-
ment to address their concern regarding the
potential for improper payments by banks and
bank holding companies in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Federal
Election Campaign Act. While not widespread,
the federal bank supervisory agencies were con-
cerned that such practices could reflect adversely
on the banking system and constitute unsafe and
unsound banking practices, in addition to their
possible illegality.

The potential devices for making political
payments in violation of the law could include
compensatory bonuses to employees, designated
expense accounts, fees or salaries paid to offi-
cers, and preferential or zero interest rate loans.
In addition, political contributions could be
made by providing equipment and services with-
out charge to candidates for office.

SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS
RULES AND REGULATIONS

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act—
15 USC 78DD-1, 78DD-2

Beginning in 1973, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) became aware of conduct by
some companies involving the use of corporate
funds for illegal domestic political contribu-
tions. Subsequent SEC investigations, revealed
instances in which some of the largest U.S.
corporations had secretly engaged in the bribery
of foreign officials. In the course of these

investigations, it became apparent that, in many
instances, these activities were concealed from
the outside auditors and others by maintaining
off-the-book bank accounts or otherwise circum-
venting the system of internal accounting
controls.

As a result of these investigations, Congress
passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (Act). This Act consists of two separate
groups of rules: (a) those that prohibit the
offering or payment of bribes to certain foreign
officials, and (b) those requiring the mainte-
nance of complete accounting books and records
and an effective system of accounting controls.

Section 78DD-1 applies to any issuer of
securities registered on a U.S. national securities
exchange. Thus, if an FBO has issued securities
so registered, the prohibition on certain corrupt
practices applies to the FBO. Section 78DD-2,
however, applies to any domestic concern, which
is defined in subsection (h)(1)(B) to include any
corporation which has its principal place of
business in the United States. Generally, ques-
tions of specific applicability of provisions of
this Act to U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs
should be referred to appropriate legal counsel.

Antibribery Provisions

These provisions of the Act prohibit any U.S.
company or business entity (and its officers,
directors, agents, employees, and shareholders
acting on its behalf) from using the mails,
telephone, transportation, or any other instru-
mentality of interstate or foreign commerce
corruptly, in furtherance of an offer, payment,
promise to pay, authorization of the payment of
any money, or other thing of value to:

• An official of a foreign government or instru-
mentality of a foreign government;

• A foreign political party or official thereof or
a candidate for political office; or,

• Any other person the payor knows of or has
reason to know, who will pay or give the
money or value to those listed above,

where the purpose is to influence an act or
decision (including a decision not to act) of the
recipient in his official capacity or to induce the
recipient to use his or her influence to affect or
influence an act or decision of the government
