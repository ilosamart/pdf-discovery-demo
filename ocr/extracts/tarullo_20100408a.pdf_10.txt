manageable for a closely held bank, it would make any needed capital raises more difficult for a 

publicly traded community bank.   

Alternatively, banks could further diversify their loan and investment portfolios, 

expanding into lower risk or new loan and investment segments.  But this too presents 

difficulties.  For one thing, lower risk assets have lower returns.  Also, one of the reasons 

community banks have been so concentrated in commercial real estate loans is stiff competition 

for other types of loans, such as consumer installment loans, from larger banks and other 

nonbank competitors.   

A second long-term challenge facing community banks is the secular compression in the 

net interest margin.  Despite all of the emphasis on noninterest revenues in recent years, 

community banks have continued to rely heavily on spread income, indicating that many 

community banks have been unsuccessful in diversifying their revenue streams.3  The aggregate 

net interest margin for banks with assets of $10 billion or less has also tightened considerably as 

competition in the debt and lending markets has intensified, compressing by more than 70 basis 

points over the last 10 years to 3.63 percent.  As a result, it becomes more difficult for 

community banks to cover their overhead, pressuring their earnings and their ability to support 

capital needs from internal sources. 

It is possible that this declining trend in spread income could be reversed once the high 

level of non-accruing assets falls and if the premium charged for credit risk remains elevated 

once the current crisis has passed.  Smaller banks may also find that they are able to win good, 

solid business away from their national competitors, if customers turn away from large banks as 

a consequence of the crisis.  But community banks cannot count on this happening. 

                                                       
3 On average, during the five years ending December 31, 2004, community banks generated 32 percent of their 
revenue from noninterest-based sources.  For the most recent five years ending December 31, 2009, the average 
contribution of noninterest income to total revenues was even lower, at 27 percent.
