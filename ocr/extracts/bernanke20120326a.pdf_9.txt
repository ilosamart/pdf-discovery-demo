 The diagram suggests that what we may be seeing now is the flip side of the fear-

driven layoffs that occurred during the worst part of the recession, as firms have become 

sufficiently confident to move their workforces into closer alignment with the expected 

demand for their products.  Such a dynamic would explain the position of the square 

labeled “2011” in that figure being far below the line representing Okun’s law.  Of 

course, Okun’s law is a noisy relationship, and we don’t really know if the better-than-

expected labor market performance of 2011 has largely offset the worse-than-expected 

performance in 2009.  However, to the extent that the decline in the unemployment rate 

since last summer has brought unemployment back more into line with the level of 

aggregate demand, then further significant improvements in unemployment will likely 

require faster economic growth than we experienced during the past year.  It will be 

especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess whether the recovery is 

picking up as improvements in the labor market feed through to consumer and business 

confidence; or, conversely, whether the headwinds that have impeded the recovery to 

date continue to restrain the pace at which the labor market and economic activity 

normalize. 

The Challenge of Long-term Unemployment 

Discussions of the labor market at this juncture necessarily have a “glass half-

empty or half-full” tone.  Recent improvements are encouraging, but, as I have noted, in 

an absolute sense, the job market is still far from normal by many measures, and millions 

of families continue to suffer the day-to-day hardships associated with not being able to 

find suitable employment.  Although most spells of unemployment are disruptive or 

costly, the persistently high rate of long-term unemployment we have seen over the past
