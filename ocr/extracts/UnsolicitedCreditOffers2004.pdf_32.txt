Benefits of Receiving Written Offers 
of Credit or Insurance 

The third issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is “the 
benefits provided to consumers as a result of receiving written offers of credit or 
insurance.” 

GREATER AVAILABILITY OF TARGETED PRICING 
AND PRODUCT INFORMATION 

Prescreened solicitations significantly benefit consumers by providing them with ready 
access to product information on credit and insurance products for which they likely 
qualify. Thus, prescreened offers help consumers by greatly reducing the time and effort 
necessary for shopping for these products. Also, the widespread dissemination of pricing 
and product information contained in prescreened offers helps to make markets for these 
products more competitive, a result that benefits all consumers whether or not they 
engage in extensive shopping themselves. 

Theoretical developments in economics known as the economics of information have 
demonstrated the importance of information for the effective and efficient functioning of 
product markets and for enhancing competition. One of the important insights from this 
comparatively new branch of economic theory is that advertising can contribute to the 
competitiveness of markets for consumer products by substituting for substantial amounts 
of consumer shopping.19 This is especially true for the advertising of product pricing, but 
it is also true for the advertising of product quality despite the greater difficulty of 
establishing credible advertising in that area.20 

Most consumers probably realize that more shopping would be useful in obtaining the 
lowest available price for their purchases. But aside from new clothing, automobiles, 
some appliances, antiques and collectibles, and some other items, additional shopping for 
most products and services is simply too time consuming and burdensome for many 
consumers relative to the potential benefit. Under these circumstances, advertising can 
reduce shopping costs if it brings the relevant information to consumers in a way that is 
less burdensome to them than looking for it on their own. For straightforward products 
without extensive quality differentiations, widespread availability of price and product
