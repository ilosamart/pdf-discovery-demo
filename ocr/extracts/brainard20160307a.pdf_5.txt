But even after discounting the influence of energy prices, core PCE inflation has 

been stubbornly stuck in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since 2012. 4  Most 

recently, the dollar has played an important role in holding down non-oil import prices, 

which fell 3-1/2 percent last year and subtracted an estimated 1/2 percentage point from 

core inflation.5  Should the dollar stabilize, the downward influence on inflation should 

dissipate.  But, as with oil prices, the movement in the value of the dollar has been more 

persistent than markets and many observers expected, with increases in every quarter 

since mid-2014. 

If the labor market continues to improve, higher resource utilization should also 

put some upward pressure on inflation going forward.  However, the effect of resource 

utilization on inflation is estimated to be much lower today than in past decades.6   

An important concern about persistently low inflation is that it can lead to a fall in 

longer-term inflation expectations, making it much more difficult to achieve our inflation 

target.  For the most part, longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained 

reasonably stable, though there are some concerning signs.  Longer-term inflation 

expectations of professional forecasters and primary dealers have held quite steady in 

recent years at levels consistent with the FOMC’s target.  However, households’ inflation 

expectations appear to have moved down somewhat recently.  Five-to-10-year inflation 

                                                 
4 Core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been 1/2 percentage point higher than core PCE inflation 
over the 12 months through January.  Over the past 15 years, core CPI inflation has averaged about 
1/4 percentage point more than core PCE inflation.  Much of the recent larger gap is due to differences in 
the coverage of health-care services and to differences in the weight accorded to housing services and 
health-care services.  The CPI only covers out-of-pocket expenditures for health-care services, while the 
PCE index covers a much broader range of spending.  Expenditures on housing are a larger share of the 
CPI than of the PCE index, and prices for housing services have increased at an above-average pace 
recently.
