Systemic Risk:  Sources and Surveillance 

At its most basic level, systemic risk stems from the possibility that some event or 

sequence of events could result in severe impairment of the financial sector’s ability to 

provide credit in the economy.  At their most extreme, such events can trigger panicky 

attempts to withdraw credit, creating runs that lead to failures of important financial 

institutions and, ultimately, systemic collapse.  

If policymakers are to detect emerging threats to the financial system, we must 

understand the determinants of systemic risk and develop appropriate metrics for 

measuring it.  Economists have long studied these issues, and the recent crisis has 

intensified research on the subject.  This work points to several key elements in the 

buildup of risks in the financial system.  Let me mention three factors that current 

research suggests are critical.   

One factor is the accumulation in the financial sector of very high levels of risk 

and leverage, along with excessive reliance on unstable short-term funding.  The 

emergence of such behavior among the largest and most interconnected financial 

institutions is particularly dangerous, since these institutions are linchpins in our financial 

system and their failure could cause significant damage to large numbers of 

counterparties and the system as a whole, as the examples of Lehman Brothers and 

American International Group demonstrate.  However, a buildup of leverage and growing 

maturity mismatches are also worrisome when they occur more broadly in the financial 

system. 

A second element is a high positive correlation of risk exposures across 

institutions.  A wide array of commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial
