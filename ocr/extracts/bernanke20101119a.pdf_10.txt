suggests that inflows of capital to emerging market economies have indeed picked up in 

recent months.  

To a large degree, these capital flows have been driven by perceived return 

differentials that favor emerging markets, resulting from factors such as stronger 

expected growth--both in the short term and in the longer run--and higher interest rates, 

which reflect differences in policy settings as well as other forces.  As figures 6 and 7 

show, even before the crisis, fast-growing emerging market economies were attractive 

destinations for cross-border investment.  However, beyond these fundamental factors, an 

important driver of the rapid capital inflows to some emerging markets is incomplete 

adjustment of exchange rates in those economies, which leads investors to anticipate 

additional returns arising from expected exchange rate appreciation. 

The exchange rate adjustment is incomplete, in part, because the authorities in 

some emerging market economies have intervened in foreign exchange markets to 

prevent or slow the appreciation of their currencies.  The degree of intervention is 

illustrated for selected emerging market economies in figure 8.  The vertical axis of this 

graph shows the percent change in the real effective exchange rate in the 12 months 

through September.  The horizontal axis shows the accumulation of foreign exchange 

reserves as a share of GDP over the same period.  The relationship evident in the graph 

suggests that the economies that have most heavily intervened in foreign exchange 

markets have succeeded in limiting the appreciation of their currencies.  The graph also 

illustrates that some emerging market economies have intervened at very high levels and 

others relatively little.  Judging from the changes in the real effective exchange rate, the 

emerging market economies that have largely let market forces determine their exchange
