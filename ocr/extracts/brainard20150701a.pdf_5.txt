A second possible contributor may be the growing role of electronic execution of 

trades across equity, Treasury, and foreign exchange markets and the associated 

increasing role of high-frequency trading.  Competition from high-frequency trading in a 

particular market may reduce the attractiveness of that market for traditional (manual) 

traders or slower automated traders, leading to a progressive shift in the composition of 

market participants toward high-frequency traders (HFTs) over time.  This shift could be 

important to the extent that HFTs may have more limited capacity to support liquidity 

resilience since, on average, HFTs appear to trade with smaller inventories and lower 

capital than traditional traders.  Although having less inventory and capital reduces the 

cost of trading, it also means that markets increasingly dominated by HFTs may be less 

able to absorb large shocks.  Thus, liquidity may be sufficient and relatively cheap on 

normal trading days, but it may not be deep enough to prevent large price swings when 

demand for liquidity is significantly above the norm.  This consideration would be most 

relevant in the markets that are amenable to high-frequency trading, and automated 

trading more generally, where assets are fairly standardized, such as equities and U.S. 

Treasury securities, and less relevant in markets where securities are more idiosyncratic, 

such as corporate bonds.  It is also possible that markets that more readily lend 

themselves to high-speed trading may be characterized by relatively greater concentration 

over time.  Achieving the speed necessary for high-frequency trading requires large 

technology investments that necessarily may support a relatively more limited number of 

market participants.  Greater concentration in turn might be associated with lower 

resilience at times of stress. The possible effect of HFTs on the resilience of market 

liquidity is an important topic for future research.
