Thank you for the opportunity to address the important topic of how the financial 

system and its regulation have evolved in response to the global financial crisis.  I will 

focus my remarks on the global initiative to expand central clearing of over-the-counter 

(OTC) derivatives.  While we have made significant progress in enlisting central clearing 

to reduce systemic risks, I will argue that there is a good deal more to do to ensure that 

the reforms achieve their potential and minimize the possibility of unintended and 

undesirable consequences.1 

Prior to the crisis, the then highly opaque market for OTC derivatives grew at an 

astonishing and unsustainable pace of nearly 25 percent per annum in a context of 

relatively light regulation and bilateral clearing.2  With the benefit of hindsight, we know 

that along with this torrid growth came an unmeasured and underappreciated buildup of 

risk.  The spectacular losses suffered by American International Group, Inc., or AIG, on 

its derivatives positions, and the resulting concerns about the potential effect of AIG’s 

failure on its major derivatives counterparties, serve as particularly apt reminders of the 

wider failures and weaknesses that were revealed by the crisis.   

The threats posed were global, and the response was global as well.  In September 

2009, the Group of Twenty (G-20) mandated that all sufficiently standardized derivatives 

should be centrally cleared--a sea change in the functioning and regulation of these 

markets.  And in the five intervening years, substantial progress has been made in the 

United States and abroad to implement this reform and begin to reduce systemic risk in

2 According to the Bank for International Settlements, the notional amount of OTC derivatives outstanding 

grew from $80.3 trillion in December 1998 to $598.1 trillion in December 2008, which corresponds to an 

annual growth rate of 22.2 percent per year.  For more information, see Bank for International Settlements,
