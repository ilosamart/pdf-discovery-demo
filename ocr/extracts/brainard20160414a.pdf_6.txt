o Cryptography, in the form of hashes and digital signatures, provides a secure 

way to initiate a transaction that helps verify ownership and the availability of 

the asset for transfer.  

o Consensus algorithms provide a process for transactions to be confirmed and 

added to the single ledger. 

While Bitcoin was originally associated with the concept of a universally available, 

publicly shared digital ledger technology without any central authority, many of the use 

cases that are currently under development and discussion rely on “permissioned” ledgers 

in which only permitted, known participants can validate transactions.  These in turn can 

be either public or private in terms of access to the ledger.   

The resulting Internet of Value holds out the promise of addressing important 

frictions and reducing intermediation steps in the clearing and settlement process.  For 

example, in cross-border payments, faster processing and reduced costs relative to current 

correspondent banking are cited as specific potential benefits.  Reducing intermediation 

steps in cross-border payments may help reduce costs and counterparty risks and may 

additionally improve financial transparency.    

In securities clearing and settlement, the potential shift to one master record 

shared among participants has some appeal.  Having one immutable record may have the 

potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for reconciliation by avoiding duplicative 

records that have different details related to a transaction that is being cleared and settled.  

This also can lead to greater transparency, reduced costs, and faster securities settlement.  

Likewise, digital ledgers may improve collateral management by improving the tracking 

of ownership and transactions.
