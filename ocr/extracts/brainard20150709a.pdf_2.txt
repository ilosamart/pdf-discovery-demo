If there is one simple lesson from the crisis that we all can embrace, it is that no financial 

institution in America should be so big or complex that its failure would put the financial system 

at risk.1  Congress wrote that simple lesson into law as a core principle of the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).   

Consequently, a fundamental change in our framework of regulation as a result of the 

crisis is to impose tougher rules on banking organizations that are so big or complex that their 

risk taking and distress could pose risks to financial stability.2  Whereas previously, our 

regulatory framework took a homogeneous approach focused narrowly on the safety and 

soundness of an institution, the reforms underway take a tailored approach to also address the 

risks posed by an institution to the safety and soundness of the system. 

Five years on, it is an opportune time to ask how far along we are in accomplishing that 

basic imperative. I would argue we are at a pivotal moment when many of the key requirements 

that apply differentially to the biggest and most complex institutions will be finalized and their 

impact will become clear.   

In the immediate wake of the crisis, the central focus was to reduce leverage and build 

capital across the banking system while also addressing risks in derivatives and short-term 

wholesale funding markets. For instance, considerable effort went into the new Basel III capital 

framework, whose key elements apply across the entire banking system.3  With these important
