bank is an essential tool to address liquidity stress and to mitigate--though not eliminate--the 

externalities imposed on the real economy through defensive hoarding by intermediaries.  The 

importance of lending by the central bank is emphasized in much of the economics literature, 

where LOLR is often viewed as the optimal policy tool.7  

Consider now the opposite approach to dealing with liquidity stress, one that relies 

largely on the LOLR function of the central bank.  If the problem with complete reliance on self-

insurance is that firms would ration liquidity too tightly in normal times and hoard it in periods 

of stress, the obvious problem with a readily available LOLR is that firms would maintain only 

the liquidity needed for operations in normal times and do essentially no self-insuring for periods 

of stress.   

Some might argue that this state of affairs is not actually problematic, so long as the 

intermediaries are sufficiently capitalized to remain solvent under stressed circumstances.  The 

theory of LOLR lending rests on institutions being fundamentally solvent.  Central bank 

provision of liquidity is not intended to prop up weak or insolvent institutions.  Rather, the 

objective is to facilitate financial intermediation generally, and maturity transformation in 

particular, by relieving unusual liquidity strains associated with periods of financial stress.  

Indeed, to support their independence and to guard against their engaging in fiscal policy, central 

banks are correctly permitted to take on only a small amount of credit risk.  Thus, most 

advocates of expansive LOLR programs would readily agree with the need for strong capital 

standards, so as to limit the number of occasions on which market participants run because they 

7 For example, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig (1983) argue that just the presence of the LOLR, without any 
actual lending, can eliminate run-risk altogether, increasing social welfare at zero cost; see “Bank Runs, Deposit 
Insurance, and Liquidity,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91(3), pp. 401–419.  Similarly, Holmstrom and Tirole 
(1998) show that public provision of liquidity in the presence of aggregate shocks is a pure public good, with no 
moral hazard involved.
