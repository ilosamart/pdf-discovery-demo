Good afternoon and welcome.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak 

today with educators throughout the country on the topic of financial education.  Thank 

you for your participation and for the important work you do.  As an educator myself, I 

understand the profound effect that good teachers and a quality education have on the 

lives of our young people.  Today I hope you will learn from each other and share ways 

to best promote learning and, in particular, to help students achieve greater financial 

literacy.  

Financial education supports not only individual well-being, but also the 

economic health of our nation.  As the recent financial crisis illustrates, consumers who 

can make informed decisions about financial products and services not only serve their 

own best interests, but, collectively, they also help promote broader economic stability.  

Smart financial planning--such as budgeting, saving for emergencies, and preparing for 

retirement--can help households enjoy better lives while weathering financial shocks.  

Financial education can play a key role in getting to these outcomes.  Research by 

Federal Reserve Board staff members on the effectiveness of financial education for 

young military personnel, for instance, found that those who had taken a high school 

financial education course were more likely to save regularly.1 

Effective financial education is not just about teaching students about financial 

products or performing financial calculations.  It also involves teaching them the essential 

skills and concepts they will need to make major financial choices.  High school students 

might not recall specific information from a lesson about loans a year later when they go
