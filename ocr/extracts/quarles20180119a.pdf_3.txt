safe financial system, and with the goal of maintaining the ability of banks to lend through the 

business cycle.  

 That said, the Federal Reserve and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the 

better part of the past decade building out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime.  At 

this point, we have completed the bulk of the work of post-crisis regulation, with an important 

exception being the U.S. implementation of the recently concluded Basel III “end game” 

agreement on bank capital standards at the Basel Committee.  As such, now is an eminently 

natural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts.  It is our responsibility to ensure 

that they are working as intended and--given the breadth and complexity of this new body of 

regulation--it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of 

experience and hindsight. 

In undertaking this review and assessment, in addition to ensuring that we are satisfied 

with the effectiveness of these regulations, I believe that we have an opportunity to improve the 

efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of regulation.  By efficiency I mean the degree to which 

the net cost of regulation--whether in reduced economic growth or in increased frictions in the 

financial system--is outweighed by the benefits of the regulation.  In other words, if we have a 

choice between two methods of equal effectiveness in achieving a goal, we should strive to 

choose the one that is less burdensome for both the system and regulators.   

Efficiency of regulation can be improved through a variety of means.  For example, it can 

mean achieving a given regulation’s objective using fewer tools.  It can mean addressing 

unintended adverse consequences to the industry and the broader public from a regulation or 

eliminating perverse incentives created by a regulation.  It can mean calibrating a given 

regulation more precisely to the risks in need of mitigation.  It can also mean simpler
