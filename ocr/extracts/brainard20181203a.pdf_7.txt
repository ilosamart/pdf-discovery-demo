show that Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) trade in significant volumes as 

well.   

Due to the TRACE data, we are now able to measure with reasonable precision 

the transaction volumes in these securities.  Off-the-run and TIPS activity is largely 

concentrated in the dealer-to-client (DTC) and voice venues of the market, segments into 

which the public sector had only limited insight before the TRACE data.  While 

substantial analysis with respect to pricing and liquidity remains to be done in these 

market segments, the early results allow us to conclude that these securities do trade in 

meaningful amounts.  

Third, although there was speculation that proprietary trading firms had already 

eclipsed bank dealers in benchmark Treasury trading or would come to threaten the 

dealer business model more broadly, neither has occurred.8  Based on the TRACE data, 

as shown in figure 2, we can now state with a reasonable amount of confidence that 

dealers generally--and primary dealers particularly--still intermediate the majority of 

activity in all Treasury securities.9  In the market for Treasury bills in particular, primary 

dealers play an important role in allocating issuance to investors.  This can be seen where 

most activity in bills occurs, as shown in figure 3, which depicts the share of trading 

volume of bills in the DTC, interdealer broker (IDB), and interdealer segments of the

9 TRACE data do not currently identify PTF firms.  We estimate the activity by assuming PTFs account for 
92 percent of nondealer trading volume on the electronic and automated interdealer brokers, which is the 
share of nondealer activity accounted for by PTFs on electronic IDBs reported in the Joint Staff Report 
from 2014.  The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved a rule change proposed by 
FINRA to require some reporters in TRACE to identify non-FINRA member activity.  Once in effect, this 
change will enhance regulators’ ability to identify trades with PTFs on IDBs and to more accurately 
identify the share of overall trading activity attributable to PTFs.
