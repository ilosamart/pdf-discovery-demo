complex issues in their financial lives.  These tools build on important advances in our 

understanding of consumer financial behavior and the applications, or “app,” ecosystem.  

Researchers have invested decades of work exploring how consumers actually make 

decisions.  We all tend to use shortcuts to simplify financial decisions, and it turns out many of 

these can prove faulty, particularly when dealing with complex problems.17  For example, 

empirical evidence consistently shows that consumers overvalue the present and undervalue the 

future.18  Researchers have documented that consumers make better savings decisions when they 

are presented with fewer options.19  They have shown the importance of “anchoring” bias--the 

tendency to place disproportionate weight on the first piece of information presented. This bias 

can lead consumers either to make poor financial choices or instead to tip the scales in favor of 

beneficial choices, as with automatic savings defaults.20  Similarly, “nudges” can help consumers

(“…[It] is actually completely not possible for a finite human mind to be rational or to obey the axioms of 

rationality. You’d have to know too much . . . [T]he cognitive rules are, to a large extent, simplifying rules. They are 

shortcuts.”)

(“Many financial decisions that individuals face are complicated and daunting for those who are not financial 

experts. .By collapsing a multidimensional set of options into a binary choice between the status quo and the pre-

selected alternative, this intervention increases participation rates by 10 to 20 percentage points among affected 

employees.”); Sheena S. Iyengar, Wei Jiang, and Gur Huberman, “How Much Choice is Too Much?: Contributions
