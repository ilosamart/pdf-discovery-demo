The Federal Reserve Asset Purchase Programs 

The nature of our purchase programs has changed over time.  In the early 

programs--that is to say, QE1, QE2, and the program we call the MEP, or the maturity 

extension program, otherwise known as “Operation Twist”--the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) specified the expected quantities of assets to be acquired over a 

defined period.  Early in the crisis, this strategy seemed to help bolster confidence that 

the Fed was acting aggressively to offset the tightening in credit conditions and the steep 

downturn in economic activity.   

The communication of asset purchases changed with QE3.  In September 2012, 

the FOMC launched an open-ended asset purchase program in which it directed the New 

York Fed’s Open Market Desk to conduct purchases at an announced monthly pace until 

there was “significant improvement” in the outlook for the labor market.  Later, the 

FOMC noted that the monthly pace of purchases was data dependent, allowing the pace 

to be revised up or down based on its assessment of progress toward its long-run 

objectives. 

Both of these types of asset purchase programs were aimed at putting downward 

pressure on long-term yields.1  Table 1 provides a summary of various studies’ estimated 

effects of these programs on the term premium on 10-year Treasury securities.  For 

example, the decline in 10-year Treasury yields associated with the first purchase 

1 The Fed staff analysis has focused mostly on the so-called stock effects of the purchase programs--that is, 
persistent shifts in asset prices observed as the result of a QE program.  While these stock effects are well 
documented in the literature, there have been relatively fewer studies of “flow effects” that may occur at 
the time of QE transactions (for example, see Stefania D’Amico and Thomas B. King (2013), “Flow and 
Stock Effects of Large-Scale Treasury Purchases:  Evidence on the Importance of Local Supply,” Journal 
of Financial Economics, vol. 108 (May), pp. 425-48, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.11.007; and

Letters, vol. 121 (November), pp. 330-35, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.09.003).
