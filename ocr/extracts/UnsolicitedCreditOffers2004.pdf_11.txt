Background 

Creditors and insurers use a variety of methods to establish account relationships with 
consumers. The most common methods used by creditors offering general-purpose credit 
cards (such as Discover, MasterCard, Optima, or Visa), for example, are direct mail 
(prescreened or not); outbound telephone calls (prescreened or not); television, print, and 
Internet advertisements; electronic mail; promotional events; and “take one” brochures. 
Creditors also use direct mail and a variety of other print and electronic media to solicit 
customers for other credit products.3 

Insurance companies market their products and services in different ways depending on 
their business model. Some rely on a network of independent insurance agents or their 
own agents to identify and acquire customers. Some also use direct marketing 
approaches, including prescreened solicitations. 

HOW PRESCREENING WORKS 

In prescreening, a creditor or insurer establishes a set of specific credit criteria (such as a 
minimum credit score) and requests from a CRA the names, addresses, and certain other 
information on consumers in the CRA’s database who meet the specified criteria.4 

Alternatively, the creditor or insurer may provide a list of potential customers to the CRA 
and request that the CRA identify which consumers on that list meet the established 
credit criteria. Prescreening requests to CRAs may be made either directly by the 
creditors and insurers or indirectly through a third-party vendor. Prescreened 
solicitations may be conducted by mail, telephone, or electronically through the Internet, 
with use of the U.S. mail being the most common approach.5 

3 Although creditors use credit files at CRAs to prescreen solicitations for a variety of credit products, 
prescreening is most common in soliciting credit card accounts. For this reason, most available information 
about prescreening, and much of the discussion in this report, pertains to credit card accounts. 

4 Generically, a “credit score” is a statistically derived measure of creditworthiness that ranks 
individuals according to their default or credit risk, typically on the basis of information in their credit 
reports. As such, a credit score measures the relative degree of credit risk a borrower represents to a 
creditor. Credit scores are typically associated with an odds ratio that represents the proportion of 
individuals at that credit-score level who are likely to become delinquent on their credit obligation. 
“Insurance scores” also are derived from information in consumer reports, but such scores use insurance 
claims experience. In this report, the term “credit score” refers to both kinds of scores. 

5 As required, this report addresses only written prescreened solicitations. For purposes of 
completeness, however, the report contains some data on prescreened solicitations made by telephone.
