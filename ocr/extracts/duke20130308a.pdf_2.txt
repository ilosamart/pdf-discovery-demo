Since joining the Board in 2008 amid a crisis centered on mortgage lending, I 

have focused much of my attention on housing and mortgage markets, issues surrounding 

foreclosures, and neighborhood stabilization.  Today I am pleased to provide some 

comments about the outlook for housing and mortgages.  Before I proceed, I should note 

that the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the 

Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

I think the evidence is pretty clear that a recovery in the housing market is finally 

under way.  National house prices have increased for 13 consecutive months and are now 

10 percent higher than at their trough in December 2011.1  Construction activity has also 

picked up.  Housing starts and permits are still far below their peaks but have risen by 

about one-third over the past year, and homebuilder sentiment has improved notably.2  

New and existing home sales have increased.  In national surveys, households report that 

low interest rates and house prices make it a good time to buy a home; they also appear 

more certain that house price gains will continue.3  And real estate agents report stronger 

traffic of people shopping for homes.4 

The open question is whether this positive trend is sustainable.  When I look at the 

factors driving recent improvement and those that have inhibited housing recovery 

through the downturn, I conclude that recent gains in the housing market will continue 

and perhaps even strengthen.  My main hesitation with this forecast is that mortgage 

credit conditions remain quite tight for many would-be borrowers, and I suspect that the
