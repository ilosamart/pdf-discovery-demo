Analysis of annual data on home lending reported pursuant to the Home Mortgage 

Disclosure Act (HMDA) provides insight into the role of community banks in the mortgage 

market.8  As you may know, HMDA requires banking institutions, credit unions, and mortgage 

companies with offices in metropolitan areas to report details about the applications they receive 

and the loans they extend each year.9     

To investigate the role of community banks in the home lending market and to foster a 

more detailed understanding of mortgage lending within the broad group of community banks, 

our staff sorted lending institutions in HMDA into three asset size categories: smaller community 

banks with assets under $500 million, larger community banks with assets between $500 million 

and $10 billion, and large banks with assets of more than $10 billion.  For the analysis, all 

affiliated entities were combined and treated as a single organization.  

The HMDA data indicate that community banks account for a significant fraction of total 

home loan originations each year.  Smaller community banks account for about 5 percent of the 

originations annually and larger community banks an additional 13 percent.10  Credit unions, 

which are nearly all small, now account for an additional 7 percent of home loan originations.  

Thus, taken together, community banks and credit unions accounted for one-quarter of the new 

origination market in 2011.  This is up from a combined market share of nearly 16 percent in 

2004.  Over the same time period, the share of loans originated by non-banks dropped from

9 The data include information about the types and purposes of the loans; the disposition of applications; information 
about the borrowers, such as their incomes; and information about the location of the properties securing loans.  
Although HMDA’s coverage does not extend to lending institutions with offices exclusively in rural areas, its 
coverage of the home lending market is considerable, including more than 7,600 institutions and nearly 12 million 
applications in 2011. 
10 Estimates are based on the number of first-lien mortgage originations related to one- to four-family dwellings as 
reported under HMDA.
