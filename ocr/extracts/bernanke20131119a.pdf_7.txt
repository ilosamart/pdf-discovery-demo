Forward Guidance about Policy Interest Rates 

As the economy weakened over 2008, the FOMC repeatedly cut its target for the 

federal funds rate, its short-term policy rate.  In December of that year, the target for the 

funds rate was reduced to a range of zero to 1/4 percent, and money market rates declined 

nearly to zero.  Thus, using the standard means of further easing monetary policy--cutting 

the target interest rate--was no longer possible.  

The so-called zero lower bound on the FOMCâ€™s policy interest rate was not the 

only challenge the Committee faced.  First, the depth of the recession, combined with 

ongoing concerns about the functioning of the financial system, raised significant 

uncertainties about both the likely pace of recovery and the effectiveness of monetary 

policy in supporting growth.  The recoveries from most post-World War II U.S. 

recessions had been relatively rapid, with production, unemployment, and other key 

variables returning to close to normal levels within six to eight quarters.  In such cases, 

the policy horizon most relevant to financial markets might be the next several quarters.  

In the aftermath of the recent crisis, however, the Committee had to consider the 

possibility that a highly accommodative policy might be required for a number of years.  

Second, a federal funds rate effectively at zero created an important asymmetry 

for policy planning.  On the one hand, if the economy were to recover rapidly and 

inflation were to increase, monetary policymakers would be able to respond in the normal 

way, by raising the federal funds rate.  But, on the other hand, if the economy were to 

remain weak or recover only gradually--the case we actually faced--the FOMC would not
