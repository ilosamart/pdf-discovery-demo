Consideration of interest rate rules has also, as I will discuss, come to have a 

prominent role in FOMC discussions, with the Taylor rule being one benchmark that we 

regularly consult.  But--building on recent remarks I made elsewhere--I will also indicate 

why policymakers might have good reasons for deviating from these rule benchmarks 

and why, in pursuing the objectives of monetary policy, they could appropriately behave 

in ways that are not very well characterized by simple monetary policy rules.6  In 

particular, I will point to reasons why the FOMC’s discussions might lead to decisions 

that depart--temporarily or permanently--from the prescriptions of baseline monetary 

policy rules. 

Rules as a Benchmark for Policy Discussions 

Some perspective on the status of policy rules in FOMC discussions is provided 

by considering what has changed over the past 20 years.  Donald Kohn, at a landmark 

conference organized by John Taylor in January 1998, described the role played by 

monetary policy rules in the FOMC briefing process.7  His account noted that Federal 

Reserve staff members presented FOMC participants with prescriptions from several 

policy rules, including the Taylor (1993) rule.  This description remains true today.  

Publicly available Bluebooks and Tealbooks of successive years demonstrate that the 

coverage of policy rules in the briefing material provided by the Board staff expanded 

considerably in the years after Kohn spoke.8

7 See Kohn (1999).  At the time, Donald Kohn was director of the Division of Monetary Affairs at the 
Federal Reserve Board.  The conference proceedings were published as Taylor (1999a). 
8 The Federal Reserve Board’s website 
(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical_year.htm) provides downloadable copies 
of the briefing books (the Greenbook and Bluebook, which were replaced in 2010 by the Tealbook) 
distributed to FOMC members and other participants ahead of each FOMC meeting.  At present, the most 
recent year for which these materials are available on the site is 2011.  The “Monetary Policy Strategies” 
portion of the Bluebook (and, later, the Tealbook) contains prescriptions from interest rate rules.
