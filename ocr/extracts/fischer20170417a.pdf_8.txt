strongly these beliefs were held by the individual respondents, nor on the extent to which 

their individual beliefs might have been reflected in the size of their market positions and, 

in particular, the amount of leverage underlying those positions.13        

In contrast, the most recent primary dealer and market participant surveys, 

conducted prior to the March 2017 FOMC meeting, asked survey participants to indicate 

their view of their own uncertainty over several different aspects of policy.  For example, 

in addition to their point estimates, participants were asked to indicate the percent chance 

they assigned to the federal funds rate being at various levels when the FOMC first 

announces a change to the reinvestment policy.  They were also asked to assign 

probabilities to different dates for the first announced change in reinvestment policy.   

Why is this information important?  To go back to Jeremy Stein’s argument about 

the taper tantrum, Jeremy pointed out that market participants’ expectations for tapering 

varied widely, but he conjectured that some of the participants were very certain in their 

expectations and that it was primarily their reaction that fueled the taper tantrum.  When 

the surveys reported only point estimates, we had a measure of dispersion across market 

participants, but we were in the dark on how firmly held these beliefs were.  By asking 

participants to provide a distribution of outcomes, we also obtained a measure of how 

certain they are of a particular outcome.   

To highlight some results from the March 2017 surveys, as shown in figure 3, the 

primary dealers’ median projection for the level of the target federal funds rate when the 

FOMC first announces a change in its reinvestment policy was reported to be 

                                                 
13 Participants in the April 2013 survey were asked for their probability distribution across the total 
holdings of the System Open Market Account portfolio at year-end 2013 and year-end 2014, providing 
some, though incomplete, indication of the extent of uncertainty among market participants.
