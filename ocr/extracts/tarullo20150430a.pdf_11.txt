fairly widespread view that some fine tuning of regulatory tiering was warranted.  Let me now 

offer a few of my own thoughts on this point.   

First, I want to mention how pleased we were that last December Congress amended the 

statutory provision that had prevented us from raising the threshold for application of our Small 

Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.  I will not repeat here the purpose and history of this

month, the Board issued a final rule implementing the statutory change.7  The rule expands the 

scope of application of the statement from bank holding companies with less than $500 million 

in total consolidated assets to those with less than $1 billion, and adds savings and loan holding 

companies.  As a result, our statement now covers nearly 90 percent of bank holding companies.  

We had already taken steps to relieve the regulatory reporting burden for the impacted firms--

requirements for all of these institutions and eliminating certain regulatory reporting 

requirements entirely for savings and loan holding companies with less than $500 million in 

assets.8
