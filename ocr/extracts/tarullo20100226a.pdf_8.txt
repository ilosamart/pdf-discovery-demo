Legislative proposals to remove the Gramm-Leach-Bliley constraints placed on the 

Federal Reserve’s ability to obtain information from, and address unsafe and unsound 

practices in, the subsidiaries of bank holding companies would make this supervisory

firms.  Periodic scenario analyses across large firms will enhance our understanding of 

the potential effects of adverse changes in the operating environment on individual firms 

and on the system as a whole.
