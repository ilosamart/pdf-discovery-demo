securities, and the federal funds rate was still at the effective lower bound.  With the 

economy now at or beyond full employment and inflation around target, the Federal 

Open Market Committee has since gradually increased its target for the federal funds rate 

to between 2 and 2-1/4 percent, and normalization of the balance sheet is well under way.  

Since October 2017, the portfolio of the System Open Market Account has decreased in 

size from $4.2 trillion to about $3.9 trillion. 

What Have We Learned So Far? 

Against this changed backdrop and with more than a year’s worth of information 

from the TRACE data available, it is a good time to ask what we have learned since the 

initial market event and what questions remain.  First, the initiation of policy 

normalization and the ongoing reduction of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet do not 

appear to have sparked a deterioration in Treasury market liquidity.  Standard metrics 

such as bid-ask spreads have not materially changed for benchmark securities since 2014.  

Market functioning has also been orderly during a number of recent events that were 

characterized by high trading volume and elevated price volatility, such as in early 

February of this year. 

Second, some segments of the market seem much more active than observers may 

have feared before the collection of TRACE data.  In particular, according to the TRACE 

data as shown in figure 1, off-the-run trading accounts for 27 percent of overall trading 

volume, while deep off-the-run notes and bonds--seasoned securities older than the first 

or second off-the-run--account for 14 percent of all coupon activity.7  Likewise, the data
