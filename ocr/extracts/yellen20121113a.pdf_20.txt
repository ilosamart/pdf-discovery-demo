longer than the modified Taylor rule, thereby maintaining greater accommodation as the 

economic recovery takes hold.21  

The Future of FOMC Communications 

The fact that simple rules aren’t as useful in current circumstances as they would 

be for the FOMC at other times poses a significant challenge for FOMC communications, 

especially since private-sector Fed watchers have frequently relied on such rules to 

understand and predict the Committee’s decisions on the federal funds rate.22  In 

particular, private-sector forecasters commonly use such rules to revise their expectations 

concerning the path of the federal funds rate in response to news that alters their views 

concerning the outlook for the economy.   

Now, however, the federal funds rate may well diverge for a number of years 

from the prescriptions of simple rules.  Moreover, the FOMC announced an open-ended 

asset purchase program in September, and there is no historical record for the public to 

use in forming expectations on how the FOMC is likely to use this tool.  Thus, the current 

situation makes it very important that the FOMC provide private-sector forecasters with 

the information they need to predict how the likely path of policy will change in response 

to changes in the outlook.  While a clear statement of the Committee’s goals and the 

strategy it will use to achieve them was an important and necessary step in this regard, 

the exercise we’ve just undertaken illustrates that a host of additional assumptions and 

                                                 
21 I would note that the original Taylor rule, which places only one-half as much weight as the modified 
rule on unemployment deviations, would already have raised the federal funds rate above the zero bound, 
producing far worse outcomes than any illustrated in figure 1. 
22 The baseline path, based through the end of 2015 on the primary dealer survey, assumes greater 
accommodation than would be consistent with the modified Taylor rule, suggesting that FOMC 
communications have had some success in conveying the desirability of such an approach.
