response to a large and sustained decline in their tax revenues, state and local 

governments have cut about 600,000 jobs on net since the third quarter of 2008 while 

reducing real expenditures for infrastructure projects by 20 percent.   

More recently, the situation has to some extent reversed:  The drag on economic 

growth from state and local fiscal policy has diminished as revenues have improved, 

easing the pressures for further spending cuts or tax increases.  In contrast, the phasing-

out of earlier stimulus programs and policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit 

have led federal fiscal policy to begin restraining GDP growth.  Indeed, under almost any 

plausible scenario, next year the drag from federal fiscal policy on GDP growth will 

outweigh the positive effects on growth from fiscal expansion at the state and local level.  

However, the overall effect of federal fiscal policy on the economy, both in the near term 

and in the longer run, remains quite uncertain and depends on how policymakers meet 

two daunting fiscal challenges--one by the start of the new year and the other no later 

than the spring. 

Upcoming Fiscal Challenges 

What are these looming challenges?  First, the Congress and the Administration 

will need to protect the economy from the full brunt of the severe fiscal tightening at the 

beginning of next year that is built into current law--the so-called fiscal cliff.  The 

realization of all of the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that make up the fiscal 

cliff, absent offsetting changes, would pose a substantial threat to the recovery--indeed, 

by the reckoning of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and that of many outside 

observers, a fiscal shock of that size would send the economy toppling back into 

recession.  Second, early in the new year it will be necessary to approve an increase in the
