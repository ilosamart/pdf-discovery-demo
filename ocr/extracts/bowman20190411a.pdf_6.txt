This is not to say that the community banks’ advantages cannot be challenged by 

technology. Many fintech firms are currently looking to leverage their deep ties with other 

aspects of small businesses—their payment processing services or accounting software, for 

instance—to build data-driven lending products that are tied to the day-to-day operations of 

small businesses. Fintech lenders can provide easy-to-use online applications, rapid loan 

decisionmaking, and customer service that helps bring low cost, automated decisionmaking to 

the small loan segment that was previously left to community banks. 

Partnering with a fintech firm can offer a community bank the best of both worlds. The 

bank can take advantage of new technology and all the efficiencies that come with it as an 

extension of the banks’ relationship-banking model. In a sense, fintech is just the latest evolution 

of a long history of community banks leveraging technology to provide financial services. I’m 

thinking here of technologies, such as ATMs, mobile banking, and remote deposit capture.15 For 

their part, community banks offer potential fintech partners a consumer-first approach to 

business and a number of advantages: deposit insurance and liquidity; a stable customer base; 

credibility in a local community; and settlement and compliance services.16 I thought one 

response to the CSBS survey said it best. The banker wrote, “[T]he future of consumer banking 

seems to be as a participant in the ecosystem of lifestyle technological solutions rather than as a 

standalone banking relationship.” The problem is, as the banker continued, “[I]t’s hard to 

imagine what exactly that will look like and how it will change the banking business model.”17
