Despite these and other policy successes, the episode as a whole has not been kind 

to the reputation of economic and economists, and understandably so.  Almost 

universally, economists failed to predict the nature, timing, or severity of the crisis; and 

those few who issued early warnings generally identified only isolated weaknesses in the 

system, not anything approaching the full set of complex linkages and mechanisms that 

amplified the initial shocks and ultimately resulted in a devastating global crisis and 

recession.  Moreover, although financial markets are for the most part functioning 

normally now, a concerted policy effort has so far not produced an economic recovery of 

sufficient vigor to significantly reduce the high level of unemployment.  As a result of 

these developments, some observers have suggested the need for an overhaul of 

economics as a discipline, arguing that much of the research in macroeconomics and 

finance in recent decades has been of little value or even counterproductive.   

Although economists have much to learn from this crisis, as I will discuss, I think 

that calls for a radical reworking of the field go too far.  In particular, it seems to me that 

current critiques of economics sometimes conflate three overlapping yet separate 

enterprises, which, for the purposes of my remarks today, I will call economic science, 

economic engineering, and economic management.  Economic science concerns itself 

primarily with theoretical and empirical generalizations about the behavior of individuals, 

institutions, markets, and national economies.  Most academic research falls in this 

category.  Economic engineering is about the design and analysis of frameworks for 

achieving specific economic objectives.  Examples of such frameworks are the risk-

management systems of financial institutions and the financial regulatory systems of the 

United States and other countries.  Economic management involves the operation of
