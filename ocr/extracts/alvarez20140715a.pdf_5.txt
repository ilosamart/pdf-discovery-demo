MSBs.5  That guidance confirms that banking organizations may provide banking services to 

MSBs that operate lawfully.  The guidance is intended to assist banks in the decision to open and 

maintain accounts for legitimate businesses by identifying the programs and procedures they 

should have in place to perform customer due diligence and monitoring of these customers for 

suspicious activity.  

The Federal Reserve also follows the interagency examination manual and related 

guidance issued by FinCEN when evaluating the procedures banking organizations use to 

manage account relationships with TPPPs.6  These entities often use their commercial bank 

accounts to conduct payment processing for their merchant clients.  The guidance is designed to 

assist banking organizations in designing and implementing policies and systems for monitoring 

and managing the risks associated with the payment and lending products they offer.  The 

objective of the guidance and the Federal Reserve’s supervisory activities is to direct banking 

organizations to take appropriate steps to offer their services to legitimate and law-abiding 

customers, and to minimize the risk of facilitating money laundering, terrorist financing, or other 

illicit activity.
