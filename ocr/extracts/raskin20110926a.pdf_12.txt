many households may be unable to take advantage of the lower borrowing rates that are 

available to those who have a high net worth and pristine credit records.   

Many small businesses also appear to be facing unusual obstacles in obtaining 

credit.  If times were more typical, we would expect a smooth transmission in which 

lower interest rates would fuel credit expansion that would be used to finance expanding 

payrolls, capital investment, inventories, and other short-term operating expenses.  

Nonetheless, the latest Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 

Lending Practices, which was taken in July, indicated that although domestic banks 

continued to ease standards on their commercial and industrial loans, the net fraction 

reporting easing on such loans to smaller firms (those with annual sales of less than 

$50 billion) remained low and was well below that of loans to large and middle-sized 

firms.

  In its August survey, the National Federation of Independent Businesses reported 

a noticeable increase in the proportion of small businesses reporting that credit has 

become more difficult to obtain.

  These businesses not only expect credit to become 

tighter in coming months but--like other businesses--have turned sharply more 

pessimistic about the broader economic outlook. 

Finally, and perhaps most comprehensively, it is worth observing that the 

financial crisis has undermined the wealth of many Americans.  Low- and moderate-

income families entered the recession with little financial buffer against the adverse 

effects of wage cuts, job loss, and drops in home values.  According to the 2007 Survey 

of Consumer Finances (SCF), home equity accounted for about half of the total net worth
