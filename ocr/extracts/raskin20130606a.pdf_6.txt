threats?  After a crisis caused in part by opaque financial engineering, how do we prevent such 

excesses without stifling innovation that might benefit customers and the public and foster 

economic growth?  Should financial inclusion and financial literacy be regulatory goals, as some 

have suggested, and what responsibility should banks bear in achieving such ends?  What do we 

do to re-calibrate a multi-layered regulatory response that was partly dictated by the exigencies 

of a crisis rather than by calculated principles of best design?   

We have to address these and other questions if we hope to envision a post-crisis 

financial regulatory system that supports a strong, dynamic, and diverse financial system.  This, 

to me, is the strongest motivation for moving ahead as expeditiously as possible on 

implementing statutory requirements and international agreements to raise capital standards so 

that we can begin lifting our vision beyond a crisis response.  Moreover, as we implement these 

requirements and agreements, one of the things that the agencies have been considering is how 

we can do so in a way that does not differentially harm those financial institutions whose actions 

were not, by and large, responsible for the need to develop a policy response to the crisis.   

Timeliness  

Letâ€™s talk about the importance of timely implementation of rules based on one set of 

international agreements--the Basel III framework.  The proposed rule, together with the capital-

related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, is intended to raise both the quality and quantity of 

capital at banking organizations in the United States.  I fully support this goal, because the 

financial crisis demonstrated, among other things, the need for robust capital at banks of all sizes.  

The issue, of course, is that the framework has not been finalized, and I am concerned that 

significant, further delays could add to uncertainty and could detract from the maintenance of 

strong capital levels.
