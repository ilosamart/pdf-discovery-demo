Government Performance and Results Act
Biennial Performance Report
2008–2009

INTRODUCTION

About This Biennial Performance Report

The Government Performance and Results Act

(GPRA) of 1993 requires that federal agencies, in con-

sultation with the Congress and outside stakeholders,

prepare a strategic plan covering a multiyear period

and submit an annual performance plan and perfor-

mance report. Although the Board of Governors of the

Federal Reserve System (Board) is not covered by

GPRA, the Board of Governors voluntarily complies

with the spirit of GPRA and, like federal agencies, pre-

pares these regular plans and reports.

Consistent with the requirements of GPRA, this Per-

formance Report is based on two earlier Board docu-

ments covering the same period—the Government Per-

formance and Results Act Strategic Planning Document,

2008–2011 and the Government Performance and

Results Act Biennial Performance Plan, 2008–2009,

both published in 2008.1 This report covers two years

rather than just one because the Board operates under

a biennial budget.

Like the Biennial Performance Plan 2008–2009, this

report focuses on four areas: the Board’s monetary

policy function, its bank supervision and regulation

function, its operations in overseeing Federal Reserve

System (the System) activities, and its management

activities to improve e�ectiveness and e�ciency.

Although a discussion of the Federal Reserve System

and its structure is provided below to help explain the

performance measures used by the Board, this perfor-

mance report focuses solely on Board operations.

As required by GPRA, this report is issued indepen-

dently of other Board documents submitted to the

Congress. However, considering the report in conjunc-

tion with other Board documents gives a more detailed

understanding of Board planning, budgeting, opera-

tions, and performance. As required by the Federal

Reserve Act, the Board annually submits a report to the

Congress describing in detail the operations of the Sys-

tem for the previous year. Since 1985, the Board has

also provided the Congress with a supplement, the

Annual Report: Budget Review, which describes in

detail the plans and resources discussed in the approved

budgets of the Board and the Reserve Banks. The most

recent versions of these two documents were provided

to the Congress in 2010.2

Overview of the Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the

United States, established by the Congress to provide

the nation with a safer, more �exible, and more stable

monetary and �nancial system. Over the years, its role

in banking and the economy has expanded, and today

the Federal Reserve’s duties fall into �ve general areas:

1. conducting the nation’s monetary policy by in�u-

encing money and credit conditions in the economy

in pursuit of maximum employment and stable

prices

2. supervising and regulating banking institutions to

ensure the safety and soundness of the nation’s

banking system, maintaining the stability of the

�nancial system, and containing systemic risk that

may arise in �nancial markets

3. protecting the credit rights of consumers and

encouraging banks to meet the credit needs of con-

sumers, including those in low- and moderate-

income neighborhoods

4. playing a major role in operating the nation’s pay-

ment systems

5. providing certain �nancial services to the U.S. gov-

ernment, the public, �nancial institutions, and for-

eign o�cial institutions

The System was created by passage of the Federal

Reserve Act (the act), which President Woodrow Wil-

son signed into law on December 23, 1913. The act

stated that the System was created “to provide for the

establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an

elastic currency, to a�ord means of rediscounting com-

mercial paper, to establish a more e�ective supervision

of banking in the United States, and for other pur-

poses.”

Soon after the creation of the Federal Reserve, it

became clear that the act had broader implications for

national economic and �nancial policy. As time has

passed, further legislation has clari�ed and supple-

mented the System’s original purposes. Key laws a�ect-

ing the Federal Reserve include the Bank Holding

Company Act of 1956 and its amendments; the Finan-

cial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement

Act of 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-

tion Improvement Act of 1991; the Gramm-Leach-

Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999; and the Check Clearing for

the 21st Century Act of 2004. In a 1977 amendment to

the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress de�ned the pri-

mary objectives of national economic policy. These

objectives include economic growth in line with the

economy’s potential to expand; a high level of employ-

ment; stable prices (that is, stability in the purchasing

power of the dollar); and moderate long-term interest

rates. Major �nancial services reform legislation, incor-

porated in the GLBA, re�ects changes in the nature of

the industry and in the economy generally. GLBA and

the changes it ushered in for the United States �nancial

services industry continues to a�ect signi�cantly the

operations and workload of the Federal Reserve.

Since the late 1960s, several federal laws were created

that were designed to protect consumers when secur-

ing credit or in making other �nancial transactions has

grown. The Congress has assigned to the Federal

Reserve the duty of implementing the provisions of

these laws to ensure that consumers receive comprehen-

sive information and fair treatment from �nancial insti-

tutions when they engage in these transactions. Con-

sumer protection laws such as the 1968 Truth in

Lending Act, the Community Reinvestment Act of

1977 (CRA), the Expedited Funds Availability Act of

1987, the Truth in Savings Act of 1991, and the Fair

and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 have

given the Federal Reserve rule-writing, compliance, and

consumer education responsibilities. As a result of the

recent �nancial crisis, the federal government is consid-

ering additional legislation designed to update the

�nancial regulatory system and increase consumer pro-

tection. Although the outcome of current legislative

e�orts is still uncertain, several of the proposals could

signi�cantly impact the Board’s organization, opera-

tions, and resource requirements.

System Role in the Government

The Federal Reserve System is considered to be an

independent central bank because its decisions do not

have to be rati�ed by the President or anyone else in the

executive branch of government. The System is, how-

ever, subject to oversight by the U.S. Congress. The

Federal Reserve must work within the framework of

the overall objectives of economic and �nancial policy

established by the government; therefore, the descrip-

tion of the System as “independent within the govern-

ment” is more accurate.

Structure of the System

Congress designed the structure of the Federal Reserve

System to give it a broad perspective on the economy

and on economic activity in all parts of the nation. It is

a federal system, composed of a central, governmental

agency—the Board of Governors—in Washington,

D.C., and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The

Board and the Reserve Banks share responsibility for

supervising and regulating certain �nancial institutions

and activities, for providing banking services to deposi-

tory institutions and the federal government, and for

ensuring that consumers receive adequate information

and fair treatment in their business with the banking

system.

A major component of the System is the Federal

Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is made up

of the members of the Board of Governors, the presi-

dent of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and

presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks, who

serve on a rotating basis. The FOMC oversees open

market operations, which is the main tool used by the

Federal Reserve to in�uence overall monetary and

credit conditions.

Board of Governors

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-

tem is a federal government agency. The Board is com-

posed of seven members, who are appointed by the

President of the United States and con�rmed by the

U.S. Senate. The full term of a Board member is 14

years, and the appointments are staggered so that one

2 Government Performance and Results Act Biennial Performance Report □ 2008–2009


term expires on January 31 of each even-numbered

year. After serving a full term, a Board member may

not be reappointed. If a member leaves the Board

before his or her term expires, however, the person

appointed and con�rmed to serve the remainder of the

term may later be reappointed to a full term.

The Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board

are also appointed by the President and con�rmed by

the Senate. The nominees to these posts must already be

members of the Board or must be simultaneously

appointed to the Board. The terms for these positions

are four years.

MISSION, VALUES, AND GOALS
OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS

Mission

The mission of the Board is to foster the stability, integ-

rity, and e�ciency of the nation’s monetary, �nancial,

and payment systems so as to promote optimal macro-

economic performance.

Values

The following values of the Board guide its organiza-

tional decisions and its employees’ actions.

• Public interest. In its actions and policies, the Board

seeks to promote the public interest. It is accountable

and responsive to the general public, the U.S. govern-

ment, and the �nancial community.

• Integrity. The Board adheres to the highest standards

of integrity in its dealings with the public, the �nan-

cial community, and its employees.

• Excellence. The conduct of monetary policy, respon-

sibility for bank supervision, and maintenance of the

payment system demand high-quality analysis, high

performance standards, and a secure, robust infra-

structure. The pursuit of excellence drives the

Board’s policies concerning recruitment, selection,

and retention for Board employees.

• E�ciency and e�ectiveness. In carrying out its func-

tions, the Board is continually aware that its opera-

tions are supported primarily by public funds, and it

recognizes its obligation to manage resources e�-

ciently and e�ectively.

• Independence of views. The Board values the diversity

of its employees; input from a variety of sources; and

the independent professional judgment that is fos-

tered by the System’s highly valued regional struc-

ture. It relies on strong teamwork to mold indepen-

dent viewpoints into coherent, e�ective policies.

Goals

The Board has six primary goals with interrelated and

mutually reinforcing elements:

1. conducting monetary policy that promotes the

achievement of the statutory objectives of maxi-

mum sustainable longterm growth and the price sta-

bility that fosters that goal

2. promoting a safe, sound, competitive, and accessible

banking system and stable �nancial markets

3. developing regulations, policies, and programs

designed to inform and protect consumers, to

enforce federal consumer protection laws, to

strengthen market competition, and to promote

access to banking services in historically under-

served markets

4. providing high-quality professional oversight of the

Reserve Banks

5. fostering the integrity, e�ciency, and accessibility of

U.S. payment and settlement systems

6. fostering the integrity, e�ciency, and e�ectiveness of

Board programs

Role of Strategic Planning

Unlike most other government agencies, the Board’s

budget is not subject to the Congressional appropria-

tions process or to review by the administration

through the O�ce of Management and Budget. Rather,

the Board establishes its own budget formulation pro-

cedures, conducts strategic planning to identify changes

to its critical activities and the proper amount and allo-

cation of resources to support its mission, and provides

various reports and budget testimony to the Congress.

The Board, like the framers of the Federal Reserve

Act, considers its budgetary independence directly rel-

evant to independence in managing monetary policy.

That said, the Board believes that to maintain budget-

ary independence, it must demonstrate e�ective and

e�cient use of its �nancial resources. Resource man-

agement begins with a clear mission statement, identi�-

cation of goals, a review of factors that might a�ect the

long-term attainment of these goals, and consideration

of possible responses to those factors. By establishing

objectives to attain its goals and by identifying the

resources needed to accomplish them, the Board devel-

ops a budget necessary to implement its strategic plan.

Strategic planning is a critical factor in ensuring the

long-term e�ectiveness of Board operations and in

minimizing its costs. E�ectiveness is improved through

timely identi�cation of threats and through e�orts to

improve operational e�ciency. E�ciency is increased

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 3


by early identi�cation of issues and timely responses.

Major factors a�ecting the current strategic plan

include the following:

1. The desire to develop better performance metrics for

each division and major Board function, and pro-

vide comparative Boardwide management data to

senior sta�

2. Continuing advances in automation and telecom-

munication technologies that will

• foster the e�ciency associated with greater stan-

dardization of System supervision and regulation

automation tools and databases, and help ensure

better coordination of plans, strategies, actions,

and information sharing with other domestic and

foreign regulators;

• reduce reaction time to address systemic issues;

• require and make possible enhanced systems for

identifying, measuring, and pricing risk;

• improve the capabilities for gathering, analyzing,

and sharing data; and

• provide signi�cant opportunities for improving

communication with the public

3. The need for actions and policies that attract and

retain a highly motivated, properly trained, and

fairly compensated professional workforce

4. The need for contingency plans related to the safety

of personnel, disaster recovery, and information

5. The current state of the U.S. and foreign economies

As technological and other changes evolve and accel-

erate, planning is essential to the e�ective and e�cient

conduct of Board operations. A continuing challenge

to government agencies in this regard is identifying the

appropriate measures of performance. The Board’s

strategic planning e�ort recognizes the key distinctions

between government and private-sector strategic plan-

ning e�orts and measurement of those e�orts. Private-

sector planning often relies on measures of cost and

revenue derived from prices determined in competitive

markets; the results of that planning are re�ected in the

ability of the private entity to prosper over time. The

government does not have direct competition in certain

areas, and has a monopoly in others (conducting mon-

etary policy, for example); establishing a comparable

metric to costs and prices is therefore extraordinarily

di�cult. Moreover, the results are judged relative to

public policy objectives embodied in law, which often

are not readily measurable. The Board seeks to accom-

plish its mission e�ectively while creating the e�cien-

cies that come from strategic planning, recognizing that

analogies to the private sector are just that. The Board’s

central planning objective is oriented toward achieving

e�ectiveness and e�ciency speci�c to the functions it

serves.

MONETARY POLICY FUNCTION

Goal

Conduct monetary policy that promotes the achieve-

ment of the statutory objectives of maximum sustain-

able long-term growth and the price stability that fos-

ters that goal.

Objectives

1. Informed monetary policy: Staying abreast of recent

developments and prospects in the U.S. economy

and �nancial markets, and in those abroad, so that

monetary policy decisions will be well informed

2. Understanding of macroeconomics and markets:

Enhancing our knowledge of the structural and

behavioral relationships in the macroeconomic and

�nancial markets, and improving the quality of data

used to gauge economic performance, through

developmental research activities

3. E�ective implementation of monetary policy: Imple-

menting monetary policy e�ectively in rapidly

changing economic circumstances and in an evolv-

ing �nancial market structure

4. Contribution to international e�orts: Contributing to

the development of U.S. international policies and

procedures in cooperation with the U.S. Department

of the Treasury and other agencies

5. Expanded public awareness of monetary policy: Pro-

moting understanding of Federal Reserve policy

among other government policy o�cials and

the general public

Performance Measures

The e�ectiveness of the Board’s monetary policy in

relation to evolving economic and �nancial cir-

cumstances continues to be reviewed by the Congress

in the context of the Board’s semiannual monetary

policy report and the accompanying testimony. It is rec-

ognized that monetary policy has only a partial and

indirect in�uence on performance of the U.S. economy.

Resources

The majority of the resources utilized to achieve this

goal are reported in the Board’s three research divi-

sions, the O�ce of Board Members, the O�ce of the

4 Government Performance and Results Act Biennial Performance Report □ 2008–2009


Secretary, and the O�ce of the Sta� Director for Man-

agement. The combined expenses for the 2008–09 bien-

nium for these divisions and o�ces totaled approxi-

mately $230 million.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION FUNCTION

Goals

Safety and Soundness: Promote a safe, sound, competi-

tive, and accessible banking system and stable �nancial

markets

Consumer Protection: Develop regulations, policies,

and programs designed to inform and protect consum-

ers, to enforce federal consumer protection laws, to

strengthen market competition, and to promote access

to banking services in historically underserved markets

Objectives

1. Financial stability and risk containment: Promoting

overall �nancial stability, managing and containing

systemic risk, and identifying emerging �nancial

problems early so that crises can be averted

2. Accessibility of the banking system: Providing a safe,

sound, competitive, and accessible banking system

through comprehensive and e�ective supervision of

U.S. banks, bank and �nancial holding companies,

foreign banking organizations, and related entities

(at the same time, remaining sensitive to the burden

on supervised institutions)

3. Financial system e�ciency: Enhancing e�ciency and

e�ectiveness by addressing the supervision func-

tion’s procedures, technology, resource allocation,

and sta�ng issues

4. E�ective oversight of �nancial institutions: Promot-

ing the compliance by domestic and foreign bank-

ing organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve

with applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, and

guidelines through a comprehensive and e�ective

supervision program

5. Consumer protection: Serving as a leader in, and

helping shape the national dialogue on, consumer

protection in �nancial services

6. Relationship building: Promoting, developing, and

strengthening e�ective communications and col-

laborations within the Board, the Federal Reserve

Banks, and other agencies and organizations

Performance Measures

See table below for the 11 metrics, targets, and results

for the two-year period.

Resources

The majority of the resources utilized to achieve this

goal are reported in the divisions of Banking Supervi-

sion and Regulation and Consumer and Community

A�airs, whose combined expenses for the 2008–09

biennium were approximately $159 million.

No speci�c target The Federal Reserve is actively reviewing current
prudential standards and supervisory approaches
to incorporate the lessons learned from the recent
�nancial crisis. On the supervisory front, the Fed-
eral Reserve is taking steps to strengthen oversight
and enforcement, including augmenting tradi-
tional microprudential methods of oversight with
a more macroprudential approach that should bet-
ter anticipate and mitigate broader threats to
�nancial stability.
