A common theme in the legislation and the Fed’s steps to improve our regulation 

and supervision is tailoring.  As the Fed continues to evaluate the effectiveness and 

efficiency of regulations, I expect tailoring will be a guiding principle.  

Let me now address international efforts to promote financial stability, 

specifically those centered in the Financial Stability Board.   

In the run-up to the crisis, as I’m sure you all know, decades of relative stability in 

the United States had left both the financial industry and government agencies 

complacent about potential threats.  And even though financial crises had occurred during 

that time in some advanced economies, it is fair to say that the United States and other 

nations did not place a high probability on a crisis that could be global in nature.  As a 

result, international coordination and collaboration on financial stability was limited, and 

there was a shortage of detailed and standardized information about financial conditions 

and vulnerabilities in different countries.   

As the crisis descended and the global nature of the problems became clear, the 

United States and other major economies, working through the Group of Twenty nations, 

created the Financial Stability Board to coordinate their efforts to stabilize the global 

financial system, reform international financial regulation, and share information.1  The 

FSB includes central banks, finance ministries and regulators from 24 nations, the 

European Union, and also international organizations such as the International Monetary 

Fund and important global financial standard-setting bodies.  Unlike other global 

organizations, the FSB includes multiple agencies from each government in recognition 

of the fact that financial stability is a responsibility shared across many parts of any 

                                                 
1 The FSB was created in April 2009 and was the successor of a less-formal group known as the Financial 
Stability Forum. See www.fsb.org/about/.
