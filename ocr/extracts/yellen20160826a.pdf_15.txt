hypothetical unconstrained policy.  In general, the study concludes that, even if the 

average level of the federal funds rate in the future is only 3 percent, these new tools 

should be sufficient unless the recession were to be unusually severe and persistent.   

Figure 2 in your handout illustrates this point.  It shows simulated paths for 

interest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy 

responses--the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the 

constrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2 trillion 

in asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by 

staying lower for longer.21  As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall 

far below zero if policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to 

fall sharply.i  But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can 

push long-term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case 

(especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the 

downward pressure on the expected average value of future short-term interest rates.  

Thus, the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and 

inflation on average.   

Of course, this analysis could be too optimistic.  For one, the FRB/US simulations 

may overstate the effectiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases, particularly in 

an environment where long-term interest rates are also likely to be unusually low.22  In 

                                                 
21 The forward guidance is provided at the start of the recession and has three components.  First, the 

federal funds rate will be lowered to zero more quickly than prescribed by the rule.  Second, the federal 

funds rate will remain at zero as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 5 percent.  And, finally, that 

after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, policymakers will proceed gradually in returning to the 

prescriptions of the policy rule.    
22 As shown in figure 2, the 10-year Treasury yield in the simulation starts out at just over 4 percent, well 

below its level pre-crisis, suggesting that there may be less room to push down long-term interest rates in 

the future than in the past.  Another potential source of overstatement could be the FRB/US assumption that
