MBS, Fannie and Freddie brought greater liquidity to mortgage markets and made mortgages 

more affordable.  But the system ultimately failed due to fundamental flaws in its structure.  In 

the early days of securitization, the chance that either GSE would ever fail to honor its guarantee 

seemed remote.  But the question always loomed in the background:  Who would bear the credit 

risk if a GSE became insolvent and could not perform?  Would Congress really allow the GSE to 

fail to honor its obligations, given the devastating impact that would have on mortgage funding 

and the housing market?  The law stated explicitly that the government did not stand behind the 

GSEs or their MBS, as Fannie and Freddie frequently pointed out in order to avoid tougher 

regulation.  Nonetheless, investors understandably came to believe that the two GSEs were too-

big-to-fail, and priced in an implicit federal government guarantee behind GSE obligations.  In 

the end the investors were right, of course.  The implicit government guarantee also meant that 

investors--including banks, the GSEs themselves, and investors around the world--did not do 

careful due diligence on the underlying mortgage pools.  Thus, securitization also enabled 

declining lending standards.  This was not only a problem of the GSEs--private label 

securitizations also helped to enable lower underwriting standards.   

Over time, the system’s bad incentives caused the two GSEs to change their behavior and 

take on ever greater risks.  The GSEs became powerful advocates for their own bottom lines, 

providing substantial financial support for political candidates who supported the GSE agenda.  

Legislative reforms in the 1990s and the public/private structure led managements to expand the 

GSEs’ balance sheets to enormous size, underpinned by wafer-thin slivers of capital, driving 

high shareholder returns and very high compensation for management.  These factors and others 

eventually led to extremely lax lending conditions.  The early 2000s became the era of Alt-A,
