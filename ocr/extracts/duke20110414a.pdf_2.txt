this conference and to talk with you about credit conditions--especially conditions in the 

small business lending market.  Credit availability is a necessary component of economic 

recovery, and factoring represents an important source of credit for large and small 

businesses.   

Credit markets normally recover slowly following financial crises, and the most 

recent episode was no exception.  However, after declining throughout 2009 and much of 

2010, recent measures of aggregate credit outstanding have shown some signs of 

improvement.  Nonrevolving consumer credit outstanding, which includes auto and 

student lending, has increased for the past seven months.  Issuance of corporate bonds has 

been robust for several quarters, and new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 

securities picked up in the first quarter of 2011, albeit from very low levels.  Commercial 

and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding have resumed growing modestly on average.   

While credit availability seemed to improve for large companies throughout the 

past year, small businesses still complained of difficulty in gaining access to credit.  

Recent anecdotes lead me to believe that conditions are improving for small businesses, 

but data are scarce for this market.  Today I will pull together information from a variety 

of sources, including surveys of small businesses and surveys of lenders, to paint a 

picture of the credit conditions currently facing small businesses. 

Sources of Financing for New and Existing Small Businesses 

Small businesses are central to creating jobs and to restoring our economic 

prosperity.  The economic importance of small businesses is due in part to the fact that 

about one-half of all Americans are employed by firms with fewer than 500 employees.
