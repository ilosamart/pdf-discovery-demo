thoroughly.  In some cases, the arbitrage opportunities presented by existing capital requirements 

were an incentive for securitization and other capital markets activities.  The exposures created 

by off-balance-sheet activities such as structured investment vehicles (SIVs) were badly 

underweighted.  Minimum capital ratios were not high enough and, in meeting even those 

inadequate requirements, firms were allowed to count liabilities that did not really provide the 

ability to absorb losses and still maintain the firms as viable, functioning intermediaries.   

 There has already been a substantial response to this challenge. With the support of the 

Federal Reserve and other U.S. bank regulators, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 

has strengthened capital requirements by raising risk-weightings for traded assets and improved 

the quality of loss-absorbing capital through a new minimum common equity ratio.  The 

committee also has created a capital conservation buffer and introduced an international leverage 

ratio.  These Basel 2.5 and Basel III reforms either have been, or soon will be, implemented in 

the United States and most other countries that are home to internationally active banking firms.  

Also, the Basel Committee has just recently adopted the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a first 

step in addressing liquidity problems.     

 In the United States, some important additional steps have been taken.  Beginning at the 

peak of the crisis, the Federal Reserve has conducted stress tests of large banking organizations, 

making capital requirements more forward-looking by estimating the effect of an adverse 

economic scenario on firm capital levels in a manner less dependent on firms’ internal risk-

measurement infrastructure.  And the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act popularly known as the 

Collins Amendment ensures that banking organizations cannot use models-based approaches to 

reduce their minimum capital below generally applicable, more standardized risk-based ratios.
