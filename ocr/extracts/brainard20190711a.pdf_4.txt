addressing these financial imbalances by activation of the countercyclical capital buffer, 

more rigorous use of stress tests, and active monitoring of leveraged lending. 

So what does this mean for you and the families and businesses you serve in and 

around Scranton?  I hope and expect that the progress you have made in transforming the 

region’s economy will continue as the expansion extends into its 11th year.  I am well 

aware of the challenges this area has been working to overcome since the Great 

Recession.  And I am impressed by how much has been accomplished here.  You have 

had important success in attracting new logistics jobs to take advantage of Northeastern 

Pennsylvania’s proximity to major cities.  You are making important investments in the 

forward-looking “eds and meds” (education and health-care) sectors by leveraging the 19 

colleges and universities in and around Scranton.  There are signs that these investments 

are paying off.  Household incomes in Scranton are growing again.  The area’s 

unemployment rate is close to its lowest level in the past 40 years.  I look forward to 

hearing from the community bankers gathered here today about the outlook for families 

and businesses in Northeastern Pennsylvania and how you are helping the region invest 

and grow.  

And I am looking forward to continuing the discussions tomorrow, when I will 

visit with the Scranton Area Community Foundation to discuss the Northeastern 

Pennsylvania equitable transportation initiative, NEPA Moves, that is working on 

transportation solutions to connect residents with opportunity.  I look forward to visiting 

Geisinger Fresh Food Farmacy and meeting with patients to hear about the innovative 

“food as medicine” program.  I also look forward to visiting the Cedar Avenue corridor
