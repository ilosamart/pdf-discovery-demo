the kind of material change in the risks faced by a firm, such that a supplemental capital plan 

would be needed during the course of the year. 

It is important to note that the capital planning process, including the stress testing 

component, provides supervisors with the opportunity to determine whether banking 

organizations need to maintain capital ratios above the minimum levels specified in the various 

Basel frameworks as implemented into U.S. law.  Institution-specific capital measures of this 

sort are explicitly contemplated in the Basel arrangements, in U.S. legislation, and in the 

regulations of U.S. banking agencies.  During the financial crisis, we used our safety-and-

soundness authority to require banks to hold sufficient capital to weather the impact of the crisis 

and the serious recession that followed.  Similarly, our annual capital plan review is a forward-

looking exercise that, in estimating losses and reduced revenues that would follow an adverse 

economic scenario, may result in requiring banks to maintain more capital than would a static, 

backward-looking snapshot of minimum capital levels. 

Conclusion 

On a number of previous occasions, I have noted that, for all the disagreement over the 

right set of financial reform measures, on one point there is near unanimity: No one wants 

another TARP program.  Not those who thought TARP was the best of a bad set of options in the 

fall of 2008.  Certainly not those who opposed it.  Not the American people, many of whom saw 

the injection of billions of dollars of government capital into financial firms as more a bail-out of 

large banks than an imperative to stabilize the financial system.  And not even, I suspect, most of 

the large financial firms that received the government capital. 

Each of what I have characterized as the three threads of capital regulation reform is still 

in development.  Domestically, there are notice-and-comment rulemakings still to be done in
