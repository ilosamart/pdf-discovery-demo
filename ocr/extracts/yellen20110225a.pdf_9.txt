To assess the macroeconomic effects of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase 

program, I would like to highlight some findings from a recent study by four Federal 

Reserve System economists.6  As shown in figure 5, the authors constructed an 

illustrative baseline trajectory for the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over the 

course of this decade (solid line) as well as an alternative trajectory corresponding to a 

counterfactual scenario in which the FOMC never decided to initiate any securities 

purchases (dashed line).   

The baseline incorporates the first round of asset purchases--which brought the 

Federal Reserve’s securities holdings to a little more than $2 trillion.  It embeds an 

assumption that the FOMC will complete the purchases announced last November so that 

the balance sheet expands to about $2.6 trillion by the middle of this year.  From that 

point forward, the authors assume that the overall size of the portfolio will remain 

unchanged until mid-2012 and then shrink gradually at a rate sufficient to return it to its 

pre-crisis trend line by mid-2016, whereupon the Federal Reserve resumes expanding its 

holdings at the trend rate.  Full convergence of the composition of the portfolio is not 

complete until 2017, however, as the average maturity of the portfolio is still somewhat 

elevated in 2016.  It should also be noted that the trend line itself rises gradually over 

time as a consequence of steady growth in demand for U.S. currency.  

Of course, the baseline trajectory is purely illustrative:  The actual evolution of 

the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will depend on the decisions that the FOMC will 

make in light of economic and financial developments.  Nonetheless, the overall 

characteristics of this assumed trajectory seem broadly consistent with the sense of the 

Committee’s discussions last spring.  In particular, as reported in the minutes of the April
