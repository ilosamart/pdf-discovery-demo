considerable uncertainty regarding the conditions that might warrant changes in an 

existing program or the introduction of a new one.  

In a step roughly analogous to the shift from date-based guidance to the 

contingent, thresholds-based guidance now in use for the federal funds rate target, in 

September 2012 the FOMC announced a program of asset purchases in which the total 

size of the purchase program would not be fixed in advance but instead would be linked 

to the Committee’s economic objectives.  In particular, the Committee initiated purchases 

of agency MBS at the rate of $40 billion per month and stated its intention to continue 

purchases until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of 

price stability.14  In December 2012, when a program to extend the maturity of the Fed’s 

portfolio of Treasury securities came to an end, the FOMC added purchases of 

$45 billion per month in longer-term Treasury securities to the new program, bringing the 

monthly purchase rate to $85 billion, where it remains today.   

As I noted, the Committee set a criterion of substantial improvement in the 

outlook for the labor market as the condition for ending the new purchase program.  The 

Committee also signaled its expectation that it would end the purchases and return to an 

emphasis on rates policy and forward guidance before it had fully attained its dual 

mandate objectives, stating that “the Committee expects that a highly accommodative 

stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset 

purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.”15  The reason for this 

                                                 
14 This criterion was expressed in slightly different ways in the FOMC statements between September 2012 
and January 2013.  Since March 2013, the statement has included the sentence, “The Committee will 
continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy 
tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price 
stability.”  FOMC statements are available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.
