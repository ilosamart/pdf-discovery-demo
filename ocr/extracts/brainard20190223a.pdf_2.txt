It is an honor to be a part of the inaugural Sadie T. M. Alexander conference in 

economics and related fields.  I want to thank each of you in this room and those of you 

livestreaming who form the Sadie Collective.  Special thanks go to Mykelle Richburg, 

Kayla Jones, Olusayo Adeleye, George-Ann Ryan, Jada Houser, Fanta Traore, and Anna 

Gifty Opoku-Agyeman for taking the initiative and launching this organization and this 

conference to increase the representation of black women in the field of economics.  I 

applaud your efforts, and I support your mission.1   

The story of Dr. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander is an inspiration for us all.  A 

woman of firsts--the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in economics and the first 

woman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania--she was a pioneer 

who knocked down some daunting doors.  The question for the women in this room here 

today is whether you will follow her through those doors and maybe knock down a few 

of your own. 

The Need for Greater Diversity 

Let me start by making two observations about economics.  First, the field of 

economics is rooted in evidence and research.  The second observation follows strongly 

from the research and the evidence:  Economics has a diversity challenge.   

There is a stubbornly persistent lack of diversity in the economics profession.2  

Year after year, minorities and women are underrepresented in the pool of individuals

2 “Between 1995 and 2014, the share of women obtaining a doctorate in economics held roughly steady in 
the neighborhood of 30 percent. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning doctorates, the 
representation of those identifying as black, Hispanic, or Native American among the pool of doctorate 
recipients improved from 6 percent in 1995 to 11 percent in 2007.  But the improvement has since 
unwound and the underrepresented minority share stood at about 7 percent in 2014.”  See Lael Brainard,
