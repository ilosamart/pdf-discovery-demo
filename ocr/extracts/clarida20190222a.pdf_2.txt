I am pleased to participate in this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, which, 

since its inception, has brought together policymakers, academics, and market 

participants to share ideas and perspectives on U.S. monetary policy.  Today I would like 

to discuss the broad review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework that we 

are undertaking this year.  We will examine the policy strategy, tools, and communication 

practices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and 

price stability.  In my remarks, I will describe the motivation for and scope of this review 

and will preview some of the events we are planning as part of it.1  The U.S. Monetary 

Policy Forum is an excellent venue for this presentation.  For more than a decade, it has 

focused attention and timely analysis on critical issues confronting the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC).  Its programs have drawn on the latest economic research 

and considered a range of views.  Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary 

policy framework will be transparent, will be open minded, and will seek perspectives 

from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including academics, other 

specialists, and the public at large. 

Motivation for the Review 

The fact that the System is conducting this review does not suggest that we are 

dissatisfied with the existing policy framework.  Indeed, we believe our existing 

framework has served us well, helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned 

dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Nonetheless, in light of 

the unprecedented events of the past decade, we believe it is a good time to step back and 

assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and
