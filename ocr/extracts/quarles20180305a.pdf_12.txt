Accordingly, we will be looking for ways to reduce the compliance burden of the Volcker rule 

for foreign banks with limited U.S. operations and small U.S. trading books.    

Conclusion 

As I have described previously, the Federal Reserve is actively reviewing post-crisis 

financial reforms in an effort to better understand which reforms are working well and which 

ones can be improved to reduce regulatory burden and improve the efficiency, transparency, and 

simplicity of the regulatory framework without compromising a safe and sound financial system.  

In that effort, we recognize the importance of foreign banks to the U.S. economy and have a 

strong interest in ensuring our regulations are appropriately tailored to their U.S. footprint and 

risks to U.S. financial stability.  Our goal is to maintain a regulatory framework that helps to 

ensure a strong and stable banking system in an efficient manner that does not result in 

excessively burdensome costs to the banking industry or the economy as a whole.  

The areas I have discussed today are important components of the exercise of improving 

our regulations as they apply to FBOs, and are part of a larger overall agenda to critically 

evaluate and improve our regulations to promote financial stability while fostering the conditions 

for solid economic activity.  Some of these exercises will require more effort and time than 

others, but each one of them is a high priority for us at the Federal Reserve.  I look forward to 

hearing your views as we make progress toward these improvements.
