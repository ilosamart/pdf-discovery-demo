market recovery on track.16  These episodes illustrate what I described earlier as a vital 

aspect of effective monetary policymaking:  monitor the economy for signs that events 

are unfolding in a materially different manner than expected and adjust policy in response 

in a systematic manner.  Now I will turn from the task of monitoring to the policy 

response. 

Policy Challenges in an Unprecedented Recovery 

Fundamental to modern thinking on central banking is the idea that monetary 

policy is more effective when the public better understands and anticipates how the 

central bank will respond to evolving economic conditions.  Specifically, it is important 

for the central bank to make clear how it will adjust its policy stance in response to 

unforeseen economic developments in a manner that reduces or blunts potentially 

harmful consequences.  If the public understands and expects policymakers to behave in 

this systematically stabilizing manner, it will tend to respond less to such developments.  

Monetary policy will thus have an “automatic stabilizer” effect that operates through 

private-sector expectations.  It is important to note that tying the response of policy to the 

economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain.  But by 

responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing 

uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment. 

Recall how this worked during the couple of decades before the crisis--a period 

sometimes known as the Great Moderation.  The FOMC’s main policy tool, the federal 

funds rate, was well above zero, leaving ample scope to respond to the modest shocks 

                                                 
16 There are a range of estimates on the effectiveness of these policies.  A review is provided in Ben S. 
Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The Changing 
Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson 
Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1,
