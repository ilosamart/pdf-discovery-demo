(IOSCO). The PFMI lays out comprehensive expectations for CCPs and other financial market 

infrastructures. 


Recent Accomplishments 

Extensive work has been done to implement the PFMI.2  The joint CCP work plan agreed 

to in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board (or FSB), CPMI, IOSCO, and the Basel Committee 

on Banking Supervision (or BCBS) laid out an ambitious program to provide further guidance on 

the PFMI and better understand interdependencies between CCPs and their members.3 

CPMI and IOSCO will soon publish more granular guidance on CCP resilience, focusing 

on governance, stress testing credit and liquidity risk, margin, and recovery planning.  While this 

guidance will not establish new standards beyond those set out in the PFMI, I believe that it will 

encourage CCPs and their regulators to engage in thoughtful dialogue on how they could further 

enhance their practices. 

The FSB has led the work on resolution planning for CCPs, publishing draft guidance 

this past February.  The guidance covers a range of topics, including the powers that resolution 

                                                           
2 In 2013, CPMI-IOSCO launched a multi-level, multi-year monitoring program to evaluate how the principles and 
responsibilities in the PFMI are being implemented around the world.  Several different assessments have been 
completed to date and the findings have provided important insight on both the progress and methods by which 
authorities and CCPs have sought to implement the PFMI.  In 2014, CPMI-IOSCO published supplemental 
guidance and a menu of recovery tools to help financial market infrastructures, including CCPs, meet the 
expectations in the PFMI that all financial market infrastructures have a comprehensive and effective recovery plan.    
3 While the work done in the context of the joint work plan represents significant regulatory efforts related to CCPs, 
progress is also being made on a parallel path.  In particular, it is important to highlight the adoption and 
implementation of the SEC’s Covered Clearing Agency Standards, which further strengthens the risk management 
standards that clearing agencies registered with the SEC must meet.  In addition, the SEC and the industry have been 
working jointly to shorten the settlement cycle to two days for many securities products, culminating in the SEC’s 
adoption of amendments to Rule 15c6-1(a) earlier this year.
