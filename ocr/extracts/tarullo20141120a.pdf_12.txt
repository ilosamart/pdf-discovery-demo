After a somewhat lengthy gestation period, there has been considerable recent progress 

on measures that reflect the role for liquidity regulation I have just described.  The U.S. banking 

agencies have worked with other regulators in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to 

develop two quantitative liquidity standards--the LCR and the NSFR.  These standards 

complement the bank capital framework and resolution mechanisms that have been agreed 

internationally.  They will also help central banks limit the use of LOLR.  In addition, as I have 

previously noted, the Federal Reserve is working on a proposal to tie risk-based capital 

surcharges for each U.S. global systemically important bank (G-SIB) to that G-SIB’s reliance on 

short-term wholesale funding.10  Together, these standards are designed to mitigate the risks 

associated with banks’ reliance on unstable funding structures and to encourage them to embrace 

more resilient funding models.  

Under the LCR, banking organizations11 must hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets 

sufficient to cover net cash outflows during a 30-day stress scenario.  This requirement serves 

several of the purposes discussed earlier.  A buffer of high-quality liquid assets is a form of self-

insurance against liquidity risk that allows banks to meet short-term needs in the event of 

creditor runs.  Because holding the buffer is likely to be somewhat costly, the LCR should also 

encourage banks to reduce use of very short-term wholesale funding that increases buffer 

requirements.  The buffer will also provide central banks and other national authorities time to 

assess the financial condition of a firm encountering liquidity difficulties and to determine the

11 Under the U.S. rule implementing the LCR, the LCR would apply to banking organizations with total 
consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or total consolidated on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion 
or more.  In addition, a simpler, less stringent version of the LCR would apply to other banking organizations with 
$50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.  LCR requirements would not apply to banking organizations with 
total assets of less than $50 billion.
