might well have backed up significantly following the November FOMC meeting if the 

Committee had decided not to move ahead with the program.12 

As shown in figure 4, longer-term Treasury yields have risen substantially over 

the past couple of months since the FOMC initiated this round of asset purchases.  I 

believe that this increase in Treasury yields likely reflects a number of significant factors, 

including incoming information suggesting a somewhat stronger economic outlook and 

the fiscal package that was announced by President Obama in early December and 

approved by the Congress about two weeks later; that package will not only support 

economic growth next year but will also increase the amount of federal debt issuance.  

Also, investors appear to have scaled back their expectations about the extent to which 

the FOMC will engage in further purchases beyond those already announced; however, 

the effect of that reassessment on market rates tends to bolster the view that the Federal 

Reserve’s securities purchases do indeed affect yields in the direction indicated by 

analytical and empirical studies.13 

Will the Asset Purchase Program Lead to Excessive Inflation? 

A concern voiced by some observers is that the asset purchase program will lead 

to excessive inflation.  One rationale for this view is that the economy is currently 

operating with little slack--that is, an unemployment rate that is not far from the NAIRU.  

A second rationale is that asset purchases have ballooned the Fed’s balance sheet and the 

supply of bank reserves.  I will consider each argument in turn.   

                                                 
12 Consistent with the conjecture that bond yields are affected by expected purchase size, the 30-year 
Treasury yield increased markedly in the days following the November FOMC meeting, as market 
participants reportedly revised downward their expectations of the amount of purchases by the Federal 
Reserve in this maturity sector. 
13 The backup in rates may have been amplified by technical factors such as mortgage-related hedging 
flows and year-end positioning by leveraged investors.
