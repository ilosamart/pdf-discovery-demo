Given their importance in holding and transferring funds, banks continue to have 

a key role to play in the design and safety of more efficient retail payment systems.  

Without bank participation, it would be difficult to change how funds are transferred in a 

way that brings pervasive benefits to consumers.  For example, if the aim is to capture the 

speed and continuous nature of today’s commerce in the payment system as a whole—as 

has become a focus for many countries, including the United States—it would be difficult 

to do so without banks allowing the transfer of their deposits on a 24x7 real-time basis.  

Of course, individual payment systems are already doing this for consumers within their 

own network.  But achieving these benefits on a broad scale would be challenging 

without the banking system’s participation, because of the large role banks have in 

holding and transferring funds. 

All this is to say that we are at a critical juncture in the payment system’s 

evolution, where technology is rapidly changing many facets of the payments process.  

Fintech firms and banks are seizing these technological changes in their own ways.  But a 

collective and collaborative effort by all payment stakeholders will also be important as 

the United States works to achieve a payment system that has broad reach and can 

seamlessly integrate with other systems to transfer funds in a reliable, secure, and 

convenient manner.  When we pay with cash or write a check, we don’t spend a lot of 

time worrying about who our recipient banks with; that universality seems an appropriate 

standard for new payment options as well.

At the Federal Reserve, we believe it is important to embrace opportunities 

provided by technological change to improve the convenience and safety of the U.S.
