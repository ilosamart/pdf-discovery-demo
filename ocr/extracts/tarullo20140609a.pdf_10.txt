enterprisewide risk management practices” of the firm.8  This provision in itself requires only 

that the bank holding companies have capable and independent risk committees that, by 

extension, should be overseeing well-developed risk-management practices and systems of 

controls in the firms.  It does not specify what the risk appetite of the firm should be.  However, 

its inclusion in section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires an array of additional 

prudential measures directed at firms that could pose threats to financial stability, suggests that 

the risk-committee mandate has a prudential motivation. 

Of course, good risk management is important for shareholders as well.  Regulatory 

prods for efficient management information systems and well-developed risk-assessment 

procedures should generally be welcomed by shareholders.  Similarly, regulatory insistence on 

capable and independent oversight of risk management is consonant with shareholder interests, 

which might be damaged by employees who exercise poor judgment or whose compensation 

structures may incentivize them to take risks not desirable for the firm as a whole.  To a 

considerable extent, then, fostering sound risk-management practices serves the overlapping 

interests of both shareholders and regulators. 

The possible divergence of interests comes not in the architecture of risk management but 

in substantive decisions on risk appetite.  How, then, might corporate governance be changed to 

incorporate risk considerations consistent with micro- and macroprudential regulatory 

objectives?  One way would be to broaden the fiduciary duties of boards and management.  The 

other, which has already been followed to some degree, is to apply regulatory and supervisory 

requirements to relevant corporate governance processes.  Of course, realization of the first 

approach would require either changes in state corporate law or amendments to federal securities

management expert having experience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk exposures of large, complex 
firms.”
