awarded a doctorate in economics in the United States relative to their share in the 

broader population, and the gap is especially acute for women of color.  The American 

Economic Association reports that in the 2016–17 academic year, seven black/African 

American women were awarded a doctorate in economics in the United States, along 

with eight black/African American men, out of a total pool of 1,150 economics Ph.D.’s 

awarded overall. 

The economics diversity gap starts even earlier.3  As Amanda Bayer and David 

Wilcox have documented, women and minorities are also underrepresented in 

undergraduate economics programs.  From 2011 to 2015, women accounted for only 31 

percent of undergraduate degrees in economics--substantially below their 57 percent 

share of all four-year undergraduate degrees.  For black women, the gap is even bigger:  

they accounted for 1.5 percent of undergraduate economics degrees compared with a 6.2 

percent share of all undergraduate degrees.4   

A growing body of research and evidence makes clear that the quality of the 

economics profession and its contribution to society will be greater when a broader range 

of people are engaged.5  Research shows that greater diversity results in better outcomes-

-it broadens the range of ideas and perspectives brought to bear on solving problems, and 

it brings important insights to the analysis of our economy.  As Amanda Bayer and Cecilia
