much these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much 

targeted intervention is required through other policy means.   

There is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth 

rate and equality of opportunity.  Large disparities in opportunity based on race, ethnicity, 

gender, or geography mean that the enterprise, exertion, and investments of households 

and businesses from different groups are not rewarded commensurately.  To the extent 

that disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect 

such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged 

groups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth 

will fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.4   

Aside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy, 

persistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for 

the robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate 

spending in the United States.  The gaps in household income and wealth between the 

richest and poorest households are at historically high levels, as income and wealth have 

increasingly accrued to the very richest households.  For example, results from the 

Federal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is due to be released 

soon, indicate that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of households reached 

24 percent in 2015, up from 17 percent in 1988.  The share of wealth held by the top 

1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.5  Some research 

suggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in
