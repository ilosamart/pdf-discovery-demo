average of 2-1/2 percent from 1949 to 2005.  This halving of productivity growth, if it 

were to persist, would have wide-ranging consequences for living standards, wage 

growth, and economic policy more broadly.  A number of explanations have been offered 

for the decline in productivity growth, including mismeasurement in the official statistics, 

depressed capital investment, and a falloff in business dynamism, with reality likely 

reflecting some combination of all of these factors and more.      

We should also consider the possibility that weak demand has played a role in 

holding back productivity growth, although standard economic textbooks generally trace 

a path from productivity growth to demand rather than vice versa.  Chair Yellen recently 

spoke on the influence of demand on aggregate supply.3  In her speech, she reviewed a 

body of literature that suggests that demand conditions can have persistent effects on 

supply.4  In most of the literature, these effects are thought to occur through hysteresis in 

labor markets.  But there are likely also some channels through which low aggregate 

demand could affect productivity, perhaps by lowering research-and-development 

spending or decreasing the pace of firm formation and innovation.  I believe that the 

relationship between productivity growth and the strength of aggregate demand is an area 

where further research is required.
