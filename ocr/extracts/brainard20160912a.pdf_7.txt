Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has 

slowed rapidly in recent years.9  Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging 

transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state-

owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private 

businesses.  Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic 

trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow.  Given that China has experienced 

very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks.  Importantly, Chinese 

authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital 

outflows have slowed in recent months.  Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains, 

and further volatility cannot be ruled out.  The importance of Chinese growth and 

stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies 

that these risks have global implications.    

Headwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent 

experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances 

emanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S. 

financial markets.  The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more 

powerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously.  Indeed, recent research suggests that 

changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other 

major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger 

than they were several years ago.10  The fact that many advanced economies are suffering 

from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S. 

                                                 
9 Emerging market growth, as weighted by a countryâ€™s share of U.S. exports, has decreased from an 

average pace of 5-1/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2 

percent last year.
