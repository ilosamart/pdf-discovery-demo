been recently suggested, over the longer run--to reduce the likelihood of hitting the zero lower 

bound.  Although I agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, I do 

not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets.  Central banks around the world 

have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by 

businesses and households when making decisions about the future.  Moreover, inflation 

expectations are well anchored at those low levels.  

Increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse 

economic outcomes over time.  Inflation expectations would necessarily have to become 

unanchored as inflation moved up.  I doubt households and businesses would immediately raise 

their expectations to the new targets and that expectations would then be well anchored at the 

new higher levels.  Instead, I fear there could be a long learning process, just as when inflation 

trended down over recent decades.  Moreover, a higher inflation target might also mean that 

inflation would be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation 

more into account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that 

otherwise transitory inflation would become more persistent.  

For both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make 

expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other 

economic conditions.  That greater sensitivity would reduce the ability of central banks to buffer 

the economy from bad shocks.  It could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run 

and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates.  It is notable that while the 

theoretical economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central 

bank has raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis.
