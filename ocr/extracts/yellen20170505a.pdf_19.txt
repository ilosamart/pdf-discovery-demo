Conclusion 

The United States faces a number of longer-term economic challenges, including 

the aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity.  One recent study 

estimates that increasing the female participation rate to that of men would raise our gross 

domestic product by 5 percent.49  And, as I have argued, our workplaces and families, as 

well as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress.  However, a number 

of factors, which I have only had a chance to touch upon, appear to be holding women 

back, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers 

with other aspects of their lives, including caregiving.  In looking to solutions, we should 

consider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women, 

but all workers.  Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in 

women’s involvement in the workforce, which, as I have described here, has contributed 

not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our 

country.   

The title for my remarks today, “So We All Can Succeed,” was inspired by 

Malala Yousafzai, the advocate for girls’ and women’s education, who said, “We cannot 

all succeed when half of us are held back.”50  Brown University has played its own role 

by admitting women 125 years ago, by educating many thousands of women over the

claims (Lovell, 2008).

Note: On May 5, 2017, a typo was corrected to change 83 to 93 in the following sentence on page 8: “By 
the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age women--those between the ages of 
25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared with roughly 83 percent for prime working-age men.”
