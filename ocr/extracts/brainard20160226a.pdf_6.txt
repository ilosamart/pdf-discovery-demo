economies.  The sharp repeated declines in the price of oil have been a major common 

factor depressing headline inflation and are also likely feeding into low core inflation, 

although to a lesser extent.5  As noted previously, these price declines have led headline 

inflation across the globe to behave quite similarly over this time period.  Even so, most 

observers expect this source of convergence in inflationary outcomes to eventually fade 

and thereafter not affect monetary policy paths over the medium term.   

In contrast, a more persistent source of convergence may be found in an apparent 

decline in the neutral rate of interest.  The neutral rate of interest--or the rate of interest 

consistent with the economy remaining at its potential rate of output and inflation 

remaining at target level--appears to have declined over the past 30 years in the United 

States and is now at historically low levels.6  Similarly, longer-run interest rates appear 

also to have fallen across a broad group of advanced and emerging market economies, 

suggesting that neutral rates are at historically low levels in many countries around the 

world and near or below zero in the major advanced foreign economies.7  Although the 

reasons for the declines in neutral rates are not perfectly understood and may differ across 

countries, there are some common drivers, such as slower productivity and labor force 

growth and a heightened sensitivity to risk.8   

                                                 
5 In five of the six quarters since mid-2014, the price of oil has decreased for a cumulative decline of 
70 percent.

Johannsen and Mertens (2016).

(International Monetary Fund, 2014). 
8 While the empirical link between potential growth and the neutral rate is not precisely estimated, the 
evidence suggests that slower trend growth is associated with lower interest rates; see Laubach and 
Williams (2015) and Hamilton and others (2015).  U.S. labor force growth has slowed from 1 percent from 
2001 to 2004 to 1/2 percent over the most recent 4 years.  Over the same periods, euro-area growth has 
slowed from 1.3 percent to 0.4 percent.  In Japan the labor force was essentially flat from 2011 to 2015, 
though this was a slight improvement from a small rate of decline in the early 2000s.  Productivity growth 
over the same periods has slowed from 3.0 percent to 0.5 percent in the United States, from 0.6 percent to 
0.2 percent in the euro area, and 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent in Japan.
