leverage by banks.2  It is much harder to find evidence that low interest rates have led to 

increased post-crisis risk-taking by U.S. banks.  Growth in overall lending by U.S. banks 

has been modest at best.  However, some pockets of increased risk-taking by banks and 

other investors are observable in domestic markets, such as leveraged loans.  And on the 

international front, there has been a notable increase in syndicated loan originations.   

Recent research by Board staff, using a database of loans primarily to U.S. 

borrowers but also to some foreign borrowers, suggests that lenders have indeed 

originated an increased number of risky syndicated loans post-crisis, based on the 

assessed probability of default as reported to bank supervisors (figure 1).3  Regression 

results confirm that the average probability of default is significantly inversely related to 

U.S. long-term interest rates.  This increase in riskiness of syndicated loans post-crisis 

has been accompanied by a shift in the composition of loan holders:  An increasing share 

is now held not by banks but by hedge, pension, and other investment funds (figure 2).  

These nonbank investors also tend to hold loans with higher average credit risk (figure 3).  

These data suggest that a tougher regulatory environment may have made U.S.-based 

bank originators unable or unwilling to hold risky loans on their balance sheets.  Related 

work by the same researchers, using a database with more-extensive coverage of loans to
