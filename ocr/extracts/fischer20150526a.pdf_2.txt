I am happy to be here today, and I thank the organizers for inviting me.1  It is a 

particular pleasure to be back in Israel, where my career as a central banker began.  At 

the Fed, I face a somewhat different set of responsibilities, and my lecture today is on the 

special challenges that face the Federal Reserve and the global economy in an 

increasingly interconnected world.2   

Over the past 50 years, global trade has more than tripled relative to world gross 

domestic product (GDP), and the ratio of total exports to global GDP now stands at about 

30 percent--though, interestingly, the rate of growth of global international trade has 

declined to the level of the growth rate of world GDP since the start of the Great 

Recession.  International trade has not loomed as large in the U.S. national accounts as it 

has for many other countries, but it is an increasingly important driver of the U.S. 

economy, with the share of trade in U.S. GDP currently at about 15 percent.   

Although the U.S. share of world GDP has gradually declined since the mid-20th 

century, the broader importance of the United States to the global economy has 

diminished less, as a result of increasing financial linkages.  In particular, U.S. residents’ 

ownership of private foreign assets has risen from 6.5 percent of U.S. annual GDP in 

1950 to more than 140 percent of annual U.S. GDP (nearly $25 trillion), reflecting the 

leading role of U.S. capital markets in cross-border finance.  Total foreign investment in 

the United States is even larger, at more than $30 trillion.   

                                                 
1 I am grateful to John Ammer, Christopher Erceg, Joseph Gruber, and Beth Anne Wilson of the Federal 
Reserve Board’s staff for their assistance in preparing these remarks.

2014.
