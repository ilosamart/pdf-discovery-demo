the share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains a full percentage 

point above the pre-recession level of around 3 percent, despite considerable recent 

improvement.  Even if there has been some trend increase in part-time work, it seems 

unlikely to account for all of the difference between current levels and pre-recession 

levels.3 

Perhaps the most striking evidence in support of continued labor market slack is 

the absence of any acceleration in wages and prices.  Our main gauges of wage inflation 

suggest that labor compensation is increasing at a pace of about 2 to 2-1/4 percent, little 

different from the rate of increase over the past several years.  Indeed, the lack of wage 

acceleration is likely one of the key reasons that many Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) participants have revised down their estimates of the longer-run level of the 

unemployment rate.  Most recently, a majority of participants moved their estimates 

below 5 percent.4  By comparison, in September 2012, the central tendency of estimates 

of the longer-run unemployment rate ranged from 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  

More broadly, domestic real activity appears likely to continue to grow at a 

moderate pace.  Domestic final sales, which exclude net exports and the volatile category 

of inventory investment, increased at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the first half of 

                                                 
and the decision to participate in the labor force may respond with a lag to cyclical improvements.  See 

Aaronson and others (2014) and Erceg and Levin (2014).  
3 Changes in the structure of labor demand, such as a shift toward occupations or industries characterized 

by flexible and part-time hours, may have led to an increase in the equilibrium level of part-time work.  For 

more on this issue, see Cajner and others (2014) and Valletta and van der List (2015). If workers combine 

two or more part-time jobs to arrive at a full-time workweek, part-time employment could be elevated with 

average weekly hours at normal levels.  But the logistical costs of multiple job holding make such an 

outcome unlikely, and in recent years elevated part-time employment has not coincided with an increase in 

official estimates of multiple job holding.
