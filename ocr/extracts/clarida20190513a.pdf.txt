“New England Perspectives on Fed Policymaking:  A ‘Fed Listens’ Conference” 
hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 

 
Boston, Massachusetts 


May 13, 2019 
 



I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing a New England 

perspective for the Federal Reserve’s review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices.1  We are bringing open minds to our review and are seeking a 

broad range of perspectives.  To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to 

engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive 

approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 

Motivation for the Review 

The Congress charged the Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate—

maximum employment and price stability—and this review will take this mandate as 

given.  We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for 

personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-

stability mandate.  While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and 

communications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate 

ways they might be improved.  That said, based on the experience of other central banks 

that have undertaken similar reviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not 

a revolution, in the way we conduct monetary policy. 

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and 

price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review.  The 

unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent 

objective.  We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming

framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes.

years.  In addition, we will evaluate the new policy tools and enhanced communication 

practices the Federal Reserve deployed in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the 

Great Recession.  Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved 

significantly since before the crisis. 

Perhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United 

States and abroad.3  This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for 

years and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-

taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.  These factors’ contributions are 

highly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the 

decline in neutral rates are important.  All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates 

increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower 

bound in future economic downturns.  That development, in turn, could make it more 

difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business 

investment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.4 

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less 

responsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between 

inflation and employment.5  This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.  

It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during 

                                                 
3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several 
contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); 
and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018). 
4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound 
and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others 
(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019). 
5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research as a 
flattening of the short-run Phillips curve.  For evidence of this flattening in the slope of the Phillips curve in 
the United States and abroad, see, among others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, 
and Summers (2015); and Bank for International Settlements (2017).

downturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained 

inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment 

conditions.6  However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, 

of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, it is all the 

more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels 

consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

Our monetary policy review will have several components.8  The Board and the 

Reserve Banks are hosting Fed Listens events—such as this one in Boston—in which we 

are hearing from, among others, business and labor leaders, community development 

advocates, and academics.  Next month, we are holding a System research conference at 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  

                                                 
6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary 
policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such 
a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and 
Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a 
central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the 
adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary 
policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to 
shocks. 
7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others 
(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the 
precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the 
level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in 
these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low 
and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in 
determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.

communications.htm.

The program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the 

review. 

Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal Open 

Market Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy, 

beginning around the middle of the year.  We expect to make our conclusions public in 

the first half of 2020. 

Concluding Thoughts 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict 

our ultimate finding.  What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary 

policy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and 

sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
