include time-varying caps on mortgage loan-to-value ratios and household debt-to-

income ratios, which have been used in Korea and Hong Kong, and dynamic 

provisioning for losses by banks, which has been employed in Spain.  The Basel III 

package of reforms that was agreed to last year includes a countercyclical capital buffer 

that can be imposed when excessive growth of risk-taking in credit markets results in an 

unacceptable level of systemic risk.  Another policy that has been put forward but not yet 

tried is countercyclical margins and haircuts for funding contracts, as proposed by the 

Committee on the Global Financial System.5 

Of course, U.S. policymakers will need to examine such policy tools in depth 

before implementing them here.  As a first step, policymakers need to establish that 

countercyclical policy tools address cyclical vulnerabilities more effectively than simpler 

tools that are constant over the course of the cycle do.6  In addition, in taking lessons 

from abroad, policymakers need to be aware of institutional differences that may prevent 

tools from having the same effects in the United States as they do elsewhere.  A further 

issue is that the literature on the efficacy of macroprudential tools in limiting the buildup 

of cyclical systemic risks is still at an early stage.  Even for policies that have been used 

in other countries, the number of papers that evaluate their effectiveness is relatively 

small, and isolating the effect of a specific policy amid an array of economic and 

financial developments is a persistent challenge.  Nonetheless, these papers are 

encouraging--at least to the further consideration of the use of cyclical policy tools--and

in Procyclicality,” CGFS Papers No. 36 (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for International Settlements, March),

6 Examples of constant, through-the-cycle policy tools are time-invariant caps on loan-to-value (LTV) and 
debt-to-income (DTI) ratios and time-invariant floors on margins and haircuts, which can likely play some 
role in limiting the buildup of cyclical vulnerabilities (even if they do not go as far as countercyclical 
policies).
