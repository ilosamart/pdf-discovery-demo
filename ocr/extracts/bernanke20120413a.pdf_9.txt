In retrospect, it is clear that the statutory framework of financial regulation in 

place before the crisis contained serious gaps.  Critically, shadow banking activities were, 

for the most part, not subject to consistent and effective regulatory oversight.  Much 

shadow banking lacked meaningful prudential regulation, including various special 

purpose vehicles, ABCP conduits, and many nonbank mortgage-origination companies.  

No regulatory body restricted the leverage and liquidity policies of these entities, and few 

if any regulatory standards were imposed on the quality of their risk management or the 

prudence of their risk-taking.  Market discipline, imposed by creditors and counterparties, 

helped on some dimensions but did not effectively limit the systemic risks these entities 

posed. 

Other shadow banking activities were potentially subject to some prudential 

oversight, but weaknesses in the statutory and regulatory framework meant that in 

practice they were inadequately regulated and supervised.  For example, the Securities 

and Exchange Commission supervised the largest broker-dealer holding companies but 

only through an opt-in arrangement that lacked the force of a statutory regulatory regime.  

Large broker-dealer holding companies faced serious losses and funding problems during 

the crisis, and the instability of such firms as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers severely 

damaged the financial system.  Similarly, the insurance operations of American 

International Group, Inc. (AIG), were supervised and regulated by various state and 

international insurance regulators, and the Office of Thrift Supervision had authority to 

supervise AIG as a thrift holding company.  However, oversight of AIG Financial 

Products, which housed the derivatives activities that imposed major losses on the firm, 

was extremely limited in practice.
