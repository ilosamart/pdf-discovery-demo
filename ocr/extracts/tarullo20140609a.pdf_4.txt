these today is the imposition of minimum capital requirements on all insured depository 

institutions and bank holding companies. 

 Second, there is a variety of ways in which the attributes of financial markets and 

financial regulation affect the capital market discipline assumed in much corporate governance 

theory and corporate law.  The prior point about the moral hazard associated with insured 

deposits implies that--at least in traditional, deposit-reliant banks--the kind of market discipline 

associated with the price of funding and creditor monitoring will be attenuated.  More generally, 

to the degree uninsured depositors or other bank creditors expect that they will be protected by 

the government in the event the bank encounters serious difficulties, those same features of 

market discipline will again be weakened.  This, of course, is the problem of moral hazard 

associated with too-big-to-fail perceptions, whereby investors or counterparties are willing to 

extend credit at prices that do not fully reflect the risk associated with the bank.2 

 The market discipline traditionally associated with the market for corporate control is 

also affected by banking regulation and supervision.  Mergers and acquisitions involving 

banking organizations are subject to review, and possible disapproval, on a broad range of 

grounds beyond the antitrust considerations relevant in all industries.  These include an 

assessment of the adequacy of the financial resources of the firms, the “competence, experience, 

and integrity” of the officers and directors, and the impact of the acquisition on systemic risk.3  

Moreover, of course, any firm that acquires a commercial bank must be a bank holding company, 

thereby subject to a range of activity restrictions and other regulatory requirements.  There are

disincentivized from doing so for too-big-to-fail institutions, see Mark J. Roe (2014), “Structural Corporate 
Degradation Due to Too-Big-to-Fail Finance,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review, vol. 162, pp. 1419-64

3 Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 §3, 12 U.S.C. §1842(c).  The Bank Merger Act requires consideration of a 
roughly comparable set of factors.  Acquisitions are also subject to special scrutiny where an acquiring firm has less-
than-satisfactory supervisory ratings.
