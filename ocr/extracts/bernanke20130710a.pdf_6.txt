board members drawn from the private sector, and they were given considerable scope to 

make policy decisions that applied to their own Districts.  For example, Reserve Banks 

were permitted to set their own discount rates, subject to a minimum set by the Board. 

While the founders of the Federal Reserve hoped that this new institution would 

provide financial and hence economic stability, the policy framework and the institutional 

structure would prove inadequate to the challenges the Fed would soon face.  

The Great Depression 

The Great Depression was the Federal Reserve’s most difficult test.  Tragically, 

the Fed failed to meet its mandate to maintain financial stability.  In particular, although 

the Fed provided substantial liquidity to the financial system following the 1929 stock 

market crash, its response to the subsequent banking panics was limited at best; the 

widespread bank failures and the collapse in money and credit that ensued were major 

sources of the economic downturn.

  Bagehot’s dictum to lend freely at a penalty rate in 

the face of panic appeared to have few adherents at the Federal Reserve of that era.

Economists have also identified a number of instances from the late 1920s to the 

early 1930s when Federal Reserve officials, in the face of the sharp economic contraction 

and financial upheaval, either tightened monetary policy or chose inaction.  Some 

historians trace these policy mistakes to the early death of Benjamin Strong, governor of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in 1928, which left the decentralized system 

without an effective leader.

  Whether valid or not, this hypothesis raises the interesting 

question of what intellectual framework an effective leader would have drawn on at the

 Meltzer (2003, pp. 282, 729-30) notes that Board members discussed Bagehot’s ideas but nevertheless 

did not integrate them fully into their approach to policy.
