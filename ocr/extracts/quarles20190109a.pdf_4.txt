The Federal Reserve’s Consolidated Supervision of Insurance Firms 

Now in its eighth year of having a supervisory role over certain insurers, the Federal 

Reserve continues to thoughtfully approach its mandates and authority.  The Dodd-Frank Act 

gave the Federal Reserve regulatory responsibilities for insurance holding companies that choose 

to own a federally insured depository institution and those designated by the Financial Stability 

Oversight Council.  The insurance thrift holding companies supervised by the Federal Reserve 

represent just under 10 percent of U.S. insurance industry assets and span a wide range of sizes, 

structures, and business activities.7  With a core focus on ensuring the safety and soundness of 

the supervised insurance institutions, and protecting their subsidiary depository institutions, the 

Board aims to continue fulfilling its role as consolidated supervisor by tailoring its oversight to 

the insurance business of the supervised firms, complementing the existing work of state 

insurance supervisors.   

The Federal Reserve has aimed to develop policies that are insurance-centric and 

appropriate for insurance risks.  For instance, the Board’s advance notice of proposed 

rulemaking (ANPR) on insurance capital requirements set out two frameworks for capital 

standards that are each unlike the Board’s capital rules for bank holding companies.8  The BBA, 

as set out in the ANPR, was fashioned as a framework that builds upon the regulatory capital 

rules of subsidiaries’ functional regulators--state or foreign insurance regulators for insurance 

subsidiaries and federal banking regulators for insured depository institutions--to provide a 

consolidated capital requirement.  We appreciate the comments we have received, including 

from the ACLI and other interested parties, and have worked hard to reflect the perspectives of
