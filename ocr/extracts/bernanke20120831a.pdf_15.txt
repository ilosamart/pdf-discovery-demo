but we will continue both our careful oversight and the implementation of financial 

regulatory reforms aimed at reducing systemic risk.   

A fourth potential cost of balance sheet policies is the possibility that the Federal 

Reserve could incur financial losses should interest rates rise to an unexpected extent.  

Extensive analyses suggest that, from a purely fiscal perspective, the odds are strong that 

the Fed’s asset purchases will make money for the taxpayers, reducing the federal deficit 

and debt.27  And, of course, to the extent that monetary policy helps strengthen the 

economy and raise incomes, the benefits for the U.S. fiscal position would be substantial.  

In any case, this purely fiscal perspective is too narrow:  Because Americans are workers 

and consumers as well as taxpayers, monetary policy can achieve the most for the 

country by focusing generally on improving economic performance rather than narrowly 

on possible gains or losses on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 

In sum, both the benefits and costs of nontraditional monetary policies are 

uncertain; in all likelihood, they will also vary over time, depending on factors such as 

the state of the economy and financial markets and the extent of prior Federal Reserve 

asset purchases.  Moreover, nontraditional policies have potential costs that may be less 

relevant for traditional policies.  For these reasons, the hurdle for using nontraditional 

policies should be higher than for traditional policies.  At the same time, the costs of 

nontraditional policies, when considered carefully, appear manageable, implying that we 

should not rule out the further use of such policies if economic conditions warrant.
