decided at its January, March, and April meetings that it would be prudent to maintain the 

existing target range for the federal funds rate.   

Over the past few months, financial conditions have recovered significantly and 

many of the risks from abroad have diminished, although some risks remain.  In addition, 

consumer spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall 

growth has indeed picked up as expected.  Unfortunately, as I noted earlier, new 

questions about the economic outlook have been raised by the recent labor market data.  

Is the markedly reduced pace of hiring in April and May a harbinger of a persistent 

slowdown in the broader economy?  Or will monthly payroll gains move up toward the 

solid pace they maintained earlier this year and in 2015?  Does the latest reading on the 

unemployment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment, or does 

relatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains?  My colleagues and I 

will be wrestling with these and other related questions going forward.       

Conclusion 

 To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to 

improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will 

probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMCâ€™s goals of maximum employment and 

price stability.  I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that 

apply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal 

funds rate.  My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming 

information implies for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook.  What is 

certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will 

respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals.
