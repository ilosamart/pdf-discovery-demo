manufacturing, for example, and even more in agriculture.  Housework involved a great 

deal of drudgery; refrigerators, freezers, vacuum cleaners, electric stoves, and washing 

machines were not in general use, which should not be terribly surprising since most 

urban households, and virtually all rural households, were not yet wired for electricity.  In 

the entertainment sphere, Americans did not yet have access to commercial radio 

broadcasts and movies would be silent for another decade and a half.  Some people had 

telephones, but no long-distance service was available.  In transportation, in 1913 Henry 

Ford was just beginning the mass production of the Model T automobile, railroads were 

powered by steam, and regular commercial air travel was quite a few years away.  

Importantly, life expectancy at birth in 1913 was only 53 years, reflecting not only the 

state of medical science at the time--infection-fighting antibiotics and vaccines for many 

deadly diseases would not be developed for several more decades--but also deficiencies 

in sanitation and nutrition.  This was quite a different world than the one in which I grew 

up in 1963 or in which we live today. 

The purpose of these comparisons is to make concrete the argument made by 

some economists, that the economic and technological transformation of the past 50 

years, while significant, does not match the changes of the 50 years--or, for that matter, 

the 100 years--before that.  Extrapolating to the future, the conclusion some have drawn 

is that the sustainable pace of economic growth and change and the associated 

improvement in living standards will likely slow further, as our most recent technological 

revolution, in computers and IT, will not transform our lives as dramatically as previous 

revolutions have.
