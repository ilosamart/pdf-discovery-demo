home and abroad as well as international capital flows.  While the Fed’s asset purchases 

were composed wholly of Treasury, agency, and agency-backed securities (for legal and 

practical reasons), the program also aimed to boost the prices of riskier assets and ease 

financial conditions for the private sector.9  (And this is what the textbooks say the 

program should have done.)  The preponderance of evidence suggests that the Fed’s asset 

purchases raised the prices of the assets purchased and close substitutes as well as those 

of riskier assets.10   

Importantly, evidence shows that foreign asset markets have been significantly 

affected by the Fed’s purchase programs.11  For example, event studies of announcements 

associated with the Fed’s purchase programs have found that they prompted inflows into 

investment funds holding both foreign debt and foreign equity securities.   

Of course, other countries’ monetary policy announcements can also leave an 

imprint on international asset prices, with market reactions to new initiatives enacted by 

the European Central Bank (ECB) one recent example.12  However, event studies tend to 

find larger international interest rate spillovers for U.S. policy announcements than for 

those of other central banks.13

nonconventional U.S. monetary expansion have driven capital flows into EMEs.

effects on sovereign yields in different countries.  Similarly, earlier work by Ehrmann and Fratzscher 
(2005) finds larger reactions in euro-area interest rates to U.S. rate changes than vice versa.
