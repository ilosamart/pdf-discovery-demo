somewhat on the side of higher capital requirements for these firms.  Indeed, there are some 

academics and others who continue to make a case for even higher capital requirements.   

The inclusion of the surcharges would allow the Federal Reserve to relax some of the 

conservative assumptions currently made in the stress test without lowering the overall post-

stress capital requirements for G-SIBs.18  While conservative assumptions were appropriate 

coming out of the financial crisis in the early days of the stress test, the SCB and its inclusion of 

the surcharges would offer an opportunity to update these assumptions without reducing the 

overall capital requirements for G-SIBs.  At the same time, relaxing these assumptions would 

result in a modest decline in the effective capital requirements of the non-G-SIB participating 

banks when, as I hope and expect, the Board of Governors moves forward with a rulemaking 

implementing the SCB idea.19 

Adoption of the SCB should remove a bit more of the drama originally associated with 

the annual announcement of the stress test results.  But some would remain, particularly given 

the possibility of a qualitative objection, even where the supervisory model shows that the firm 

would have enough capital to remain a viable intermediary in the event something like the 

severely adverse scenario came to pass.  Although the largest firms, unlike those with less than 

$250 billion in assets, are not yet generally meeting all supervisory expectations around stress 

testing and capital planning, they have each made substantial progress since 2009.  With a few 

exceptions, the issues observed during recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 

                                                 
18  This would likely include replacing the supervisory model’s current assumption that a firm’s balance sheet 
increases during the severely adverse scenario with a simpler assumption under which a balance sheet and risk-
weighted assets remain constant and relaxing the assumption that all of a firm’s planned dividends and share 
repurchases would proceed during CCAR’s two-year planning horizon.  Instead, given the SCB’s continuous 
constraint on distributions, we would assume a firm will maintain its dividends for one year while reducing its share 
repurchases.   
19 Based upon data from the 2015 and 2016 CCAR exercises, Federal Reserve staff estimates that the SCB would 
reduce by at least $10 billion the aggregate amount of common equity tier 1 capital the non-G-SIBs would need to 
maintain to avoid limitations on capital distributions.
