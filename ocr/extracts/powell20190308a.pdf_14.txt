Right now, most measures of the health and strength of the labor market look as 

favorable as they have in many decades.  Inflation will probably run a bit below our 

objective for a time due to declines in energy prices, but those effects are likely to prove 

transitory.  Core inflation, which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed 

over time, is quite close to 2 percent.  Despite this favorable picture, we have seen some 

cross-currents in recent months.  With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate 

policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the Committee has 

adopted a patient, wait-and-see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of 

policy. 

Considering monetary policy more broadly, we are inviting thorough public 

scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the Fed can best exercise 

the precious monetary policy independence we have been granted.  Our goal is to 

enhance the publicâ€™s trust in the Federal Reserve--our most valuable asset.
