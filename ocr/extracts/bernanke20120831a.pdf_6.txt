Large-scale asset purchases can influence financial conditions and the broader 

economy through other channels as well.  For instance, they can signal that the central 

bank intends to pursue a persistently more accommodative policy stance than previously 

thought, thereby lowering investors’ expectations for the future path of the federal funds 

rate and putting additional downward pressure on long-term interest rates, particularly in 

real terms.  Such signaling can also increase household and business confidence by 

helping to diminish concerns about “tail” risks such as deflation.  During stressful 

periods, asset purchases may also improve the functioning of financial markets, thereby 

easing credit conditions in some sectors.  

 With the space for further cuts in the target for the federal funds rate increasingly 

limited, in late 2008 the Federal Reserve initiated a series of large-scale asset purchases 

(LSAPs).  In November, the FOMC announced a program to purchase a total of 

$600 billion in agency MBS and agency debt.6  In March 2009, the FOMC expanded this 

purchase program substantially, announcing that it would purchase up to $1.25 trillion of 

agency MBS, up to $200 billion of agency debt, and up to $300 billion of longer-term 

Treasury debt.7  These purchases were completed, with minor adjustments, in early 

2010.8  In November 2010, the FOMC announced that it would further expand the 

Federal Reserve’s security holdings by purchasing an additional $600 billion of longer-

term Treasury securities over a period ending in mid-2011.9

8 Several months later, to avoid an implicit tightening in policy associated with the runoff of maturing 
securities, the Federal Reserve also began reinvesting the principal payments received on agency MBS and 
debt into Treasury securities and continued to roll over maturing longer-term Treasury debt.  See Board of
