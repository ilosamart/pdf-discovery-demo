electronic claims would be worth close to half that today.2  Indeed, Bitcoin’s value has been 

known to fluctuate by one-quarter in one day alone.  Such extreme fluctuations limit an asset’s 

ability to fulfill two of the classic functions of money:  to act as a stable store of value that 

people can hold and use predictably in the future, and to serve as a meaningful unit of account 

that can be used to assign a comparable value of goods and services.  

 In addition to losses, individual investors should be careful to understand the potential for 

other risks.3  Cryptocurrencies may raise important investor and consumer protection issues.  

The lack of strong governance and questions about the applicable legal framework for some 

cryptocurrencies may make consumers vulnerable to mistakes, thefts, and security breaches 

without much, or any, recourse.  Although the cryptographic technology may be robust to some 

events, such as the fraudulent double spending of the same units of the cryptocurrency for more 

than one transaction, the large number of breaches at some cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet 

providers suggest that significant vulnerabilities may remain with respect to security protections 

around customers’ accounts.4  These breaches remind us that relying solely on cryptography 

within the transfer technology is not enough.  Ultimately, a more holistic approach to the security 

of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, along with added layers of security on top of 

cryptography, are likely to be necessary for cryptocurrencies to be widely adopted.   

Some cryptocurrencies also appear quite vulnerable to money-laundering (BSA/AML, or 

Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money-laundering) concerns.  Since many cryptocurrencies store in their
