Other ideas have some conceptual appeal, but strike us as impractical for the foreseeable 

future.  Most prominent among these is an approach based on internal cash flow stress testing.  

The appeal of this idea lies in its melding of capital and liquidity considerations.  The 

relationship between a firmâ€™s capital levels and liquidity profile is something that needs to be 

kept in mind when formulating regulatory regimes for all forms of financial intermediaries.  

However, as I noted earlier, we are reluctant to rely on internal models for basic regulatory 

capital requirements, which makes this idea less appealing to us.  The novelty and untested 

nature of this idea as a basis for regulation would, in any case, necessitate extensive 

development, likely over a period of years.  While we have consciously taken a good bit of time 

in considering a capital regime for our supervised insurance firms in order to make sure we get it 

right, we cannot wait years more, especially because there is no guarantee that even this 

investment of effort would produce a feasible internal models-based capital rule.  However, I 

think it is worth continuing to explore internal cash flow stress testing as we build the 

supervisory stress testing program for systemically important insurance companies. 

Another set of possibilities is raised by the work of the International Association of 

Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).  As part of its effort to create a common framework for the 

supervision of internationally active insurance groups, the IAIS began work on a comprehensive 

insurance capital standard (ICS) in 2013, issued an initial consultative proposal on the ICS in late 

2014, and will continue work on the ICS for at least the next few years.  The ICS would be the 

first international, group-wide capital standard broadly applicable to internationally active 

insurance groups and would incorporate internationally compatible valuation principles, 

definitions of capital resources, and risk-based capital requirements for assets and insurance 

liabilities.
