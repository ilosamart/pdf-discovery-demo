capital uses and needs in developing their capital distribution plans, rather than rely 

primarily on the results of the supervisory stress test to guide those plans.    

Now that we all have several years’ experience with this system, however, firms 

have told us that they would be able to engage in more thoughtful capital planning if they 

had knowledge of that year’s stress test results before finalizing their distribution plans 

for the upcoming year.  I am sympathetic to their concerns, and will ask the Board to 

adjust the operation of the rule so that firms know their SCB before they decide on their 

planned distributions for the coming year.  This adjustment in sequence will also help 

firms manage volatility in the SCB.  We expect firms to continue to maintain robust 

stress testing practices and use those results to inform their capital distribution plans,   

and we will continue to use the supervisory process to reinforce this expectation. 

The comments also highlighted an issue with how the capital buffers operate 

today, which is amplified by the inherent volatility of the SCB.  As I noted earlier, a firm 

operating in its capital buffer is required to reduce its capital distributions so that it can 

build capital over time.  By design, the buffer was intended to apply increasingly 

stringent limitations as the firm’s capital ratios decline.  But, in our current world in 

which a healthy and profitable banking system is seeking to maintain its capital levels 

rather than continue to increase them, a bank will appropriately and safely tend to 

distribute much or all of its income in any given year.  In that case, the operation of the 

buffer would not result in a proportional restriction of income as the firm’s capital eases, 

but could be a sudden cessation of all dividends if the firm dips into the buffer by even a 

small amount, even if the changes in its capital levels are quite minor.  We are 

considering adjustments that would make the rules more consistent with the graduated 

intent.  We plan to work with the other banking agencies to consider how best to effect 

this change. 

There are two additional elements of the SCB proposal that I believe would 

benefit from modification.  First, the SCB proposal would have included four quarters of 

dividends in a firm’s SCB, in recognition of the fact that firms experience market 

pressure to hold dividends constant, even under stress.  In my view, there may be ways of 

encouraging greater reliance on less sticky repurchases while providing more flexibility
