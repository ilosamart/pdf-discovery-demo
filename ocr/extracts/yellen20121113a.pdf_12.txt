inflation.  In contrast, they cannot do much to affect the maximum sustainable level of 

employment.  That level is determined by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of 

the labor market that are almost completely outside the control of the central bank.  

Nonetheless, the Committee felt strongly that it should provide some quantitative 

interpretation of economic conditions consistent with the maximum employment portion 

of the Fed’s mandate.  Failure to do so might be seen as elevating the inflation side of the 

dual mandate above the employment side.  The Committee chose to couch the longer-run 

employment objective in terms of the rate of unemployment while indicating that other 

indicators may also be relevant in assessing the maximum level of employment.  

Unfortunately, there is a considerable range of disagreement in the economics profession 

and on the FOMC itself about what this longer-run normal rate of unemployment is.  

Moreover, there is widespread recognition that whatever the normal rate might be today, 

it can change over time.  So the consensus statement notes that, as of January 2012, 

FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 

6.0 percent.  I expect the FOMC to review its estimates of the longer-run normal rate of 

unemployment in its annual reaffirmation of the consensus statement on goals and 

strategy.  

Setting Longer-Run Objectives and Minimizing Shorter-Run Fluctuations   

As I mentioned before, stating longer-run goals is only one part of clarifying the 

dual mandate.  The other part involves explaining how the FOMC will conduct policy to 

attain its longer-run objectives over time.  Because shocks to the economy regularly push 

inflation and unemployment away from the Committee’s objectives, the FOMC must 

adjust policy to mitigate such deviations from its goals.  We can therefore think of two
