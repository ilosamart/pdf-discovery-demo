Credit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories, 

although indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and 

insufficient credit histories.26  Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism 

and growth.  Smaller firms rely disproportionately on lending from smaller banks, and 

the Federal Reserve has been taking steps and examining additional steps to reduce 

unnecessary complexity in regulations affecting smaller banks.27 

Finally, many financial market participants have expressed concerns about the 

ability to transact in volume at low cost--that is, about market liquidity, particularly in 

certain fixed-income markets such as that for corporate bonds.  Market liquidity for 

corporate bonds remains robust overall, and the healthy condition of the market is 

apparent in low bid-ask spreads and the large volume of corporate bond issuance in 

recent years.  That said, liquidity conditions are clearly evolving.  Large dealers appear to 

devote less of their balance sheets to holding inventories of securities to facilitate trades 

and instead increasingly facilitate trades by directly matching buyers and sellers.  In 

                                                 
26 This conclusion is consistent with, for example, the findings in Federal Reserve Banks (2017), 2016

27  As I have discussed previously, the Federal Reserve has been considering improvements through a 

number of work streams.  For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently 

completed the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review.  Under 

EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their regulations every 

10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.  The Federal Reserve 

viewed this review as a timely opportunity to step back and identify ways to reduce regulatory burden, 

particularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the U.S. financial system.  I discussed 

preliminary emerging themes from this review in Janet L. Yellen (2016), “Supervision and Regulation,” 

statement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, September 28, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160928a.htm.  For the final EGRPRA 

report to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of 

the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credit Union Administration (2017),
