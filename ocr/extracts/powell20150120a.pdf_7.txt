players such as mutual funds, exchange traded funds, algorithmic and high-frequency 

traders, and electronic exchanges are taking more prominent roles.  These changes will 

affect market liquidity and functioning in ways that are difficult to foresee.  It is possible 

that some of these factors played a role in the sharp swing in Treasury yields last October 

15, and we are working with other regulators to understand exactly what happened that 

day and to determine whether there are implications for regulatory or supervisory policy.   

The Review raises the right questions in considering the troubling patterns of 

market abuse, and also in considering the structural changes that we are now seeing.  It is 

important that market participants, end users, and regulators collectively take a step back 

and consider, as the Review invites us to do, whether the changing structure of FICC 

markets will result in markets that are fair, effective, and safe.
