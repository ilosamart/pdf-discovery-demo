The issue of the fiscal-monetary distinction may also arise in the case of the 

nonconventional policy known as quantitative easing, in which the central bank provides 

additional support for the economy and the financial system by expanding the monetary 

base, for example, through the purchase of long-term securities.  Rarely employed 

outside of Japan before the crisis, central banks in a number of advanced economies have 

undertaken variants of quantitative easing in recent years as conventional policies have 

reached their limits.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has purchased both 

Treasury securities and securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises. 

Although quantitative easing, like conventional monetary policy, works by 

affecting broad financial conditions, it can have fiscal side effects:  increased income, or 

seigniorage, for the government when longer-term securities are purchased, and possible 

capital gains or losses when securities are sold.  Nevertheless, I think there is a good case 

for granting the central bank independence in making quantitative easing decisions, just 

as with other monetary policies.  Because the effects of quantitative easing on growth and 

inflation are qualitatively similar to those of more conventional monetary policies, the 

same concerns about the potentially adverse effects of short-term political influence on 

these decisions apply.  Indeed, the costs of undue government influence on the central 

bank’s quantitative easing decisions could be especially large, since such influence might 

be tantamount to giving the government the ability to demand the monetization of its 

debt, an outcome that should be avoided at all costs. 

The Historical Evolution of Central Bank Independence 

Support for the idea of central bank independence has evolved over time.  In the 

United States and many other countries, the historically high and volatile inflation rates in
