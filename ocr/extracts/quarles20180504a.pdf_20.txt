Figure 3:  Projected SOMA Domestic Securities Holdings:
Alternative Liabilities Scenarios

    Note:  Figures are as of year−end. Figures for 2010 to 2017 (shaded area) are historical settled holdings. Smaller and larger liabilities are 
based, respectively, on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile responses to a question about the size and composition of the Federal 
Reserve’s long−run balance sheet in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s December 2017 Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey
of Market Participants. Projected figures are rounded. SOMA is System Open Market Account.
