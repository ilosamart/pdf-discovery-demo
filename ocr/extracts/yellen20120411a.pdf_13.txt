obtain a prescription for the path of monetary policy conditional on a baseline forecast of 

economic conditions.  Optimal control typically involves the selection of a particular 

model to represent the dynamics of the economy as well as the specification of a “loss 

function” that represents the social costs of deviations of inflation from the Committee’s 

longer-run goal and of deviations of unemployment from its longer-run normal rate.  In 

effect, this approach assumes that the policymaker has perfect foresight about the 

evolution of the economy and that the private sector can fully anticipate the future path of 

monetary policy; that is, the central bank’s plans are completely transparent and credible 

to the public.

To show what an optimal control approach might have called for at the time of the 

January FOMC meeting, figure 7 depicts a purely illustrative baseline outlook 

constructed using the distribution of FOMC participants’ projections for unemployment, 

inflation, and the federal funds rate that we published in January.  Here, the baseline 

paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the 

Committee’s projections through 2014.  The unemployment rate gradually converges to 

around 5-1/2 percent--roughly the midpoint of the central tendency of participants’ long-

run projections of these factors--and inflation converges to the Committee’s longer-run 

goal of 2 percent.  The baseline path for the funds rate stays near zero through late 2014 

and then rises steadily back to the long-run value expected by most participants.  While 

this path is consistent with the January and March statements, I hasten to add that both

 The assumption of perfect foresight or “certainty equivalence” is commonly used in practice but is not an 

intrinsic feature of optimal control techniques.  Indeed, the fully optimal policy under uncertainty involves 

the specification of a complete set of state-contingent policy paths.
