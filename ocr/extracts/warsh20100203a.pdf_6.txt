practicable, well-understood bankruptcy protocols.  This replication would provide clearer rules 

of the road for classes of creditors in advance of any resolution.  Still, the financial architecture 

requires additional reforms to mitigate the too-big-to-fail problem.   

Preferred Theory of the Case:  Resurrecting Market Discipline to Redress Too-Big-To-Fail 

Moral hazard in the financial system is higher than any of us should countenance.  There 

is a high burden on policymakers to mitigate it.  Some newly-empowered and untested 

regulatory structure is not likely--in and of itself--to be sufficient to tackle institutions that are 

too-big-to-fail, particularly as memories of the crisis fade.  Regulation is too important to be left 

to regulators alone. 

We must resurrect market discipline as a complementary pillar of prudential supervision.  

Otherwise, the too-big-to-fail problem--exacerbated by recent events--could undermine our 

financial system and do long-term harm to the real economy.  The growing specter of 

government support threatens to weaken market discipline, confuse price signals, and create a 

class of institutions that operate under different rules of the game.  This state is not acceptable.       

We need a system in which insolvent firms fail.  Market discipline only works if 

governments can demonstrably and credibly commit to allow firms to fail.  This system isn’t just 

about giving government officials better options on Sunday nights.  It is about making sure that 

market discipline is operative in the prior months and years to avoid altogether the proverbial 

Sunday night judgments. 

I don’t preach the infallibility of market discipline in policing risks.  Market discipline, 

like regulatory discipline, is imperfect.  It too has a tendency to become lax late in economic 

booms and excessively tight in busts.  But, a system must be designed so that market discipline
