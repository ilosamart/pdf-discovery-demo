Implications of a Growing Gig Economy 

If market forces and technology are driving the growing prevalence of gig work, 

these trends will likely continue, and policymakers must better understand these changes.  

A natural starting point is measurement.  There is some good news on this front, as the 

BLS is preparing to field a CWS in May 2017 for the first time since 2005.   

Better data should help deepen our understanding of how the growth of contingent 

work is changing the behavior of workers and employers and what these developments 

imply for the overall economy and household welfare.  From a macroeconomic 

perspective, we should be attuned to the possibility that the growth in flexible work 

arrangements may alter the natural rate of employment and how the labor market reacts 

to shocks as we assess the cyclical behavior of important aggregates--such as labor force 

participation, employment, hours worked, and underemployment.    

One possibility is that new technologies, by lowering the barriers to workforce 

entry, could raise employment and labor force participation.  Because there are fixed 

costs to obtaining and maintaining a job--such as searching for the job, learning about the 

job, and traveling to the job site every workday--the traditional work arrangement 

embeds incentives for individuals to work only one job, thus minimizing these fixed 

costs.  And for those individuals who desire to work relatively few hours, these fixed 

costs in the past may have led to a decision to remain out of the labor force.  But if 

technology makes it less costly for individuals to find work, manage multiple work 

relationships, and flexibly work more or fewer hours as their schedule permits, this could 

significantly increase workersâ€™ options and have important effects on labor market
