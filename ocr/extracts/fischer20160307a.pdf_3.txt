Bound, and Secular Stagnation,” with the importance of usury laws having diminished 

since 1936. 

There is an old joke about our field--not the one about the one-handed economist, 

nor the one about “assume you have a can opener,” nor the one that ends, “If I were you, 

I wouldn’t start from here.”  Rather it’s the one about the Ph.D. economist who returns to 

his university for his class’s 50th reunion.  He asks if he can see the most recent Ph.D. 

generals exam.  After a while it is brought to him.  He reads it carefully, looking 

perplexed, and then says, “But this is exactly the same as the exam I wrote over 50 years 

ago.”  “Ah yes,” says the professor.  “It is the same, but all the answers are different.” 

Is that really the case?  Not really, though it is true to some extent in the realm of 

policy.  To discuss the question of whether the answers to the questions of how to deal 

with macroeconomic policy problems have changed markedly over the past half-century 

or so, I will start by briefly sketching the structure of a basic macro model.  The building 

blocks of this model are similar to those used in many macro models, including FRB/US, 

the Fed staff’s large-scale model, and a variety of DSGE (dynamic stochastic general 

equilibrium) models used at the Fed and other central banks and by academic researchers.   

The structure of the model starts with the standard textbook equation for 

aggregate demand for domestically produced goods, namely:2 

(1) AD = C + I + G + NX; 

(2) Next is the wage-price block, which is based on a wage or price Phillips 

curve.  Okun’s law is included to make the transition between output and 

employment;
