Second, the emergence of financial institutions of sufficient combined size, interconnectedness, 

and leverage that their failures could threaten the entire system. 

In prior speeches I have discussed the correlated risks present in such areas as money 

market funds and repo markets.i  This afternoon I turn to some of the issues surrounding 

regulation of SIFIs.  Before doing so, it is important to underscore what is at stake here.  For all 

the disagreements among legislators, policy officials, and the public over the right set of 

financial reform measures, I have noted one point on which there is near unanimity:  No one 

wants another TARP program.  Not those who thought TARP was the best of a bad set of options 

in the fall of 2008.  Certainly not those who opposed it.  Not the American people, many of 

whom saw the injection of billions of dollars of government capital into financial firms as more a 

bail-out of large banks than an imperative to stabilize the financial system.  And not even, I 

suspect, most of the large financial firms that received the government capital. 

In a period of financial stress, the disorderly failure of one or more SIFIs carries the 

potential for a devastating impact on the financial system.  The fear elicited by that prospect led 

the Bush Administration to ask for TARP authority.  That same fear led many members of 

Congress with no great love for large financial firms to vote for TARP.  Those actions are further 

evidence for the proposition that, no matter what their general economic policy principles, 

government officials faced with a cascading financial crisis that threatens to bring down the 

national economy will usually support measures to rescue large banks.  In order to avoid the 

need for a new TARP at some future moment of financial stress, the regulatory system must 

address now the risk of disorderly failure of SIFIs.
