likely all useful in strengthening financial stability. 

Loan Modification in a Crisis 

Even though macroprudential policies reduce the incidence and severity of 

housing related crises, they may still occur.  When house prices drop, households with 

mortgages may find themselves underwater, with the amount of their loan in excess of 

their homeâ€™s current price.  As Atif Mian and Amir Sufi have pointed out, this 

deterioration in household balance sheets can lead to a substantial drop in consumption 

and employment.22  Extensive mortgage foreclosures--that is, undertaking the legal 

process to evict borrowers and repossess the house and then selling the house--as a 

response to household distress can exacerbate the downturn by imposing substantial 

dead-weight costs and, as properties are sold, causing house prices to fall further.23   

Modifying loans rather than foreclosing on them, including measures such as 

reducing the principal balance of a loan or changing the loan terms, can allow borrowers 

to stay in their homes.  In addition, it can substantially reduce the dead-weight costs of 

foreclosure.  

Yet in some countries, institutional or legal frictions impeded desired mortgage 

modifications during the recent crisis.  And in many cases, governments stepped in to 

solve the problem.  For example, U.S. mortgage loans that had been securitized into 

private-label MBS relied on the servicers of the loans to perform the modification.  

However, operational and legal procedures for servicers to do so were limited, and, as a 

result, foreclosure, rather than modification, was commonly used in the early stages of
