pace in 2017.  This rise followed two years of weak growth, dragged down by declines in 

the drilling and mining sector.  

Financial conditions are currently supportive of economic growth despite the recent 

choppiness in financial markets and some tightening since the beginning of the year.  

Various measures of equity valuations remain elevated relative to historical norms even 

after recent movements, and corporate bond spreads remain quite compressed.3  This 

compares with the period from mid-2014 through the second half of 2016, when equity 

prices were flat and the dollar rose steeply.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s 

National Financial Conditions Index provides a useful summary statistic.4  According to 

this measure, financial conditions tightened significantly from the middle of 2014 to early 

2016.  By comparison, financial conditions today remain near the accommodative end of 

the range since the financial crisis, even with the recent tightening in conditions.  

The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from 

restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.  In the earlier 

period, the economy had just weathered a challenging adjustment to a sharp withdrawal of 

fiscal support.  Today, from a position near full employment, the economy is poised to 

absorb $1-1/2 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in 

federal spending.  Estimates suggest December’s tax legislation could boost the growth rate 

of real gross domestic product (GDP) as much as 1/2 percentage point this year and next.5

indexes published by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and St. Louis, tell a similar story.

level of U.S. GDP 1-1/4 percent by 2020.
