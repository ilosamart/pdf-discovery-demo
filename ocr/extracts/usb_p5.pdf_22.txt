Contributions and Expenditures

The words contribution and expenditure are
defined broadly by FECA and the Commission’s
regulations to include any loan, advance, deposit,
purchase, payment, distribution, subscription,
gift of money, or anything of value that is made
for the purpose of influencing the nomination or
election of any person to federal office. The
payment by a third party of compensation for
personal services rendered without charge to a
candidate or political committee is also treated
as a contribution by FECA, although the term
does not include the value of personal services
provided by an individual without compensation
on a volunteer basis.

Although loans are included in the definitions
of contribution and expenditure under FECA, a
specific exemption is provided for bank loans
made in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with applicable banking laws and
regulations. The Commission’s regulations pro-
vide further that extensions of credit to a candi-
date, political committee, or other person in
connection with a federal election may be treated
as a loan, and not a contribution, if they are on
terms substantially similar, in risk and amount,
to those made to nonpolitical debtors. The
regulations also provide that a debt may be
forgiven only if the creditor has treated it in a
commercially reasonable manner, including mak-
ing efforts to collect the debt, which are similar
to the efforts it would make with a nonpolitical
debtor. In considering whether a particular trans-
action is a contribution or a loan, it is expected
that a factor would be the extent to which the
creditor may have departed from its customary
credit risk analysis.

FECA and the implementing regulation per-
mit certain limited payments to candidates or
their political committees. For example, pay-
ment of compensation to a regular employee,
who is providing a candidate or political com-
mittee with legal or accounting services, which
are solely for the purpose of compliance with
the provisions of the FECA, is exempt from the
definitions of contribution and expenditure. The
Commission’s regulations also permit occa-
sional use of a corporation’s facilities by its
shareholders and employees for volunteer politi-
cal activity; however, reimbursement to the
corporation is required for the normal rental
charge for anything more than occasional or
incidental use.

Separate Segregated Funds and Political
Committees

FECA allows the establishment and administra-
tion by corporations of separate segregated funds
to be utilized for political purposes (2 USC
Section 441b(b)(4)). While corporate monies
may not be used to make political contributions
or expenditures, corporations may bear the costs
of establishing and administering these separate
segregated funds, including payment of rent for
office space, utilities, supplies, and salaries.
These costs need not be disclosed under FECA.
Commission regulations also permit a corpora-
tion to exercise control over its separate segre-
gated fund.

In practice, most corporate segregated funds
are administered by a group of corporate per-
sonnel, which, if the fund receives any contri-
butions or makes any expenditures during a
calendar year, constitutes a political committee,
as defined by FECA. As such, it is required to
file a statement of organization with the Com-
mission, to keep detailed records of contribu-
tions and expenditures, and to file with the
Commission reports identifying contributions in
excess of $200 and candidates who are recipi-
ents of contributions from the fund.

Solicitation of contributions to corporate seg-
regated funds by political committees must be
accomplished within the precise limits estab-
lished by FECA. All solicitations directed to
corporate employees must satisfy the following
requirements: (1) the contribution must be
entirely voluntary, (2) the employee must be
informed of the political purposes of the fund at
the time of the solicitation, and (3) the employee
must be informed of his or her right to refuse to
contribute without reprisal. Beyond those basic
requirements, FECA distinguishes between
executive and administrative personnel and other
employees. The former and their families may
be solicited any number of times, while the latter
and their families may only be solicited through
a maximum of two written solicitations per year,
and these solicitations must be addressed to the
employees at their homes. Solicitations may
also be directed to corporate stockholders and
their families in the same manner as to executive
and administrative personnel.

Although a corporation or a corporation and
its subsidiaries may form several political com-
mittees, for purposes of determining the statu-
tory limitations on contributions and expendi-
tures, all committees established by a corporation
