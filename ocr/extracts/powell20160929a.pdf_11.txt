I think the key question for policymakers is whether the recent acceleration in the 

rate of decline in the number of small banks is primarily a structural change attributable 

to increasing economies of scale--or, perhaps more accurately, diseconomies of very

soon to say. 

The Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors began this 

conference three years ago in order to stimulate research on community banks, with the 

goal of improving our understanding of their condition and their important contributions 

to economic growth and prosperity.  We plan to continue our own research efforts across 

the Federal Reserve System, as well as our efforts, through initiatives such as this 

conference, to encourage academics to focus their attention on community banks.   

Of course, the Federal Reserveâ€™s support for community banks goes well beyond 

research.  One of the clearest lessons from our most recent recession is that, when it 

comes to bank regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all.  As we seek to 

promote safety and soundness and ensure consumer compliance, we increasingly tailor 

rules and supervisory approaches to the differing risks posed by institutions of different 

size and complexity.  This way, we can achieve our aims without creating undue 

regulatory burden.    The Federal Reserve is committed to this approach to community 

bank oversight and to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly 

burdensome for community banks. In addition to fulfilling this commitment, the Federal 

Reserve and other federal banking agencies have launched a review to identify banking
