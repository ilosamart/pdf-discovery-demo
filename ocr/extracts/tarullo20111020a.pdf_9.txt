finds that poor job opportunities early in one’s working life can lead to lower 

employment and wage rates in the future.6 

The Aggregate Demand Shortfall 

To this point, I have portrayed a labor market still disabled by the trauma of the 

financial crisis and the recession that followed, but also beset by chronic maladies whose 

symptoms predate the crisis.  In considering the nature and magnitude of appropriate 

policy responses, an important question is the extent to which the current high level of 

unemployment reflects a shortfall in aggregate demand rather than additional structural 

problems arising from the recession.  If the high level of unemployment is predominantly 

structural in origin, then the increase in aggregate demand intended by various monetary 

and fiscal policies would presumably be of limited efficacy.   

Although structural problems likely account for some of the high jobless rate, I 

believe the evidence points to aggregate demand as clearly the more important 

explanation.  On its face, the sheer magnitude of the decline in the number of jobs during 

the recession, the speed of the increase in unemployment, and the halting nature of the 

economic recovery together create a fairly strong presumption that insufficient aggregate 

demand is the most significant factor.  Moreover, one thing that the current episode has in 

common with the previous two “jobless” recoveries is a slow rebound in aggregate 

economic activity.  Over the first eight quarters of all three recoveries, real GDP grew at 

an average annual rate of 3 percent or less, compared, for example, with more than
