corporate bond issuance has been strong, and stock prices have partially recovered.  Bank

stabilized and is growing again, although we can hardly be satisfied when 1 out of every

options under extremely difficult circumstances were bad and worse, as our ability to 

respond effectively was sharply limited by the lack of tools available to act in a crisis.  In
