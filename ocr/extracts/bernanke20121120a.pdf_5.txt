There are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the 

rate of growth of the economy’s potential.  For example, the extraordinarily severe job 

losses that followed the crisis, especially in housing-related industries, may have 

exacerbated for a time the extent of mismatch between the jobs available and the skills 

and locations of the unemployed.  Meanwhile, the very high level of long-term 

unemployment has probably led to some loss of skills and labor force attachment among 

those workers.  These factors may have pushed up to some degree the so-called natural 

rate of unemployment--the rate of unemployment that can be sustained under normal 

conditions--and reduced labor force participation as well.  The pace of productivity 

gains--another key determinant of growth in potential output--may also have been 

restrained by the crisis, as business investment declined sharply during the recession; and 

increases in risk aversion and uncertainty, together with tight credit conditions, may have 

impeded the commercial application of new technologies and slowed the pace of business 

formation. 

Importantly, however, although the nation’s potential output may have grown 

more slowly than expected in recent years, this slowing seems at best a partial 

explanation of the disappointing pace of the economic recovery.  In particular, even 

though the natural rate of unemployment may have increased somewhat, a variety of 

evidence suggests that any such increase has been modest, and that substantial slack 

remains in the labor market.  For example, the slow pace of employment growth has been 

widespread across industries and regions of the country.  That pattern suggests a broad-

based shortfall in demand rather than a substantial increase in mismatch between 

available jobs and workers, because greater mismatch would imply that the demand for
