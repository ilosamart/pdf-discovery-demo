Small businesses owners, who in the past might have tapped into the equity in 

their homes or used their homes as collateral for small business loans, also have found

peak in 2009.  

The Federal Reserve is keenly interested in understanding how shifts in loan 

supply, loan demand, and borrower quality may be affecting lending and, by extension, 

the broader economy.  Of course, sorting out the relative effect of changes in loan

Recent research at the Federal Reserve examines cyclical changes in banks’
