It is an honor to be here today with such distinguished panelists to discuss the 

communications challenges associated with quantitative easing.  I should say at the outset 

that the views I express here today are my own and may not reflect those of other Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

I’ll start with the FOMC’s commitment, when the current asset purchase program 

was launched in September 2012, to continue purchases until the Committee sees a 

substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, a term the Committee left 

undefined. 1  This commitment was powerful precisely because it was open ended.  But 

“open ended” does not mean unending.  As time passed and labor market conditions 

improved, it would be important for the Committee to clarify the meaning of the term 

substantial improvement.  And given the lack of precedent, it was likely that this 

transition to more-specific guidance would involve some short-run volatility. 

Economic conditions have improved since the program was launched.  Consumer 

and business confidence moved higher, and sectors such as housing and autos have 

performed well.  Despite strong, ongoing headwinds from fiscal policy, there has been 

significant progress in the labor market.  From September 2012 through August of this 

year, the private sector created 2.3 million new jobs.  The unemployment rate declined 

from 8.1 percent to 7.3 percent.  It’s unclear how much of this improvement was due to 

the program, but I think there is evidence that it played a role, lowering long-term interest 

                                                 
1 The Committee also noted:  “In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the 
Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”
