market, but bilateral repo and securities lending taken together accounted for 

approximately $1.7 trillion in outstanding activity.7

accepted as collateral by the majority of intermediaries in the repo market. GC repo assets are high quality and 
liquid, but not subject to exceptional specific demand.
