include: elimination of the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements; one or more 

ratios in stress testing; and some simplification of our TLAC rule.  I am not the first Federal 

Reserve governor to mention some of these possibilities, and we should put them back on the 

table in the context of a more holistic discussion of streamlining these requirements.  Let me be 

clear, however, that while I am advocating a simplification of large bank loss absorbency 

requirements, I am not advocating an enervation of the regulatory capital regime applicable to 

large banking firms.  

Although not a post-crisis regulation, the Board’s complex and occasionally opaque 

framework for making determinations of control under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC 

Act) is another area that is ripe for re-examination through the lenses of efficiency, transparency, 

and simplicity.  As you know, a determination of control under the BHC Act is significant 

because even remote entities in a controlled group can be subject to the BHC Act’s restrictions 

on activities and a host of other regulatory requirements.  Under the Board’s control framework--

built up piecemeal over many decades--the practical determinants of when one company is 

deemed to control another are now quite a bit more ornate than the basic standards set forth in 

the statute and in some cases cannot be discovered except through supplication to someone who 

has spent a long apprenticeship in the art of Fed interpretation.  The process can be burdensome 

and time-consuming both for the requester and Federal Reserve staff.  We are taking a serious 

look at rationalizing and recalibrating this framework.   

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, an enhanced stress testing transparency package was 

released for public comment last month.  I personally believe that our stress testing disclosures 

can go further.  I appreciate the risks to the financial system of the industry converging on the 

Federal Reserve’s stress testing model too completely, so I am hesitant to support complete
