official-sector entities, have been using more formal economic analysis to estimate the level of 

capital requirements that best balances the benefits associated with reduced risk of financial 

crisis with the costs of banks funding with capital rather than debt.  A recent study by three 

Federal Reserve Board researchers concludes that the tier 1 capital requirement5 that best 

achieves this balance is somewhere in the range of 13 percent to 26 percent, depending on 

reasonable choices made on some key assumptions.6  By this assessment, current requirements 

for the largest U.S. firms are toward the lower end of this range, even when one takes account of 

the de facto capital buffers imposed on most firms in connection with the stress test. 

 This assessment, when added to our original historically-based approach and the 

methodology used in developing the capital surcharges, suggests strongly that a reduction in risk-

based capital requirements for the U.S. G-SIBs would be ill-advised.  In fact, one might conclude 

that a modest increase in these requirements--putting us a bit further from the bottom of the 

range--might be indicated.  This conclusion is strengthened by the finding that, as bank capital 

levels fall below the lower end of ranges of the optimal trade-off, the chance of a financial crisis 

increases significantly, whereas no disproportionate increase in the cost of bank capital occurs as 

capital levels rise within this range.  In other words, in trying to avoid a future financial crisis, it 

is wise to err somewhat toward the higher end of the range of possible required capital levels for 

this group of firms.   

                                                 
5 The post-crisis amendments to the banking agencies’ capital regulations strengthened the definition of tier 1 capital 
by having at its core common equity tier 1 capital, the most loss-absorbing form of capital comprised primarily of 
common equity and related surplus, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited 
amounts of common equity tier 1 minority interest.  Specifically, tier 1 capital consists of common equity tier 1 
capital plus additional tier 1 capital instruments which include qualifying non-cumulative preferred stock, related 
surplus, and limited additional amounts of tier 1 minority interest.
