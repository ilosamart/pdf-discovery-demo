subject to the Volcker rule due to Bank Holding Company Act control principles.  Last summer, 

the banking agencies, in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, issued guidance that effectively stayed enforcement 

of the Volcker rule to these foreign funds in light of the technical and complex issues they raise.8  

I expect we would continue this period of stay while we continue to consider these important 

issues.  

 The statute also contains exemptions for FBOs to allow foreign banks to continue trading 

and engaging in covered fund activities solely outside the United States.  The regulation again 

has a complex series of requirements that a foreign bank must meet to make use of these 

exemptions.  We have heard from a number of foreign banks that complying with these 

requirements is unworkable in practice, and we are considering ways to address this 

impracticality.  One possibility that has been suggested by market participants is a simple 

approach that focuses on the risk of the booking location.  Of course, we would have to consider 

whether this is possible in light of the language of the statute and principles of competitive 

equity, but the suggestion is illustrative of the possibility of a more workable approach.   

As a final but no less important matter, we are considering broad revisions to the Volcker 

rule compliance regime.  We would like Volcker rule compliance to be similar to compliance in 

other areas of our supervisory regime.  As I noted earlier, we appreciate the broad extraterritorial 

impact of the rule in its current form on foreign banks’ operations outside of the United States.
