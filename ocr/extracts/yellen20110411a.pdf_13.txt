the improvement in the labor market deepens and broadens, households should regain 

some of the confidence they lost during the recession, providing an important boost to 

spending.     

Broad Contours of the Outlook 

Nonetheless, a sharp rebound in economic activity--like those that often follow 

deep recessions--does not appear to be in the offing.  One key factor restraining the pace 

of recovery is the construction sector, which continues to be hampered by a considerable 

overhang of vacant homes and commercial properties and remains in the doldrums.  In 

addition, spending by state and local governments seems likely to remain limited by tight 

budget conditions.   

Moreover, while the labor market has recently shown some signs of life, job 

opportunities are still relatively scarce.  The unemployment rate is down from its peak, 

but at 8.8 percent, it still remains quite elevated.  And even the decline that weâ€™ve seen to 

date partly reflects a drop in labor force participation, because people are counted as 

unemployed only if they are actively looking for work.  

Some observers have argued that the high unemployment rate primarily reflects 

structural factors such as a longer duration of unemployment benefits and difficulties in 

matching available workers with vacant jobs rather than a deficiency of aggregate 

demand.  In my view, however, the preponderance of available evidence and research 

suggests that these alternative structural explanations cannot account for the bulk of the 

rise in the unemployment rate during the recession.  For example, if mismatches were of 

central importance, we would not expect to see high rates of unemployment across the 

vast majority of occupations and industries.  Instead, I see weak demand for labor as the
