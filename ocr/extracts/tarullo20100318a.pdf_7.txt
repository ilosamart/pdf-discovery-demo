A natural response, which one can find peppered through various law journals 

over the years, is to propose an international treaty that would establish and harmonize 

appropriate insolvency regimes throughout the world.  Just to state the proposition is to 

see the enormous hurdles to its realization.  The task of harmonizing divergent legal 

regimes, and reconciling the principles underlying many of these regimes, would be 

challenge enough.  But an effective international regime would also likely require 

agreement on how to share the losses and possible special assistance associated with a 

global firm’s insolvency. 

Despite the good and thorough work being undertaken in both the Basel 

Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Financial Stability Board, 

we must acknowledge that satisfyingly clean and comprehensive solutions to the 

international difficulties occasioned by such insolvencies are not within sight.2  It would 

certainly be useful if jurisdictions could at least broadly synchronize both standard 

bankruptcy and any special resolution procedures applicable to a failing financial firm.   

But even this significant advance would not settle many of the nettlesome problems 

raised by a cross-border insolvency. 

It thus seems reasonably clear that effective management of these problems will,

cooperation before a large firm’s failure becomes a real possibility.  In one sense, this
