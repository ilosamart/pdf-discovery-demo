recent speech.5  Evans suggested that the FOMC could indicate its intention to continue 

holding the federal funds rate close to zero as long as the unemployment rate exceeds a 

given threshold, conditional on the medium-term inflation outlook remaining at or below 

a specified level.6  Such an approach could be helpful in facilitating public understanding 

of how various possible shifts in the economic outlook would be likely to affect the 

anticipated timing of policy firming.  For example, if there were a further downward 

revision of the economic outlook, investors would recognize that the conditions for 

policy firming would not be reached until a later date and hence would have a more 

concrete basis for extending the time period during which they expect the federal funds 

rate to remain near zero.   

The approach of numerically specifying the values of unemployment and inflation 

that could prompt policy tightening is not without potential pitfalls, however.  For 

example, such thresholds could potentially be misunderstood as conveying the 

Committee’s longer-run objectives rather than the conditions surrounding the likely onset 

of policy firming.  Thus, in addition to giving careful consideration to this particular 

approach, it seems sensible to explore other potential enhancements to FOMC 

communications--a topic to which I will return shortly.

Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the European Economics and Financial Centre, London,

6 For example, if such thresholds were specified to be broadly consistent with professional forecasters’ 
projections for unemployment and inflation in mid- to late 2013, this approach might essentially reinforce 
current expectations that policy firming is likely to commence around that time.  Alternatively, as Evans 
(2011) has noted, some additional monetary accommodation could be provided by specifying a modestly 
lower unemployment threshold and a slightly higher medium-term inflation threshold, thereby leading 
forecasters to push back their assessments of the onset of policy firming.
