models of cloud computing providers, potentially getting to market faster than by taking the 

traditional route of finding training data and building out models in-house from scratch.  

Third, fintech developers can also draw from enormous pools of data that were 

previously unavailable outside of banking institutions.  Consumer financial data are increasingly 

available to developers via a new breed of business-to-business suppliers, called data 

aggregators.28  These companies enable outside developers to access consumer account and 

transactional information typically stored by banks.  But aggregators do more than just provide 

access to raw data.  They facilitate its use by developers, by cleaning the data, standardizing it 

across institutions, and offering their own application programming interfaces for easy 

integration.  Further, similar to cloud computing providers, data aggregators are also beginning 

to provide off-the-shelf product stacks on their own platforms.29  This means that developers can 

quickly and easily incorporate product features, such as predicting creditworthiness, determining 

how much a consumer can save each month, or creating alerts for potential overdraft charges.  

Researchers have documented the benefits of tailored one-on-one financial coaching.30  

Until recently, though, it has been hard to deliver that kind of service affordably and at scale, due 

to differences in consumers’ circumstances.  Let’s again consider the example of deferred 

interest credit cards.  It turns out only a small minority of consumers miss the deadlines for 

repaying promotional balances and are charged retroactive interest payments, and they typically
