term Treasury rates fell as market participants priced in additional Fed purchases.2  

However, since the announcement of the decision to purchase longer-term Treasury 

securities, longer-term rates have actually increased.  It might seem that the recent 

increase in rates contradicts the view that Fed asset purchases put downward pressure on 

rates.  However, the logic behind this view works in both directions.  If the market 

expects the Fed to respond to weak economic conditions by buying more assets, investors 

bid up the assets and rates fall.  Conversely, if the market expects the economy to 

strengthen, investors ratchet back expectations for Fed purchases and reduce their bid for 

the assets, and rates rise.  I believe that the current rise in rates is due to exactly this latter 

circumstance--a strengthening in market participants’ outlook for the economy and a 

corresponding decrease in the market’s expectation for future accommodation.    

One concern that has been raised about asset purchases is the resulting expansion 

of the Fed’s balance sheet and the corresponding increase in reserves.  For example, some 

observers have noted that an increase in reserve balances could lead to an increase in the 

money supply, which would in turn generate inflation pressures.  Others have worried 

that elevated levels of reserve balances might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to 

remove monetary accommodation at the appropriate time.  While we will need to remain 

alert to economic developments, I am convinced that we can and will manage these risks. 

The monetary policy objective of asset purchases is to foster downward pressure 

on interest rates.  But assets are “paid for” by crediting the reserve balances of banks, 

generating higher levels of reserve balances in the banking system.  Reserves are relevant
