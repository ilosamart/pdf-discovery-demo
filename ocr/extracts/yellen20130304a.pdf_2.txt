Thank you.  I’m delighted to address the National Association for Business 

Economics (NABE), a group that has done so much to promote understanding of the 

economy and the appropriate role of policy.   

My topic today is the challenges confronting monetary policy in what has been an 

unusually weak recovery from a severe recession.  I will discuss the Federal Reserve’s 

ongoing efforts in these circumstances to speed the U.S. economy’s return to maximum 

employment in a context of price stability.

As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has recently taken 

new steps to achieve this objective.  In September, the Committee approved a new 

program of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchases, pledging to 

continue the program--contingent on favorable ongoing evaluations of its efficacy and 

costs--until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.

Most recently, in December the Committee announced that it would purchase longer-term 

Treasury securities after completion of the maturity extension program.  At the same 

time, it revamped its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, explicitly linking the 

path of that rate to quantitative measures of economic performance.

My goal today is to explain these policies and why I consider them appropriate 

under current conditions.  With respect to the asset purchase program, I will discuss 

several economic indicators that I plan to consider in evaluating the outlook for the labor 

market and then offer my perspective at present on the program’s efficacy and costs, an 

assessment I will continue updating in light of experience.
