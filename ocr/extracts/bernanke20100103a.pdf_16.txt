comparison of the initial monthly payment for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage and an 

ARM shows that the ARM payment is about 16 percent lower, a consequential but not 

dramatic difference.  The ARM payment is not substantially lower than the fixed-rate 

payment because it includes amortization of principal and a spread over the index interest 

rate.15  Moreover, less accommodative monetary policy would not have had a substantial 

effect on ARM payments.  Using the Board’s principal macroeconometric model, staff 

simulated the effects on the economy and on mortgage rates of a monetary policy that 

followed the original 1993 Taylor rule, taking into account the feedback effects from 

tighter policy to the economy.16  Under this scenario, they found that the initial ARM rate 

would have been about 0.71 percentage point higher than in the baseline and that the 

initial monthly payment for an ARM borrower would have increased by only about $75.  

This result does not suggest that moderately tighter monetary policy would have 

dissuaded many potential ARM borrowers. 

Slide 7 also shows initial monthly payments for some alternative types of 

variable-rate mortgages, including interest-only ARMs, long-amortization ARMs, 

negative amortization ARMs (in which the initial payment does not even cover interest 

costs), and pay-option ARMs (which give the borrower considerable flexibility regarding 

the size of monthly payments in the early stages of the contract).  These more exotic 

mortgages show much more significant reductions in the initial monthly payment than 

                                                       
15 The figures in Slide 7, which are for prime borrowers, also take no account of the fact that subprime 
borrowers using ARM products typically faced both higher interest rates and additional fees. 
16 The simulation covered the period from 2003 through 2005.  The year 2006 was excluded because actual 
policy and that prescribed by the 1993 Taylor rule were not significantly different in that year.  When the 
1993 Taylor rule is assumed to govern monetary policy, the simulated federal funds rate averages 2.6 
percent from 2003 to 2005, 70 basis points higher than in the baseline.  The increase in the federal funds 
rate is less than the difference shown in Slide 4 because of feedback effects working through the economy; 
a less accommodative policy rule reduces output and inflation, which in turn limits the increase in rates 
implied by the policy rule.
