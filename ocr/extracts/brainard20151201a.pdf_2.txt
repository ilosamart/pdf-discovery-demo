Let me begin by noting that my comments today will not address the timing of 

liftoff for the federal funds rate.1 

Recent months have seen increased anticipation of the normalization of monetary 

policy in the United States.  Many observers interpret normalization to mean a tightening 

cycle similar in pace to previous cycles, such as those from 1994 to 1995 and from 2004 

to 2007, with the effect of returning interest rates to the level viewed as normal in the 

decades before the crisis.  The Federal Reserve describes normalization as “steps to raise 

the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels.”2  But 

what do we mean by “more normal levels”?  A broad deterioration in foreign growth 

prospects, together with greater risk sensitivity in the wake of the crisis and changes in 

the rate of potential output growth, may be contributing to a “new normal.”  The new 

normal is likely to be characterized by a lower level of interest rates than in the decades 

preceding the crisis, which counsels a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting 

monetary policy.  

The Benchmark Neutral Rate 

The appropriate pace and target for normalizing monetary policy depend centrally 

on understanding the neutral rate of interest.  The nominal neutral interest rate is the level 

of the federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate 

with full employment and stable inflation.3  The appropriate benchmark for assessing the 

stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal neutral rate

savings are equilibrated at full employment--is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.
