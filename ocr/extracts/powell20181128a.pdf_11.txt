business borrowing relative GDP has risen during expansions, no doubt reflecting 

business optimism, and then fallen when the cycle turned, as some of that optimism 

proved unfounded (see figure 6).  By this measure, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP is 

about where one might expect after nearly a decade of economic expansion: it is well 

above its trend, but not yet at the peaks hit in the late 1980s or late 1990s.  Further, the 

upward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business 

assets relative to GDP.   

There are reasons for concern, however.  Information on individual firms reveals 

that, over the past year, firms with high leverage and interest burdens have been 

increasing their debt loads the most (see figure 7).  In addition, other measures of 

underwriting quality have deteriorated, and leverage multiples have moved up.  Some of 

these highly leveraged borrowers would surely face distress if the economy turned down, 

leading investors to take higher-than-expected losses--developments that could 

exacerbate the downturn.  The question for financial stability is whether elevated 

business bankruptcies and outsized losses would risk undermining the ability of the 

financial system to perform its critical functions on behalf of households and businesses.  

For now, my view is that such losses are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety and 

soundness of the institutions at the core of the system and, instead, are likely to fall on 

investors in vehicles like collateralized loan obligations with stable funding that present 

little threat of damaging fire sales.10  Of course, we will continue to monitor 

developments in this sector carefully.
