Developing a New Form of Market Regulation    

As I have just described, measures to promote the macroprudential objectives associated 

with the regulation of large financial institutions have already been developed.  They need 

variously to be finalized or implemented.  And all will probably need to be adjusted as time 

passes and circumstances change.  But the tools themselves have been identified, selected, and 

elaborated upon.  When it comes to much financial activity taking place outside prudentially 

regulated institutions, however, there is still a need to develop, analyze, and consider tools that 

should be used for achieving macroprudential aims.   

Given the breadth and diversity of activities that can be encompassed, for example, in the 

term “shadow banking,” it is also necessary for policymakers to identify some priority areas 

within which to focus work on developing an appropriate set of regulations informed by 

macroprudential considerations.  I would suggest that priority should be given to activities that 

pose significant risks of rapid investor flight during stress periods, with the attendant risks of 

firesales and other negative effects on funding and asset markets more generally.  Specifically, it 

seems sensible to prioritize two areas: short-term wholesale funding and the liquidity and 

redemption risks that may be present in asset management activities.  These areas may, of 

course, overlap in some circumstances.   

I have on past occasions described at some length my concerns with short-term wholesale 

funding--especially, though not exclusively, funding associated with assets thought to be cash 

equivalents.5  We are, of course, addressing these risks within prudentially regulated firms 

through various types of liquidity regulation and supervision, as well as changes in practice by
