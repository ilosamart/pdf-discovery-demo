price of oil and other commodities fed through to gasoline prices, and, to a lesser extent, 

to prices of other goods and services.  Then inflation subsided after commodity prices 

came off their peaks.  More recently, prices of crude oil, and thus of gasoline, have turned 

up again.  But smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as measured by the 

personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index averaged 2 percent over the past 

two years.  Using the price index excluding food and energy--another rough way to 

abstract from transitory fluctuations--inflation averaged about 1-1/2 percent over the past 

two years.  These rates are lower than the inflation rates that were seen prior to the 

recession, and they are at or below the FOMCâ€™s long-run goal of 2 percent inflation.     

In my view, the subdued inflation environment largely reflects two factors.  First, 

the substantial slack in the labor market has restrained inflation by holding down labor 

costs.  Second, and of critical importance, longer-term inflation expectations have been 

remarkably stable.  Like many other observers, I was concerned that inflation 

expectations might move lower during the recession, driving down both wages and prices 

in a self-reinforcing spiral.  The Federal Reserve acted forcefully to resist such an 

outcome and, fortunately, that destructive dynamic did not take hold.  Indeed, the 

stability of expectations has meant that the price increases driven by costs of oil and other 

commodities have had only temporary effects on the rate of inflation.  Although firms 

passed higher input costs into their prices when they could do so, those one-time price 

increases have not led to an expectations-driven process that might have resulted in 

persistently higher inflation.   

The same key factors that have kept core inflation subdued provide the rationale 

for my inflation forecast.  I anticipate that slack in the labor market will continue to
