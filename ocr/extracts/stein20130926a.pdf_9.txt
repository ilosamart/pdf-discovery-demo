point.  Thus, if it is a goal of policy to push term premiums far down into negative 

territory, one should be prepared to accept that this approach may bring with it an 

elevated conditional volatility of rates and spreads.   

When we talk about the interplay of monetary policy and financial stability, I 

think that this kind of tradeoff is an important part of what we should be bearing in mind.  

Indeed, maybe the term “financial stability” is a bit misleading, because the risk scenario 

that I am describing--and that may be among the most relevant when thinking about the 

costs and benefits of our current highly accommodative policies--need not be one that is 

so dramatic as to call into question the viability of any large financial firm or threaten an 

important part of the market’s infrastructure.  Rather, one scenario to be worried about 

may simply be a sharp increase in marketwide rates and spreads at an inopportune time, 

such that it becomes harder for us to achieve our dual-mandate objectives. 

Having said all of this, I believe we are currently in a pretty good place with 

respect to the pricing of interest rate risk.  The movement in Treasury rates that we have 

seen since early May has led to somewhat tighter financial conditions in certain sectors--

most notably the mortgage market--but has also brought term premiums closer into line 

with historical norms, and thereby has arguably reduced the risk of a more damaging 

upward spike at some future date.  On net, I believe the adjustment has been a healthy 

one.   

Finally, let me say a few words about last week’s FOMC meeting.  I voted with 

the majority of the Committee to continue our asset purchase program at its current flow 

rate of $85 billion per month.  It was a close call for me, but I did so because I continue 

to support our efforts to create a highly accommodative monetary environment so as to
