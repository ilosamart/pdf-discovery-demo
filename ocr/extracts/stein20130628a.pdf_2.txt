Thank you very much.  It’s a pleasure for me to be here at the Council on Foreign 

Relations, and I look forward to our conversation.  To get things going, I thought I would 

start with some brief remarks on the current state of play in monetary policy.  As you 

know, at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, we opted to 

keep our asset purchase program running at the rate of $85 billion per month.  But there 

has been much discussion about recent changes in our communication, both in the formal 

FOMC statement, as well as in Chairman Bernanke’s post-meeting press conference.  I’d 

like to offer my take on these changes, as well as my thoughts on where we might go 

from here.  But before doing so, let me note that I am speaking for myself, and that my 

views are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the FOMC. 

It’s useful to start by discussing the initial design and conception of this round of 

asset purchases.  Two features of the program are noteworthy.  The first is its flow-based, 

state-contingent nature--the notion that we intend to continue with purchases until the 

outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  

The second is the fact that--in contrast to our forward guidance for the federal funds 

rate--we chose at the outset of the program not to articulate what “substantial 

improvement” means with a specific numerical threshold.  So while the program is meant 

to be data-dependent, we did not spell out the nature of this data-dependence in a 

formulaic way.  

To be clear, I think that this choice made a lot of sense, particularly at the outset 

of the program.  Back in September it would have been hard to predict how long it might 

take to reach any fixed labor market milestone, and hence how large a balance sheet we 

would have accumulated along the way to that milestone.  Given the uncertainty
