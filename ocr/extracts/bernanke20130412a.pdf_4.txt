argued, in neighborhoods with a rich mixture of activities taking place in buildings of 

varying age, character, and use.  

For the most part, social science research has vindicated Jacobs’s perspective.  

For example, sociologists studying community resilience in the wake of natural disasters 

mapped deaths caused by an extreme heat wave in Chicago in 1995.

  They found, not 

surprisingly, that death rates were higher in poor areas where air conditioners were 

scarce.  But they also noticed a remarkable difference in the fatality rate in two adjacent 

neighborhoods--Englewood and Auburn Grisham--on Chicago’s South Side.  These 

neighborhoods were comparable by many measures:  Both were 99 percent African 

American, with similar numbers of elderly residents and comparably high rates of 

poverty and unemployment.  Yet Englewood experienced 33 deaths per 100,000 residents 

during the heat wave, while Auburn Grisham had among the lowest fatality rates in the 

city, 3 deaths per 100,000 residents.  Researchers found that a key difference between 

Auburn Grisham and other neighborhoods lay in its physical and social topography--the 

vitality of its sidewalks, stores, restaurants, and community organizations that brought 

friends and neighbors together, making it easier for people to look out for each other.  

This example illustrates a point that many community development practitioners 

have come to embrace:  Resilient communities require more than decent housing, 

important as that is; they require an array of amenities that support the social fabric of the 

community and build the capabilities of community residents.  The movement toward a 

holistic approach to community development has been long in the making, but the 

housing crisis has motivated further progress.  To be sure, implementing a holistic 

approach is easier said than done.  Government resources are still largely managed in
