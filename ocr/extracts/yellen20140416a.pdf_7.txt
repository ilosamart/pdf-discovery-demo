emphasizes, inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic 

performance.  

The FOMC strives to avoid inflation slipping too far below its 2 percent objective 

because, at very low inflation rates, adverse economic developments could more easily 

push the economy into deflation.  The limited historical experience with deflation shows 

that, once it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged 

periods of very weak economic performance.8 

A persistent bout of very low inflation carries other risks as well.  With the federal 

funds rate currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value 

for the federal funds rate, limiting the capacity of monetary policy to support the 

economy.9  Further, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in 

recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden 

of debt for households and firms, which may put a drag on economic activity.   

I will mention two considerations that will be important in assessing whether 

inflation is likely to move back to 2 percent as the economy recovers.  First, we anticipate 

that, as labor market slack diminishes, it will exert less of a drag on inflation.  However, 

during the recovery, very high levels of slack have seemingly not generated strong 

downward pressure on inflation.  We must therefore watch carefully to see whether

9 If firms’ and households’ spending decisions depended only on longer-term interest rates, temporarily 
higher short-term real interest rates due to low inflation at a time that nominal interest rates are constrained 
by the zero lower bound would have little economic effects, provided that these higher short-term real 
interest rates would be expected to be compensated by lower short-term real interest rates later on.  
However, to the extent that these spending decisions depend in part on shorter-term real interest rates, low 
inflation can induce meaningful economic costs.
