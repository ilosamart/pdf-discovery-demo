Supervision of Community Banks 

 Let me turn now to describing how our supervisory policies reflect these regulatory 

objectives.  First, of course, the Federal Reserve has long organized supervision into four 

portfolios of banking organizations, based principally--though not exclusively--on asset size.  

Since the financial crisis and the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), supervisory policies for the largest firms have become 

increasingly more data-driven, horizontal, and centrally coordinated.  The enhanced prudential 

standards applicable to the largest firms, such as supervisory stress tests and quantitative 

liquidity regulation, have increased the differences in supervisory practice among our four 

portfolios.  We do not regard the supervision of community banks (or, for that matter, smaller 

regional banks) as a diluted version of large bank supervision, but as an entirely separate 

undertaking.  We believe there is a distinct “state-of-the-art” approach to each of the four 

portfolios, including community banks. 

 Second, supervision within the community bank portfolio has not been centralized in the 

way that large firm supervision has been.  On the contrary, with 837 state member community 

banks and several thousand community bank holding companies, it would make little sense to do 

so.  While we strive for a well-considered overall supervisory program for our community bank 

portfolio, we will continue to rely on the examiners in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks to carry out 

that program in accordance with local conditions and based on the varying situations of 

community banks.   

I believe this intention reflects the preference of most community bankers, who worry 

that more centralization of supervisory practice would lead to delays in getting answers to 

questions and decisions on applications.  At the same time, members of the Board do, from time
