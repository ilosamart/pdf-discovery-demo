of the non-default-related component of credit spreads--portends a decline in economic 

activity and employment a year later. 

The specifications of GZ are linear, so they impose the assumption that increases 

in the EBP have an effect that is symmetric to decreases.  In table 1 and figure 2, I look 

explicitly for asymmetries, with a specification that allows an upward move in the EBP to 

have a different effect on the economy than a downward move.  The results, which come 

from a sample spanning the period from January 1973 to December 2012, are striking.  

Upward moves in EBP--again, those corresponding to a widening of credit spreads--are 

very informative about the future evolution of the real economy.  The coefficient 

estimates imply that an increase of 50 basis points in the EBP in a single quarter, which is 

roughly a once-every-five-years kind of move, is associated with a two percentage point 

slowing of GDP growth over the next four quarters and slightly more than a one 

percentage point increase in the unemployment rate over the same interval.20  These 

effects are, by any standard, economically important.  By contrast, declines in the EBP 

have no discernible effect at all on economic activity.      

Putting it all together, this reasoning suggests that the credit risk premium--as 

measured, say, by a forecasting model like that of Greenwood and Hanson--may be an 

operationally useful measure of financial market vulnerability. When this risk premium is 

low, there is a greater probability of a subsequent upward spike in credit spreads and the 

EBP.  Moreover, such upward spikes, when they do occur, are associated with significant 

adverse economic effects.  To be clear, we are not necessarily talking about once-in-a-

generation financial crises here, with major financial institutions teetering on the brink of 

                                                 
20 To be a bit more precise, in the 40-year sample period, there are seven observations in which the EBP 
increases by more than 50 basis points in a single quarter.
