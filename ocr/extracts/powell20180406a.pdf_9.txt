Although job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the U.S. economy 

continues to face some important longer-run challenges.  GDP growth has averaged just 

over 2 percent per year in the current economic expansion, much slower than in previous 

expansions.  Even the higher growth seen in recent quarters remains below the trend 

before the crisis.  Nonetheless, the unemployment rate has come down 6 percentage 

points during the current expansion, suggesting that the trend growth necessary to keep 

the unemployment rate unchanged has shifted down materially.  The median of FOMC 

participantsâ€™ projections of this longer-run trend growth rate is 1.8 percent.  The latest 

estimate from the Blue-Chip consensus of private forecasters is about 2 percent.7 

To unpack this discussion a little further, we can think of output growth as 

composed of increases in hours worked and in output per hour, also known as 

productivity growth.  Here, a comparison with the 2001-to-2007 expansion is 

informative.  Output growth in that earlier expansion averaged nearly 3 percent per year, 

well above the pace in the current expansion.  Despite the faster output growth, however, 

average job growth in the early 2000s was 1/2 percentage point per year weaker than in 

the current expansion.  The difference, of course, is productivity, which grew at more 

than twice the pace in the early 2000s than it has in recent years.  

Taking a longer view, the average pace of labor productivity growth since 2010 is 

the slowest since World War II and about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 

10).  Moreover, the productivity growth slowdown seems to be global and is evident even 

in countries that were little affected by the financial crisis (figure 11).  This observation 

suggests that factors specific to the United States are probably not the main drivers.
