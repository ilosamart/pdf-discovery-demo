24/7 basis in real time.  To ensure the robustness of the payment system into the future, banks 

and other providers acting as their agents should have access to a settlement system that operates 

24/7 and settles each payment as soon as an individual sends it.   

 While everyone stands to benefit from faster payments, the benefits could be especially 

important for households and small business owners who face cash flow constraints.  We know 

from the Fed’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking that four in 10 adults say 

they would need to cover an unexpected expense of $400 by borrowing or selling something, or 

simply be unable to pay.  A forthcoming Fed research note estimates that a quarter of households 

have less than $400 combined in their bank accounts.7  For these households, the difference 

between waiting for a payment to clear and receiving a payment in real time is not merely an 

inconvenience; it could tip the balance toward overdraft fees, bounced checks, or collections 

fees.  To be clear, faster payments would not address the root causes of these households’ 

financial fragility.  Even so, faster payments could help reduce the strain on some.  

 Similarly, many small businesses cite immediate access to working capital to finance 

inventories or pay employees as their number one constraint on growth.8  Smaller businesses and 

merchants would benefit from faster payments because of their need to tightly manage how 

much of their capital is tied up in unused material or inventory.  If a small business could count 

on its customers’ payments being immediately accessible in its bank account, it could reduce its 

need for short-term financing to cover the costs of ordering materials and goods well in advance.
