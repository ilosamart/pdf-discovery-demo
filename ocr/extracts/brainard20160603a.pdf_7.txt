surprises.  This asymmetry in the capability of policy effectively skews risks to the 

outlook to the downside. 

It also may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates.  Indeed, the evidence 

suggests that over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become 

considerably greater in response to U.S. monetary policy surprises than previously.4  The 

evidence that the sensitivity of exchange rate movements has been elevated lately is 

consistent with recent research suggesting that cross border financial transmission is 

likely to be amplified at near-zero interest rates where the ability to provide additional 

support through domestic channels in response to negative shocks may be viewed as 

limited.5  

In this environment, markets have become quite sensitive to the possibility of a 

prolonged period of low growth, low inflation, and economic underperformance.  One 

possible example of this sensitivity is the current negative term premium for 10-year 

Treasury notes, or the difference between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and expected 

risk-free short rates over the next 10 years.  Prior to the Great Recession, the term 

premium was positive, as bond investors seem to have been most concerned about the 

risk that inflation would be higher than expected.  But since the Great Recession, the term 

premium has been persistently negative, suggesting that investors have instead been 

focused on the risk of prolonged lower-than-expected inflation in the context of low 

growth and underperformance.6   

                                                 
4 Recent research by Federal Reserve staff suggests that over the past year, a surprise of 25 basis points in 

the Federal Funds rate following FOMC announcements has triggered dollar appreciation of over 5 percent, 

although the confidence interval is extremely large, and the coefficient has varied substantially over time, 

including intervals when the relationship has been negative.

asset purchases.  In addition, some have suggested the low term premium could reflect an “insurance”
