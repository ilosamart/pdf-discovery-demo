nearly one-third of all originations in 2004 to slightly more than one-quarter in 2011.  The 

HMDA data further indicate that large banks accounted for about one-half of all originations in 

2004 and about the same share in 2011.11 

Therefore, as overall originations have declined, originations by small banks have not 

fallen as much as those of large banks or non-banks.  And, as a reminder, these data do not 

include loan originations by institutions that operate exclusively in rural areas that, if included, 

would presumably increase the share originated by community institutions.  Furthermore, these 

smaller institutions have been able to hold their own in the marketplace even as their numbers 

were diminished over the past few years by a number of bank closures and acquisitions by larger 

banking organizations.12 

Looking more closely at the HMDA data provides considerably more information about 

the nature of home lending undertaken by institutions and the extent to which loans are held in 

portfolio or sold.  Compared to larger banks, community banks  

 have notably larger shares of home purchase loans than loans for other purposes, such as 

refinancing or home improvement   

 tend to originate proportionately more conventional loans than loans backed by 

government guarantees 

 extend larger shares of their total home-purchase loans to low- or moderate-income 

individuals or borrowers in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods, lending that is the 

                                                 
11 Some industry sources suggest that the mortgage market is getting more concentrated at the top.  The share of 
mortgage-related activity of large banks is greater if market share estimates are based on both the number of loan 
originations and loan purchases. 
12 From year-end 2007 to June 2012, the number of banks with assets under $10 billion declined 15 percent from 
7,188 to 6,110.
