On the one hand, our unconventional tools have some limitations and costs.  For 

example, the effects of forward guidance are likely to be weaker the longer the horizon of the 

guidance, implying that it may be difficult to provide much more stimulus through this channel.  

As for our balance sheet operations, although we have now acquired some experience with this 

tool, there is still considerable uncertainty about its likely economic effects.  Moreover, some 

have expressed concern that a substantial further expansion of the balance sheet could interfere 

with the Fed’s ability to execute a smooth exit from its accommodative policies at the 

appropriate time.  I disagree with this view: The FOMC has tested a variety of tools to ensure 

that we will be able to raise short-term interest rates when needed while gradually returning the 

portfolio to a more normal size and composition.  But even if unjustified, such concerns could in 

theory reduce confidence in the Federal Reserve and so lead to an undesired increase in inflation 

expectations.   

On the other hand, risk management considerations arising from today’s unusual 

circumstances strengthen the case for additional accommodation beyond that called for by simple 

policy rules and optimal control under the modal outlook.  In particular, as I have noted, there are 

a number of significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and hence it may well be 

appropriate to insure against adverse shocks that could push the economy into territory where a 

self-reinforcing downward spiral of economic weakness would be difficult to arrest.   

Conclusion 

In my remarks this evening I have sought to explain why, in my view, a highly 

accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for some time to come.  My views 

concerning the stance of monetary policy reflect the FOMC’s firm commitment to the goals of 

maximum employment and stable prices, my appraisal of the medium term outlook (which is
