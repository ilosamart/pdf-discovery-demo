principles of transparency--involves policymakers stating clear objectives as well as their 

plans for attaining those objectives.  For example, over the past two decades, many 

central banks have introduced explicit numerical targets for inflation.  Supplemented by 

regular publication of the central bank’s economic forecasts and provisional plans for 

achieving its objective in the medium term, numerical inflation goals have helped 

increase the transparency and predictability of policy in a number of economies.  

In this spirit, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has clarified the 

Federal Reserve’s objectives and policy strategy.  Because of its dual mandate from the 

Congress, which specifies both maximum employment and price stability as policy 

objectives, the Federal Reserve could not adopt a numerical inflation target as its 

exclusive goal.  Nor would it have been appropriate for the FOMC simply to provide a 

fixed objective for some measure of employment or unemployment, in parallel with an 

inflation objective.  In contrast to inflation, which is determined by monetary policy in 

the longer run, the maximum level of employment that can be sustained over the longer 

run is determined primarily by nonmonetary factors, such as demographics, the mix of 

workforce skills, labor market institutions, and advances in technology.  Moreover, as 

these factors evolve, the maximum employment level may change over time.  

Consequently, it is beyond the power of the central bank to set a longer-run target for 

employment that is immutable or independent of the underlying structure of the 

economy.1   

The approach on which the FOMC agreed is described in its statement of longer-

run goals and policy strategy, issued in January 2012 and reaffirmed in January of this 

                                                 
1 To be clear, although monetary policy has limited influence on the level of employment that can be 
sustained in the longer run, it can be used to help eliminate gaps between the current level of employment 
and its sustainable level--as policy is doing today.
