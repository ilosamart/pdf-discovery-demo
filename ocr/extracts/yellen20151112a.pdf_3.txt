conference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a 

stimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days.  

Looking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will 

deliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary 

policy.  Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the 

effect of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in 

the post-crisis world. 

Let me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly 

relevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long-run 

monetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of issues related to 

the consideration of alternative frameworks.  I hope the work and ideas presented and 

discussed over the next two days will spur subsequent research on these issues and 

promote further collaboration among all of you.  

As I have often stressed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary 

policy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously 

its role as a research institution.  I want to thank our research conference committee for 

putting together this high-caliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished 

speakers and guests from around the world and, I am sure, will add to our understanding 

of the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.   

Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board.  I hope you all have enjoyable and 

productive discussions over the next two days.
