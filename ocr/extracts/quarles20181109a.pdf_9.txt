detail starting in early 2019, and that these changes will allow firms to benchmark the 

results of their own models against those of the supervisory models. 

However, our commitment to transparency does not end there. We are currently 

considering options to provide additional transparency regarding scenarios and scenario 

design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and possible 

approaches to, gathering the public’s input on scenarios and salient risks facing the 

banking system each year.  Such a proposal may also provide additional details about the 

scenario design features that underpins each year’s scenarios, and a range of other 

enhancements.  Additional transparency regarding the stress test scenarios serves 

multiple purposes: it both provides additional due process to affected participants, and 

provides additional sources of insight--including from academics and thought leaders like 

many of you in this room--that could be used to inform a given year’s scenario.  

Increased transparency could also enable us to be more nimble in our scenario design to 

the extent we uncover through external input new salient risks that we have not 

previously considered. 

As we develop proposals, a key consideration is to ensure that we maintain 

incentives for firms to conduct their own stress tests rigorously and thoughtfully.  Firms 

have indicated that additional disclosure about models would not affect their own stress 

tests.  We expect them to make good on that representation, as the Federal Reserve’s 

stress test is not, and cannot be, a full picture of a firm’s resiliency in light of its 

idiosyncratic risks.    

For example, there is some risk that firms will use knowledge from additional 

transparency about the stress test to engage in transactions that are solely designed to 

reduce losses in the test, but that do not truly reduce risk in their portfolios.  As 

supervisors, however, this is something that we can guard against through the regular 

examination process.  We will closely monitor changes in firms’ portfolios and take 

appropriate actions to ensure firms are holding sufficient capital, and have sufficient 

controls and governance, in light of the risk characteristics of their activities.
