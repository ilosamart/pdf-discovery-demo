the number of banks in the smallest category increased or remained unchanged over the 

past 20 years. 

This examination of the geographic patterns of changes in the population of 

community banks has shown that most markets in the United States have maintained or 

increased their numbers of community banks over the past 20 years.  Those local markets 

that have lost community banks have not been concentrated in any particular section of 

the country, and urban markets have been slightly more likely to lose community banks 

over the past 20 years than rural areas. 

One might ask, what factors have led some markets to lose community banks 

while others gained community banks or saw no change?  Because of the importance of 

community banks as a source of small business lending and other retail services, we have 

explored this question but do not yet have any definitive answers.  We considered the 

possibility that underlying demographic characteristics were driving the observed 

changes in the number of banks in a local market area.  Perhaps the size of the labor force 

or the population density, the racial and ethnic mix of the population, or changes in any 

of these factors might explain the outcome.  We also considered whether economic 

conditions such as the unemployment rate, the median household income, the number of 

business establishments, or changes in any of these measures might be useful in 

predicting which markets would lose community banks over time.  Taking into account 

all of these variables in a regression framework did not yield much explanatory power.   

This analysis has not led us to a clear story regarding the determinants of changes 

in the number of community banks serving a local market area, but we intend to continue 

our research efforts and hope that they will ultimately yield some valuable insights.  We
