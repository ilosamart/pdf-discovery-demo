I appreciate the opportunity to be at Columbia this evening to discuss the 

American economy and, in particular, the employment situation.1  Mindful of the trend of 

public discourse toward hyperbole, I hesitated in deciding whether to characterize that 

situation as a crisis.  But it is hard to justify characterizing in any less urgent fashion the 

circumstances of the nearly 30 million Americans who are officially unemployed, out of 

the labor force but wanting jobs, or involuntarily working only part time.   

This situation reflects acute problems in labor markets, created by the financial 

crisis and the recession that followed.  But we also confront chronic labor market 

problems.  In my remarks this evening, I will outline both sets of problems.  In my 

observations on policy responses, however, I will concentrate on the acute problems--in 

part to join the debate on their origins, in part because they call for the most immediate 

response, and in part because they are most relevant to my monetary policy 

responsibilities as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the 

Federal Reserve.  That said, I hope you will not think the chronic problems any less 

important for the briefer treatment they receive tonight. 

Most of what I have to say can be summarized in three points.  First, the acute 

problems are largely, though not completely, the result of a shortfall of aggregate demand 

following the financial crisis and recession.  As such, they can be addressed through 

measures designed to increase total investment and consumption spending in the 

economy.
