Supervisory stress testing has become a cornerstone of post-crisis prudential regulation.  

Stress testing, unlike traditional capital requirements, provides a forward-looking assessment of 

losses that would be suffered under adverse economic scenarios.  The simultaneous testing of the 

largest firms lends a perspective on a large part of the banking system and facilitates 

identification of common exposures and risks.   

During the financial crisis, the success of an ad hoc stress test in assessing the capital 

needs of, and restoring confidence in, the nation’s largest financial institutions encouraged 

Congress to make stress testing a required and regular feature of large firm prudential 

regulation.1  The Federal Reserve has, in the succeeding years, substantially refined its 

supervisory stress test.  Moreover, the stress test has been integrated into our Comprehensive 

Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which both ties the results of the test into the banks’ 

capital distribution practices and evaluates their risk management and capital planning capacities.   

Today I want to share with you the results of an extensive review of the statutory stress 

test and CCAR programs, which we began following the end of the 2015 cycle.  Before turning 

to the reasons for that review and some ideas for changing these programs that have arisen from 

it, I will take a few moments to summarize the characteristics and purposes of the programs as 

they have evolved to this point. 

Stress Testing and CCAR Today 

 As we have implemented the requirement mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) for stress testing--which the Federal 

Reserve denominates as the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST)--that exercise includes four
