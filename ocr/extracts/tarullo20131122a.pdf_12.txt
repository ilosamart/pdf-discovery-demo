required to hold against assets in the trading book.  But these reforms are limited: The LCR does 

not require firms to hold any liquidity buffer against SFT liabilities that mature in more than 30 

days or that are backed by very liquid assets.  There continues to be a need for standardized 

capital requirements for market risk to back up model-derived risk weights.   

 Moreover, the current regulatory framework does not impose any meaningful regulatory 

charge on the financial stability risks associated with SFT matched books.  The Basel III risk-

based capital rules require banking organizations to hold relatively little capital against SFT 

assets, which are assumed to pose little microprudential risk.  Because leverage requirements do 

not take into account the fact that SFTs are collateralized transactions, leverage requirements 

have the potential to impose higher charges on SFT assets.  But leverage requirements have 

traditionally been calibrated at non-binding levels and, to the extent they do bind in the future, 

are unlikely to bind evenly across firms.  As a result, the leverage ratio may simply cause SFT 

assets and liabilities to migrate to those firms with stronger leverage ratios.  

 Similarly, the LCR and, at least at this stage of its development, the Net Stable Funding 

Ratio (NSFR), both assume that a firm with a perfectly matched book is in a stable position.  The 

LCR assumes a bank can call in reverse repos and other SFT assets that mature in less than 30 

days or reuse the collateral that secures those assets for purposes of its own borrowing.  Thus, 

reverse repos and other SFT assets generally are treated as completely liquid instruments.  Under 

the initial version of the NSFR, firms would not need to hold any stable funding against reverse 

repos, securities borrowing receivables, or other loans to financial entities that mature in less 

than one year.  Again, this may be a reasonable position from a microprudential perspective, 

geared toward more or less normal times.  But here is where we need an explicitly
