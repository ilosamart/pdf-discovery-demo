The ratio of refinance applications to the number of real estate credit employees--

a measure of capacity constraints--has been at levels near those seen during the record 

2003 refinancing boom.  And, at the same time, each loan takes longer to process, as all 

elements of an application are now fully documented.  Capacity may be slow to expand, 

as hiring and training additional staff takes time and some lenders may judge the boom as 

likely to be too short lived to justify the cost.  Indeed, the number of real estate credit 

employees, as measured by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, has only edged up over 

the past year. 

When capacity constraints are binding, lenders may manage the surge in 

refinancing demand by holding mortgage rates high relative to lendersâ€™ funding costs.  

That would explain the pattern observed during refinance booms, such as the one in 2003, 

when mortgage rates fell more slowly than yields on mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  

Also, when MBS yields drop sharply, as occurred in September 2012 when the Federal 

Reserve announced its most recent MBS purchase program, the mortgage rate may take 

time to adjust as a result of both capacity issues and the need to process loans with rate 

locks in place.  

Furthermore, when refinancing demand is high, lenders have less incentive to 

pursue harder-to-complete or less profitable loan applications.  In the current 

environment, refinance applications by high-credit-quality borrowers--many of whom 

may have refinanced repeatedly as rates have fallen over the past couple of years--are 

likely the easiest to complete.  And refinances under the revised Home Affordable 

Refinance Program, require substantially less documentation than other loans.  It is 

possible that the abundance of these applications may have had the unintended effect of
