The third and final assumption is that the risks associated with an elevated value 

of FMV cannot be fully offset at zero cost with other nonmonetary tools, such as 

financial regulation.  To be clear, this assumption does not imply that regulation is not 

helpful in reducing financial vulnerabilities--it only says that regulation is not a perfect 

instrument.  These imperfections could stem from regulatory arbitrage; political-economy 

constraints; or the fact that too much regulation can also impede economic growth, just 

like overly restrictive monetary policy.7  Thus one way to think of my construct of FMV 

is that it is a stand-in for the level of financial vulnerabilities that remain after regulation 

has done the best that it can do, given the existing real-world limitations. 

In this setting, even with inflation concerns entirely set aside, monetary policy 

faces a tradeoff.  Consider a situation in which unemployment is above target.  A more 

accommodative policy has the usual benefit of lowering expected unemployment and 

thus reducing the expected shortfall term in the objective function.  If, however, it also 

raises the conditional variance of the unemployment rate via an elevated-FMV channel--

thereby increasing the risk term in the objective function--then there is a cost to be 

weighed alongside the benefit.  And importantly, this is true even when financial stability 

is not a separate objective in and of itself; as I have framed it, financial stability matters 

only insofar as it affects the degree of risk around the employment leg of the Federal 

Reserveâ€™s mandate.8  

To be sure, absent a concrete measure of FMV, as well as some sense of the 

responsiveness of FMV to monetary policy, this discussion is all pretty theoretical and 

                                                                                                                                                 
tradeoffs to be considered, particularly if the economy were in a very vulnerable position today.  In any 
event, these are just assumptions at this point, meant to illustrate the logic of the argument.
