shifts in liquidity are having a notable effect on the cost of trading.  Nonetheless, the 

potential for liquidity to evaporate in times of stress deserves careful scrutiny--along with 

broader risks to financial stability associated with changes in markets. 

One area where policy concerns have arisen is related to the potential for fire sales 

in bond markets, which could compound the risks associated with leverage in the 

financial sector.  Bond markets have grown considerably, and market-based finance has 

intensified over the past years, making market liquidity even more important.13  In 

addition, mutual funds that offer daily redemption rights have grown relative to the size 

of corporate bond markets. As shown in figure 5, assets under management in 

investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond mutual funds (the solid blue area) have 

hovered around 25 to 30 percent of the amount of outstanding corporate bonds in recent 

years, up from about 15 percent before the crisis.i   

Reduced market liquidity might exacerbate fire sale risks from leverage at 

financial institutions or from first-mover advantage at mutual funds.  Leveraged 

institutions are more sensitive to changes in asset prices.  Adverse movements in asset 

prices, margin calls, and higher haircuts may force them to sell assets to obtain cash and 

delever, affecting other market participants through declining asset prices and increased 

margin calls.   

In addition, leverage may closely interact with liquidity risk at mutual funds.  

Open-end mutual funds are characterized by the so-called first-mover advantage:  

Investors can redeem daily from the funds that hold assets that are less liquid, while

 A market-based system is one where securities markets share center stage with banks in allocating 

capital, in contrast to a bank-based system, where banks play a leading role.
