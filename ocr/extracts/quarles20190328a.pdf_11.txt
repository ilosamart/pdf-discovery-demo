nonbank financial firms and the banking system have emerged that could, in some scenarios, act 

as channels for domestic and cross-border amplification of risks.  

Given these potential risks, and the large--and increasing--role for nonbank financing, we 

need to monitor closely its development.  Is the growth of nonbank financing altering the 

existing market structures?  Are there new vulnerabilities in the financial system?  How will 

nonbank financing develop? 

To answer these important questions, the FSB is progressing on three related tracks.  

First, the FSB produces an annual report that outlines the developments in nonbank financing, 

detailing the global trends and potential risks.  Second, the FSB promotes the resilience of 

nonbanks through the development of a range of policies to address systemic vulnerabilities 

where they arise, while not impeding the growth of sustainable nonbank financing models.  In 

this way, we hope to promote resilient nonbank financial intermediation.  The FSB, working 

alongside other standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee and IOSCO, is monitoring 

the implementation of these policies.  Finally, knowing it is arrogant to expect that we got 

everything right the first time around, it is imperative that we start analyzing the effectiveness of 

the policies that have been implemented.  How should we alter our policies?  Have we modelled 

the risks from nonbank financing accurately?  Have we missed a crucial new source of systemic 

risk?  These are all questions that we must ask ourselves.  

Evaluation of Too-Big-To-Fail Reforms 

The third issue that I would like to raise is the problem of “too big to fail”--that is, the 

perception by investors that some institutions will receive support from their governments if they 

become distressed.  This weakens market discipline and allows such firms to become even 

larger, more leveraged and more complex.  To address this challenge, the FSB and other global
