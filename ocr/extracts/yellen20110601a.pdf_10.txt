amassed significant “pipelines” of very large deals, which effectively represented commitments 

to provide financing.  When investor interest waned, banks were left with notable positions in 

“hung” deals, which resulted in substantial mark-to-market losses.  Today, in contrast, banks 

report that they have significant risk mitigants in place to protect their balance sheets.  In 

particular, deals are smaller, financings are reportedly arranged on a “best efforts” basis, and 

banks are said to maintain considerable contractual flexibility post-commitment to adjust the 

pricing and structure of loans, at the expense of borrowers, to market-clearing levels.7  

 A second question is whether leveraged loans are being funded on any significant scale 

using mechanisms, such as repo funding, total return swaps and other OTC derivatives, and 

collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, that were prevalent before the crisis.  During the market 

disruption in 2007-08, the significant leverage deployed through these channels, and the 

operation of the associated mark-to-market triggers, clearly contributed to the disruptions in the 

loan market, and to the losses experienced by banks and other market participants.  When prices 

came under pressure, calls for additional collateral followed, leading in many cases to the sale of 

positions that put further pressure on valuations and started the cycle anew.  But, at present, a 

number of indicators, including SCOOS special questions focused on funding of syndicated 

leveraged loans, provide little evidence of heavy reliance on such mechanisms, suggesting that 

the potential for such a rapid and disorderly delevering is very limited. 

 These comforts aside, demand from unlevered investors, presumably “reaching for 

yield,” has persisted in recent months.  Strong inflows into the asset class have reportedly 

allowed borrowers to bargain for more attractive loan terms, especially given that many funds 

catering to retail and other unlevered investors have little choice but to immediately deploy 

                                                            
7 A “best efforts” syndication entails a commitment by the arranging banks for less than the entire amount of 
financing.  If the loan is undersubscribed, the deal may not close or terms may need to be adjusted to induce greater 
investor demand.
