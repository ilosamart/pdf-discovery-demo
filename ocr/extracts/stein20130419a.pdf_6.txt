and to the economy as a whole.  Thus, while banks will naturally hold buffer stocks of 

liquid assets to handle unanticipated outflows, they may not hold enough because, 

although they bear all the costs of this buffer stocking, they do not capture all of the 

social benefits, in terms of enhanced financial stability and lower costs to taxpayers in the 

event of failure.  It is this externality that creates a role for policy. 

There are two broad types of policy tools available to deal with this sort of 

liquidity-based market failure.  The first is after-the-fact intervention, either by a deposit 

insurer guaranteeing some of the bank’s liabilities or by a central bank acting as an 

LOLR; the second type is liquidity regulation.  As an example of the former, when the 

economy is in a bad state, assuming that a particular bank is not insolvent, the central 

bank can lend against illiquid assets that would otherwise be fire-sold, thereby damping 

or eliminating the run dynamics and helping reduce the incidence of bank failure.   

In much of the literature on banking, such interventions are seen as the primary 

method for dealing with run-like liquidity problems.  A classic statement of the central 

bank’s role as an LOLR is Walter Bagehot’s 1873 book Lombard Street.  More recently, 

the seminal theoretical treatment of this issue is by Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, 

who show that under certain circumstances, the use of deposit insurance or an LOLR can 

eliminate run risk altogether, thereby increasing social welfare at zero cost.7  To be clear, 

this work assumes that the bank in question is fundamentally solvent, meaning that while 

its assets may not be liquid on short notice, the long-run value of these assets is known 

with certainty to exceed the value of the bank’s liabilities.8  One way to interpret the

8 The underlying premise of solvency is captured in Bagehot’s famous dictum for use of the LOLR:  In 
times of crisis, the central bank should lend freely (and at a penalty rate) to banks, provided that the banks
