that the trauma associated with the Great Recession may have contributed to a persistent 

increase in precautionary saving and greater demand for safe and liquid assets.16  

Thus, both increased saving and reduced investment have potentially driven the 

sizable decline in the natural rate of interest.  If some of the forces behind these shifts 

prove to be quite persistent, then we could be stuck in a new longer-run equilibrium 

characterized by sluggish growth and recurrent reliance on unconventional monetary 

policy.   

Nonetheless, there is a silver lining.  Monetary and fiscal policies could 

ameliorate some, though not all, of the potential causes of ultralow rates--such as 

excessive precautionary saving and weak demand for physical capital.  In other words, 

ultralow interest rates are not necessarily here to stay, especially if the right policies are 

put in place to address at least some of their root causes.   

What are some of these policies?  First, transparent and sound monetary policies 

here and abroad have helped mitigate downside risks and improve economic conditions, 

likely boosting confidence in the sustainability of the recovery.  Without them, we 

probably would have had a more pronounced increase in precautionary saving and a 

deeper decline in fixed investment, which together would have put additional downward 

pressure on the natural rate of interest and, more important, further damaged the 

economy’s growth potential. 

But, second, the virtues of sound monetary policy notwithstanding, we must not 

forget, as former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reminded us on numerous occasions, that 

“monetary policy is not a panacea.”17  For instance, as I mentioned recently elsewhere,
