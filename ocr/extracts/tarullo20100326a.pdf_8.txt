was equally important not to become a slave to any one model or method of estimating 

losses.  It was precisely the combination of rigorous, data-driven analyses and considered 

judgment that made the stress test successful.  The interactive and iterative nature of the 

process helped refine each method of assessment. 

 Fourth, the SCAP underscored the importance of both horizontal and 

macroprudential perspectives in supervising banking organizations.  During the SCAP, 

simultaneous, consistent, and comparative cross-firm assessments allowed a broader 

analysis of risks, easier identification of outliers, and better evaluation of individual firm 

estimates.  Because SCAP banks held the majority of U.S. banking assets, it also allowed 

for a better understanding of interrelationships and systemic risks.   

Turning now to how the SCAP experience has informed our supervisory policies, 

I think its effects are best understood in the overall context of the reforms motivated by 

the financial crisis.  Like regulators around the world, we are developing and 

implementing improvements in capital and other prudential rules.  The Congress is 

considering legislative proposals to enhance market discipline through such means as a 

special resolution mechanism for large financial firms and to affect the structure of the 

financial services industry through such measures as the Volcker rule and limitations on 

acquisitions by systemically important firms.  These three modes of reform--rules, market 

discipline, and structural measures--must be complemented by more-effective 

supervisory oversight, particularly of the largest, most complex financial institutions.  To 

this end, the Federal Reserve is now implementing a more closely coordinated 

supervisory system in which a cross-firm, horizontal perspective is an organizing 

supervisory principle.  We will concentrate on all activities within the holding companies
