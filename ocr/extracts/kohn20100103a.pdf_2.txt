 I’m pleased to participate in this year’s Brimmer Policy Forum.  Governor 

Brimmer and I did not overlap at the Board, but I admired his work from my perch at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, where I began my career in the System.  And my 

colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I have benefited greatly since then from his 

analytical approach to difficult public policy issues.  This morning I thought it might be 

useful for me to review the course of monetary policy through the crisis and highlight a 

few issues for policy in the future. 

 I’d like to make two important clarifications before I get started:  First, despite the 

title of the Forum, what I am about to discuss is not President Obama’s monetary policy--

it is the Federal Reserve’s.  Fortunately, the Administration has been careful to respect 

the independence of the Federal Reserve in the conduct of monetary policy.  It recognizes 

that the Federal Reserve’s insulation from short-term political pressures is essential for 

fostering achievement of its legislative objectives of stable prices and maximum 

employment over time.  Second, the views you are about to hear are my own and not 

necessarily those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).   

Monetary Policy Past 

As a prelude to discussing where we are now and issues for the future, I thought it 

would be helpful to summarize the actions that we took over the past two years.  In 

August 2007, we recognized that we were coping with a potentially serious disruption in 

financial markets that could feed back adversely on the economy and job creation.  With 

liquidity in key funding markets drying up and some securitization markets closing down, 

lower policy interest rates alone were not going to be enough to keep financial conditions
