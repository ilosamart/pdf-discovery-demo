structural vulnerabilities in financial systems and in the gold standard itself, helped 

destabilize the global economic and financial system and bring on the Great Depression. 

The Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s illustrates a somewhat different type 

of risk associated with large cross-border flows of capital.  During the 1990s, strong 

capital inflows helped support robust growth in many Asian economies.  But Thailandâ€™s 

devaluation in mid-1997 triggered closer scrutiny of developments in the region.  

Investors began to recognize that the financial systems of some Asian economies--

because of institutional weaknesses, inadequate regulation, or other deficiencies--had not 

effectively channeled the surge of incoming funds into productive investments.  As 

foreign investors lost confidence, capital flows into the region reversed sharply, and the 

credit-driven boom came to a precipitous end.  The Asian crisis imposed heavy costs in 

terms of financial and macroeconomic instability in the affected countries.  In this case, 

capital inflows posed a problem because of weaknesses in the financial systems and 

regulatory oversight in countries receiving foreign capital.   

Although these issues are now generally discussed in the context of emerging 

market economies, the United States--the recipient of the largest capital inflows in the 

world--has also faced challenges coping with capital inflows.  Notably, the failures of the 

U.S. financial system in allocating strong flows of capital, both domestic and foreign, 

helped precipitate the recent financial crisis and global recession.  

Why was the United States, a mature economy, the recipient of net capital inflows 

that rose to as much as 6 percent of its gross domestic product prior to the financial 

crisis?  A significant portion of these capital inflows reflected a broader phenomenon
