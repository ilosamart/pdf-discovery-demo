recovery.  And their knowledge, analysis and judgment will be indispensable in fulfilling the 

mission of the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.     

Congress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with great responsibilities.  The tools we deploy, to 

guide the financial system and influence our vast economy, can seem far removed from the lives 

and concerns of average Americans.  And yet the decisions we make affect the welfare and shape 

the future of every American.  I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and 

challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy.  The 

unemployment rate represents millions of individuals who are eager to work but struggling to 

provide for themselves and their families.  When we make progress toward our goals, each job 

that is created lifts this burden for someone who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a 

stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.   

Let me close by offering my heartfelt thanks for the many messages I have received since my 

nomination from individuals around the country who have written to wish me well and offer 

their support.  I pledge to do my very best to meet the challenges that lie ahead.     

Thank you all for coming today.
