strengthening the banking sector through the capital and liquidity requirements of 

Basel III.  We have also made important strides in improving international cooperation 

and coordination in the supervision of systemically important financial institutions, 

whose operations and exposures span numerous jurisdictions.  That said, we need to 

continue working toward viable resolution mechanisms for these institutions.  Further 

work is also needed to improve our macroprudential approach to managing 

vulnerabilities.  And we must collaborate to ensure that risky activities do not migrate to 

the shadows of the financial system in an attempt to circumvent regulatory authorities.   

We must also strengthen the international monetary system.  We need a system 

characterized by more open capital accounts, flexible exchange rates, and independent 

monetary policies.  Open capital accounts, supported by appropriate financial supervision 

and regulation, channel savings to their most productive uses, thereby enhancing welfare.  

Exchange rate flexibility improves domestic macroeconomic management, allowing 

countries to pursue independent monetary policies tailored to their individual needs, and 

limits unwelcome spillovers to other economies.  Such a system can also flexibly adapt to 

changing economic and financial realities as countries develop, technology progresses, 

and shocks buffet the global economy. 

Our current international monetary system does not yet fulfill these objectives.  

We now have a hybrid arrangement in which some economies have flexible exchange 

rates, maintain open capital accounts, and pursue independent monetary policy--a 

sensible reconciliation of the so-called impossible trinity.  But other countries heavily 

manage their exchange rates, with varying mixes of capital mobility and monetary policy 

independence.
