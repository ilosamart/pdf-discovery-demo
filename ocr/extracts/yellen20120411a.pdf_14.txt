the assumed date of liftoff and the longer-run pace of tightening are merely illustrative 

and are not based on any internal FOMC deliberations.

Given this baseline, one can then employ the dynamics of one of the Federal 

Reserve’s economic models, the FRB/US model, to solve for the optimal funds rate path 

subject to a particular loss function.

  Such a policy involves keeping the funds rate close 

to zero until late 2015.  This highly accommodative policy path generates, according to 

the FRB/US model, a notably faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline 

outlook.  In addition, the inflation rate runs close to the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 

percent over coming years.  According to the specified loss function, and in my opinion, 

this economic outcome would be more desirable than the baseline.  One reason this 

exercise generates a better outcome is because it assumes that the Federal Reserve’s 

inflation objective is fully credible--that is, all households and businesses fully 

understand the Federal Reserve’s goals and believe that policymakers will follow the 

optimal policy designed to meet those goals.  This belief ties down longer-term inflation 

expectations in the model even while it allows the lower interest rate to spur faster 

growth in output and employment.  

While optimal control exercises can be informative, such analyses hinge on the 

selection of a specific macroeconomic model as well as a set of simplifying assumptions 

that may be quite unrealistic.  I therefore consider it imprudent to place too much weight

 In these simulations, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is assumed to evolve in accordance with the 

exit strategy principles that the FOMC adopted at its June 2011 meeting.

 This procedure involves two steps.  First, the FRB/US model’s projections of real activity, inflation, and 

interest rates are adjusted to replicate the baseline forecast values reported in figure 7.  Second, a search 

procedure is used to solve for the path of the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of a loss function.  

The loss function is equal to the cumulative sum from 2012:Q2 through 2025:Q4 of three factors--the 

(discounted) squared deviation of the unemployment rate from 5-1/2 percent, the squared deviation of 

overall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the squared quarterly change in the federal funds rate.  The third 

term is added to damp quarter-to-quarter movements in interest rates.
