Second--and here is an affirmative argument for rationalization measures--we need to 

have a more explicit and thorough tiering of requirements within the prudential regulatory 

regime.  The flip side of the observation that the largest banks need stricter and more wide-

ranging regulation because of the special risks they pose is that the smaller and less 

interconnected a bank is, the less risk it presents and thus the less strict its regulatory 

requirements need be.  The Dodd-Frank Act reflects this principle, not only in its mandate of 

progressively more stringent requirements as the systemic importance of a financial firm 

increases, but also in the asset-size thresholds it establishes for various new regulations.  

However, as I have noted in the past, I think these thresholds were set too low in places.20  For 

example, I would raise the threshold for enhanced prudential standards from its current $50 

billion level, perhaps to $100 billion.  And I would entirely exempt community banks--by which 

I mean those with less than $10 billion in assets--from some regulations, such as the Volcker rule 

and the incentive compensation rule. 

It is worth noting that the burden of these rules for small banks is often less in the 

substantive constraints they impose on bank activities than in the compliance costs they impose.  

Even with efforts by banking agencies to streamline implementing regulations for smaller banks, 

the relatively scarce compliance resources of those banks must still be directed towards assuring 

that no changes in substantive activities are needed and possibly documenting their compliance.  

Indeed, I would generalize this point to suggest that the smaller the bank, the greater the 

likelihood that a potential disconnect between costs and benefits of regulation is rooted in the 

disproportionate costs of exams, audits, and reporting.  So while I think it is worthwhile to 

continue, for example, efforts to simplify capital rules for small banks, the greater value for those
