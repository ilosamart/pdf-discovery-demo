â€¢ A fourth reason that spillovers could be mitigated is that U.S. policy rates are 

likely to increase only gradually--assuming that economic developments unfold 

reasonably in line with expectations--and to plateau at a significantly lower level 

than the historical average.12  The low long-run level of the policy rate reflects a 

number of factors--including slower productivity growth, demographic change, 

and a higher demand for safe assets--that have pushed down the real long-run 

neutral rate, which is the real interest rate needed to keep the economy at full 

employment in the longer-run.  The upshot is that U.S. policy rates are likely to 

increase more slowly, and by a lower cumulative amount, than in past episodes of 

U.S. monetary tightening.  This in turn should reduce the divergence between the 

stance of U.S. and foreign monetary policies and the associated spillovers arising 

from such divergence.  

While there are good grounds to expect that spillovers from U.S. monetary policy 

actions will be manageable for most of our trading partners, events may unfold 

differently than expected.  To illustrate, a noticeably faster U.S. recovery would require a 

more rapid removal of U.S. accommodation and could exert noticeably larger spillovers 

abroad by putting more upward pressure on foreign interest rates and by inducing larger 

depreciations of foreign currencies.  Despite greater policy divergence, many of our 

trading partners would receive a net boost to their GDP provided that the stimulus to their 

exports--from stronger U.S. demand and a weaker domestic currency--was sufficient to 

offset possible tightening in their financial conditions.  But other economies might be 

hurt as a weaker currency could lead to balance sheet deterioration and rising risk
