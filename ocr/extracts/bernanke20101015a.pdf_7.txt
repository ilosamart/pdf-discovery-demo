The Outlook for Inflation 

Let me turn now to the outlook for inflation.  Generally speaking, measures of 

underlying inflation have been trending downward.  For example, so-called core PCE 

price inflation (which is based on the broad-based price index for personal consumption 

expenditures and excludes the volatile food and energy components of the overall index) 

has declined from approximately 2.5 percent at an annual rate in the early stages of the 

recession to an annual rate of about 1.1 percent over the first eight months of this year.  

The overall PCE price inflation rate, which includes food and energy prices, has been 

highly volatile in the past few years, in large part because of sharp fluctuations in oil 

prices.  However, so far this year the overall inflation rate has been about the same as the 

core inflation rate.   

The significant moderation in price increases has been widespread across many 

categories of spending, as is evident from various measures that exclude the most 

extreme price movements in each period.  For example, the so-called trimmed mean 

consumer price index (CPI) has risen by only 0.9 percent over the past 12 months, and a 

related measure, the median CPI, has increased by only 0.5 percent over the same 

period.2 

The decline in underlying inflation importantly reflects the extent to which cost 

pressures have been restrained by substantial slack in the utilization of productive 

resources.  Notably, the unemployment rate remains fairly close to last fallâ€™s peak and is 

                                                 
2 Trimmed-mean and median CPI measures are published regularly by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland; these indicators are constructed using the distribution of monthly price changes for the 
disaggregated components of the CPI.  The median CPI inflation rate is the price change at the center of 
this distribution, and the trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate is a weighted average of all components 
excluding the most extreme price increases and decreases.  For further information, see
