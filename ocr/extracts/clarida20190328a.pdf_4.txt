boost the dollar, weighing on the U.S. economy.4  The spillover of risk aversion to U.S. 

markets might well also push down equity prices and widen corporate credit spreads, 

adding to the contractionary pressures.  However, the same safe-haven flows into 

Treasury securities would cause U.S. long-term yields to fall, mitigating these adverse 

effects on domestic demand and activity.5   

Historical Experience  

Let us consider some historical examples of the effect of adverse foreign shocks 

on the U.S. economy.  The Mexican peso crisis of 1994 and ’95 and the Asian financial 

crisis of 1997 through ’98 resulted in substantial hits to aggregate emerging market 

economy (EME) growth, but they had fairly muted effects on U.S. growth.6  In part, this 

limited response in previous decades reflected the smaller share of the EMEs in the 

global economy and, as a related matter, in U.S. trade.  Furthermore, the weight of EMEs 

in the global financial system was lighter in previous decades, so their crises were less 

disruptive to global markets.7  Finally, even back then, the safe-haven flows into dollar 

                                                 
4 Other countries that are also recipients of safe-haven flows include Japan and Switzerland. 
5 An additional channel I have abstracted from here is that of commodity prices, which often move 
significantly in response to foreign factors.  Since the United States is both a large exporter of some 
commodities and a large importer of some other commodities, the overall implications for U.S. activity are 
likely to be mixed.  In particular, the effects of oil prices on the U.S. economy have been quite extensively 
studied.  For example, Kilian (2008) and Kilian and Vigfusson (2017) present evidence on how increases in 
oil prices have historically adversely affected U.S. economic performance, as the United States is a net 
importer of oil.  More recently, as outlined in Board of Governors (2018, pp. 16-17), with the net oil import 
share trending lower in the United States, the drag on U.S. GDP from higher oil prices has likely declined. 
6 Most studies discussing contagion effects of the Mexican peso crisis focus on effects on other Latin 
American countries and do not highlight effects on U.S. growth.  Studies on the effects of the Asian 
financial crisis on U.S. activity generally find from modest adverse to even slightly positive effects (see, for 
example, Duca, Gould, and Taylor, 1998; Harrigan, 2000; and van Wincoop and Yi, 2000).  Duca, Gould, 
and Taylor (1998) called the effect on the United States “more of a swell rather than a tsunami” (p. 1).  One 
study, Pollard and Coughlin (1999), found significant negative effects of the Asian crisis on U.S. exports in 
certain industries, but it also concluded that this effect did not translate into much of an effect on industry 
outputs.   
7 Support provided by the official international financial community also helped mute global market 
disruptions during these EME crises.
