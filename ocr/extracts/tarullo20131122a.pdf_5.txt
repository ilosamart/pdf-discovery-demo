de facto extension of federal guarantees created moral hazard problems, which the safety-and-

soundness regulation of insured depository institutions was strengthened to address. 

  The similarities between deposit runs and short-term wholesale funding runs have 

suggested to some that the policy responses should also be similar.  Those taking this position 

argue for providing discount window access to broker-dealers, guaranteeing certain kinds of 

wholesale funding, or both.  Others, myself included, are wary of any such extension of the 

government safety net and would prefer a regulatory approach that requires market actors using 

or extending short-term wholesale funding to internalize the social costs of those forms of 

funding.  Unlike deposit insurance, the savings of most U.S. households are generally not 

directly at risk in short-term wholesale funding arrangements.  And, also unlike insured deposits, 

there is an argument in the short-term wholesale funding context that counterparties should be 

capable of providing some market discipline in at least some of the contexts in which such 

funding is provided. 

In thinking about how to regulate shadow banking, we must be mindful that it is not 

really a single system.  It is immeasurably more complicated than the bank deposit system of 

either the 1930s or today.  Even with the reduction in activity following the crisis, the scale of 

shadow banking activity remains very large.  Banks and broker-dealers currently borrow about 

$1.6 trillion, much of this from money market funds and securities lenders, through tri-party 

repos, leaving aside additional funds sourced from asset managers and other investors through 

other channels.2  The banks and broker dealers, in turn, use reverse repo to provide more than $1 

trillion in financing to prime brokerage and other clients.  While the volume of this activity has
