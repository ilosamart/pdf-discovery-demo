$2 trillion--is many orders of magnitude higher than the level that prevailed before the 

financial crisis, a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs or “quantitative 

easing.”  The vertical lines in the figure show key dates in the implementation of the 

LCR, including the initial Basel III international introduction of the regulation followed 

by its two-step introduction in the United States.  A key takeaway from this figure is that 

the Fed was in the process of adding substantial quantities of reserve balances to the 

banking system while the LCR was being implemented--and these two changes largely 

happened simultaneously.  As a result, banks, in aggregate, are currently using reserve 

balances to meet a significant portion of their LCR requirements.  In addition, because 

these changes happened together, it is reasonable to conclude that the current 

environment is likely not very informative about banks’ underlying demand for reserve 

balances. 

But now the situation is changing, albeit very slowly.  Last October, the Fed 

began to gradually and predictably reduce the size of its balance sheet.9  The Fed is doing 

so by reinvesting the principal payments it receives on its securities holdings only to the 

extent that they exceed gradually increasing caps--that is, the Fed is allowing securities to 

roll off its portfolio each month up to a specific maximum amount.  This policy is also 

reducing reserve balances.  So far, after the first seven months of the program, the Fed 

has shed about $120 billion of its securities holdings, which is a fairly modest amount 

when compared with the remaining size of its balance sheet.  Consequently, the level of 

reserves in the banking system is still quite abundant.
