strained balance sheets of financial institutions led to a sharp tightening of mortgage 

credit. 

The drop in national house prices erased $7 trillion in household wealth.  Home 

equity was a large share of the total assets of low- and moderate-income families prior to 

the recession, so the drop in housing wealth has hit many families particularly hard.  

Because wealth is one of the key factors that households consider when deciding how 

much to spend, the drop in housing wealth is expected to reduce household expenditures-

-the so-called wealth effect.  This restraint on consumer spending is especially severe for 

households who owe more on their mortgage than their house is worth because such 

“underwater” households have been unable to take advantage of low mortgage rates by 

refinancing.  With more than one out of every five mortgages nationwide estimated to be 

underwater in 2011, the resulting restraint on consumer spending and its effect on slower 

economic growth is appreciable.   

The heavy load of housing-related debt that many households are still carrying 

may be affecting consumer spending even more powerfully than would be suggested by 

the drop in house values alone.  For example, recent academic research has found that 

highly indebted households cut their spending on goods and services more severely in 

response to a drop in home values than do less-indebted households hit with the same 

reduction in home values.

  This result suggests that consumer spending may not act 

powerfully to revive the economy until Americans’ financial situations have improved.
