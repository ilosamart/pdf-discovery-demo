Business investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both 

business surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead.  Fiscal stimulus and 

continued accommodative financial conditions are supporting both household spending 

and business investment, while strong global growth has boosted U.S. exports. 

As many of you know, each quarter FOMC participants--the members of the 

Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks--submit their individual 

projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their forecasts of the 

appropriate path of the federal funds rate, which the Committee uses as the primary tool 

of monetary policy.  These individual projections are compiled and published in the 

Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP.  FOMC participants submitted their most 

recent forecasts three weeks ago, and those forecasts show a strengthening in the 

medium-term economic outlook (table 1).  As you can see, participants generally raised 

their forecasts for growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and 

lowered their forecasts for unemployment.  In addition, many participants expressed 

increased confidence that inflation would move up toward our 2 percent target.  The 

FOMC sees the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.  

The State of the Labor Market 

As I mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen 

since 2000.  The median projection in the March SEP calls for unemployment to fall well 

below 4 percent for a sustained period, something that has not happened since the late 

1960s.  This strong labor market forecast has important implications for the fulfillment of 

both sides of the dual mandate, and thus for the path of monetary policy.  So I will spend 

a few minutes exploring the state of the job market in some detail.
