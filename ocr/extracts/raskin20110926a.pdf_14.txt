Indeed, some commentators assign a label of “hawk” or “dove” to the various 

FOMC participants in an attempt to characterize how we prioritize the goals of maximum 

employment and price stability.  In my view, such labels are ill conceived and misleading 

because everyone on the Committee is fully committed to promoting both of these goals.  

Incidentally, since my kids now love describing everyone as a hawk or a dove or some 

other kind of bird, I have taken to reminding them of this conviction I have:  When my 

colleagues and I are doing our job correctly, we are neither hawks nor doves but owls--

that is, we are trying to be as wise as possible in deploying all the tools we have to fulfill 

our legal mandate. 

Conclusion 

In summary, the economic recovery has fallen well short of restoring labor market 

conditions to historically typical levels.  Given the elevated rate of unemployment and the 

large number of individuals who are experiencing long spells of unemployment, both 

fiscal and monetary policymakers should be considering a wide array of approaches for 

promoting job creation.  In my view, the deployment of our monetary policy tools needs 

to be carefully gauged, appropriately timed, and clearly communicated to the public.  

Moreover, to the extent that some factors may attenuate the usual effectiveness of 

monetary policy, there is a compelling case to identify and implement policy measures to 

mitigate those factors and thereby strengthen the effect of the monetary accommodation 

that we have already put in place.  Finally, in light of the economic hardships that are 

facing our nation, I want to underscore that the Federal Reserve is fully committed to 

doing everything we can to promote maximum employment in the context of price 

stability.
