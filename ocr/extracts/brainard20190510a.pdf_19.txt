Maximum Employment, Wages, and Wealth 

With lower net worth and financial assets, the livelihoods of most middle-income 

families, other than retirees, depend primarily on compensation from working.  So the 

robustness of labor income over time is central to the ability of middle-income families to 

achieve and maintain middle-class financial security.  While the strengthening of the 

labor market over the course of this extended recovery has benefited middle-income 

families, the long-term decline in the share of national income going to wage earners is 

concerning. 

The Congress put maximum employment right at the heart of the Federal 

Reserve’s mandate, alongside price stability.  In fact, we are one of only a handful of 

central banks that have the explicit responsibility to promote maximum employment.  

Given that households at the middle of the income distribution rely primarily on wage 

income, our full employment mandate has served the country well during this extended 

recovery.   

The gains to workers, including those in the middle class, from the strong labor 

market are clear.  Unemployment is now at 3.6 percent—its lowest level in 50 years.  

Employment rates of adults in their prime working years (ages 25 to 54) have been rising 

steadily during the expansion and recently reached their pre-recession peak of 80 

percent.42  Importantly, wage growth has begun to pick up after years of slow gains.  

It is notable that the near recovery in middle-class wealth from the Great 

Recession did not take hold until the labor market began to strengthen.  While higher-

income households saw their wealth begin to recover as soon as financial markets
