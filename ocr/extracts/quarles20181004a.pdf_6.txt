The number of community banks has been declining over the last 20 years, but 

community banks still account for more than 95 percent of banks operating in the United 

States.  The decline has been roughly similar for urban and rural community banks, 

leaving the share of community banks that operate primarily in rural markets quite stable 

at just over 50 percent.  While urban community banks are quite a bit larger than rural 

community banks on average, over the last 20 years, rural community banks have 

consistently earned higher rates of return on assets and rates of return on equity than their 

urban peers despite a more challenging economic environment.    

While the data present a compelling high-level picture, they do not tell the whole 

story.  For example, averages across a large number of markets do not tell us what is 

going on in any individual market.  In addition, much of the data that I am presenting 

today is aggregated to the county level, which obscures community-level dynamics: 

Some communities within a county may have lost banks or bank branches, while others 

may have gained.  In the rural Mountain West, where I grew up, a single county can be 

physically larger than some Eastern states.  And the demographics of the communities--

for example, high- or low-income--that have lost or gained are also not visible, but 

important.  Federal Reserve staff are engaged in efforts to further our understanding of 

the effects of losses of banks or bank branches on the people who live and work in the 

affected communities. 

National Trends in Urban versus Rural Community Banks over the Past 20 Years 

The number of banks in the United States fell by almost half over the past 

20 years--from about 10,700 in 1997 to about 5,600 in 2017.  About 97 percent of the 

decrease was accounted for by community banks.  Looking at the trend in the number of
