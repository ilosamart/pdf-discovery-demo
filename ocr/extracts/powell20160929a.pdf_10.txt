can take some comfort from the fact that the number of local markets that either 

maintained or increased the number of community banks serving their residents and small 

businesses is much larger than the number of markets that saw a decline in the number of 

community banks.  That said, we recognize that the loss of community banks may have 

caused some communities to suffer adverse economic consequences. 

So, what do we take away from this review of bank numbers and performance?  

First, the decline in the number of community banks is not a recent phenomenon--it has 

been a constant theme over at least the past 20 years.  Second, it has occurred almost 

exclusively among the smallest community banks--those with less than $100 million in 

assets.  However, I want to emphasize that the long-trending decline in the number of 

very small community banks does not mean that these banks do not play an important 

role in our financial system.  Almost all newly chartered banks fall into this category, and 

many of these banks thrive and, ultimately, outgrow the smallest size category.  Thus, 

banks with less than $100 million in assets should be viewed as a key source of 

dynamism and competition within the banking sector.  Third, although the rate of decline 

has accelerated a bit during the past 5 years, that acceleration is largely due to a lack of 

entry rather than an increased rate of exit.  Fourth, although the lack of entry may be due 

in part to increased regulatory burden, much of it can be explained by very low interest 

rates and a post-crisis expansion that has been slower than usual.  Fifth, at a local level, 

about one-third of markets have seen a decline in the number of community banks over 

the past 20 years, but about two-thirds have seen no change or an increase in the number 

of community banks.  It is unclear what factors explain observed changes in the number 

of community banks at a local market level.  More research is needed on this question.
