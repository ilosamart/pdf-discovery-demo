As this map should make plain, when we talk about rural America, to a significant extent 

we are talking about the rural West.  Another way to put it is that while the West is half of the 

United States geographically, it is only a quarter of its population.2  Eight of the 13 states in our 

definition of the West are among the dozen in the nation with the lowest population density.3  

Even after subtracting the large share of unpopulated government-owned land in the West, the 

overwhelming majority of the West is rural. 

Yet it is also true that, as most of you know, the West is the most urban region of the 

country.  Five of the 15 largest metro areas in the United States are located in the West, and 90 

percent of the entire region’s population lives in cities, compared to 81 percent of the country as 

a whole. 4,5  Nevada and Utah are among the least densely populated states, but 90 percent or 

more of their residents live in cities.  Like the rest of the country, the West is urbanizing.  I will 

return to the differences between urban and rural areas, but first, let’s look at the economy of the 

West. 

The Economy of the West: From Boom to Boom 

The West accounts for 25 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, almost exactly the 

share of the U.S. population in the West.  This isn’t entirely a coincidence, because population 

relates to labor supply, which is one determinant of economic output.  I mention this because it is
