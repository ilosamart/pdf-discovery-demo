industry practices change over time, although it is not yet clear whether it will be an initial 

feature.  

The Federal Reserve plans to devote the necessary resources to deliver the highest quality 

FedNow Service in a timely manner. We are working to streamline our internal processes to 

move quickly in the market. President George will play an integral role in this new process, and 

the Conference of Reserve Bank Presidents has pledged its support.  

It is important for the Federal Reserve, working with the payment industry, to act quickly 

in finalizing the initial business requirements of the FedNow Service. We will need to hear the 

views of payment system stakeholders on the features of the FedNow Service, as discussed in the 

Federal Register notice announced today. We will engage with the industry through groups and 

forums to finalize the design and features of the service. We hope that these conversations will 

provide an opportunity for stakeholders to work together to shape the evolution of the U.S. 

payment system.  

Earlier this month, I joined my Reserve Bank colleagues for a visit with bankers and 

community organizations in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to hear about the biggest challenges they 

are facing. The head of a bank that has been serving the Scranton area for more than a century 

told me that for his community bank to remain competitive in its payment offerings, it is vital to 

be able to rely on the Federal Reserve for real-time payments just as he does for check, ACH, 

and wire transfer. I appreciate the importance of community banks to the economic health of our 

communities, and I recognize the role of the Federal Reserve in enabling community banks to 

offer payment services on a competitive basis. I am confident that by working together with all 

payment system stakeholders, we can collectively achieve widespread, safe, and efficient faster 

payments that will benefit all.
