controlling inflation had clearly resulted in inflation expectations becoming 

“unanchored,” with high estimates of trend inflation embedded in longer-term interest 

rates.   

As you know, under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Federal 

Reserve in 1979 fundamentally changed its approach to the issue of ensuring price 

stability.  This change involved an important rethinking on the part of policymakers.  By 

the end of the 1970s, Federal Reserve officials increasingly accepted the view that 

inflation is a monetary phenomenon, at least in the medium and longer term; they became 

more alert to the risks of excessive optimism about the economy’s potential output; and 

they placed renewed emphasis on the distinction between real--that is, inflation-

adjusted--and nominal interest rates.

  The change in policy framework was initially tied 

to a change in operating procedures that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves, but 

the critical change--the willingness to respond more vigorously to inflation--endured even 

after the Federal Reserve resumed its traditional use of the federal funds rate as the policy 

instrument.

  The new regime also reflected an improved understanding of the 

importance of providing a firm anchor, secured by the credibility of the central bank, for 

the private sector’s inflation expectations.

  Finally, it entailed a changed view about the

 Central banks’ emphasis on expectations management partly reflected lessons from the rational 

expectations literature of the 1970s.  Monetary policy implications of the rational expectations literature 

were further clarified by later research.  For example, Sargent (1982) brought out dramatically the 

dependence of inflation expectations on the monetary policy regime in his study of major disinflations, 

while rational expectations models were extended to include sticky prices (Fischer, 1977; Taylor, 1980; 

Rotemberg, 1982; Calvo, 1983) and interest rate rules (Sargent and Wallace, 1975; McCallum, 1981; 

Taylor, 1993, 1999b; Woodford, 2003).
