advanced economies.44  Evidence suggests that if the United States had policies in place 

such as those employed in many European countries, female labor force participation 

could be as high as 82 percent.45  

However, these policies entail tradeoffs.  Women in other advanced economies 

are more likely than women in the United States to be employed part time, which could 

reflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it 

also comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and 

advancement.  Such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas 

in recent years have had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive for 

employers there to hire women into full-time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as 

women are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits.46 

This possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier 

for women and men to combine their family and career aspirations.  For instance, 

improving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as 

it has been shown to support full-time employment.47  Recently, there also seems to be 

some momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth.  The 

experience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not narrowly target childbirth, but 

instead can be used to meet a variety of the health and caregiving responsibilities.48  

                                                 
44 Note that Blau and Kahn  (2013) do not find that improvement in the provision of childcare in other 
advanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s; 
however, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare has a positive effect on full-time 
employment.

46 In most European countries, men are significantly less likely than women to use paid parental leave, 
although in a few countries, including Sweden and Iceland, over 40 percent of users of parental leave are 
men (OECD, 2016).
