runoff of our securities starting in May and to cease the runoff entirely in September.3  

This decision is the culmination of discussions that we had over the previous four 

meetings about our operating framework and reflects our desire to converge to a balance 

sheet that is no larger than it needs to be to conduct monetary policy efficiently and 

effectively.  In September, reserve balances likely will remain above the minimum level, 

including a buffer, consistent with this goal.  In that case, we anticipate we will likely 

hold the size of our balance sheet at the level reached in September for a time thereafter 

and let the gradual increase in other (nonreserve) liabilities, such as currency, slowly 

shrink the level of reserves.  Importantly, with this decision on the size of our balance 

sheet now taken, we can turn our attention in future meetings to discussing and deciding 

on the maturity composition of our System Open Market Account portfolio.   

As you may know, last November the Federal Reserve announced that in 2019 we 

are undertaking a System review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications practices.  Information about this review can be found on the Federal 

Reserve Board’s website.4  In this review, we will listen to a broad range of stakeholders 

at public events held around the country, and we will draw on their insights as we assess 

how best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most 

robust fashion possible.  Taking these viewpoints on board, the FOMC will begin its own 

discussions this summer on how we might refine our framework, and we will provide a 

public assessment after the review is complete.
