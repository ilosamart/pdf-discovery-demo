example by considering frequent batch auctions as an alternative to the central 

limit order book, or by placing minimum time limits on orders.  Ideas such as these 

make me wonder whether it might collectively be possible to come to a 

compromise in which more trading is done directly on the public market, if at the 

same time the public market rules were adjusted to emphasize greater liquidity 

provision, and particularly more stable liquidity provision, over speed.  Perhaps 

public-private forums such as this conference can help in achieving that type of 

cooperative approach.  I look forward to hearing views on these ideas tomorrow.    

Treasury repo markets have also been undergoing structural changes.  This 

is a good time to look at potential changes to the clearance and settlement 

infrastructure in these markets, as we will discuss tomorrow afternoon.  We should 

take this opportunity to ask whether current market structures are well-suited to the 

new environment, or whether we should be aiming for a substantially different 

approach in the longer run.  There is a tight link between funding liquidity in repo 

markets and market liquidity in cash and futures markets, so a healthy, liquid repo 

market is essential to the overall health of the market.  However, regulatory 

changes have made repo activity more expensive.4  There are currently a number of 

private proposals to expand the use of central clearing for repo markets that could

reliance on discretionary extensions of intraday credit by the clearing banks and fostering improvements in market 
participants’ liquidity and credit risk-management practices.
