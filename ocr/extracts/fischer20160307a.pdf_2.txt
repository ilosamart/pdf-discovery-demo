I am grateful to the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) for 

conferring the fourth annual NABE Paul A. Volcker Lifetime Achievement Award for 

Economic Policy on me, thereby allowing me the honor of following in the footsteps of 

Paul Volcker, Jean-Claude Trichet, and Alice Rivlin.1  The honor of receiving the award 

is enhanced by its bearing the name of Paul Volcker, a model citizen and public servant, 

and a giant in every sense among central bankers.   

One thinks of many things on an occasion such as this one.  My mind goes back 

first to growing up in a very small town in Zambia, then Northern Rhodesia, and to the 

surprise and delight my parents would have felt at seeing me standing where I am now.  

They would have been even more delighted that my girlfriend, Rhoda, whom I met when 

my parents moved to a bigger town in Zimbabwe, and I have been happily married for 

50 years.  But that is not the story I will tell today.  Rather, I want to talk about our field, 

macroeconomics, and some of the lessons we have learned in the course of the last 

55 years--and I say 55 years, because in 1961, at the end of my school years, on the 

advice of a friend, I read Keynes’s General Theory for the first time.    

Did I understand it?  Certainly not.  Was I captivated by it?  Certainly, though 

“captured” is a more appropriate word than “captivated.”  Does it remain relevant?  

Certainly.  Just a week ago I took it off the bookshelf to read parts of chapter 23, “Notes 

on Mercantilism, the Usury Laws, Stamped Money and Theories of Under-

Consumption.”  Today that chapter would be headed “Protectionism, the Zero Lower
