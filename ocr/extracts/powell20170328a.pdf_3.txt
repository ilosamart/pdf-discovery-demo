Before the Federal Reserve 

The question of how to structure our nation’s financial system arose in the early 

years of the republic.  In 1791, Congress created an institution known as the Bank of the 

United States, often considered a forerunner of the Federal Reserve.  The Bank was 

created in part to assist the federal government in its financial transactions, a typical 

responsibility of central banks at that time.  It was also designed to help America’s 

financial system meet the needs of a growing economy--the same purpose behind the 

founding of the Federal Reserve more than 100 years later.  The most famous proponent 

of the Bank was Alexander Hamilton, who has recently achieved the central banker’s 

dream of being the subject of a hit Broadway musical (figure 2). 

Congress gave the Bank of the United States unique powers--its notes were 

accepted for making payments to the federal government and it was the only bank able to 

branch across state lines (figure 3).  The Bank could affect the ebb and flow of credit 

around the country.2  People in different regions of the country came to have distinct 

views about the Bank.  Borrowers in the western areas--in those times, the West meant 

places like Ohio--desired cheap and abundant loans but were also wary of lenders.  These 

borrowers grew opposed to the power of the Bank in the credit market.  Northern 

business interests favored the Bank’s contribution to the country’s industrial 

development, but at times disagreed with actions taken by the Bank to constrain credit.  

Southern agriculturalists viewed the Bank with suspicion but supported its occasional 

                                                 
2 The Bank of the United States became a net creditor to state banks by holding the notes issued by those 
banks.  When it presented those notes for redemption, it could affect the funding position of state banks and 
effectively constrain credit in this manner.
