Conference (SLC), state tax revenues fell roughly 10 percent in 2009, similar to the 

average of all states.4

Medicaid spending is another source of pressure on state budgets.  The recession 

and the weak job market have swelled the rolls of Medicaid participants.  In 2009, 

caseloads were 11 percent above their 2007 level in the region represented by the SLC, 

again similar to the average in all states.  


With revenues down and Medicaid spending up, other categories of spending by 

state governments have been tightly squeezed.  Over the past year, numerous state 

governments have laid off or furloughed employees, decreased capital spending, and 

reduced aid to local governments.  Indeed, state and local payrolls have fallen by more 

than 200,000 jobs from their peak near the end of 2008.  Some states have also raised 

taxes, but the weak economy has made it difficult to find significant new revenues.   

Assistance from the federal government, especially through the fiscal stimulus 

package, has eased, but certainly not eliminated, the budget difficulties faced by states.  

Although states and localities will continue to receive significant aid this year, that source 

of help will be winding down next year. 

On a more positive note, state and local tax revenues seem set to increase as 

economic activity expands.  Indeed, 11 of the 15 states of the SLC reported earlier this 

year that they expect fiscal year 2011 revenues to be at least somewhat higher than the 

previous fiscal year.5
