currently report that the bulk of their loan modifications are being done outside of 

HAMP.  Again, we do not know enough about what those modifications look like or how 

they are being structured.   

 Prior to HAMP, many servicers were creating modifications that themselves were 

problematic.  For example, high percentages of the pre-HAMP modifications provided no 

payment relief to borrowers and, not surprisingly, then exhibited high re-default rates.  

Servicers may not be doing everything they can do to ensure that loss mitigation 

activities, including HAMP and non-HAMP modifications, are responsible and 

sustainable and subject to strong internal controls.  

  So the problems that have been grabbing headlines in recent weeks are neither 

new nor amenable to quick fixes.  While there may be some specific practices--“robo-

signing” among them--that are possible to isolate and eliminate, chronic, uncured 

problems continue to plague this industry.  There is a long track record of actions and 

cases brought by attorneys general, which some of you in this room have no doubt 

litigated, demonstrating the harm done to consumers by sloppy or unscrupulous practices. 

Because consumers cannot choose to hire or fire their servicers (other than by paying off 

the loan), the industry lacks the level of market discipline imposed in other industries by 

the working of consumer choice.  For this reason, if servicers do not actively maintain 

adequate and trained staff and do not establish and heed internal controls, if investors do 

not monitor their servicers’ behavior, if regulators do not conduct meaningful 

examinations, if courts do not stand guard against unfair practices, both substantive and 

procedural, then it will be much less likely that a well-functioning housing market will 

reemerge from this crisis.  Because the very structure of the loan servicing industry as it
