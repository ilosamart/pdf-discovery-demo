main steps.2  (1) The firms subject to DFAST provide the Federal Reserve with detailed, 

significantly standardized data on their loans, securities holdings, trading positions, counterparty 

exposures, revenue, expenses, and balance sheets.  (2) The Federal Reserve specifies 

hypothetical macroeconomic and financial market scenarios--including an “adverse” and a 

“severely adverse” scenario.  (3) The Federal Reserve inputs the data from the firms into its own 

supervisory models to project each firm’s losses, revenues, and capital over a nine-quarter 

planning horizon under the specified scenarios.  (4) The results of the exercise, including the 

capital positions of the firms following the hypothesized stress scenarios, are disclosed to the 

public. 

As DFAST has evolved, it has become an increasingly valuable tool for evaluating 

whether the largest financial firms are holding sufficient capital to continue providing credit in 

the event of significant macroeconomic and financial stress.  However, in itself DFAST does not 

set any capital ratios or limit any capital actions by the firms.  Those functions are implemented 

through the CCAR program, which was created through the regulatory process by the Federal 

Reserve.3  In CCAR, the Federal Reserve assesses the overall capital adequacy of the firms--

including evaluations of whether each firm’s capital provides an adequate buffer for the losses 

that would be incurred during the stress scenarios, whether its risk management and capital 

planning processes are appropriately well-developed and governed, and how its plans to 

distribute capital through dividends or share repurchases could affect its ability to remain a 

viable financial intermediary in the hypothesized scenarios.  Given how central these

www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.  As a formal matter, DFAST was 
implemented beginning in 2013.  However, in 2011 and 2012, the Federal Reserve conducted supervisory stress 
tests as part of its CCAR program, as explained later in the text.
