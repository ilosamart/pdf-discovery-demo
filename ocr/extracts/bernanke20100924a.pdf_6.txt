rethink economics and finance from the ground up, it did reveal important shortcomings 

in our understanding of certain aspects of the interaction of financial markets, institutions, 

and the economy as a whole, as I will discuss.  Certainly, the crisis should lead--indeed, it 

is already leading--to a greater focus on research related to financial instability and its 

implications for the broader economy. 

In the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on the implications of the crisis for 

what I have been calling economic science, that is, basic economic research and analysis.  

I will first provide a few examples of how economic principles and economic research, 

rather than having misled us, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the crisis 

and are informing the regulatory response.  However, the crisis did reveal some gaps in 

economists’ knowledge that should be remedied.  I will discuss some of these gaps and 

suggest possible directions for future research that could ultimately help us achieve 

greater financial and macroeconomic stability. 

How Economics Helped Us Understand and Respond to the Crisis 

 The financial crisis represented an enormously complex set of interactions--

indeed, a discussion of the triggers that touched off the crisis and the vulnerabilities in the 

financial system and in financial regulation that allowed the crisis to have such 

devastating effects could more than fill my time this afternoon.1

  The complexity of our 

financial system, and the resulting difficulty of predicting how developments in one 

financial market or institution may affect the system as a whole, presented formidable 

challenges.  But, at least in retrospect, economic principles and research were quite useful
