growth, core consumer prices, and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were 

to weaken, if market-based measures of inflation compensation were to fall appreciably 

further, or if survey-based measures were to begin to decline noticeably.   

Under normal circumstances, simple monetary policy rules, such as the one 

proposed by John Taylor, could help us decide when to raise the federal funds rate.3  

Even with core inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent objective, Taylor’s 

rule now calls for the federal funds rate to be well above zero if the unemployment rate is 

currently judged to be close to its normal longer-run level and the “normal” level of the 

real federal funds rate is currently close to its historical average.  But the prescription 

offered by the Taylor rule changes significantly if one instead assumes, as I do, that 

appreciable slack still remains in the labor market, and that the economy’s equilibrium 

real federal funds rate--that is, the real rate consistent with the economy achieving 

maximum employment and price stability over the medium term--is currently quite low 

by historical standards.4  Under assumptions that I consider more realistic under present 

circumstances, the same rules call for the federal funds rate to be close to zero.5

in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39, pp. 195-214.  For a 
discussion of policy rules in general, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust 
Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of 
Monetary Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego:  Elsevier), pp. 829-59.     
4 The equilibrium real rate is typically viewed as the level of the short-term interest rate, less inflation, 
estimated to be consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation in the long run, assuming no 
future disturbances to the economy.  Accordingly, the equilibrium real rate is usually thought of as 
independent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy, on the assumption that the 
influences of such disturbances on real activity and inflation fade away after a few years.  In the aftermath 
of the financial crisis, however, the U.S. economy has been subject to various adjustment processes that are 
unusually drawn out by historical standards, such as the ongoing repair of household balance sheets and 
other persistent headwinds.  These atypical processes imply that, in determining the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy over time, policymakers in the current environment need to take account of slow-moving 
influences on both aggregate demand and supply that were not important factors during previous tightening 
episodes.  For this reason, it is useful to think of the equilibrium real rate in present circumstances as not 
only time-varying but also having a predictable element that evolves over the medium term. 
5 For example, the Taylor rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 2) + 0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where R denotes the federal funds 
rate, RR* is the estimated value of the equilibrium real rate, π is the current inflation rate (usually measured
