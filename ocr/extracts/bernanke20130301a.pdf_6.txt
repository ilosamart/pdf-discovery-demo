nominal short-term rates.  However, because inflation adjusts slowly, control of nominal 

short-term rates usually translates into control of real short-term rates over the short and 

medium term.  In the longer term, real interest rates are determined primarily by 

nonmonetary factors, such as the expected return to capital investments, which in turn is 

closely related to the underlying strength of the economy.  The fact that market yields 

currently incorporate an expectation of very low short-term real interest rates over the 

next 10 years suggests that market participants anticipate persistently slow growth and, 

consequently, low real returns to investment.  In other words, the low level of expected 

real short rates may reflect not only investor expectations for a slow cyclical recovery but 

also some downgrading of longer-term growth prospects.

Chart 3, which displays yields on inflation-indexed, long-term government bonds 

for the same five countries represented in chart 1, shows that expected real yields over the 

longer term are low in other advanced industrial economies as well.  Note again the 

strong similarity in returns across these economies, suggesting once again the importance 

of common global factors.  While indexed yields spiked up around the end of 2008, 

reflecting market stresses at the height of the crisis that undercut the demand for these 

bonds, these effects dissipated in 2009.  Since that time, inflation-indexed yields have 

declined steadily and now stand below zero in each country.

  Apparently, low longer-

term real rate expectations are playing an important role in accounting for low 10-year 

nominal rates in other industrial countries, as well as in the United States.

 Between April 2009 and October 2012, expectations for average growth over the next 10 years, as 

reported in Consensus Forecasts, have fallen about 0.2 percentage points for the United States.  This 

reduction in growth expectations is a broad phenomenon:  Between April 2009 and October 2012, the 

average prediction for growth over the next 10 years for Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom 

has fallen between 0.1 and 0.6 percentage points.

 It is important to note that these indexed yields are likely being pushed down by term premiums akin to 

the term premiums in nominal rates discussed in this speech.
