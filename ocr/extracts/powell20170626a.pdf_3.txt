customers and shareholders.  But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large 

banking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth.   

Our objective should be to set capital and other prudential requirements for large banking 

firms at a level that protects financial stability and maximizes long-term, through-the-cycle credit 

availability and economic growth.  To accomplish that goal, it is essential that we protect the 

core elements of these reforms for our most systemic firms in capital and liquidity, stress testing 

and resolution.   

With that in mind, I will highlight five key areas of focus for regulatory reform.  The first 

is simplification and recalibation of regulation of small and medium-sized banks.  We are 

working to build on the relief we have provided in the areas of call reports and exam cycles, by 

developing a proposal to simplify the generally applicable capital framework that applies to 

community banking organizations.   

The second area is resolution plans.  The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation believe that it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will 

submissions from annual to once every two years, and focusing every other of these filings on 

key topics of interest and material changes from the prior full plan submission.  We are also 

considering other changes, as I discussed last week when testifying to Congress.   

Third, the Federal Reserve is reassessing whether the Volcker rule implementing 

regulation most efficiently achieves its policy objectives, and we look forward to working with 

the other four Volcker rule agencies to find ways to improve that regulation.  In our view, there 

is room for eliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation in ways that do not 

undermine the Volcker ruleâ€™s main policy goals.
