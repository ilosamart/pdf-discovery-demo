targeted microprudential and macroprudential tools should be used to address developing 

risks to financial stability, such as excessive credit growth.  Prudential tools can be 

structural or cyclical in nature.  Examples of structural prudential tools are measures to 

ensure adequate levels of capital and liquidity in the banking sector or to increase the 

resiliency of the financial infrastructure.  Examples of cyclical prudential tools include 

varying caps on loan-to-value ratios on mortgages, as Korea and Hong Kong have done; 

dynamic provisioning for losses by banks, as employed in Spain; time-varying margin 

and haircut rules; and countercyclical capital requirements, as have been set out in 

Basel III.  In principle, structural and cyclical prudential tools could both damp the 

buildup of imbalances and bolster the resilience of the financial sector to a decline in 

asset prices by increasing its capacity to absorb losses.  The diverse tools of financial 

regulation and supervision, together with appropriate monitoring of the financial system, 

should be, I believe, the first line of defense against the threat of financial instability.  

However, the effectiveness of such targeted policies in practice is not yet proven, so the 

possibility that monetary policy could be used directly to support financial stability goals, 

at least on the margin, should not be ruled out. 

Conclusion 

 The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 will leave a lasting imprint on the theory 

and practice of central banking.  With respect to monetary policy, the basic principles of 

flexible inflation targeting--the commitment to a medium-term inflation objective, the 

flexibility to address deviations from full employment, and an emphasis on 

communication and transparency--seem destined to survive.  However, following a much 

older tradition of central banking, the crisis has forcefully reminded us that the
