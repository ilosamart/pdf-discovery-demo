over the long run.  The deployment of any new financial technology must be undertaken 

with a thorough understanding and management of risks.   

Like many new financial technologies, distributed ledgers could ameliorate or 

exacerbate traditional financial risks.  What matters to us as policymakers and regulators 

is not only whether the migration to a new technological platform increases or reduces 

risks, but also whether risks are rendered more or less opaque, and how they are 

distributed among and between financial intermediaries and end users.  In the payments, 

clearing, and settlement arena, some important risk areas for consideration include 

settlement, operations, and cybersecurity, as well as money laundering and terrorist 

financing.  In managing risks, important considerations include system resiliency and 

governance as well as the role of licensing in ensuring proper oversight.  

In securities settlements, for example, a difference in timing between the delivery 

of securities and the delivery of funds introduces settlement risk between counterparties 

and other institutions involved in this process.  To the extent that distributed ledger 

technologies are designed to supplant the traditional reliance on trusted intermediaries to 

ensure settlement, they will need to reliably demonstrate their ability to mitigate or even 

eliminate settlement risk, especially in cases where the delivery of the securities and the 

associated payment take place on different platforms.   

Traditional payment, clearing, and settlement are subject to operational risk, and it 

is critically important that new technologies operate reliably, securely, and with integrity.  

The daily operation of markets and their clearing and settlement functions are built on 

trust and confidence.  Market participants trust that clearing and settlement functions and
