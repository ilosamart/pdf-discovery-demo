After the proposals had been out for a couple of months, a number of parties, including 

many community bankers, requested more time to analyze the proposals prior to submitting 

comment letters.  As a result, the agencies decided to extend the original 90-day comment period 

by an additional 45 days.6  Also in response to requests, in September, the agencies made 

available a tool to help community banking organizations and others estimate the potential 

impact of the capital proposals on their regulatory capital ratios.7 

 We received more than 2,000 comment letters during the consultative period, which we 

are in the process of posting to the Board’s public website.  Our staff is currently reviewing each 

and every one of those letters.  We take these comments very seriously, and we will be working 

with our colleagues at the OCC and FDIC to understand and analyze the many issues that have 

been raised.   

We heard many different concerns during our outreach efforts, but there were some 

recurring themes, including: the complexity of the proposed changes, the operational costs that 

would be incurred to track data that are not currently needed to calculate capital ratios, the 

potential impact on mortgage lending of the proposed mortgage risk weights, the accelerated 

phase-out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital, and the potential volatility in regulatory 

capital arising from the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.   

 It’s still far too early in the process to know where we and the other agencies are going to 

come out on these and other issues, or when final rules may be released.  But what I can promise 

you is that before we issue final capital rules, we will do everything possible to address the
