path, with the budget gap becoming increasingly large over time, unless the Congress 

enacts significant changes in fiscal programs. 

For example, under plausible assumptions about how fiscal policies might evolve 

in the absence of major legislative changes, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 

projects the deficit to fall from around 9 percent of GDP currently to roughly 5 percent of 

GDP by 2015, but then to rise to about 6-1/2 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.2  

After that, it projects the budget outlook to deteriorate even more rapidly, with federal 

debt held by the public reaching almost 90 percent of GDP by 2020 and 150 percent of 

GDP by 2030, up from about 60 percent at the end of fiscal year 2010.   

The long-term fiscal challenges confronting the nation are especially daunting 

because they are mostly the product of powerful underlying trends, not short-term or 

temporary factors.  The two most important driving forces for the federal budget are the 

aging of the U.S. population and rapidly rising health-care costs.  Indeed, the CBO 

projects that federal spending for health-care programs--which includes Medicare, 

Medicaid, and subsidies to purchase health insurance through new insurance exchanges--

will roughly double as a percentage of GDP over the next 25 years.3  The ability to 

control health-care costs, while still providing high-quality care to those who need it, will 

be critical for bringing the federal budget onto a sustainable path. 

The retirement of the baby-boom generation will also strain Social Security, as 

the number of workers paying taxes into the system rises more slowly than the number of 

                                                 
2 The so-called alternative fiscal policy scenario, which assumes, among other things, that most of the tax 
cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 are made permanent and that discretionary federal outlays rise at the same 
rate as GDP, is presented in Congressional Budget Office (2010), The Long-Term Budget Outlook 
(Washington:  CBO, June (revised August)), available at
