Thus, while the reductions in the unemployment rate through 2011 were roughly 

as forecast in early 2010, this improvement only came about with the FOMC providing a 

considerably higher level of accommodation than originally anticipated.   

This experience was essentially repeated the following year.  In April 2011, Blue 

Chip forecasters expected the unemployment rate to fall to 7.9 percent by the fourth 

quarter of 2012, with the FOMC expected to have already raised the federal funds rate to 

near 1 percent by mid-2012.14   

As it turned out, the unemployment rate forecast was once more remarkably 

accurate, but again this was associated with considerably more accommodation than 

anticipated.  In response to signs of slowing economic activity, in August 2011 the 

FOMC for the first time expressed its forward guidance in terms of the calendar, stating 

that conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at 

least through mid-2013. The following month, the Committee added to accommodation 

by adopting a new balance sheet policy known as the maturity extension program. 15  

Thus, in both 2011 and 2012, the unemployment rate actually declined by about 

as much as had been forecast the previous year, but only after unexpected weakness 

prompted additional accommodative steps by the Federal Reserve.  In both cases, I 

believe that the FOMC’s decision to respond to signs of weakness with significant 

additional accommodation played an important role in helping to keep the projected labor
