In some ways there has been little change since the first edition of the “Come with Me” 

speech was given more than four decades ago:  Members of the Board of Governors and 

presidents of the 12 Reserve Banks still meet regularly in Washington, D.C., to discuss how best 

to set monetary policy to foster full employment and stable prices.  But the ways in which these 

policymakers think and talk about the economic outlook, the formulation of monetary policy, 

and the communication of that policy have all changed dramatically, especially lately.   

 So without further ado, I’d like to invite you to come with me to the FOMC.  We’ll start 

with a recent meeting and I will try to point out the things that have changed within the meetings 

themselves since previous speeches.   

As we enter the room, you will notice a large oval table, big enough to seat about 25 

people.  Chairman Bernanke sits at the center of the table.  Members of the Board of Governors 

sit to his left, beginning with the Vice Chair and then continuing in order of seniority.  On the 

Chairman’s right is the deputy secretary of the Committee, next to whom sits the president of the 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The other Reserve Bank presidents are arrayed around the 

ends of the table, and staff who will be presenting sit on the side of the table opposite the 

Chairman.  The voting members of the Committee include all the members of the Board of 

Governors, seven in all when we have a full Board, the New York Fed president, and four of the 

other presidents on a rotating basis.  But you won’t be able to tell the difference between voters 

and nonvoters in any of the discussions because everyone participates equally in the meeting 

until the vote is taken.  Incidentally, as I read the 1967 version of this speech, I noted that it 

referred to the 19 men on the Committee.  The first woman joined the FOMC in 1978.  I am 

proud to say that at our next meeting, there will be four women on the Committee.
