I am very pleased that the American Economic Association (AEA) and the 

Federal Reserve Board have organized this conference on an important issue for our 

profession.   

In trying to raise awareness of diversity in the economics profession, I am aided 

by the fact that economists are well acquainted with the concept of diversity from their 

work.  When conducting a survey, economists understand that the results will be more 

meaningful when the diversity of the sample approaches the diversity of the population 

being studied.  In finance, we know that diversity is fundamentally important in 

spreading risk.  History shows that economies develop and become more stable through 

diversification.  Often, in the things economists study and the methods we use, diversity 

is a good thing.   

To cite another example, research by economists and other social scientists 

supports the view that considering a diversity of perspectives and ideas leads to better 

decisions in an organization.  I believe decisions by the Federal Reserve Board and the 

Federal Open Market Committee are better because of the range of views and 

perspectives brought to the table by my fellow policymakers, and I have encouraged this 

approach to decisionmaking at all levels and throughout the Fed System.    

One way to promote diversity of ideas is to promote diversity among the people 

we rely on for those ideas, including more than 300 Ph.D. economists who serve at the 

Board and more than 400 serving at the Fedâ€™s 12 Reserve Banks.  At the Board, our 

Office of Diversity and Inclusion coordinates this effort, but everyone involved in the 

recruiting, hiring, management, and promotion of economists is engaged in it as well.
