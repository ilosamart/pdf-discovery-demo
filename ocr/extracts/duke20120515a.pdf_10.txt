Responses confirmed that lenders today are less likely--and often much less likely--to 

originate loans to GSE borrowers with credit scores of 620 even when borrowers were 

making down payments of 20 percent.  In fact, the only category of borrower to have 

experienced no net reduction in reported credit availability was the category with the 

highest credit profile asked about in the survey--those with down payments of 20 percent 

and credit scores of 720. 

Lenders who responded in the April SLOOS that they were less likely to originate 

loans were asked to identify the reasons why.  About 80 percent of the respondents 

reported greater borrower difficulty in obtaining affordable private mortgage insurance, a 

less favorable economic outlook, or the outlook for home prices as being at least 

somewhat important.  But policy concerns played a role as well.  In an indication that 

delinquency risk is now considered in addition to the risk of credit loss, more than half 

the respondents cited risks associated with loans becoming delinquent as being at least 

somewhat important--in particular, higher servicing costs of past due loans or the risk that 

GSEs would require banks to repurchase delinquent loans (known as putback risk). 

The ability of the GSEs to put back loans when lenders have misrepresented their 

riskiness helps protect taxpayers from losses; however, if lenders perceive that minor 

errors can result in significant losses from putback loans, they may respond by being 

more conservative in originating those loans.  In its recently released strategic plan, the 

Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 

has identified the use of standardized data as a strategy for improving risk management 

for the GSEs while reducing repurchase risk for lenders.  If technology and data 

standardization can be used to enhance quality control reviews at the time of purchase
