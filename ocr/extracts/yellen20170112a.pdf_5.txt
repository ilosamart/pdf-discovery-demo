FedEd also sponsors several speaker events a year that bring students into this Board 

Room.  Students recently heard a presentation from Scott Alvarez, who oversees the 

Board’s Legal Division, and, in February, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will speak to 

students at another event.  FedEd is overseen by two research assistants, Caroline Shinkle 

and Jamie Lenney, along with Karen Pence, who is an economist at the Board.  All three 

are with us this evening and prepared to answer further questions about the program. 

Online resources for teachers can be found on the Board’s website at 

federalreserve.gov, and additional resources available throughout the System are at 

federalreserveeducation.org.  The websites include videos in which policymakers and the 

staff describe the Fed’s functions.  Also, the sites include historical materials and a 

wealth of information related to the financial crisis and the Fed’s response.      

Let me leave it there, and again thank teachers for participating in this town hall, 

and offer my thanks, on behalf of the Board of Governors, for the valuable work you do 

every day.  I would be very happy to respond to your questions.
