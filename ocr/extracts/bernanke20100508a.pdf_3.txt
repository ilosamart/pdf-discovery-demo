important to facilitate the pursuit of happiness, maybe we should think a bit about what 

that means in practice. 

 In exploring the question, researchers have distinguished between two related, but 

different, concepts--“happiness” and “life satisfaction.”  They use “happiness” to mean a 

short-term state of mind that may depend on a person’s temperament, but also on external 

factors, such as whether it is a sunny or rainy day.  They use “life satisfaction” to refer to 

a longer-term state of contentment and well-being.1  The relationship between life 

satisfaction and happiness, and the factors contributing to each, is not always 

straightforward.  I’ll come back to this issue later. 

As you might guess, when thinking about the sources of psychological well-

being, economists have tended to focus on the material things of life.  This proclivity is 

why economic policymakers often emphasize the promotion of economic growth.  The 

richer a country is, the higher the material standard of living of its average person.  What 

applies to a country applies to individuals:  Higher income equals a higher standard of 

living, which most people desire.  

This traditional economist’s perspective on happiness is not as narrow and 

Scrooge-y as you might think at first.  If I were to ask you what you value in life besides 

goods and services--a nice car or house, for example--you might begin with, say, your 

health.  Well, richer countries have more resources to devote to medical care, to good 

nutrition and sanitation, and to workplace safety, and for these and other reasons rich 

countries have higher life expectancies, lower infant mortality rates, and generally better 

                                                      
1 Traditionally, when economists talk about happiness or satisfaction, they use a technical term, “utility,” 
whose central role in both economics and philosophy goes back to the time of Thomas Jefferson--in 
particular, to the introduction of the “utilitarian” approach in philosophy associated with Jeremy Bentham, 
an approach that has had a strong influence on economics.
