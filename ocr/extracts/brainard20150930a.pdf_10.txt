unsecured consumer debt.  As the percentage of unsecured consumer debt outstanding 

held by community banks has been declining in recent years, several banks have 

partnered with online alternative lenders to grow and diversify their portfolios of 

unsecured consumer debt.16 

In contrast to the consumer loan activity, the small business partnerships that have 

developed so far are largely fee-based referral partnerships.  In these partnerships, banks 

refer to online alternative lenders some of their small business customers who are usually 

seeking loan amounts that the referring banks may see as too costly to underwrite and 

service, particularly in the size range below $100,000.17  For example, in 2014, OnDeck 

announced small business loan referral partnerships with BBVA Compass and with the 

ProfitStars Lending Network, part of the Independent Community Bankers of America 

Preferred Service Provider program.  

Another type of partnership that has been announced recently involves alternative 

online lenders and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that seek to 

provide loans to low-income and underserved borrowers and neighborhoods.  These 

partnerships may enable the CDFI to use the online lender’s technology platform at no 

                                                 
16 In 1994, banks and thrifts with less than $10 billion in assets held about 69 percent of U.S. consumer 

loans, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by SNL Financial.  That share dropped to 19 percent in 

2004 and 9 percent in 2014 (Tracy, 2015).  Recently, BancAlliance, a consortium of approximately 200 

community banks, has partnered with Lending Club to purchase consumer loans originated on Lending 

Club’s platform and the Western Independent Bankers, a consortium of more than 160 independent and 

community banks, have entered into a partnership with Prosper to encourage member banks to use 

Prosper’s platform to facilitate consumer loans for their customers.  Also, Lending Club and Citi 

Community Capital, the community development lending and investing division of CitiGroup, recently 

announced a partnership to facilitate up to $150 million in consumer loans designed to provide more 

affordable credit to underserved, lower-income borrowers in low- and moderate-income communities.  
17 As an indication of the demand for small dollar loans on the part of small businesses, the Joint Small 

Business Credit Survey conducted in 2014 by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, 

and Philadelphia found that more than one-half of small business loan applicants sought $100,000 or less in 

credit.  (For more information, the survey report is available at www.newyorkfed.org/smallbusiness/SBCS-
