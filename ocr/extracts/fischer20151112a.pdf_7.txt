1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this year through this import price channel.  Thus, given that 

core PCE inflation is running around 1-1/4 percent on a four-quarter-change basis, the 

stronger dollar has played a material role in holding core PCE inflation below 2 percent.   

A second channel through which dollar appreciation reduces inflation is by 

increasing economic slack.  Greater slack amplifies the downward pressure on inflation, 

although the quantitative effect is probably fairly modest given the flat slope of the 

Phillips curve.  Because the pass-through of dollar appreciation to oil and food 

commodity prices is much higher than for most imports, dollar appreciation tends to 

depress overall PCE inflation by even more than it depresses core inflation.    

An important difference between the transmission of dollar appreciation to 

inflation compared with output is that the effects on inflation are probably more transient.  

In particular, given that most of the effect on inflation occurs through changes in import 

prices--and import prices respond quickly to the exchange rate--the peak effect on 

inflation probably occurs within a few quarters.  From the standpoint of the outlook, this 

transience means that some of the forces holding down inflation in 2015--particularly 

those due to a stronger dollar and lower energy prices--will begin to fade next year.  

Consequently, overall PCE inflation is likely on this account alone to rebound next year 

to around 1Â½ percent.  And as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, both 

core and overall inflation are likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium 

term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy 

and import prices dissipate.
