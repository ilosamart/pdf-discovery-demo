policy affects the global economy and how foreign economic events affect U.S. monetary 

policy.  Given the importance of the United States in international trade and in the global 

financial system, the monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve influence the global 

economy through a wide range of trade and financial channels.  As I will discuss, each 

foreign economy may be affected quite differently by U.S. monetary policy actions, and 

each may view spillovers from U.S. monetary policy as desirable or undesirable.  Even 

so, I am reasonably confident that the spillovers from ongoing U.S. monetary policy 

normalization will generally prove manageable for foreign economies.1   

While most of my discussion will focus on monetary policy spillovers, I will 

begin by underscoring a different aspect of the interconnectedness of the U.S. economy--

namely, how foreign developments have an important influence on U.S. output and 

inflation, and hence on the conduct of U.S. monetary policy.  

How Foreign Developments Influence U.S. Monetary Policy 

The U.S. economy is affected significantly by foreign developments through both 

trade and financial channels.  Given that about one-eighth of the goods and services 

produced in the United States are exported, a sizable component of U.S. aggregate 

demand depends on foreign consumption and investment decisions, and hence ultimately 

on the economic health of foreign economies.  The high degree of interconnectedness 

between domestic and foreign financial intermediaries--banks, the nonbank financial 

sector, and insurers, among others--means that developments in foreign financial markets
