In Europe, the recovery has proven to be increasingly resilient.  Monetary policy 

has continued to provide crucial support.  As a result, several challenges--including 

referendums in the United Kingdom and Italy and liquidity and capital stresses faced by 

German and Italian banks--have so far been navigated without significant damage to 

growth, financial stability, or inflation expectations.  Fiscal policy has ceased being a 

drag on demand growth and, in some cases, has turned moderately expansionary.  Overall 

euro-area GDP increased at an annual rate of 1-3/4 percent last year, sufficiently in 

excess of potential output growth to bring the unemployment rate down nearly 1 

percentage point.  Despite some instances of heightened volatility, financial markets have 

functioned reasonably well, and risk spreads have stayed contained, although uncertainty 

about upcoming elections has likely led to some increase in French and Italian sovereign 

spreads in recent months.  Fears of disinflation also appear to have abated:  Measures of 

inflation compensation based on 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation swaps, which fell to 1-1/4 

percent in the middle of last year, have recently moved up to 1-3/4 percent. 

Activity in Japan has also picked up recently, with GDP increasing 1-1/2 percent 

last year--noticeably above the estimated rate of potential growth--and the unemployment 

rate declining 1/4 percentage point to 3 percent, as monetary policy has remained 

supportive. 

Of course, concerns regarding the medium to longer run remain.  In China, the 

price of near-term stability has been an increase in leverage, particularly in the corporate 

sector.  China’s overall debt-GDP ratio is elevated for an emerging market economy, 

especially considering that Chinese growth is likely to slow noticeably in coming years.  

In Japan, core consumer price inflation is close to zero--well below the central bank’s 2
