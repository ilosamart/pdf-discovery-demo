First, effective rules must be transparent.  By shining a light on the problem and 

the range of feasible solutions, transparent policy rules clarify the budget choices that 

must be made, help the public understand those choices, and encourage policymakers to 

recognize the broader fiscal consequences of their decisions on individual programs.  In 

particular, transparent fiscal rules may help solve what economists refer to as a collective 

action problem.  When faced with spending decisions, most elected representatives want 

to be seen as garnering the greatest possible benefit for their constituents.  But if a prior 

agreement limits the size of the available pie, it may be easier to negotiate outcomes in 

which everyone accepts a little bit less.  Of course, transparency is enhanced by good 

watchdogs.  In the United States, the nonpartisan CBO has ably served that role since 

1974.  Nongovernmental organizations that focus on budget issues, such as nonprofit 

think tanks, can also promote transparency. 

  Second, an effective rule must be sufficiently ambitious to address the underlying 

problem.  As I mentioned, PAYGO rules, even when effective, were designed only to 

avoid making the fiscal situation worse; they did not attack large and growing structural 

deficits.  In the current U.S. context, we should consider adopting a rule, or at least a 

clearly articulated plan, consistent with achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.  

Admittedly, an important difficulty with developing rules for long-term fiscal 

sustainability in the United States is that, given the importance of health-care spending in 

the federal budget, the CBO would need to forecast health-care costs and the potential 

effects of alternative policy measures on those costs well into the future.  Such 

forecasting is very difficult.  However, any plan to address long-term U.S. fiscal issues,
