and, like Chairman Bernanke, expressed my hope that more research would be dedicated 

to finding answers to these important questions.   

I hope that the work that has been gathered and will be presented and discussed at 

this conference--as well as the research it may inspire--will further this worthy goal.  In 

carrying out its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve serves the public in a number of 

different ways, and I believe an important contribution comes via the Fed’s role as a 

research institution.  Separate from the work that directly supports the Fed’s decisions on 

monetary policy and financial oversight, Fed economists and other researchers in 

Washington and at each of the 12 Reserve Banks are engaged in a broad array of 

independent academic research aimed at adding to the general knowledge and 

understanding of the economy.   

Each year, Fed staff members publish hundreds of papers and others forms of 

research, sometimes in collaboration with scholars from universities and other 

institutions, all of it available for use by the research community and on view to the 

public.  Conferences play an integral role in promoting the Federal Reserve’s research 

mission as well.  This biennial community development research conference, organized 

by community development officials from across the Federal Reserve System, serves to 

encourage high-quality research and also helps bridge the gap between community 

development research, policy, and practice.   

In my brief remarks, I would like to mention a few aspects of economic mobility 

that I think are particularly important and worthy of further research, with the hope of 

stimulating the conversation that will take place here over the next couple of days.  This
