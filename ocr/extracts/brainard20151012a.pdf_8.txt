annual rate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first part of the year, and 

the most recent trade data suggest another substantial subtraction in the third quarter.   

More recently, weakness in foreign demand has extended to emerging market 

economies, which now account for about half of world output and have been an 

important source of growth for more than the past decade.  Growing recognition of this 

weakness pushed the dollar up further to 15 percent above its level last summer, and has 

contributed to a more general tightening of financial conditions in the past few months.   

Much of the focus has been on China, whose large size and double-digit growth 

rate put it at the center of a powerful global commodity super-cycle over the past decade.  

Consequently, the challenges China faces today are raising questions about emerging 

market growth prospects more broadly.  Most immediately, Chinaâ€™s buildup of past 

property, and more-recent stock market, bubbles together with a steep run-up in business 

debt levels and questions about the policy stance and the outlook have raised concerns 

about downside risks.  

In weighing the implications for the U.S. outlook, it would be misleading to focus 

narrowly on the direct effect of U.S.-Chinese bilateral trade alone.  Many commodity-

exporting countries that have depended heavily on Chinese demand are adjusting with 

difficulty to the recent sharp commodity price declines.  After increasing at an average 

rate of nearly 5-1/2 percent over the period from 2003 through 2011, GDP growth in 

emerging market commodity exporters is projected to be only 3-1/2 percent this year.  

Projected growth going forward has also been marked down materially.  Moreover, more 

developed economies, such as Mexico and Canada, our most important trading partners,
