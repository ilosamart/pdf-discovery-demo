Figure 1.  Bilateral and Centrally Cleared Networks 



Bilaterally Cleared Network    Centrally Cleared Network  
 


Note:  The figure on the left shows a bilateral network in the credit default swap (CDS) market for a single and highly traded CDS contract.  The figure on the right shows the 

hypothetical network that would exist if the contract were cleared through a single central counterparty.  In each figure, a red circle denotes a protection seller and a blue one 

denotes a protection buyer.  The size of the circle represents the amount of protection bought or sold.
