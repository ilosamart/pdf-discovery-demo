market.  Federal Reserve staff analysis of the TRACE data reveals that nearly three-

fourths of total trading volume of bills is in the DTC market, where dealers are, of course, 

the main intermediary.  From this and other analysis, there is substantial evidence that the 

dealer business model plays a central role in this market and will continue to do so into 

the future.10 

That said, proprietary trading firms do occupy an important space in the Treasury 

market alongside dealers, and it is clear that they, too, are here to stay.  When it comes to 

areas where speed is paramount--for instance, in trading across and between asset classes 

and trading venues--proprietary trading firms are deploying technology and infrastructure 

in ways that are having lasting effects.  This is evident in the Treasury market in the 

intervals following economic data releases.  Again turning to the TRACE data, we see in 

figure 4 a depiction of average trading volumes of all Treasury securities across five-

minute intervals on days in which the Employment Situation report, gross domestic 

product data, or consumer price index data are announced.  The TRACE volume data 

indicate that the immediate surge in trading activity following these announcements 

occurs mainly in the electronic IDB venue, where proprietary trading firms dominate. 

In short, the TRACE data are enabling us to put some old puzzles to rest.  Our 

analysis makes clear that the Treasury market has adapted well to the post-crisis 

regulatory regime, the normalization of monetary policy, and technological changes in 

trading processes, and that both broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms play 

important, often complementary, roles in the market structure that has emerged.
