consumers’ options to have their names removed from prescreened lists; this option is 
called the right to “opt out.” 

The statute also details the required procedures concerning consumers’ opt-out rights. It 
specifies the ways that consumers may notify CRAs of their intention to opt out, the 
agencies’ required responses to opt-out notices received from consumers, necessary 
timing for acting on opt-out notices from consumers, the duration of opt-out notices from 
consumers, and necessary components of the notification system itself (for example, toll-
free telephone availability). Equally important are the requirements that the existence of 
the system be disclosed to consumers, but these mandates are found later, in section 615 
of the law. 

A consumer may notify the agency through a system maintained by the agency (which, as 
indicated, must include a toll-free telephone number) or by submitting a signed “notice of 
election” form issued by the agency. Under provisions of the FCRA that go into effect 
on December 1, 2004, requests made through the telephone notification system 
maintained by the agency expire five years after notification unless the consumer revokes 
the election.10 Requests made through a signed notice-of-election form never expire, 
although they may be revoked by the consumer. When a consumer contacts an agency 
through the notification system, the agency must inform the consumer that the election is 
effective for only five years if the consumer does not submit to the agency a signed 
notice-of-election form issued by the agency. The agency also must provide to the 
consumer a notice-of-election form upon request of the consumer.11 

Section 615(d) of the FCRA specifies the details of the required notice to consumers 
regarding their right to opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations. Conversations with 
officials of the CRAs indicate that their companies monitor compliance by clients who 
use their credit files for prescreening activities. 

Under the FCRA, any person who uses a consumer report in connection with a 
prescreened solicitation must, with each written prescreened solicitation, provide to the 
consumer, a clear and conspicuous statement that (1) information contained in the 
consumer report was used in connection with the offer; (2) the consumer received the 
offer because he or she satisfied the criteria for creditworthiness or insurability used to 
screen for the offer; (3) if applicable, the credit or insurance may not be extended if, after 
the consumer responds, it is determined that the consumer does not meet the criteria used 

10 Requests made through the telephone notification system before December 1, 2004, expire two years 
after notification unless the consumer revokes the election. 

11 Although opting out eliminates future solicitations based on credit-record information, consumers 
may still receive other types of mail solicitations (not prescreened) from creditors and insurers. In addition, 
consumers may receive advertisements and solicitations (not prescreened) from, for example, local and 
national merchants, religious and charitable organizations, professional and alumni associations, and 
political candidates and parties. To avoid mail from these sources, the consumer would need to contact 
them directly or rely on voluntary, private-sector “do not mail” lists, such as the one maintained by the 
Direct Marketing Association (discussed in more detail below).
