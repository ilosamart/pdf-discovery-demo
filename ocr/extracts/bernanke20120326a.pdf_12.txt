as inadequate skills or mismatches between the types of skills that workers have and the 

skills that employers demand.  If this view is correct, then high levels of long-term 

unemployment could persist for quite a while, even after the economy has more fully 

recovered.  And it appears true that over the past two decades or so, structural factors 

have been responsible for some increase in long-term unemployment.  For example, 

because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer to find a new job than 

does a younger worker in the same situation, the aging of the baby boom generation has 

probably contributed to a gradual rise in long-term unemployment.  Factors such as 

globalization, technological change, and the loss of lower-skill manufacturing jobs have 

likely reduced the employability and earnings potential of some groups of workers.  To 

the extent that higher rates of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, result 

from structural factors, the scope for countercyclical policies to reduce unemployment 

would be impaired, and the benefits of a more complete economic recovery for many 

workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited. 

However, although structural shifts are no doubt important in the longer term, my 

reading of the research is that, at most, a modest portion of the recent sharp increase in 

long-term unemployment is due to persistent structural factors.

  Consider, for example, 

rates of job finding by those unemployed for varying amounts of time (figure 13).  

Unsurprisingly, the rate at which the long-term unemployed find work is lower than that 

of those who have been unemployed for only a short time; on average over the period 

from 1994 to 2007, a bit more than one-third of those already unemployed for one to four 

weeks found employment within the next month.  In contrast, over that same period, only
