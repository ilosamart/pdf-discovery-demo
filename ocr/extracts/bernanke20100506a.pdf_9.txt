already in the survey.  We also helped the National Federation of Independent Business 

(NFIB) develop a special survey of small business owners on their access to credit.  

Consistent with anecdotes and with our discussions with banks and businesses, the survey 

results confirm that financing conditions are difficult for small businesses and that 

declining real estate values are contributing to the difficulties. 

Although bank credit remains tight, I see some reasons for optimism.  Economic 

activity has continued to strengthen.  And senior loan officers tell us that, at least outside 

of commercial real estate, they anticipate a modest reduction in their troubled loans over 

the coming year.  As a result, bank attitudes toward lending may be shifting.  In the 

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in April, most banks reported unchanged 

lending standards over the previous three months.  For the first time since the crisis began 

in the summer of 2007, banks reported no net tightening of lending standards for small 

businesses.3 

Lessons for Future Supervision and Regulation 

Although the financial crisis has eased, we must persevere in efforts to respond to 

the lessons the crisis has taught.  The Federal Reserve supports ongoing efforts in the 

Congress to reform financial regulation and close existing gaps in the regulatory 

framework.  The new framework should include enhanced consolidated supervision of 

bank holding companies and similar supervision for systemically important nonbank 

financial firms.  We also need a strong resolution framework that allows policymakers to 

wind down failing, systemically important financial institutions without a destabilizing 

bankruptcy and without a taxpayer bailout.
