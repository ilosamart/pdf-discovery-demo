money market funds as one example.  Although many broker-dealers are parts of bank holding 

companies, the breadth and significance of the repo market suggest that it may be another.7   

Just as important as dealing with systemic risks that might be posed by vestiges of the 

pre-crisis shadow banking system is the ability to monitor and, where necessary provide 

oversight for, the new conduits that are almost surely to develop in the future.  In fact, it may be 

useful to require some systematic and standardized reporting by some classes of nonbank-

affiliated firms, even without a designation under section 113. 

With respect to both old and new channels, there is an important and growing academic 

literature on various aspects of the shadow banking system.  There is now a formal exercise 

sponsored by the Financial Stability Board to identify policy approaches and options for ensuring 

that the shadow banking system does not again grow so as to pose a threat to financial stability.  

My hope is that these sources will serve as a catalyst for more active policy discussion and, 

eventually, action.  In the absence of appropriate regulatory, and possibly legislative, action, the 

section 113 designation tool will inevitably bear more of the weight in policies crafted to contain 

systemic risk.    

The second issue to which I would draw your attention is the absence of a deep body of 

analytic work on which to form judgments about the social utility of very large, complex 

financial institutions.  This issue surfaced during the debates over financial reform in 2009 and 

early 2010, when some argued that the only way to counteract TBTF and its attendant risks for 

society was to break up these institutions.  Advocates of this approach asserted that there was 

little or no academic support for the proposition that the largest firms needed to be their current 

size in order to provide whatever efficiencies were achievable.  While this is true enough, it is 

obviously the case that the failure to find such efficiencies does not mean they do not exist.
