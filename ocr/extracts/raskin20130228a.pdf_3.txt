dollars; left millions of Americans bankrupted, jobless, underemployed, or homeless; triggered 

massive litigation; and shook the confidence of our nation to the core.  

Many of the darkest manifestations of the financial crisis have finally begun to diminish:  

the boarded-up homes with overgrown lawns, the half-built skyscrapers, the “We Buy Houses 

Cheap” signs planted at exit ramps, the eviction notices nailed to front doors.  But even as the 

economy comes back to life, our memory of these events is still sharp and the reputational 

damage suffered by U.S. financial institutions during the crisis endures.  To be blunt, a lot of 

people have negative feelings about banks, which they distrust and blame for the huge infusions 

of taxpayer money into the financial system that were deemed necessary during the crisis.   

These reputational consequences--whether justified or not--are to be expected.  

Sociologists and economists have long remarked upon the central role that social trust plays in 

healthy markets.  Market transactions depend on a whole series of assumptions that people must 

be able to rely on, including the soundness of money, the enforceability of contracts, the good 

will of their partners, the integrity of the legal system, and the common meanings of language.  

Social trust is the glue that holds markets and societies together.  In the context of banking, 

social trust and reputation are related concepts.   

Banks themselves--in crisis or not--are particularly vulnerable to reputational 

consequences because of their public role.  The principal social value of financial institutions is 

their ability to facilitate the efficient deployment of funds held by investors (and entities that 

pool these funds) to productive uses.
