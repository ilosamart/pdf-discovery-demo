I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to a group that has such a long and 

distinguished record in identifying and addressing crucial issues affecting the 

governments of the city and state of New York.  I will focus this evening on a top 

challenge not only for New York, but also for states and localities across the nation--

namely, the imperative of achieving fiscal sustainability in both the short and the long 

term.  I will first discuss the fiscal pressures currently confronting states and localities, 

then turn to longer-term challenges and opportunities faced by these jurisdictions. 

Recent State and Local Fiscal Developments 

  As you know well, the deep recession of 2008 through 2009 and the subsequent 

slow recovery have battered state and local budgets.  As the recession took hold, revenues 

dropped precipitously, especially at the state level.  Driven partly by balanced-budget 

requirements under their constitutions, many governments have responded by cutting 

numerous programs and reducing workforces.  As necessary as these cuts may have been, 

they have left some jurisdictions struggling to maintain essential services.  The fiscal 

problems of state and local governments have also had national implications, as their 

spending cuts and tax increases have been a headwind on the economic recovery.  

Moreover, concerns about both the current fiscal condition of these governments and 

their longer-term commitments to provide pensions and health benefits have recently led 

to strains in municipal bond markets. 

The recessionâ€™s effects on state governments have been substantial.  In calendar 

year 2009, state tax revenues were about 12 percent lower than they had been in 2008; 

declines in wages, salaries, capital gains, and profits reduced income tax revenues, and 

sales tax collections dropped along with household and business spending.  Reflecting
