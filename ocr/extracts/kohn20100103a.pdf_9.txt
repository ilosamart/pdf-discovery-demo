Reserve.  And we can sell portions of our holdings of MBS, agency debt, and Treasury 

securities if we determine that doing so is an appropriate approach to tightening financial 

conditions when the time comes.   

 Second, the fiscal situation will not impede timely tightening.  The trajectory of 

the federal budget is a serious economic issue that must be addressed to promote 

sustained and balanced economic growth.  But a large and growing federal deficit will 

not stop the Federal Reserve from exiting from current policies when thatâ€™s needed to 

keep prices stable and the economy on a path to sustained high employment.  The 

alternative of letting inflation rise would be inconsistent with our mandate and would 

only cause greater volatility, uncertainty, and inefficiencies that would reduce the growth 

of our economy over time.  Higher interest rates could complicate an already difficult 

fiscal trajectory, and this possibility further underscores the critical importance of 

maintaining Federal Reserve independence from short-term political pressures.   

 Third, because monetary policy typically acts with long lags on the economy and 

price level, the choice of when and how to exit will depend on forecasts.  We will need to 

begin withdrawing extraordinary monetary stimulus well before the economy returns to 

high levels of resource utilization.  The FOMC has been clear that its expectations for the 

stance of monetary policy depend on economic conditions, including resource utilization, 

inflation, and inflation expectations.  Accordingly, the judgment as to when to begin 

initiating steps to withdraw stimulus will depend on the outlook for these variables.   

 Finally, it is well to remember that we are still in uncharted waters.  We do not 

have any recent experience with financial disruptions of the breadth, persistence, and 

consequences of those that we have experienced over the past several years.  And we
