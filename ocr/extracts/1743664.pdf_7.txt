ment and multi-family construction and the dampening effect on State 

and local government spending from the problems of New York State 

and New York City.

Perhaps it would be well if I stopped here because I have 

given you the picture as I see it for the coming year. But you have 

asked me for a blueprint and blueprints require a more specific 

isolation of problems and potential solutions to those problems. 

Therefore, I intend to pursue this to some degree, isolating some of 

the principal uncertainties facing the United States as well as 

some of the potential remedies to those uncertainties. In the field 

of economics it seems to me the principal uncertainties lie in the 

problem of restinulating capital spending. This can be done, of 

course, by providing greater certainty in the field of prospective 

capital returns and profits, by stabilizing the effects of future wage 

increases and inflationary problems and by demonstrating the need for 

that new capacity at levels which would be sufficient to justify con­

struction. The overhang of apartments, condominiums and office 

buildings is a problem which is likely to be resolved only with 

sufficient time to complete many of those projects and allow the demand 

for space to absorb present vacancies.

The relative rates of growth in the United States versus 

other countries will have an important bearing upon the rate of exchange
