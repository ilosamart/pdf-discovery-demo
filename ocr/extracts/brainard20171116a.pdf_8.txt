so decided not to purchase an item as a result.25  In addition, 41 percent of smartphone owners 

checked product reviews or searched product information online while shopping in a retail store, 

and 79 percent of those respondents reported changing their purchase decision based on the 

information they accessed on their smartphone.26  

And those use cases just scratch the surface of what is possible. First of all, the 

smartphone platform has become a launch pad for a whole ecosystem of apps created by outside 

developers for a wide variety of services, including helping consumers manage their financial 

lives.  

 Second, the smartphone ecosystem puts the enormous computing power of the cloud at 

the fingertips of consumers. Interfacing with smartphone platforms and other apps, outside 

developers can tap the computing power of the leading cloud computing providers in building 

their apps.  Importantly, cloud computing offers not only the power to process and store data, but 

also powerful algorithms to make sense of it.  Due to early commitment to open-source 

principles, app developers have open access to many of the same machine-learning and artificial 

intelligence tools that power the world’s largest internet companies.27  Further, the major cloud 

computing providers have now taken these free building blocks and created different machine-

learning and artificial intelligence stacks on their cloud platforms.  A developer that wants to 

incorporate artificial intelligence into their financial management app can access off-the-shelf
