Standing in front of this audience I feel secure in observing that we are all 

macroprudentialists now.  The imperative of fashioning a regulatory regime that focuses on the 

financial system as a whole, and not just the well-being of individual firms, is now quite broadly 

accepted.  Indeed, the two entities co-sponsoring this conference were themselves created by the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which reoriented financial 

regulation toward safeguarding financial stability by containing systemic risk--an aim that may 

not define all of macroprudential policy, but surely rests at its center. 

  But beneath the high-level consensus for a macroprudential orientation lies a broad range 

of substantive views, as well as a host of analytic and practical questions, which form the subject 

of this conference and many like it.  Experience with macroprudential policy measures in various 

countries is not extensive and may, in any case, have only limited applicability elsewhere 

because of differences in economic conditions, the relative importance of capital market and 

traditional bank intermediation, and many other factors.  And there is sometimes a tendency to 

overlook the significance of institutional and legal considerations in fashioning and comparing 

macroprudential policies.  If macroprudential policy is to be more than a catchphrase, 

policymakers must confront these considerations in specifying how a macroprudential 

perspective will inform financial regulation. 

 Today I would like to suggest some specific macroprudential objectives that I regard as 

both realistic and important to incorporate into a near- to medium-term policy agenda:  first, 

continuing the task of ensuring that very large, complex financial institutions do not threaten 

financial stability; second, developing policies to deal with leverage risks and susceptibility to 

runs in financial markets that are not fully contained within the universe of prudentially regulated 

firms; and third, dealing with the vulnerabilities associated with the growing importance of
