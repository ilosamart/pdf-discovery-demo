central issues of economic policy.  It is also clear from F8 that we were surprised – 

pleasantly so – that despite the pessimism of many that the Asian crisis spelled the 

beginning of the end of globalization, we had already concluded that very few countries, 

if any, intended to withdraw from the international economic system.   

The 2011 paper reflects lessons both about policy – especially the critical role of the 

exchange rate for small open economies – and about crisis management, some of which I 

learned from my experience as Governor of the Bank of Israel.  Both B9 (don’t panic in a 

crisis) and B10 are rules of behavior for those managing economic crises, or indeed any 

crisis.  I included B10, “Never say never” because in a crisis a decision-maker may 

sometimes find him- or herself having to undertake a policy action that they were sure 

they would never do and which, furthermore, they dislike doing.   

The 2014 paper was written while I was focusing on joining the Fed, and thus 

includes in S5 and S7 issues that remain on the agenda today.  I will return to the issues 

of moral hazard and too big to fail as I turn next to five major lessons that we should 

draw from the experiences that lie behind the three columns of Table 1. 


II. The Main Lessons. 

I will focus on five major issues, leaving the most important – lessons relating to the 

financial system and its regulation and supervision – to the last.3 

Lesson T1: Monetary policy at the Zero Lower Bound.4  Before the Great Recession, 

textbooks used to say that once the central bank interest rate had reached zero, monetary 

policy could not be made more expansionary – otherwise known as the liquidity trap.
