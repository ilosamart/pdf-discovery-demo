If the natural rate is now materially lower than we believe, that would imply less 

upward pressure on inflation--the flip side of the “revenge of the Phillips curve” risk.  

Our policy of gradual interest rate normalization represents the FOMC’s attempt to take 

both of these risks seriously.  Removing accommodation too quickly could needlessly 

foreshorten the expansion.  Moving too slowly could risk rising inflation and inflation 

expectations.  Our path of gradually removing accommodation, while closely monitoring 

the economy, is designed to balance these risks.  

In wrapping up this discussion of risks to the favorable outlook, I should 

emphasize that I have chosen to focus on three risks that are all associated with the 

Phillips curve.  There are, of course, myriad other risks.  To name just a few, we must 

consider the strength of economies abroad, the effects of ongoing trade disputes, and 

financial stability issues.  I hope my discussion of three particular risks gives a sense of 

how we approach these issues.  

Conclusion 

Many of us have been looking back recently on the decade that has passed since 

the depths of the financial crisis.  In light of that experience, I am glad to be able to stand

and outside the Fed is for more of the same.   

This historically rare pairing of steady, low inflation and very low unemployment 

is testament to the fact that we remain in extraordinary times.  Our ongoing policy of 

gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that
