proposed but not tried.   

One of the ideas discussed in Chicago is that the Federal Reserve should 

explicitly promise to “make up” for misses on inflation during a downturn.  The Federal 

Reserve could hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by promising not 

to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached particular 

levels.5  A related idea discussed in Chicago is average inflation targeting, meaning the 

Federal Reserve would aim to achieve its inflation objective, on average, over a longer 

period of time—perhaps over the business cycle.6  This approach could also have aspects 

of a makeup policy, depending on how it is designed.  While such approaches sound 

quite appealing on their face, they have not yet been implemented in practice.  There is 

some skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to support above-target 

inflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation might 

accelerate, and inflation expectations might rise too high.  

At the Chicago conference, we also heard how difficult it can be to estimate with 

any precision the “maximum employment” leg of our dual mandate.7  There is no fixed 

destination point for maximum employment—no single number where we can be sure we
