and regulatory requirements, it is hard to separate the relative effects of each. 

One way to assess the effects of regulation alone might be to watch the relative 

developments in business credit cards in comparison to consumer credit cards.  Credit 

cards issued primarily for business or commercial purposes generally are not governed by 

the consumer protections in the Truth in Lending Act or the amendments to that act in the 

2009 Credit CARD Act.  Some observers have already expressed concern that some card 

issuers may be marketing business and professional cards to consumers in an effort to 

sidestep new restrictions.  At the same time, some business owners and professionals 

might find the higher credit line availability or other terms offered on business cards to be 

more attractive than using their personal cards for business expenses.  The federal

issuers market and issue business cards only to borrowers who they have legitimate 

reason to believe are using them for business purposes.  Generally speaking, the card 

issuer is responsible for determining whether an account is intended to be used for 

business or personal purposes, and indeed, business card applications commonly request 

information necessary to make this determination.  The detailed information requested 

may include, for example, the type of business, annual revenue, age of the firm, number 

of employees, and tax identification number.  The answers to these questions help verify 

that the applicant owns a business, as well as gauge the creditworthiness of the business.

consumers from being automatically enrolled in overdraft programs for overdrafts created
