Thank you for the opportunity to speak here at the Economic Club of New York.  

Today I will discuss the ongoing progress of our economy and the prospects for returning 

both the federal funds rate and the size of the Fed’s balance sheet to more normal levels.  

As always, the views I express here are mine and not necessarily those of the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

Economic Developments 

The Federal Reserve is committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate of stable 

prices and maximum employment.  To begin with the labor market, many indicators 

suggest that the economy is close to full employment.  In April, the unemployment rate 

was 4.4 percent, a level not reached since May 2007 and below most current estimates of 

the natural rate of unemployment (figure 1).1  Estimates of the natural rate are inherently 

uncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their pre-crisis levels, including 

a broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to 

work but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want full-

time work.2  The labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the 

crisis, has now been roughly stable for 3-1/2 years, which represents an improvement 

                                                 
1 For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the natural rate of unemployment is 
currently 4.7 percent.  The March 2017 Blue Chip Economic Indicators reported that the consensus forecast 
for the unemployment rate over 2024 to 2028 was 4.7 percent, with the top 10 projections averaging 
5.1 percent and the bottom 10 averaging 4.3 percent.  The median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of 
unemployment in the March 2017 Summary of Economic Projections was 4.7 percent.  The uncertainty 
around these estimates is large. The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 95 percent 
confidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate; see Douglas Staiger, 
James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and 
Strategy (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).  
2 The broader measure is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 alternative measure of labor underutilization.
