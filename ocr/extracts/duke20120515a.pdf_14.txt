Other uncertainties are hindering the development of a new mortgage market 

structure, including the future role of the government in the mortgage market.  Foremost 

among these issues is the uncertainty surrounding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie 

Mac.  Nearly three and a half years after the GSEs entered conservatorship, policymakers 

have reached no consensus about the future structure of the GSEs and the role the 

government should play in the mortgage market.  Private capital might be reluctant to 

enter the market until the future parameters of government support are resolved. 

Collectively, these uncertainties about the future are likely contributing 

significantly to the tight lending standards in the mortgage market today.  Given the role 

that poor lending decisions played in the financial crisis, it is appropriate that lenders 

have tightened their lending standards.  That said, if lenders tighten more than is 

warranted, it will hamper the recovery of the housing market and, in doing so, restrain 

economic growth.  Moreover, the responses of lenders to these uncertainties may also 

have longer-term implications.  If lenders are delaying needed developments in their own 

infrastructure, such as servicing systems and capacity, until they have more clarity about 

what the mortgage market will look like down the road, the resulting lack of 

infrastructure might constrain mortgage and housing markets in both the short term and 

the long term. 

Choosing a Path Forward 

I have talked quite a bit about the factors that I believe are inhibiting a recovery in 

housing markets and some potential solutions to the problems I identified.  We have had 

a severe financial crisis with housing and housing finance playing a central role, and 

recovery is not likely to be quick or easy.  But I do believe there are some things that can
