12 percent at the end of 2006; the states represented by the SLC had accumulated above-

average reserves of around 16 percent.  These high reserve-fund balances were helpful in 

lessening the severity of spending cuts or tax increases in many states.  Nevertheless, 

given the depth of the recent recession, even these historically high reserve-fund balances 

proved insufficient to buffer fully the budgets of most states.  Thus, state governments 

may wish to revisit their criteria for accumulating fiscal reserves.  Building a rainy-day 

fund during good times may not be politically popular, but it can pay off during the bad 

times. 

In principle, some smoothing of state government expenditures over time could 

take place through the capital budget.  Maintaining or even increasing the pace of 

infrastructure construction when the economy is weak fosters economic development and 

provides local jobs, and it may even allow the state to get more bang for the buck because 

of increased competition among private contractors when demand is slack.  However, 

voters and policymakers may understandably be reluctant to approve new bond issues 

and take on additional costs for debt payments in a period of fiscal and economic stress. 

Beyond balanced-budget rules, state government finances also fluctuate because 

of the increasing sensitivity of their revenues to changes in economic conditions.  For 

example, capital income, which tends to vary substantially more than wage and salary 

income, has over time become a relatively more important source of state personal 

income taxes.6

lead to more cyclicality in collections.  As state legislatures review their tax systems, they
