For more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has served as one of 

the nation’s leading nonpartisan forums for discussion of economic policy issues.  It is an 

honor to appear before you today to speak about the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of 

maximum employment and price stability. 

In December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target 

range for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s main policy rate, by 1/4 percentage 

point.  This small step marked the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during 

which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery from the worst 

financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.  The Committee’s action 

recognized the considerable progress that the U.S. economy had made in restoring the 

jobs and incomes of millions of Americans hurt by this downturn.  It also reflected an 

expectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low, 

would move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower 

oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves 

further.  In light of this expectation, the Committee stated in December, and reiterated at 

the two subsequent meetings, that it “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a 

manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”1 

In my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only 

gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, 

emphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast for the trajectory of 

policy rates that the Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its 

objectives, conditional on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation.
