Today I will describe how nonbank intermediation in the United States has 

changed, what regulations are in place, and what reforms are under way to address the 

risks to financial stability associated with the growth of the nonbank sector.  The lessons 

we have learned about the U.S. nonbank financial sector may be of interest to regulators 

in other countries who are promoting or reacting to the changing composition of 

financing – away from banks and toward nonbanks and market-based intermediation. 

The Role of Nonbank Financial Intermediation in the U.S. Financial System 

I apologize for starting by reminding us of material we all know.  First, the 

provision of credit to nonfinancial businesses and households is critical to a well-

functioning economy.  Indeed, Ben Bernanke’s research on the Great Depression came to 

the conclusion that it was the collapse of credit growth, rather than the slow growth of the 

money supply, that was primarily responsible for the financial crisis of the 1930s. 

Second, the basic business model of a bank is straightforward:  Banks take 

deposits from their customers and invest the proceeds in the economy via loans to 

businesses, households, and governments.  Therefore, a bank’s balance sheet typically 

has shorter-term, highly liquid deposits on the liability side and longer-term, illiquid 

loans on the asset side.  This maturity transformation makes banks vulnerable to runs.  In 

recognition of this vulnerability, bank deposits became insured and the lender of last 

resort function was extended to dealing with bank runs. 

Third, nonbank financial institutions also act as intermediaries.  Their importance 

as lenders has increased dramatically over the past 35 years.  Data from the Financial 

Accounts of the United States indicate that in 1980, banks accounted for about 60 percent 

of total credit market assets held by the domestic financial sector, while nonbanks held
