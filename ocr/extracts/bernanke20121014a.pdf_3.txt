rapid snap-back from the global financial crisis has given way to slower growth in the 

face of weak export demand from the advanced economies.  The soft tone of global 

activity is yet another headwind for the U.S. economy.  

Looking ahead, economic projections of Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) participants prepared for the Committee’s September meeting called for the 

economic recovery to proceed at a moderate pace in coming quarters, with the 

unemployment rate declining only gradually.  FOMC participants generally expected that 

inflation was likely to run at or below the Committee’s inflation goal of 2 percent over 

the next few years.  The Committee also judged that there were significant downside 

risks to this outlook, importantly including the potential for an intensification of strains in 

Europe and an associated slowing in global growth.   

Federal Reserve’s Recent Policy Actions  

All of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are guided by our dual 

mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.  With the disappointing 

progress in job markets and with inflation pressures remaining subdued, the FOMC has 

taken several important steps this year to provide additional policy accommodation.  In 

January, the Committee noted that it anticipated that economic conditions were likely to 

warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014--a 

year and a half later than in previous statements.  In June, policymakers decided to 

continue through year-end the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the 

Federal Reserve purchases long-term Treasury securities and sells short-term ones to help 

depress long-term yields.
