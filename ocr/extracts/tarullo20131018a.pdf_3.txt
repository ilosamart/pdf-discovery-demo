In my remarks this afternoon, I will begin by explaining the purpose and critical features 

of a special mechanism for resolving large financial firms, especially those of systemic 

importance.  Next, I will explain why the efforts of the FDIC have been so important in 

developing credibility for the Title II resolution mechanism for systemically important firms and 

identify some of the important work that remains, not just for the FDIC, but for a range of 

official sector and private actors, here and abroad.  Finally, I will end with a few thoughts on the 

relationship between resolution mechanisms and the broader regulatory reform agenda we have 

been pursuing over the past several years.   

The Purpose and Critical Features of a Special Resolution Mechanism 

The crisis, and the scope of government support for large banks that it precipitated, 

spawned an ambitious international regulatory reform agenda directed at the financial stability 

risks posed by SIFIs.  It was recognized that, left unaddressed, the necessary but unpalatable 

government interventions during the crisis would only further entrench the too-big-to-fail status 

of systemic financial firms—increasing moral hazard, undermining market discipline, and 

harming competitive equality among financial institutions of different sizes.   

Stated most pointedly, then, the purpose of a special resolution mechanism for large 

financial firms is to prevent future situations in which government officials face the unappealing 

choice they confronted in 2008, to which I alluded a moment ago.  Stated more analytically, a 

special resolution mechanism is needed to take account of the characteristics of financial 

markets, and of larger firms operating in those markets, that do not fit easily with normal 

bankruptcy practice.  These characteristics all relate to a basic function of financial 

intermediaries in providing liquidity to firms and households—whether through maturity 

transformation, by which banks allow depositors to lend out their savings while maintaining
