focused on these risks.  Examiners should clearly communicate their findings to banks and 

maintain a regular dialogue about their risks and their risk management processes. When 

examiners find weaknesses in any of these areas, we expect that banks will address them in a 

timely manner.   

One thing I would note here is that if done properly, effective examination requires 

looking behind the numbers.  The crisis made clear that a bank that appears to be in sound 

financial condition may actually have a ticking time bomb on its books.  As I said before, it can 

be difficult for an examiner to tell a profitable bank with strong financial indicators that there are 

management weaknesses.  But that is exactly what we should empower our examiners to do 

because we know that the seeds of financial crisis are planted during the good times.  When 

conducting an examination, an examiner should be attuned to weaknesses in governance, risk 

management, and internal controls that may not pose a current problem but that may expose the 

bank to losses in the future.  And ultimately, as you know, it is easier to fix a problem during the 

good times. 

Finally, one of the key roles that examiners play in a healthy financial system is to 

provide context and perspective.  This is natural given the number of banking organizations that 

we examine and inspect, and I believe the Federal Reserve’s renewed financial stability mandate 

under the Dodd-Frank Act will enhance our ability to assess not just individual banks, but also 

the system as a whole.  Examiners have a longstanding practice of assessing a bank’s 

performance and practices relative to its peers.  This should not be a purely mechanical exercise 

where the examiner demands that a bank meet or exceed financial indicators for its peer group.  

Instead, we should use these assessments to understand a bank’s performance relative to peers in 

the context of its own unique facts and circumstances.
