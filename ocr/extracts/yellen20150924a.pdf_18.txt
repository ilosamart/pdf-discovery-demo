simplified version of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain.  For this reason, 

significant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts 

from this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data. 

Policy Implications 

Assuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation 

expectations are in fact anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does 

the preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for 

monetary policy?   

This framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from 

our 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove 

transitory.  As the solid black line in figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably 

below our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching 

about 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1-1/2 percentage points 

this year.  The stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these 

deviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation 

model I just discussed.30  As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer 

energy prices explain about half of this year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013 

and 2014 shortfalls as well.  Another important source of downward pressure this year 

has been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which 

                                                 
30 For a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix.  In the 
decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the 
contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to 
the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending.  (Note that the “other” category 
includes the effects of changes in food prices.)  The estimated contribution of movements in import prices 
is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation, 
they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent.  In addition, the 
decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization 
and other factors.
