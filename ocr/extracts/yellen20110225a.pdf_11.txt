markets participants’ expectations for its future holdings.  Consequently, a shift in 

expectations concerning the trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could have 

an important effect on financial conditions going forward.   

In particular, financial conditions depend on market expectations not only 

concerning the amount of the FOMC’s purchases but also concerning the anticipated 

timing and pace of the eventual unwinding of those holdings.  For example, financial 

conditions would likely tighten immediately if market participants came to expect a more 

rapid renormalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In contrast, if market 

participants were to anticipate a more gradual renormalization, financial conditions 

would likely become more stimulative.   

To illustrate the potential importance of such changes in expectations, figure 7 

depicts a scenario in which markets come to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will 

shrink its balance sheet more rapidly than in the baseline scenario.  The left panel shows 

the assumed contour of an expected acceleration of asset sales that would renormalize the 

overall size of the portfolio within about two years (solid line), roughly twice as fast as 

under the baseline scenario (dashed line).  The announcement of such a strategy would 

cause a substantial rise in term premiums relative to the baseline scenario, and, assuming 

no offsetting change in the path of the federal funds rate, the resulting higher level of 

long-term interest rates would damp aggregate spending.  The right panel depicts the 

macroeconomic effects of the more rapid runoff of the balance sheet in terms of 

deviations from the baseline scenario:  The unemployment rate (solid line) is significantly 

higher, and core PCE inflation (dashed line) is somewhat lower.
