For more than 90 years, the Economic Club of Chicago has provided a valued 

forum for current and future leaders to discuss issues of vital interest to this city and our 

nation.  I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to you here today.   

At the Federal Reserve, we seek to foster a strong economy for the benefit of 

individuals, families, and businesses throughout our country.  In pursuit of that 

overarching objective, the Congress has assigned us the goals of achieving maximum 

employment and stable prices, known as the dual mandate.  Today I will review recent 

economic developments, focusing on the labor market and inflation, and then touch 

briefly on longer-term growth prospects.  I will finish with a discussion of monetary 

policy.     

Recent Developments and the State of the Economy 

After what at times has been a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the 

Great Recession, growth has picked up.  Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent at its 

peak in October 2009 to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades (figure 1).  

Seventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job 

growth remains more than sufficient to employ new entrants to the labor force (figure 2).  

The labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) expect it to remain strong.  Inflation has continued to run below the 

FOMCâ€™s 2 percent objective but we expect it to move up in coming months and to 

stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. 

Beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength.  Steady 

income gains, rising household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence continue to 

support consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of economic output.
