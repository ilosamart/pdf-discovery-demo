broadly.  The model implies indifference to the consequences of poor risk management, 

executive compensation schemes that encourage unmitigated and unmonitored risk-taking, and 

reliance on public dollars to save financial institutions from their own folly and the injuries that 

their folly creates for the people of our country. 

Some may argue that we have learned our lessons and left the low road behind us in the 

wake of the financial crisis.  That may be true.  I was tempted to think so in a speech I gave in 

February 2011 called “Putting the Low Road Behind Us,” which focused on high-road and low-

road models for mortgage servicing.

  Yet we know that low-road business models exist and 

persist: for example, when we hear about billions of dollars of losses resulting from what were 

supposed to be conservative hedging strategies, or about the manipulation of key market interest 

rates.  News like this causes the public to question the banking sector’s commitment to the public 

welfare and its willingness to help the nation get back on its feet.  And while I believe that most 

consumers understand that community banks did not, by and large, engage in the most egregious 

practices, institutions that continue to take the low road tar the image of the entire banking 

sector.  A recent Wall Street Journal article did a good job of characterizing how these events 

have affected the public’s perception of the industry, saying: “Scandals emanating from the 

boom years should have lost their power to shock.  But evidence unearthed by…regulators…is 

enough to stir even the most jaded cynic.”
