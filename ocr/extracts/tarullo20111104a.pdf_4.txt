and Basel III into national legislation or regulations is at various stages of progress around the 

world.     

Two points are worth making with respect to U.S. implementation.  First, while U.S. 

bank regulatory agencies have published a proposed regulation for the new market risk capital 

requirements, we did not include the trading book securitization and resecuritization portions of 

Basel 2.5.  The complication here, and with part of Basel III implementation, lies in the use of 

agency credit ratings.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

requires the removal of agency credit ratings from all regulations throughout the government.  

The banking agencies thus need to develop substitutes for agency ratings in each of the quite 

different contexts within the capital standards where they are used.  This has not been the easiest 

of tasks, but I believe we are now close to convergence on the approaches we will take in 

fashioning these substitutes.  Thus we should soon be able to draft a proposed regulation for the 

rest of Basel 2.5.  Work on the Basel III rule has had to compete for staff time with all the other 

rulemakings currently underway at the banking agencies, but I would expect a proposed 

regulation in the first quarter of 2012. 

My second point pertains to the six-year transition period for Basel III, which by its terms 

phases in the requirements for both the improved quality and increased quantity of capital in 

somewhat backloaded stages beginning in January 2013.  Questions have arisen--particularly 

here in the United States, though elsewhere as well--as to supervisory expectations for capital 

levels during this rather lengthy period.  Specifically, there has been some uncertainty as to 

whether supervisors intend to “pull forward” the various transition points outlined in Basel III.  

While the Federal Reserve intends to ensure that firms are on a steady path to full Basel III 

compliance, we do not intend to require firms to raise external capital or reduce their risk-
