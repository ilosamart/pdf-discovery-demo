to provide additional stimulus at the time of adoption, but rather to allow market 

participants to adjust their expectations about future monetary policy in response to 

incoming data--exactly what the authors advocate.9 

The Committee also used balance sheet policy through most of this period.  The 

first two programs of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), popularly known as QE1 and 

QE2, and the maturity extension program were announced in terms of time and quantity--

that is, a certain quantity of assets would be purchased over a certain time.  In adopting 

QE3, by contrast, the Committee committed to continuing purchases until there was a 

substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.10  QE3 was fully data-

contingent. 

Former Chairman Bernanke recounts in his recent book that he saw QE3 as akin 

to Mario Draghi’s statement that the European Central Bank would do “whatever it 

takes.”11  He also notes that FOMC participants held divergent views on the potential 

costs and benefits of the program.  Minutes of the relevant meetings described the 

complex discussions and differing views.  Contemporaneous reports by Wall Street 

analysts show frustration and confusion about the Committee’s intentions. 

When various FOMC communications suggested that the time to begin reducing 

purchases was nearing, long-term rates rose sharply--the so-called taper tantrum.  The

in December 2012 to 6.2 percent in April 2014, while inflation remained below 2.0 percent.   
10 The December 2012 FOMC statement indicated that, “If the outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed 
securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context 
of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, 
as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”  (Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press 
release, December 12, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.)
