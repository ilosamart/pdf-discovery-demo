(GDP) increased significantly--during the Great Depression-World War II era and, to a 

smaller extent, the two decades ending in the mid-1990s.3 

After each of these high-debt periods, fiscal policy responded by running 

sustained primary surpluses and reducing debt to levels below 40 percent of GDP.  In a 

recent paper, Henning Bohn observed that “the foundation of U.S. debt policy is the 

promise of safety for bondholders backed by primary surpluses only in response to a high 

debt-GDP ratio.”4  That nicely captures our recent history and suggests a principal reason 

why the federal debt of the United States still has the market’s trust.   

The Great Recession has generated a third substantial increase in federal debt, 

from about 35 percent of GDP in 2007 to around 75 percent at the end of this fiscal year, 

an increase that is consistent with other increases in sovereign debt for advanced 

economies after severe financial crises during the post-World War II period.5  History 

and common sense suggest that the federal government should again run primary 

surpluses sufficient over time to reduce debt to pre-crisis levels of perhaps 35 to 

40 percent of GDP.  That would leave fiscal space to address the coming wave of health 

and pension costs, as well as unexpected new shocks. 

In the past two years, spending cuts and tax increases totaling about $3.5 trillion 

over the next 10 years have been enacted.  Assuming these measures are not rolled back--

in particular, that the spending sequestration either takes effect or is replaced by 

equivalent deficit-reducing measures--a reasonable “current policy” projection  is that the
