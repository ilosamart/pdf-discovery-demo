respond to developments in financial markets.  Finally, at least one big crossroad still lies    

ahead--a decision on the future of the government-sponsored housing finance agencies.   

We are, of course, in the middle of the Dodd-Frank implementation process.  Thus, while 

I recognize there is enormous interest in where the Federal Reserve and other rule-writing 

agencies may be headed, I cannot say much about the substance of the regulations that will 

eventually be proposed and adopted.  Indeed, I think it would be inconsistent with the very 

purpose of administrative law requirements for me to come to my own conclusions, much less 

opine publicly on them, before we have made our proposals and evaluated all the comments.    

What I can say is that, in implementing Dodd-Frank, the Board of Governors will be 

guided by the same norms of statutory construction that a court would apply.  Most importantly, 

where Congressional intentions are clear from the language of the statute, we must faithfully 

execute those intentions.  Of course, there are a good many provisions that do not admit of a 

single interpretation, and the implementation of those provisions will require the exercise of 

discretion by the Federal Reserve or other regulatory agencies.   

I can also say that we are following a transparent and inclusive process that goes well 

beyond the classic notice and comment requirements for agencies adopting regulations.  As to 

transparency: At the Federal Reserve, we are entering into the public record a summary of all 

communications with non-government groups or individuals regarding matters subject to a 

potential or proposed rulemaking under Dodd-Frank.  As to inclusiveness: We have joined with 

the other banking agencies in sponsoring a series of joint forums to solicit views from industry, 

academics, and others on some key issues relevant to Dodd-Frank implementation.  We are also 

hearing views on regulatory implementation at meetings that cover a broad range of topics, such 

as at our last Consumer Advisory Council session.
