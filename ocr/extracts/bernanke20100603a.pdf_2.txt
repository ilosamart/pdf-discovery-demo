ongoing and very important discussion about improving access to credit for small 

businesses.  I would particularly like to thank the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Chicago and President Evans for organizing this event.  

Today’s meeting is part of a series of more than 40 such gatherings that the 

Federal Reserve System is conducting across the country.  Entitled Addressing the 

Financing Needs of Small Businesses, these forums are designed to elicit ideas and 

information that will help the Federal Reserve and others respond effectively to both the 

immediate and longer-term concerns of small businesses.  Today’s event brings together 

representatives from banks and other private lenders, community development financial 

institutions, bank supervisors, other federal and local government agencies, and small 

business trade groups.  Each of you brings an important perspective to this issue, and I 

would like to thank all of the participants for their willingness to share their ideas.  

Over the past two years, a concerted effort by the Federal Reserve and other 

policymakers has helped to stabilize our financial system and our economy.  Following a 

sharp contraction in late 2008 and early 2009, we are now in the fourth quarter of 

economic expansion, with jobs once more being created rather than destroyed.  

Nonetheless, important concerns remain.  One particularly difficult issue is the continued 

high rate of unemployment.  High unemployment imposes heavy costs on workers and 

their families, as well as on our society as a whole.  I raise this issue here because healthy 

small businesses, including start-ups as well as going concerns, are crucial to creating 

jobs and improving employment security.
