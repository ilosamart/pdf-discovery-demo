problem can be illustrated by reference to the market shocks we have applied to the 

trading books of the six largest financial firms in the last two stress tests.  The shocks, 

designed to be severe, consisted of instantaneous, hypothetical jumps in asset prices 

based on those observed over the entire second half of 2008.  The resulting trading losses 

are—as one would expect—quite large.  Even so, had we simply used the same shocks 

that we used in the 2009 exercise, unchanged from the historical experience, we would 

have underestimated the potential losses associated with subsequent developments.  For 

that reason, we modified the market shock scenario in 2011 to take account of Eurozone 

stress and then further modified the hypothesized stress in 2012 to include sharp moves in 

interest rates.  We will continue to modify the market shock regularly to incorporate 

salient risks that were not necessarily present in 2008 and to ensure that firms cannot 

artificially improve their performance on the test through holding significant amounts of 

certain assets that happened to perform well in that period. 

The second kind of macroprudential resiliency measure reduces the chances of 

distress or failure for financial companies of systemic importance to a greater degree than 

for other firms.  Key provisions of Dodd-Frank aim at this form of resiliency.  One 

extends the perimeter of regulation by authorizing the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council (FSOC) to subject nonbank financial companies to supervision and regulation by 

the Federal Reserve if the council “determines that material financial distress” at such a 

company, or its nature, size, or other characteristics or activities “could pose a threat to 

the financial stability of the United States.”

  Another requires the Federal Reserve to 

establish a broad set of enhanced prudential standards, both for bank holding companies
