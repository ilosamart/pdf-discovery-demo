Demand deposits and other short-term bank liabilities are safe, easy-to-value claims that are well 

suited for transaction purposes and provide money-like benefits to firms and households.5    

Second, in a world without LOLR, shortages of liquid assets would be exacerbated 

during stress episodes.  Banks would likely hoard their liquidity buffers.  Knowing they must 

rely only on their own liquidity to meet demands even as market uncertainty is increasing and 

asset values suffer downward pressure, banks would have to reduce dramatically their core 

intermediation function.  They would be reluctant to lend to firms and households that are 

themselves subject to the impact of the systemwide liquidity shocks.  These real-economy actors 

would thus be unable to fulfill their own financial obligations in a timely fashion or would pare 

back their own activities out of concern about their ability to do so.  Another adverse feedback 

loop could result.  Even without liquidity regulation and with an LOLR, there is a tendency to 

hoard liquidity during periods of financial instability, as evidenced between 2007 and 2009 when 

banks actually increased their balance sheet liquidity instead of running down their liquidity 

buffers.6   

It is worth noting that this very dynamic helped motivate the creation of the Federal 

Reserve.  If solvent banks are confident that they will be able to borrow from the central bank 

against good collateral to meet any unforeseen funding needs, then they need not completely stop 

lending even amid increased uncertainty about future funding needs.  Lending by the central 

5 Banks also provide liquidity to operating firms via committed lines of credit, which are more efficient, in 
conditions of uncertainty, than an arrangement in which each operating firm attempts to hold sufficient funds in 
advance to meet potential liquidity needs, as discussed in Holmstrom and Tirole (1998), “Private and Public Supply 
of Liquidity,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 106(1), pp. 1–40.

a very typical dynamic of liquidity crises historically, when reserve requirements were used to promote bank 
liquidity in the absence of a central bank that could add liquidity to the financial system; see “Lessons from the 
Historical Use of Reserve Requirements in the United States to Promote Bank Liquidity,” Finance and Economics 
Discussion Papers 2013-11 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).
