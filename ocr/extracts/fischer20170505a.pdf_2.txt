It is a pleasure to be at the Hoover Institution again.  I was privileged to be a 

Visiting Scholar here from 1981 to 1982.  In addition, many of the researchers and 

practitioners with whom I have discussed monetary policy over the years have had 

affiliations with the Hoover Institution--including several people here today.  It is a 

pleasure also to have been invited to speak at this Hoover Institution Monetary Policy 

Conference, for the Hoover conference series provides a valuable forum for policymakers 

and researchers to engage in dialogue about important monetary policy issues facing the 

United States and other countries. 

Today I will offer some observations on monetary policy rules and their place in 

decisionmaking by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).1  I have two messages.  

First, policymakers should consult the prescriptions of policy rules, but--almost needless 

to say--they should avoid applying them mechanically.  Second, policymaking 

committees have strengths that policy rules lack.  In particular, committees are an 

efficient means of aggregating a wide variety of information and perspectives. 

Monetary Policy Rules in Research and Policy 

Since May 2014, I have considered monetary policy rules from the vantage point 

of a member of the FOMC.  But my interest in them began many years ago and was 

reflected in some of my earliest publications.2  At that time, the literature on monetary 

policy rules, especially in the United States, remained predominantly concerned with the 

money stock or total bank reserves rather than the short-term interest rate.3  Seen with the

3 There was, however, a long tradition of monetary analysis in the United Kingdom and continental Europe 
that was centered on the authoritiesâ€™ use of the interest rate as an instrument.  See especially Keynes (1930) 
and Wicksell (1936).  In the post-World War II decades, this tradition continued in the U.K. research
