First, we should seek to modernize the definition of assessment areas in such a way that 

the core focus remains the credit needs of local communities.  The definition in the existing CRA 

regulation of a bank’s assessment area--that is, the area in which we evaluate a bank’s CRA 

performance--reflects a banking environment when interstate banking was not yet allowed, and 

physical branches were necessary to serve the deposit and lending needs of bank customers.  

Technological advances and changing consumer preferences have made it possible for banks to 

serve customers far outside of their physical branches--for example, online and on mobile 

devices.  Clearly, it is time to find a way to expand the area in which the agencies evaluate a 

bank’s CRA activities.  At the same time, it is important to retain a focus on place--and in 

particular the credit needs of local communities.  We are confident that there are ways to expand 

the area where we evaluate a bank’s CRA performance without losing the regulation’s focus on 

the unique role banks play in meeting local credit needs and providing services that are only 

possible by using branches.  Treasury’s recommendation that the agencies revisit the regulations 

to allow CRA consideration for a bank’s activities in its assessment area, as currently delineated 

around branches and deposit-taking automated teller machines, as well as in low- and moderate-

income areas outside that branch footprint, is a reasonable place to start our interagency 

discussions.   

  Second, banks should be encouraged to seek opportunities in areas that are underserved.  

Currently, a bank’s performance in its major markets is evaluated most closely and weighs most 

heavily in its CRA rating.  This emphasis has resulted in what banks and community 

organizations refer to as credit “hot spots” where there is a high density of banks relative to 

investment opportunities.  Meanwhile, other areas have a difficult time attracting capital because 

they are not in a bank’s major market, if they are served by a bank at all.  Key priorities in any
