Efforts are under way to deal with these gaps:  The Legal Entity Identifier 

initiative is working to allow regulators and private counterparties to trace activities by 

institution; the OFR, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve 

are cooperating with the industry to collect data on bilateral repos; and the FSB has 

finalized standards for collection of data on securities financing transactions.11  

Regulators in the United States and abroad have begun to require the reporting of detailed 

derivatives transaction data to trade repositories.  Unfortunately, as a recent report shows, 

inadequate data standards and limitations on authorities’ access to trade repository data 

have prevented the benefits of derivatives trade data reporting from being fully realized.12  

An illustration of the possible interaction between better data and better policies is 

the potential role of margins in securities financing transactions.  The more stringent 

regulation of the banking sector may push short-term financing activities to less regulated 

entities.  To limit such regulatory arbitrage, the Federal Reserve will be developing 

regulations that would establish minimum margins for securities financing transactions 

on a marketwide basis.  The margins would apply to all market participants, thereby 

mitigating the risks associated with regulation along institutional lines.  Improved data 

collection, such as mentioned earlier, would allow a better view of changes in conditions 

and potentially contribute to the deployment of countercyclical margins, thereby further 

decreasing the chances of a dynamic that culminates in adverse fire sales.
