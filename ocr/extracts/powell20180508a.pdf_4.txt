have attributed the movements in international capital flowing to EMEs since the Global 

Financial Crisis primarily to monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy 

central banks.4  The data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well.  As 

illustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel of figure 4, capital flows to EMEs 

were already very strong before the Global Financial Crisis, when the federal funds rate 

was comparatively high.  The subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was 

abating, largely reflects a rebound from the capital flow interruption during the crisis 

itself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless 

also played a role.  Moreover, capital flows to EMEs started to ease after 2011, a period 

when the Federal Reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through 

increases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel.  And, more recently, capital 

flows to EMEs have picked up again despite the fact that the Fed has been removing 

accommodation since 2015.  

If U.S. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been 

driving EME capital flows?  One prominent factor has been growth differentials between 

EMEs and advanced economies.  In figure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to 

EMEs picked up post-crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while 

the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing.  Another related 

determinant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel.  The pickup in both 

global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of 

the recent recovery of capital flows to EMEs.5
