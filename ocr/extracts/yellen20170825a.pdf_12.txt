The Financial System Is Safer 

The evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system 

substantially safer.  Loss-absorbing capacity among the largest banks is significantly 

higher, with Tier 1 common equity capital more than doubling from early 2009 to now.15  

The annual stress-testing exercises in recent years have led to improvements in the capital 

positions and risk-management processes among participating banks.  Large banks have 

cut their reliance on short-term wholesale funding essentially in half and hold 

significantly more high-quality, liquid assets.  Assets under management at prime 

institutional money market funds that proved susceptible to runs in the crisis have 

decreased substantially.  And the ability of regulators to resolve a large institution has 

improved, reflecting both new authorities and tangible steps taken by institutions to 

adjust their organizational and capital structure in a manner that enhances their 

resolvability and significantly reduces the problem of too-big-to-fail. 

The progress evident in regulatory and supervisory metrics has been accompanied 

by shifts in private-sector assessments that also suggest enhanced financial stability.  

Investors have recognized the progress achieved toward ending too-big-to-fail, and 

several rating agencies have removed the government support rating uplift that they once 

accorded to the largest banks.  Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that 

                                                 
designated four firms as systemically important--AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife.  GE Capital 

chose to shrink, adjust its business model, and reduce its footprint in short-term wholesale funding 

markets--and hence reduce a source of systemic risk.  These actions caused the FSOC to subsequently 

remove its designation as systemically important last year--illustrating how the designation process allows 

both identifying systemic firms and removing such designations when appropriate.   
15 The increase in Tier 1 common equity among bank holding companies has been sizable, especially for 

the largest banks.  If the largest banks are defined as either the eight U.S. global systemically important 

banks or the U.S. bank holding companies that participated in the CCAR in 2017 (and for which data are 

available for 2009:Q1), Tier 1 common equity has more than doubled in dollar terms and relative to risk-

weighted assets from the first quarter of 2009 to the most recent observations.
