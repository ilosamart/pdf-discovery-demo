against its estimated downward trend (figure 2).  Participation is now close to estimates 

of its trend level.3  

Wage data have gradually moved up, consistent with a tightening labor market.  

Although average hourly earnings are rising only about 2.5 percent per year, slower than 

before the crisis, much of that downshift may reflect the slowdown in productivity 

growth we have experienced.  For example, over the past three years, unit labor costs--

that is, nominal wages adjusted for increases in productivity--have been generally rising a 

bit faster than prices.4   

Turning to inflation, the FOMC interprets price stability to mean inflation of 2 

percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5  

This objective is symmetric, so the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to 

run persistently above or below this target.  Inflation has run below 2 percent for most of 

the period since the financial crisis, reflecting generally soft economic conditions as well 

as transitory factors such as the earlier declines in energy prices.  But over the past two 

years, inflation has moved gradually closer to our objective.  Prices rose 1.6 percent over 

                                                 
3 The labor force participation rate is currently slightly below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate 
of trend and slightly above trend estimates based on the methodology of Aaronson and others.  See

4 There are several other measures of nominal wage growth in addition to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
(BLS) average hourly earnings.  The BLS employment cost index measure of year-over-year wage and 
salary growth was also 2.5 percent in the first quarter, while the BLS measure of compensation per hour 
rose to 3.9 percent.  Compensation per hour is quite volatile and subject to large revisions.  The unit labor 
cost measure is based on the BLS measures of compensation per hour and productivity for the business 
sector.  All of these measures indicate that compensation has picked up in recent years.
