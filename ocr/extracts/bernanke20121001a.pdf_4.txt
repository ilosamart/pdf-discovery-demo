 In normal circumstances, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy 

through its influence on short-term interest rates, which in turn affect other interest rates 

and asset prices.1  Generally, if economic weakness is the primary concern, the Fed acts 

to reduce interest rates, which supports the economy by inducing businesses to invest 

more in new capital goods and by leading households to spend more on houses, autos, 

and other goods and services.  Likewise, if the economy is overheating, the Fed can raise 

interest rates to help cool total demand and constrain inflationary pressures.   

Following this standard approach, the Fed cut short-term interest rates rapidly 

during the financial crisis, reducing them to nearly zero by the end of 2008--a time when 

the economy was contracting sharply.  At that point, however, we faced a real challenge:  

Once at zero, the short-term interest rate could not be cut further, so our traditional policy 

tool for dealing with economic weakness was no longer available.  Yet, with 

unemployment soaring, the economy and job market clearly needed more support.  

Central banks around the world found themselves in a similar predicament.  We asked 

ourselves, “What do we do now?” 

 To answer this question, we could draw on the experience of Japan, where short-

term interest rates have been near zero for many years, as well as a good deal of academic 

work.  Unable to reduce short-term interest rates further, we looked instead for ways to 

influence longer-term interest rates, which remained well above zero.  We reasoned that, 

as with traditional monetary policy, bringing down longer-term rates should support 

economic growth and employment by lowering the cost of borrowing to buy homes and 

                                                 
1 The Fed has a number of ways to influence short-term rates; basically, they involve steps to affect the 
supply, and thus the cost, of short-term funding.
