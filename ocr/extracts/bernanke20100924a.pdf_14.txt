government the flexibility to take the actions needed to safeguard systemic stability.  This 

new regime should help restore market discipline by putting a greater burden on creditors 

and counterparties to monitor the risk-taking of large financial firms. 

The insights of economists proved valuable to policymakers in many other 

contexts as well:  in the setting and oversight of bank capital standards, in the decision to 

provide the market with extensive information gleaned during the bank stress tests in the 

spring of 2009, in the design of the Fed’s liquidity facilities for nondepository 

institutions, in the analysis of the collapse of the securitization market, and in the 

measures taken to protect consumers from deceptive or inappropriate lending, to name a 

few.  Many of the key ideas, like those of Thornton and Bagehot, were quite old, but 

some reflected relatively recent research.  For example, recent work on monetary policy 

helped the Federal Reserve provide further policy accommodation despite the constraints 

imposed by the zero lower bound on interest rates.8

Economics and Economic Research in the Wake of the Crisis 


Economic principles and research have been central to understanding and reacting 

to the crisis.  That said, the crisis and its lead up also challenged some important 

economic principles and research agendas.  I will briefly indicate some areas that, I 

believe, would benefit from more attention from the economics profession. 

                                                 
8The Federal Reserve did so by, for example, (1) acting rapidly when confronted with the zero lower 
bound, as discussed in David Reifschneider and John C. Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary 
Policy in a Low-Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936-66; (2) 
providing forward guidance regarding short-term interest rates, as discussed in Gauti Eggertsson and 
Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest-Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings 
Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 2003 (1), pp. 139-211; and (3) expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet through purchases of longer-term securities, as discussed in Ben S. Bernanke, Vincent R. Reinhart, 
and Brian P. Sack (2004), “Monetary Policy Alternatives at the Zero Bound:  An Empirical Assessment,” 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 2004 (2), pp. 1-78.
