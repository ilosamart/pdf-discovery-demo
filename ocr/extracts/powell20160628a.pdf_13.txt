 Dynamism is a relatively new field of inquiry, and there is no consensus yet on 

the reasons for, or implications of, these developments.  Some plausible sources of these 

changes are benign, while others are more negative and suggest that the reduction in 

dynamism may be a factor behind the slower increases in productivity.  For example, 

historically there has been a robust correlation at the firm level between productivity and 

growth, with high productivity levels being correlated with faster growth and low 

productivity levels being associated with contraction or exit.  This relationship has 

weakened since 2000, particularly in the high-tech sector.12  High productivity firms are 

not growing as quickly, and low productivity firms are shrinking or exiting at a slower 

pace.  

 It may be that some government policies, while well intended, have contributed to 

these trends.  One example that may explain a small portion of the reduction in dynamism 

is the substantial increase in occupational licensing.13  By some estimates, the fraction of 

workers who are required to hold a government issued license or certification to perform 

their jobs has risen from 5 percent in the 1950s to close to 40 percent.14  Like many 

policies, licensing has benefits and costs.  Among the costs are that it tends to reduce job 

switching and employment opportunities for excluded workers, and may restrict 

competition and thus increase prices faced by consumers.  Among the benefits may be 

higher quality products and services and improved health and safety standards.  Some 

researchers have advanced the view that licensing requirements have become overly

mobility. The evidence linking licensing to labor market fluidity is inconclusive, with some researchers 
finding a linkage and others not.
