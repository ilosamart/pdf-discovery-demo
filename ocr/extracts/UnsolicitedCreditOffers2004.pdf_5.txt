Executive Summary and Overview 

Each year American consumers receive several billion written offers of credit or 
insurance they did not request. In many cases, the senders have prescreened the 
recipients for creditworthiness and suitability using consumer credit records in the files of 
consumer reporting agencies (CRAs).1 Such prescreened solicitations are now among the 
principal techniques creditors and insurers use to inform prospective customers of the 
availability of their products and to establish new or additional business relationships 
with them. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) permits creditors and insurers to use CRA 
information as a basis for sending unsolicited firm offers of credit or insurance, also 
known as prescreened solicitations, to consumers who meet certain criteria, but only 
within limits specified in the act. The FCRA also provides a mechanism by which 
consumers can elect not to receive such solicitations by directing CRAs to exclude their 
names and addresses from lists provided by these agencies for sending prescreened 
solicitations. Consumers who choose to have their names removed from lists used for 
prescreened solicitations may well still receive offers of credit or insurance by mail or 
telephone, but such offers will not be based on the credit records maintained by the 
CRAs. 

REQUIREMENTS OF THE STUDY AND REPORT 

To learn more about unsolicited written offers of credit and insurance, the Congress 
directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in section 213(e) of the 
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (Fact Act), to conduct a study of 
prescreened solicitations and to summarize the results of the study in a report to the 
Congress. The Fact Act specifically requires the Board to study the ability of consumers 
to avoid (or “opt out” of) receiving written offers of credit or insurance in connection 
with transactions not initiated by the consumer and the potential effect on consumers of 
any further restrictions on providing them with such written offers of credit or insurance. 
In particular, the Congress directed the Board to address the following five issues in the 
study and report: 

1. the availability to consumers of opt-out mechanisms 
2. the extent to which consumers use existing opt-out mechanisms 
3. the benefits to consumers of receiving written offers 
4. the costs to or adverse affects on consumers of receiving written offers
