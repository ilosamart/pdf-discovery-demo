Effectively conveying our views about risks and their role in policy projections 

can be challenging at times, and we are always looking for ways to improve our 

communications.  I have asked the communications subcommittee of the FOMC to 

explore ways in which we can more effectively communicate about the role of the rate 

projections.  For now, let me leave you with a cautionary tale about focusing too much on 

dots.  Here is a picture composed of different colored dots (figure 2).  The meaning of it 

is not clear, although if you stare at it long enough you might see a pattern.  But let’s take 

a step back (figure 3).  As you can see, if you are too focused on a few dots, you may 

miss the larger picture. 

Delivering on the FOMC’s intention to ultimately normalize policy continues to 

be a major priority at the Fed.  Normalization is far along, and, considering the 

unprecedented nature of the exercise, it is proceeding smoothly.  I am confident that we 

can effectively manage the remaining stages. 

Beyond Normalization 

We live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions 

around the world.  At the Fed, we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the 

public’s trust.  The Fed has special responsibilities in this regard.  Our monetary policy 

independence allows us to serve the public without regard to short-term political 

considerations, which, as history has shown, is critical for sound monetary policymaking.  

But that precious grant of independence brings with it a special obligation to be open and 

transparent, welcoming scrutiny by the public and their elected representatives in 

Congress.  Only in this way can the Fed maintain its legitimacy in our democratic system. 

                                                 
provide some general information about the balance of risks, but this information is far less complete than 
the detail provided on the modal outlook.
