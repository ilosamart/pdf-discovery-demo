Preeminent among these domestic and global efforts have been steps to increase the loss-

absorbing capacity of banks, regulations to limit both maturity transformation in short-

term funding markets and liquidity mismatches within banks, and new authorities to 

facilitate the resolution of large financial institutions and to subject systemically 

important firms to more stringent prudential regulation. 

Several important reforms have increased the loss-absorbing capacity of global 

banks.  First, the quantity and quality of capital required relative to risk-weighted assets 

have been increased substantially.9  In addition, a simple leverage ratio provides a 

backstop, reflecting the lesson imparted by past crises that risk weights are imperfect and 

a minimum amount of equity capital should fund a firm’s total assets.  Moreover, both 

the risk-weighted and simple leverage requirements are higher for the largest, most 

systemic firms, which lowers the risk of distress at such firms and encourages them to 

limit activities that could threaten financial stability.10  Finally, the largest U.S. banks 

participate in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--the 

                                                 
9 These improvements encompass a number of changes.  The regulatory requirements for capital have been 

increased and focus on Tier 1 common equity, which proved more capable of absorbing losses than lower-

quality forms of capital.  The role of bank internal models in determining risk-weighted assets also has 

been significantly constrained in the United States.  In addition, exposures previously considered off 

balance sheet have been incorporated into risk-weighted assets. 
10 The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final 

rule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most interconnected U.S. banking 

organizations on April 8, 2014.  Under the final rule, covered bank holding companies must maintain a 

leverage buffer of 2 percentage points above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 

3 percent, for a total of 5 percent, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 

payments (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 

and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Agencies Adopt Enhanced Supplementary 

Leverage Ratio Final Rule and Issue Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” joint 

press release, April 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm).  

The Federal Reserve approved a final rule imposing risk-based capital surcharges on the largest, most 

systemically important U.S. bank holding companies on July 20, 2015; in connection with the final rule, the 

Board issued a white paper describing the calibration of the risk-based capital surcharges (see Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring 

the Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies to Further Strengthen Their 

Capital Positions,” press release, July 20,
