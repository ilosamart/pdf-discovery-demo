All that said, I do not dismiss the prospective risks emanating from global policy 

normalization.  Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in 

interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate.  And, of course, future economic 

conditions may surprise us, as they often do.   

  Moreover, the linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of 

global financial markets are not fully understood.  Some observers have argued that U.S. 

monetary policy also influences capital flows through its effects on global risk sentiment, 

with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy 

depressing sentiment.8  While those channels may well operate, research at both the Fed 

and the IMF suggests that actions by major central banks account for only a relatively 

small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9 

Nevertheless, risk sentiment will bear close watching as normalization proceeds 

around the world.  What can the Federal Reserve do to foster continued financial stability 

and economic growth as normalization proceeds?  We will communicate our policy 

strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid 

market disruptions.  And we will continue to help build resilience in the financial system 

and support global efforts to do the same. 


                                                 
8 Rey (2015); Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015).   
9 For example, Londono and Wilson (2018) find that U.S. monetary policy variables account for only 
roughly 10 percent of the six-month ahead forecast error variance of the VIX.  In fact, in their study, non-
U.S. global factors (non-U.S industrial production, a global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, and the 
expected probability of recessions outside of the United States) explain nearly as much of the VIX forecast 
error variance as U.S. monetary policy and other U.S. variables combined.  In addition, Cerutti, Claessens, 
and Rose (2017) find that directly observed variables in “center” countries (including VIX), as well as 
unobserved common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows, together rarely explain more than 
one-fourth of the variation in most types of capital flows.
