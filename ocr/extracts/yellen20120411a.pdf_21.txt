economy’s productive potential could be less than I judge, in which case inflationary 

pressures could emerge sooner than I expect.

Conclusion  

In summary, I expect the economic recovery to continue--indeed, to strengthen 

somewhat over time.  Even so, over the next several years, I anticipate that we will fall 

far short in achieving our maximum employment objective, and I expect inflation to 

remain at or below the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.  A range of considerations, 

including those relating to uncertainty and asymmetric risks, must inform one’s judgment 

on the appropriate stance of policy.  As I explained, a variety of analytical tools, 

including optimal control techniques and simple policy rules, can serve as useful 

benchmarks.  Based on such analysis, I consider a highly accommodative policy stance to 

be appropriate in present circumstances.  But considerable uncertainty surrounds the 

outlook, and I remain prepared to adjust my policy views in response to incoming 

information.  In particular, further easing actions could be warranted if the recovery 

proceeds at a slower-than-expected pace, while a significant acceleration in the pace of 

recovery could call for an earlier beginning to the process of policy firming than the 

FOMC currently anticipates.

 There is also some risk of significantly higher oil prices due to geopolitical events.  Such a shock would 

have ambiguous implications for monetary policy because, on the one hand, the contractionary effect of 

higher oil prices on output and unemployment argues for greater accommodation, while, on the other hand, 

the upward effect on inflation would argue for less.  In my view, as long as inflation expectations remain 

well anchored, then any higher inflation would be transitory--as proved to be the case last year--and the 

appropriate balance in fulfilling our dual mandate would likely imply little change in the path of short-term 

nominal rates, in part because such a policy response would cause real interest rates to be somewhat lower 

for a time and thereby provide additional policy accommodation.  Once again, then, the role of inflation 

expectations remains of central importance to the proper stance of policy.
