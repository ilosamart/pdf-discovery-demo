likely also supported investor demand for purchasing houses, as the expected return on an 

investment in housing is more likely to exceed the low yields available on Treasury 

securities and other debt instruments.  Households may be making the same calculus as 

investors. 

The interest-rate-sensitive housing market is affected by all of the tools of 

monetary policy, but purchases of agency MBS have a more direct effect on the mortgage 

market.  So, without delving deeply into monetary policy generally, I would like to make 

a few observations about the efficacy and costs of MBS purchases specifically.  In doing 

so, I want to reiterate that these are my views and may not be in accord with those of my 

colleagues on the FOMC.  

In many ways, purchases of MBS have the same downward effect on the general 

level of long-term interest rates as purchases of other longer-term securities.  But, in 

addition, purchases of agency MBS reduce the spread between Treasury and MBS yields 

and thus, compared with purchases of Treasury securities, have somewhat larger effects 

on mortgage rates.  This larger effect was especially true in the first round of purchases in 

2009 when investor uncertainty about the degree of government support for agency MBS 

was quite high.13  MBS purchases also influence MBS yields by affecting the cost of 

hedging the risk (known as convexity risk) that mortgages prepay more quickly when 

rates decline or more slowly when rates increase, because, unlike some mortgage market 

investors, the Federal Reserve does not hedge such risk.   

Lower MBS yields result in lower mortgage rates, which can spur the economy 

through elevated home-purchase and refinancing activity.  But this effect is not yet fully

Purchase Program Lower Mortgage Rates?” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 58 (July), pp. 498-514.
