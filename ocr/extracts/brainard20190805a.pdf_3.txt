supplies can be a game changer for small businesses, potentially avoiding the need for costly 

short-term financing.  

Last November, we asked the public about possible actions the Federal Reserve could 

take to support interbank settlement of faster payments.3 We received more than 350 comments 

on a Federal Reserve faster payment service, representing nearly 800 organizations. Fully 90 

percent of these comments called for the Federal Reserve to operate a real-time service for faster 

payments. Support came from a wide range of stakeholders, including individuals, merchants, 

fintech firms, and banks.4 Commenters noted that the Federal Reserve would ensure equitable 

access to banks of all sizes nationwide by operating a real-time service for faster payments 

alongside the private-sector system. Commenters highlighted the importance of safety in faster 

payments and noted the Federal Reserve’s record of resiliency, especially during periods of 

stress. Commenters observed that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service would 

increase competition, decrease market concentration, and provide a neutral platform for 

innovation.  

This broad support echoes and expands on the conclusions of the Faster Payments Task 

Force. Similarly, the U.S. Treasury Department recommended that “the Federal Reserve move 

quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the development of a real-

time settlement service that would also allow for more efficient and widespread access to 

innovative payment capabilities.”5
