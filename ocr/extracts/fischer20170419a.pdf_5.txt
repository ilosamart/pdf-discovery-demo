October 2016 WEO.5  There may well even be some chance that foreign economies kick 

into gear enough that U.S. and foreign business conditions become reasonably well 

aligned, as occurred during the U.S. monetary tightening cycles that began in 1999 and in 

2004.  In both of those episodes, U.S. exports grew substantially against the backdrop of 

a brisk expansion in foreign activity and a stable or even slightly depreciating dollar.   

Of course, it is hard to predict whether foreign economies continue to strengthen 

so that the global economy will move more in sync--as I hope--or if a substantial gap will 

remain between the business cycle positions of the United States and our foreign trading 

partners.  However, even if monetary policy divergence remains substantial, there is good 

reason to think that spillovers to foreign economies will be manageable.  First, I expect 

that the Fedâ€™s removal of accommodation will be driven by a continued expansion of the 

U.S. economy; thus, foreign economies are likely to benefit from the developments that 

induce the FOMC to tighten.  Second, most foreign central banks should be able to 

mitigate an undesirable tightening of their own financial conditions through appropriate 

policy actions.  An important lesson of the taper tantrum was that effective 

communication and actions by major central banks, including the European Central Bank 

and the Bank of England, were helpful in quickly pushing bond yields down to levels that 

these central banks regarded as appropriate to their economic situation.  Third, many 

EMEs have markedly improved fundamentals--including smaller current account deficits 

and more anchored inflation expectations--that should allow them to better withstand the 

effects of U.S. tightening, though some vulnerabilities remain.
