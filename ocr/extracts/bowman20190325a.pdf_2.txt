Good afternoon.  It is a great pleasure for me to join the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 

City in welcoming you to the Federal Reserve Board for the 2019 National Agricultural Credit 

Conference.  For nearly 80 years, these meetings have been at the forefront of important 

discussions for those with a stake in agricultural lending, with the first National Agricultural 

Credit meeting held in 1941.  At that time and with war looming, there was a clear need to ensure 

that our nation’s farmers had the resources and capability to support the nation in the wake of the 

great depression, deflation, and the dust bowl.  This meeting provided a vital forum for candid 

conversation, to exchange information, and to forge relationships that would enable lenders to 

take steps to ensure a sound future for agriculture--a future supported by the efficient and 

effective provision of credit.    

In the decades since that first meeting, this conference has seen a number of boom and 

bust cycles in agriculture, most often the result of volatile swings in commodity prices, land price 

valuations, and borrowing costs for agricultural business owners.  Through all of these 

challenges, this conference has provided an important opportunity to promote a greater 

understanding of emerging issues in agricultural finance.  Further, the success of these meetings 

largely depends on the interactions of everyone here today, so I want to thank you for attending 

and for participating.  I am honored to welcome you to the first conference meeting to be held at 

the Federal Reserve Board. And I’m pleased to support this group’s mission to foster discussion 

on issues pertaining to ag finance, and I look forward to meeting with you and learning from the 

discussion.   

Today and tomorrow, we will discuss recent developments in agricultural credit markets.  

We will also hear from presenters on topics that connect in various ways to the agricultural 

sector.  I am especially pleased to see there is a special focus on rural communities at this year’s 

meeting.  As many of you know, this topic holds a special place in my heart.  My family has deep 

roots in rural Kansas and a long history in farming, ranching, and ag banking.  I have spent much 

of my life and career living, working, and raising a family in a rural area.
