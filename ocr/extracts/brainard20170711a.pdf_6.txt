term interest rates, this lack of empirical consensus may simply reflect the difficulty of 

disentangling changes in short-term and longer-term interest rates, which are highly 

correlated.5 

Indeed, the greater sensitivity of exchange rates to expected short-term interest 

rates than to term premiums was a key rationale behind the Operation Twist strategy in 

the early 1960s.6  Under Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury made 

large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to drive down yields and 

stimulate the economy, which was suffering from an unemployment rate of nearly 7 

percent.  This policy was combined with a modest increase in short-term interest rates 

intended to alleviate the capital outflow pressures that threatened the sustainability of the 

Bretton Woods global monetary system.  Ultimately, this policy mix did succeed in 

reducing long-term interest rates, and also contributed to a reduction in private capital 

outflows that relieved pressure on U.S. international reserves, at least for a time.   

Let’s turn to a simulation of a highly stylized model to explore how a greater 

sensitivity of the exchange rate to conventional policy relative to balance sheet actions 

can make a difference in terms of cross-border transmission.  In particular, let’s assume a 

100-basis-point rise in long-term yields coming from the conventional channel of higher 

policy rates has double the effect on the exchange rate as a 100 basis point rise in yields 

coming from higher term premiums.7  If a large country, which is already at potential, 

experiences a favorable domestic demand shock, it would need to tighten monetary

attempts to identify separately the effects of forward guidance and asset purchases.

7 This simulation is shown in figure 1 in the appendix.  The stylized model is composed of two identical 
countries that are linked through trade flows.  The model is calibrated so that either type of policy action 
keeps the home country’s GDP at baseline.
