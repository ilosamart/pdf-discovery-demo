and aggressively in response to a recession, because doing so would help to reduce the 

depth and persistence of the downturn, thereby limiting the supply-side damage that 

might otherwise ensue.  In addition, if strong economic conditions can partially reverse 

supply-side damage after it has occurred, then policymakers may want to aim at being 

more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional 

view that supply is largely independent of demand.   

More research is needed, however, to better understand the influence of 

movements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply.8  From a policy perspective, we of 

course need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance, if maintained too 

long, could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial 

instability or undermining price stability.  More generally, the benefits and potential costs 

of pursuing such a strategy remain hard to quantify, and other policies might be better 

suited to address damage to the supply side of the economy.   

Heterogeneity 

My second question asks whether individual differences within broad groups of 

actors in the economy can influence aggregate economic outcomes--in particular, what 

effect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand? 

Many macroeconomists work with models where groups of individual actors, 

such as households or firms, are treated as a single “representative” agent whose behavior 

stands in for that of the group as a whole.  For example, rather than explicitly modeling 

                                                 
8 For example, the experience of the 1990s might seem to provide a natural case study of whether reverse 
hysteresis is possible.  Unfortunately, most studies of the labor market during this period do not directly 
speak to this issue, although Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2006) investigate changes in employers’ 
willingness to hire less-skilled workers during these years, while Katz and Krueger (1999) and my own 
study with Blinder (2001) explore the somewhat related question of how the U.S. economy was able to 
simultaneously experience rapid growth, low unemployment, and low inflation in the late 1990s.
