federal funds rate target near zero at least through mid-2013.6  This date-based guidance 

was more precise than the qualitative language the Committee had been using, and it 

appears to have been effective in communicating the FOMC’s commitment to a highly 

accommodative policy.  In particular, following the introduction of dates into the FOMC 

statement, interest rates and survey measures of policy expectations moved in ways 

broadly consistent with the guidance.7  

Although the date-based forward guidance appears to have affected the public’s 

expectations as desired, it did not explain how future policy would be affected by 

changes in the economic outlook--an important limitation.  Indeed, the date in the 

guidance was pushed out twice in 2012--first to late 2014 and then to mid-2015--leaving 

the public unsure about whether and under what circumstances further changes to the 

guidance might occur.8  In December of last year, the FOMC addressed this issue by 

tying its forward guidance about its policy rate more directly to its economic objectives.9  

Introducing so-called state-contingent guidance, the Committee announced for the first 

time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as 

unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations 

remained stable and near target.10  This formulation provided greater clarity about the

7 Evidence that this is the case has been provided by Campbell, Evans, Fisher, and Justiniano (2012), 
Swanson and Williams (2013), Raskin (2013), and by a recent study of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s survey of primary dealers (Femia, Friedman, and Sack, 2013).

10 See Board of Governors (2012c).  Specifically, the guidance says that the Committee anticipates that its 
0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the 
unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to 
be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 
inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  The FOMC asserted in its statement that it viewed the 
new thresholds to be consistent with the earlier, date-based guidance.  Femia, Friedman, and Sack (2013) 
present evidence that respondents to the survey of primary dealers largely shared this assessment.
