The third and fourth assignments relate to whether changes to the conduct of monetary 

policy in normal times could make financial instability and its wrenching and costly economic 

consequences less likely.  Number three involves considering whether central banks should use 

their conventional monetary policy tool--adjusting the level of a short-term interest rate--to try to 

rein in asset prices that seem to be moving well away from sustainable values, in addition to 

seeking to achieve the macroeconomic objectives of full employment and price stability.  The 

fourth and final assignment concerns whether central banks should adjust their inflation targets 

to reduce the odds of getting into a situation again where the policy interest rate reaches zero.1   

Changes in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve’s Liquidity Tools 

 Financial markets have evolved substantially in recent decades.  The task of 

intermediating between investors and borrowers has shifted over time from banks, which take 

deposits and make loans, to securities markets, where borrowers and savers meet more directly, 

albeit with the assistance of investment banks that help borrowers issue securities and then make 

markets in those securities.  An aspect of the shift has been the growth of securitization, in which 

loans that might have been on the books of banks are converted into securities and sold in 

markets.  Serious deficiencies with these securitizations, the associated derivative instruments, 

and the structures that evolved to hold securitized debt were at the heart of the financial crisis.  

Among other things, the structures exposed the banking system to risks that neither participants 

in financial markets nor regulators fully appreciated.   

The implications of these changes are far reaching, but I want to concentrate on those that 

bear on the tools we use to supply liquidity to the financial system.  Every central bank had to 

adapt its liquidity facilities to some degree, but the Federal Reserve had to adapt more than most.
