production and investment in China and other East Asian nations less attractive.  Also, 

technological progress will slow as the process of importing foreign technologies reaches 

its limits, forcing greater reliance on innovation in emerging countries themselves.  

Resource and environmental constraints, as well as aging populations, should also slow 

economic growth.  But in many ways, such a slowdown in growth will be the inevitable 

result of progress--the culmination of a successful catching up process--and in that 

respect should be viewed as a consequence of success, not of failure.  

Many emerging markets also will be challenged by their reliance on trade to drive 

growth.  As I have discussed, international trade has many benefits.  However, generating 

trade surpluses by suppressing domestic demand defeats the ultimate purpose of 

economic growth--improving the lot of the country’s own citizens.  Large and persistent 

imbalances in trade are also inconsistent, in the long run, with global economic and 

financial stability.  Of course, the advanced economies, like the United States, need to do 

their part as well in reducing global imbalances, as I have noted on numerous occasions 

before.  

In fact, with the emerging market economies accounting for a large and growing 

share of global activity, many of them can no longer view themselves as small, open 

economies whose actions have little effect on their neighbors.  With increasing size and 

influence comes greater responsibility.  In response to this new reality, many of our 

international institutions have been restructured in recent years to give an increased voice 

to the emerging market economies.  For example, the Group of Twenty (which has 

significant emerging market representation) has largely supplanted the Group of Seven as 

the premier global forum for economic and financial policy matters, and emerging market
