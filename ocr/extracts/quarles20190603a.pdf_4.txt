that expressly consider an end to LIBOR.2  I urge everyone to avail themselves of this 

work; it is, again, important for prudent risk management and your fiduciary 

responsibilities that you incorporate better fallback language.  Issuers should demand it of 

themselves, and investors should demand it of issuers.   

There is, however, also another and easier path, which is simply to stop using 

LIBOR.  At this moment, many seem to take comfort in continuing to use LIBOR—it is 

familiar, and it remains liquid.  But history may not view that decision kindly; after 

LIBOR stops, it may be fairly difficult to explain to those who may ask exactly why it 

made sense to continue using a rate that you had been clearly informed had such 

significant risks attached to it.  And make no mistake—as good as the fallback language 

may be, simply relying on fallback language to transition brings a number of operational 

risks and economic risks.  Firms should be incorporating these factors into their projected 

cost of continuing to use LIBOR, and investors and borrowers should consider them 

when they are offered LIBOR instruments.  If you do consider these factors, then I 

believe you will see that it is in your interest to move away from LIBOR.   

In convening the ARRC, we have set a model of public-private sector cooperation 

to address a key financial stability risk.  Ultimately, the private sector must drive this 

transition—these are private contracts, and each of you must choose how you can best 

address this risk—but the public sector must help.  At a recent roundtable on the LIBOR 

transition held by the Financial Stability Board, we heard calls from the private sector to 

provide greater clarity on regulatory and tax implications of the transition and also calls 

for a more “muscular” regulatory approach.
