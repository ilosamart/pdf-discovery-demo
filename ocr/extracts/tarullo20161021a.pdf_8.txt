One might fairly characterize the current regulatory approach to shadow banking as one 

that examines, in turn, significant forms of credit intermediation outside the banking system and 

determines whether some type of prudential regulation is needed.  In the terms I introduced a 

moment ago, regulators look at a particular form, such as money market funds.  If no significant 

risks to financial stability are identified, or if some regulation to counteract those risks is 

implemented, the form of intermediation may then be thought of as relatively safe (at least from 

a systemic perspective) market-based finance.  The virtue of this approach is that it allows for a 

very tailored regulatory response.  But, as you can imagine, this approach necessarily involves a 

good bit of active oversight on an ongoing basis, both of measures previously taken and of new 

channels of nonbank intermediation as they arise. 

An alternative approach would be to define shadow banking in broadly applicable terms, 

with specified regulatory consequences that ensue more or less automatically, regardless of 

whether the entity conducting the shadow banking is otherwise subject to prudential regulation.  

To date, the attempts I have seen along these lines look likely to entail substantial overinclusion, 

substantial underinclusion, or regulatory consequences that are inappropriately uniform.  And, in 

the United States and other jurisdictions, it is not clear that authority exists to take this approach, 

either by an individual regulatory agency or even collectively.  But, as with hypothesizing a 

functionally-based regulatory system more generally, hypothesizing a broadly applicable 

regulatory definition can usefully inform the direction of the current regulatory approach of 

activity-by-activity scrutiny. 

Of course, while the current approach allows for an ad hoc consideration of the 

particulars of each activity, it still requires at least a general filter for identifying sources of 

systemic risk.  My own sense is that the greatest risks to financial stability lie in activities with
