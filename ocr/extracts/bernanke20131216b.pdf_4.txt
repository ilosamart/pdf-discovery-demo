But, finally, we must also recognize that the Fed’s ability to make and implement 

such decisions ultimately depends on the public’s understanding and acceptance of our 

actions.  For this reason, we must continue to emphasize two other essential values--

transparency and accountability.  We must do all that we can to explain our actions and to 

show how they serve the public interest.  That’s why we must welcome communication, 

broadly defined.  Of course, we will continue to talk to economists and market 

participants, but that is not enough.  Ultimately, the legitimacy of our policies rests on the 

understanding and support of the broader American public, whose interests we are 

working to serve.  The ability of this institution to support a healthy economy--an 

economy with high levels of employment, low inflation, and a stable financial system--

will require our continued efforts to engage in two-way communication--explaining our 

actions and, importantly, listening to what our fellow citizens have to say. 

Let me end by thanking the organizers of this event and, in particular, all of the 

past and present policymakers in attendance for helping us mark this centennial milestone 

in such a memorable fashion.
