with the principle embodied in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 

Act that prudential regulation should be progressively more stringent as banks pose greater risks 

to financial stability.  As I will discuss in a moment, this principle also lies behind some of the 

post-crisis frameworks developed by the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board 

(FSB).   

For home countries, the relatively longstanding principle that regulators should exercise 

effective consolidated supervision remains critical, though I would emphasize that the regulation 

imposed by home jurisdictions is of equal--if not greater--importance.  It is important to 

emphasize that this obligation is not a substitute for host country regulation and supervision of 

foreign banking organizations.  The home jurisdiction regulatory structure must ensure that the 

banks are fundamentally safe and sound, and that the parent will generally be able to support its 

operations around the world.  Here, of course, a major shortcoming of the pre-crisis regime 

becomes apparent, in that capital and other regulatory requirements for internationally active 

banks were simply not strong enough.   

Consolidated supervision must contain the risks to the financial system created by 

banking activity that is not fully captured by regulations.  It must also ensure that banks do not 

hide problems by shifting assets or liabilities around their global operations and, more generally, 

that the banks are fundamentally safe and sound so as to forestall possible contagion risk to 

foreign operations.   

Within these admittedly broad guidelines, there is obviously room for host countries to 

balance the benefits and risks presented by foreign banking organizations in a number of 

different ways.  Their choices will be affected by policy preferences, the characteristics of their 

domestic financial systems, and the relative importance of foreign banks in those systems.  The
