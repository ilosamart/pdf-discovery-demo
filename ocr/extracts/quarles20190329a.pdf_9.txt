Nonetheless, judgment must play an important role in this process, especially in assessing 

how interactions between vulnerabilities may serve to mute or amplify the transmission 

of different kinds of shocks.  The framework requires further judgment as to whether the 

CCyB is the most appropriate tool to address the particular areas of concern, which will 

depend on, among other things, the extent to which banks subject to the CCyB are 

exposed to vulnerabilities or contributing to them. 

Assessing the current state of financial vulnerabilities is thus a critical part of the 

decision on whether to activate the CCyB.  Let me briefly give you my view of each of 

the four categories in turn.
