The financial and economic crisis that started in 2007 tested central banks as they had not 

been tested for many decades.  We needed to take swift and decisive action to limit the damage 

to the economy from the spreading distress in financial markets.  Because the financial distress 

was so deep and pervasive and because it took place in financial markets whose structure had 

evolved dramatically, our actions also needed to be innovative if they were to have a chance of 

being effective.  Many central banks made substantial changes to traditional policy tools as the 

crisis unfolded.  But the epicenter of the financial shock was in U.S. mortgage markets, with 

severe effects on many of our financial institutions, and our financial markets had perhaps 

evolved more than many others.  As a consequence, no central bank innovated more dramatically 

than the Federal Reserve.   

We traditionally have provided backup liquidity to sound depository institutions.  But in 

the crisis, to support financial markets, we had to provide liquidity to nonbank financial 

institutions as well.  Just as we were forced to adapt and innovate in meeting our liquidity 

provision responsibilities, we also needed to adapt and innovate in the conduct of monetary 

policy.  Very early in the crisis, it became evident that lowering short-term policy rates alone 

would not be sufficient to counter the adverse shock to the U.S. economy and financial system.  

We needed to go further--much further, in fact--to ease financial conditions and thus encourage 

spending and support employment.  We took steps to reinforce public understanding of our 

inflation objective to prevent the development of deflationary expectations; we provided 

guidance on the possible future course of our policy interest rate; and we purchased large 

amounts of longer-term securities, and in the process created unprecedented volumes of bank 

reserves.  Now, careful planning is under way to remove that stimulus at the appropriate time.
