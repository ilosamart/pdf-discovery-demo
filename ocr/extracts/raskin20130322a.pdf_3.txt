the hardest.  The poverty rate has risen sharply since the onset of the recession, after a 

decade of relative stability, and it now stands at 15 percent--significantly higher than the 

average over the past three decades.1  And those who are fortunate enough to have held 

onto their jobs have seen their hourly compensation barely keep pace with the cost of 

living over the past three years.2    

 While today’s 7.7 percent unemployment rate is a marked improvement from the 

10 percent rate we reached in late 2009, it is still higher than the unemployment rate for 

the 24 years before the Great Recession, a span of time over which the rate averaged 

about 6 percent.  Moreover, the government's current estimate of 12 million unemployed 

does not include nearly a million discouraged workers who say they have given up 

looking for work and 8 million people who say that they are working part time even 

though they would prefer a full-time job.  A broader measure of underemployment that 

includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.3 percent.  

About two-thirds of all job losses resulting from the recession were in moderate-

wage occupations, such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration 

jobs.  However, these occupations have accounted for less than one-quarter of subsequent 

job gains.  The declines in lower-wage occupations--such as retail sales and food service-

-accounted for about one-fifth of job loss, but a bit more than one-half of subsequent job 

gains.  Indeed, recent job gains have been largely concentrated in lower-wage

unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma is 11.2 percent.  Among workers age 16 to 19, the 
unemployment rate is 25.1 percent.  Compared with the 7.7 percent unemployment rate for all workers, the 
unemployment rate among African Americans is 13.8 percent, and 9.6 percent among Latinos.
