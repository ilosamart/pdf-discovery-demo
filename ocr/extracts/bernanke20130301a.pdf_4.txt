All three components of the 10-year yield have declined since 2007.  The 

decomposition attributes much of the decline in the yield since 2010 to a sharp fall in the 

term premium, but the expected short-term real rate component also moved down 

significantly.  Let’s consider each component more closely.  

The expected inflation component has drifted gradually downward for many years 

and has become quite stable.  In large part, the downward trend and stabilization of 

expected inflation in the United States are products of the increasing credibility of the 

Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability.  In January 2012, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) underscored this commitment by issuing a statement--since 

reaffirmed at its January 2013 meeting--on its longer-run goals and policy strategy, which 

included a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent.

  The anchoring of long-term inflation 

expectations near 2 percent has been a key factor influencing long-term interest rates over 

recent years.  It almost certainly helped mitigate the strong disinflationary pressures 

immediately following the crisis.  While I have not shown expected inflation for other 

advanced economies, the pictures would be very similar--again, except for Japan.  

With the expected inflation component of the 10-year rate near 2 percent and the 

rate itself a bit below 2 percent recently, it is clear that the combination of the other two 

components--the expected path of short-term real interest rates and the term premium--

must make a small net negative contribution. 

                                                                                                                                                 
this information, the model can be used to produce estimates of the components of nominal yields shown in 

chart 2.  Note that inflation in chart 2 is measured by the consumer price index; inflation measured by this 
index is close to but on average slightly higher than inflation as measured by the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures, the measure to which the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent inflation 

objective refers.

 For example, this decomposition as estimated based on expectations as reported in the Blue Chip 

Financial Forecasts gives broadly similar results, as do many standard term structure models.
