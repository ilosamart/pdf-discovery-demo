channel of monetary policy; and banks’ mortgage lending policies directly affect their 

own safety and soundness as well as the access of creditworthy households to mortgage 

credit.  My remarks today will focus on current housing market conditions and on how 

housing problems have affected borrowers, lenders, communities, and the broader 

economy.  I’ll also discuss some specific sources of our housing problems, including 

tight conditions in the mortgage market and the overhang of foreclosed and vacant 

homes. 

Overview of the State of the Housing Market 

One way to understand conditions in the housing market is to focus on the balance 

of supply and demand.  For the past few years, the actual and potential supply of single-

family homes has greatly exceeded the effective demand.  The elevated number of homes 

that are currently vacant instead of owner occupied reflects the imbalance.  According to 

the most recent estimate, about 1-3/4 million homes are currently unoccupied and for 

sale.  While this figure has declined slightly during the past few years, it is nonetheless up 

dramatically from the first half of the 2000s, when readings of about 1-1/4 million vacant 

homes were the norm.  Of course, housing conditions vary by region, and vacancy rates 

in some locations are substantially higher than the national average.  For example, here in 

Florida the homeowner vacancy rate in the third quarter of 2011 averaged 3.2 percent, 

compared with the national average of 2.4 percent.

Moreover, a very large number of additional homes are poised to come on the 

owner-occupied market.  In each of the past few years, roughly 2 million homes have 

entered the foreclosure process, and many of these homes have been put up for sale,
