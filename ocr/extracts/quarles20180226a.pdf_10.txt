There are those who argue a more optimistic take on the prospects for technology 

developments to boost productivity growth.11  For example, a number of new 

technologies, including artificial intelligence and genetic sequencing, appear on the cusp 

of breaking out, with widespread effects on economic activity.12 

Also, it might be true that productivity growth will be nudged higher by the pace 

of economic activity.  Tight labor markets might induce firms to invest more in robotics 

and other labor-saving technology.   

External developments.  With global growth picking up steam, the external 

environment is more favorable for U.S. growth than it has been in quite some time.  In 

2017, for example, the contribution of real exports to growth picked up markedly 

following two years in which exports provided no support to growth at all.           

What Are the Consequences of Higher Growth? 

Again, I think it is too soon to call a turning point in the long-run growth 

prospects of the economy, notwithstanding some encouraging signs that I have 

highlighted.  All the same, I think it is worthwhile to acknowledge that there are some 

upside risks to the forecast and to think through what the consequences of those risks 

materializing might be.     

One consequence might be that a sustained increase in growth could be associated 

with an increase in the natural rate of interest, a concept that has developed a prominent 

position in the lexicon of central banking in recent years.  One conception of the natural 

rate of interest is the rate of interest necessary to sustain stable prices and full 

                                                 
11 See Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) and Baily, Manyika, and Gupta (2013).   
12 Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson (2017) argue that lags in the adoption of new technology could explain 

the paradox between apparent advances in technology and continued weak productivity growth.  They are 

referring specifically to artificial intelligence, but the argument could also hold for other fields.
