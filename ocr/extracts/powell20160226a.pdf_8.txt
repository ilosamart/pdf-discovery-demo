inflation.”15  This language shows that the Committee has moved away from the time-

based guidance of the crisis years. 

Although time-based guidance can create communications challenges, I see other 

factors as having been more important in recent years.  In particular, the challenge of 

deciding when and how to use unconventional tools--and ultimately when and how to 

reduce that usage--is a great one.  The task of communicating clearly about those 

decisions is equally great.  And the reality of the FOMC’s size and diversity, not to 

mention uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and the effects of 

monetary policy actions, means that we are still far from the ideal world of a fully 

worked out, clearly specified and transparent consensus on what economists call a 

“reaction function”--a complete description of how policy will respond to changes in 

economic conditions. 

Often when communicating about the path of policy, it will be hard to avoid a 

combination of the two forms of guidance.  For example, the Committee has embraced 

the view that the equilibrium level of the federal funds rate is currently below its pre-

crisis level and expects the funds rate to return only gradually to its longer-run value.16  

This view is a key aspect of many Committee participants’ reaction functions, including 

mine.  Try saying that without referring to time.

will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds 
rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  (Board
