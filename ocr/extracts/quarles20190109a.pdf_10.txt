subsidiaries, the states’ focus is on policyholder protection, while the Board serves as the overall 

firm’s consolidated safety-and-soundness supervisor.   

The Board’s capital standard also must comport with federal law for insurance holding 

companies with depository institution subsidiaries, while the NAIC’s GCC interfaces primarily 

with state laws.  Moreover, because of the characteristics of the current population of insurance 

thrift holding companies, the BBA currently would only need to scale between two regimes: the 

NAIC’s insurance risk-based capital regime and federal bank capital rules.  By contrast, the firms 

to which the GCC may apply can encompass operations in a number of non-U.S. jurisdictions, 

calling for a much more extensive set of scaling parameters.   

The NAIC has announced its plan to conduct a field test of the GCC this spring.  

Likewise, to be transparent, gather additional input, and provide a valuable test of our approach, 

the Federal Reserve intends to conduct a quantitative impact study of the BBA as part of our 

rulemaking process.  We hope supervised firms will take advantage of this opportunity to 

contribute valuable information and feedback on our approach. 

Our dialogue with the NAIC and state insurance regulators has been productive and 

helpful in the BBA’s development.  Moreover, this engagement has been helpful for Team 

USA’s efforts in the international insurance standard-setting arena.   

The Federal Reserve’s Advocacy in International Insurance Standard Setting 

It is our intent that the Federal Reserve’s development of the BBA, together with the 

NAIC’s development of the GCC, will assist with Team USA’s advocacy of an aggregation 

method that can be deemed comparable to the ICS.   

In 2013, through the Federal Reserve’s role as consolidated supervisor of certain insurers, 

we joined the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), strengthening our
