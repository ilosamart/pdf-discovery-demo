containing risk-taking?  In other words, what does the institutions view tell us about why 

credit markets sometimes overheat? 

Let me suggest three factors that can contribute to overheating.  The first is 

financial innovation.  While financial innovation has provided important benefits to 

society, the institutions perspective warns of a dark side, which is that innovation can 

create new ways for agents to write puts that are not captured by existing rules.  For this 

reason, policymakers should be on alert any time there is rapid growth in a new product 

that is not yet fully understood.  Perhaps the best explanation for the existence of second-

generation securitizations like subprime CDOs is that they evolved in response to flaws 

in prevailing models and incentive schemes.

  Going back further, a similar story can be 

told about the introduction of payment-in-kind (PIK) interest features in the high-yield 

bonds used in the leveraged buyouts (LBOs) of the late 1980s.  I donâ€™t think it was a 

coincidence that among the buyers of such PIK bonds were savings and loan associations, 

at a time when many were willing to take risks to boost their accounting incomes.   

The second closely related factor on my list is changes in regulation.  New 

regulation will tend to spur further innovation, as market participants attempt to minimize 

the private costs created by new rules.  And it may also open up new loopholes, some of 

which may be exploited by variants on already existing instruments.  

The third factor that can lead to overheating is a change in the economic 

environment that alters the risk-taking incentives of agents making credit decisions.  For

 To be clear, I do not intend this critique to apply to first-generation securitizations, such as RMBS, asset-

backed securities collateralized by auto and credit card loans, or collateralized loan obligations (where the 

collateral pool is composed of bank loans).  As a number of academic studies have emphasized, the basic 

pooling-and-tranching structure of these securitizations can help reduce adverse selection problems in 

markets, and thereby increase liquidity and reduce financing costs.  See, for example, Gorton, and 

Pennacchi (1990), DeMarzo and Duffie (1999), and DeMarzo (2005).
