I gave a speech on monetary policy independence and modern central banking at 

the tercentenary celebration, in which I made the case for central bank independence and 

concluded with the sentence “On her 300th birthday, it is time to allow the Old Lady to 

take on the responsibilities of independence.”2  At that time, visitors to Britain who raised 

the issue of independence for the Bank of England were typically treated to a lecture on 

why that was not possible in the British political system.  Nonetheless, independence was 

granted to the Bank of England by a newly elected Labour government in 1997, and 

subsequent researchers have linked this independence to declines in both longer-term 

inflation risk premiums and inflation expectations.3   

The literature I discussed in my 1994 speech was developed with an emphasis--

based on post-World War II experience--on the problem of preventing high inflation.  But 

we are no longer in that era.  The inflation problem with which most of the leading 

economies are dealing is inflation that is too low, not too high.  Further, now that we have 

had time to understand better the damage that the global financial crisis has wreaked on 

the world economy, and after much research on the effect of major financial crises on 

growth and on the dynamics of business cycles, we are focused to a much greater extent 

than in the past on the importance of financial stability. 

I would like to use our time tonight to reflect on how the analysis of central bank 

independence of 20 years ago should be updated to reflect the different economic 

environment in which we are now living.  I shall argue that, although high inflation is not 

the immediate concern that it was in the 1980s and 1990s, monetary policy independence 

                                                 
2 The lecture, titled “Modern Central Banking,” was printed in the conference volume, Capie and others 
(1994).  A standalone version, including revisions following the discussion at that conference, is available 
as Fischer (1995a).
