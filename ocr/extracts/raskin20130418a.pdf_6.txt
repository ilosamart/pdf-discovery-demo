income distribution, and the effect of that variation on aggregate consumption--and, 

ultimately, growth--requires more exploration.3   

But since household behavior is surely driven by more than the size of the 

paycheck coming in the proverbial front door, the distribution of wealth--as distinct from 

the distribution of income--could have clearer implications for the macroeconomy.  

Indeed, wealth inequality is greater than income inequality in the United States, although 

it has widened little in recent decades.  For example, according to the Survey of 

Consumer Finances (SCF), a survey conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve 

Board, the top one-fifth of families ranked by income owned 72 percent of the total 

wealth in the economy in 2010, whereas families in the bottom one-fifth of the income 

distribution together owned only 3 percent of total wealth in 2010.4     

Hence, families with more-modest incomes have much less wealth to cushion 

themselves against income shocks, such as unemployment.  For example, in 2010, the 

median value of financial assets was less than $1,000 for families in the lowest income 

quintile.  Moreover, what wealth low- and middle-income families do have is typically 

                                                 
3 One concern with rising inequality and stagnating wages is that low- and middle-income households will 
turn to credit and wealth extraction to maintain their consumption growth.  One sign of this behavior would 
be consumption inequality rising much less than income inequality.  Researchers--including Krueger and 
Perri (2006); Aguiar and Bils (2011); and Attanasio, Hurst, and Pistaferri (2012)--have produced mixed 
findings on this basic question, although, taken together, there is growing evidence that consumption 
inequality has also risen substantially over the past several decades.  See Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri 
(2006), “Does Income Inequality Lead to Consumption Inequality?  Evidence and Theory,” Review of 
Economic Studies, vol. 73 (January), pp. 163-93; Mark A. Aguiar and Mark Bils (2011), “Has 
Consumption Inequality Mirrored Income Inequality?” NBER Working Paper Series 16807 (Cambridge, 
Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, February); and Orazio Attanasio, Erik Hurst, and Luigi 
Pistaferri (2012), “The Evolution of Income, Consumption, and Leisure Inequality in the US, 1980-2010,”

4 The specific measure used to group families for these wealth calculations is the stable component of 
income, referred to in the SCF as “normal” or “usual” income.  In the SCF, after families have reported 
their actual incomes for the year, they are asked whether this was a normal year.  If the answer is no, they 
are asked what their income usually would be in a normal year.  Using normal income as a classifier 
removes the systematic bias in average wealth that arises when, for example, normally high-income 
families are temporarily in the lowest income group because they had a particularly bad year.
