situation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are 

not solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are 

actually observed.23  Such conditions--which arguably prevailed in the United States from 

the 1970s to the mid-1990s--could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past, 

allowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur.  In this case, the 

temporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in 

inflation.  This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period 

of rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future 

inflation.  A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the 

level of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization.     

By contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps 

because the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some 

specified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so.  

Then the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import 

prices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B.  In this 

case, inflation will deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are 

rising.  But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence 

of other disturbances.24   

A key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well-anchored 

inflation expectations greatly enhances a central bank’s ability to pursue both of its 

                                                 
23 An expectations-augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually 
respond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve. 
24 Qualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations--
including the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--in which the 
long-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation 
objective.
