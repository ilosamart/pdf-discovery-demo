underwriting standards while clarifying the degree to which anticipated distribution of loans 

through syndication constitutes risk mitigation.  In addition, supervisory expectations concerning 

risk-management standards applicable to the syndication activity--in particular, the management 

of “pipeline risk” related to the warehousing of loans awaiting distribution--could be made more 

stringent.      

The need to deploy an enhanced set of tools and standards to promote financial stability 

has been widely recognized in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  In the United States, for 

example, more rigorous prudential standards will be applied to systemically important financial 

institutions to ensure that these firms internalize the costs of the risks they pose to the financial 

system and the economy.  Likewise, systemically important institutions will be required to 

develop living wills, or plans to facilitate their resolution in the event of insolvency.  Novel tools 

may be needed, however, to limit--or lean against--the buildup of financial sector imbalances 

that span multiple institutions and markets.  Approaches that have been used in other countries 

when policymakers determine that credit growth and risk-taking have become excessive include, 

for example, restrictions on underwriting practices, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios, loan-

to-income ratios, and debt-to-income ratios.  Of course, the use of such tools must be carefully 

evaluated in the context of the particular imbalance that policymakers are seeking to address, and 

judged both on their potential benefits and potential costs.            

Should monetary policy itself be adjusted to address emerging financial imbalances?  

Given the damage that financial imbalances can cause if not addressed in a timely fashion, I 

would not categorically rule out the use of monetary policy when dangerous imbalances are 

building and prudential steps seem ineffective.  However, calibrating the magnitude of a 

monetary policy response to address financial imbalances--even assuming that these can be
