has invested in connections and customer service relationships with nearly every bank, small and 

large, across the country.  

Currently, we provide payment services to nearly all banks either directly or indirectly. 

With our 12 regional Reserve Banks, we have the capacity to meet the needs of banks serving 

different communities and with different needs and operating models. For that reason, 

commenters stated that the Federal Reserve is uniquely positioned to offer nationwide access to a 

new payment and settlement service for faster payments. FedNow will allow faster payments to 

reach banks of all sizes and their customers across the country, which is especially important for 

rural communities, who often struggle with access to financial services.  

Guided by our public mission, the Federal Reserve serves the needs of all banks, no 

matter how small or challenging to reach, and with competitive fairness. In response to our 

request for feedback last November, several commenters emphasized how much they value the 

Federal Reserveâ€™s mission of providing nationwide access on fair, transparent terms and 

expressed concern that a sole private-sector RTGS service provider may be less likely to exhibit 

the same commitment over the long run.  

Safety is also vital. If the Federal Reserve does not establish the FedNow Service, there 

will be a single provider of real-time retail payment services. We are mindful of the serious 

safety issues associated with a single point of failure, a risk that will rise as faster payments 

grow. Stakeholders have noted the importance of having access to more than one real-time 

payment service for back-up purposes in order to provide resiliency through redundancy. In fact, 

many banks already take advantage of having connections to multiple operators today in check, 

ACH, and wire services. The Federal Reserve has always had a vital role in promoting the safety 

and stability of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity
