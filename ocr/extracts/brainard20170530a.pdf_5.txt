the core measure of inflation, which abstracts from the transitory movements in energy 

prices and is a better predictor of future inflation.  In the April report, the core measure--

that is, excluding food and energy prices--had increased only 1.5 percent on a 12-month 

change basis.  That reading marks a considerable shortfall from the Committee’s 

2 percent objective.  And there does not seem to have been any progress over the past 

year or so:  Core PCE inflation is about the same over the past 12 months as over the 

preceding period.  Although the past two monthly readings of core inflation have been 

held down in part by idiosyncratic factors, including upgrades to cell-phone plans, the 

apparent lack of progress in moving core inflation back to 2 percent is a source of 

concern. 

Traditionally, economists assessed that as labor market slack diminished and the 

economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result, in the 

statistical relationship known as the Phillips curve.  But I am not confident we can count 

on the Phillips curve to restore inflation to target in today’s economy.  Since 2012, 

inflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier 

decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably.4  At a time when the 

unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.4 percent, core inflation has 

undershot our 2 percent target for 58 straight months.5  In other words, the Phillips curve 

appears to be flatter today than it was previously.  This is also true in a number of 

advanced foreign economies, where declines in unemployment rates to low levels have 

failed to generate significant upward pressures on inflation.

the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent during the Great Recession.
