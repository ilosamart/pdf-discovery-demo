3. What is the risk that the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy will lead to 

inflation? 

4. How does the Fed’s monetary policy affect savers and investors? 

5. How is the Federal Reserve held accountable in our democratic society? 

What Are the Fed’s Objectives, and How Is It Trying to Meet Them? 

 The first question on my list concerns the Federal Reserve’s objectives and the 

tools it has to try to meet them. 

As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting a 

healthy economy--broadly speaking, an economy with low unemployment, low and 

stable inflation, and a financial system that meets the economy’s needs for credit and 

other services and that is not itself a source of instability.  We pursue these goals through 

a variety of means.  Together with other federal supervisory agencies, we oversee banks 

and other financial institutions.  We monitor the financial system as a whole for possible 

risks to its stability.  We encourage financial and economic literacy, promote equal access 

to credit, and advance local economic development by working with communities, 

nonprofit organizations, and others around the country.  We also provide some basic 

services to the financial sector--for example, by processing payments and distributing 

currency and coin to banks.   

But today I want to focus on a role that is particularly identified with the Federal 

Reserve--the making of monetary policy.  The goals of monetary policy--maximum 

employment and price stability--are given to us by the Congress.  These goals mean, 

basically, that we would like to see as many Americans as possible who want jobs to 

have jobs, and that we aim to keep the rate of increase in consumer prices low and stable.
