Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  Fifteen years ago, during the 

period now referred to as the Great Moderation, the topic of this symposium was 

“Adapting to a Changing Economy.”  In opening the proceedings, then-Chairman Alan 

Greenspan famously declared that “uncertainty is not just an important feature of the 

monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.”1  On the 

doorstep of the period now referred to as the Global Financial Crisis, surely few, if any, 

at that symposium would have imagined how shockingly different the next 15 years 

would be from the 15 years that preceded it. 

Over the course of a long recovery, the U.S. economy has strengthened 

substantially.  The unemployment rate has declined steadily for almost nine years and, at 

3.9 percent, is now near a 20-year low.  Most people who want jobs can find 

them.  Inflation has moved up and is now near the Federal Open Market Committee’s 

(FOMC) objective of 2 percent after running generally below that level for six 

years.  With solid household and business confidence, healthy levels of job creation, 

rising incomes, and fiscal stimulus arriving, there is good reason to expect that this strong 

performance will continue.   

As the economy has strengthened, the FOMC has gradually raised the federal 

funds rate from its crisis-era low near zero toward more normal levels.  We are also 

allowing our securities holdings--assets acquired to support the economy during the deep 

recession and the long recovery--to decline gradually as these securities are paid off.  I 

will explain today why the Committee’s consensus view is that this gradual process of 

normalization remains appropriate.  As always, there are risk factors abroad and at home
