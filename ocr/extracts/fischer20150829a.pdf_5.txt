models we maintain at the Federal Reserve.4  The estimated pass-through from import 

prices to consumer price inflation occurs relatively quickly, with effects becoming 

evident within a quarter and the bulk of the overall effect occurring within one year.  By 

contrast, the portion of the dollar effects on inflation that work through the channel of 

overall economic activity occurs with considerable lags.  In the model shown here, the 

appreciation has its largest effect on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second 

year after the shock.  Thus, it is plausible to think that the rise in the dollar over the past 

year would restrain growth of real GDP through 2016 and perhaps into 2017 as well.  The 

rise in the dollar since last summer, of about 17 percent in nominal terms, with its 

associated declines in non-oil import prices, could plausibly be holding down core 

inflation quite noticeably this year. 

  Commodity prices other than oil are also of relevance for inflation in the United 

States.  Prices of metals and other industrial commodities, and agricultural products, are 

affected to a considerable extent by developments outside the United States, and the 

softness we’ve seen in these commodity prices, has in part reflected a slowing of demand 

from China and elsewhere.  These prices likely have also been a factor in holding down 

inflation in the United States.  

The dynamics with which all these factors affect inflation depend crucially on the 

behavior of inflation expectations.  One striking feature of the economic environment is

Paper Series 2005-835 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January), 

www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2005/835/ifdp835r.pdf.  This model incorporates monetary policy 

responses to economic shocks and thus may show smaller effects on real GDP and inflation than other 

partial-equilibrium analyses.  That said, the SIGMA model is just one of a number of models that the Board 

staff regularly consults to inform their analysis of the U.S. economy.
