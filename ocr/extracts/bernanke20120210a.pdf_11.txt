The problem of tight mortgage credit will not be solved easily or quickly.  The 

Federal Reserve, in its supervisory capacity, continues to encourage lenders to find ways 

to maintain prudent lending standards while serving creditworthy borrowers.  But the 

slow recovery of the housing market and the economy, continued uncertainty surrounding 

the future of the GSEs and the regulatory environment for mortgage lending, the likely 

continued absence of a private-label market, and more cautious attitudes by lenders are 

all barriers to rapid normalization of the flow of mortgage credit.  

Overhang of Empty and Foreclosed Homes 

To date, policymakers have been focusing on refinancing creditworthy (but 

sometimes underwater) borrowers, on loan modifications, and on other ways to avert 

additional foreclosures.  This work is obviously very important.  But unfortunately, not 

all foreclosures can be prevented.  Given the weak economy and high unemployment 

rates, some borrowers simply do not have the wherewithal to meet monthly mortgage 

payments even if their loans were to be substantially modified.  Therefore, we have seen 

increased interest in whether anything can be done to reduce the overhang of empty and 

foreclosed homes.

We estimate that about one-fourth of the excess supply of vacant homes for sale 

in the second quarter of 2011 was owned by creditors; these homes are often referred to 

as real estate owned, or REO properties.

  Moreover, Federal Reserve staff estimate that 

distressed sales, which include both short sales and non-auction sales of foreclosed

 For a discussion of some of the tradeoffs that policymakers might take into account in considering 

whether to expand these efforts to reduce the overhang of empty and foreclosed homes further, see Board 

of Governors, “The U.S. Housing Market” (see note 1).

 The inventory of REO for sale is roughly 140,000 units above its 2004 level, while the inventory of 

vacant homes for sale is roughly 600,000 units above its 2004 level, per Federal Reserve staff calculations 

based on data from CoreLogic and the Housing Vacancy Survey.
