Despite the recent gains, the level of housing market activity remains 

low.  Existing home sales are currently at levels in line with those seen in the late 1990s, 

while single-family starts and permits are at levels commensurate with the early 

1990s.  And applications for home-purchase mortgages, as measured by the Mortgage 

Bankers Association index, were at a level in line with that of the mid-1990s 

(figure 5).  The subdued level of mortgage purchase originations is particularly striking 

given the record low mortgage rates that have prevailed in recent years. 

The drop in originations has been most pronounced among borrowers with lower 

credit scores.  For example, between 2007 and 2012, originations of prime purchase 

mortgages fell about 30 percent for borrowers with credit scores greater than 780, 

compared with a drop of about 90 percent for borrowers with credit scores between 

620 and 680 (figure 6).

  Originations are virtually nonexistent for borrowers with credit 

scores below 620.  The distribution of credit scores in these purchase origination data 

tells the same story in a different way:  The median credit score on these originations rose 

from 730 in 2007 to 770 in 2013, whereas scores for mortgages at the 10th percentile rose 

from 640 to 690 (figure 7).   

Many borrowers who have faced difficulty in obtaining prime mortgages have 

turned to mortgages insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA),

 These calculations are based on data provided by McDash Analytics, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of 

Lender Processing Services, Inc.  The underlying data are provided by mortgage servicers.  These servicers 

classify loans as “prime,” “subprime,” or “FHA.”  Prime loans include those eligible for sale to the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) as well as those with favorable credit characteristics but loan 

sizes that exceed the GSE guidelines (“jumbo” loans).
