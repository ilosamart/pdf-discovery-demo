could be obtained through a standard ARM.  Clearly, for lenders and borrowers focused 

on minimizing the initial payment, the choice of mortgage type was far more important 

than the level of short-term interest rates. 

The availability of these alternative mortgage products proved to be quite 

important and, as many have recognized, is likely a key explanation of the housing 

bubble.  Slide 8 shows the percentage of variable-rate mortgages originated with various 

exotic features, beginning in 2000.  As you can see, the use of these nonstandard features 

increased rapidly from early in the decade through 2005 or 2006.  Because such features 

are presumably not appropriate for many borrowers, Slide 8 is evidence of a protracted 

deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards, which was further exacerbated by 

practices such as the use of no-documentation loans.  The picture that emerges is 

consistent with many accounts of the period:  At some point, both lenders and borrowers 

became convinced that house prices would only go up.  Borrowers chose, and were 

extended, mortgages that they could not be expected to service in the longer term.  They 

were provided these loans on the expectation that accumulating home equity would soon 

allow refinancing into more sustainable mortgages.  For a time, rising house prices 

became a self-fulfilling prophecy, but ultimately, further appreciation could not be 

sustained and house prices collapsed.  This description suggests that regulatory and 

supervisory policies, rather than monetary policies, would have been more effective 

means of addressing the run-up in house prices.  I will return to this point in my 

conclusion. 

Let me turn now to the international evidence on the link between monetary 

policy and house price appreciation.  Some cross-country evidence on this link is shown
