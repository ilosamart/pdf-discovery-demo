clearinghouse for limited types of brokers’ trades.4  Faced with growing volumes of 

trading and the associated clearing costs after World War I, the New York Stock 

Exchange took a further step in 1920 by establishing the Stock Clearing Corporation; this 

new clearinghouse reduced the number of checks needed for settlements by up to 90 

percent and the volume of funds and credit needed by 70 percent or more.5 

   It was not until the dramatic increase in equity trading volumes in the late 1960s, 

however, that backlogs of trading tickets, confirmations, and delivery instructions caused 

the infamous “paperwork crisis” that led the exchange to curtail trading hours and close 

on Wednesdays for six months in order to manage the situation.6  The paperwork crisis 

represented more than a set of operational problems for financial institutions and other 

market participants.  Unprocessed instructions and delivery failures also increased the 

financial risks faced by many firms, leading to supervisory concerns about the ability of 

firms to control and monitor their securities holdings and exposures and to manage their 

financial positions appropriately.  

 These risks clearly needed to be addressed.  Pressed by the Congress and 

regulators, the industry began in the mid-1970s to establish central securities depositories 

and central counterparties (CCPs) to immobilize paper certificates, encourage multilateral 

netting of trades, reduce pre-settlement risk through the guarantee of trades, and conduct 

securities settlements through “book entries” to electronic records. The result of these 

efforts was a set of critical electronic infrastructures to centralize and coordinate clearing
