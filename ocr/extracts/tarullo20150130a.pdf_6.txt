The simultaneous testing of the largest firms using a supervisory model provides a perspective 

on a large part of the banking system and facilitates identification of correlated exposures and 

other common risks.  The supervisory construction of adverse scenarios each year allows us to 

incorporate changes in financial practices, vulnerabilities, and conditions into a dynamic capital 

standard.  For example, in recent tests, the Federal Reserve has assessed potential interest rate 

risk by analyzing how sensitive deposits will be to rate rises, whether banks might have to raise 

deposit rates more than expected to retain deposits, and whether banks that are hedging interest 

rate risk are all dealing with the same few counterparties. 

The system of risk-weighted capital surcharges adopted by the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision is a regulatory innovation designed to reduce the chances of distress or 

failure of “G-SIBs” (global systemically important institutions) to a greater degree than at other 

firms, in recognition of the fact that the resulting negative consequences for the financial system 

would likely be substantially more significant.  These surcharges are an important example of the 

principle, embodied in section 165(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, that prudential requirements 

should increase in stringency with the systemic importance of regulated firms.2  The surcharge 

applicable to institutions varies based on the relative systemic importance of a firm.   

As you are doubtless aware, the Federal Reserve has proposed for domestic 

implementation a range of surcharges higher, and somewhat differently calibrated, than the Basel 

framework.3  The approach to calibration we developed in cooperation with other Basel 

Committee members was to determine the additional capital necessary to equalize the probable 

2 Another capital measures applicable only to the eight most systemically significant U.S. institutions is a leverage 
ratio of 5 percent, which is higher than the international standard.  In light of increases in applicable risk-based 
capital requirements, this increase seemed warranted to maintain the traditional complementary relationship between 
these two forms of capital rules.
