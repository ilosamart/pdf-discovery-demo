have returned to pre-crisis levels (chart 19), and even mortgage delinquency rates have 

declined somewhat from the extraordinarily high peaks reached in late 2009.  

 Of course, some of the causes of the declining debt ratios are not the kinds of 

things you would typically describe as grounds for optimism.  In particular, one reason 

that many households owe less debt today than in recent years is that banks wrote off 

an unprecedented amount of loans between 2008 and 2011, much of it as a result of 

foreclosure or bankruptcy.  However, although bankruptcies and foreclosures are 

wrenching events for the households involved, the associated discharge of debt can lay 

the foundation for a fresh start once income prospects improve.  

 While unusually high charge-offs tell part of the declining household debt story, 

a drop-off in new loans--resulting from both tepid loan demand and tight loan supply--

likely played a larger role.  Loan demand weakened during the recession as 

households delayed purchasing houses and consumer goods because of rising 

unemployment, weak income growth, and the steep declines in household wealth.  At 

the same time, lenders responded to high delinquency rates by tightening credit 

standards. 

 Although mortgage credit conditions remain tight, much of the tightening in 

other consumer credit markets appears to be unwinding.  As indicated on the SLOOS, 

the number of loan officers reporting easing standards for consumer loans now 

exceeds those reporting tightening standards and the willingness of banks to make 

consumer installment loans has rebounded (chart 20).  Standards for credit cards are 

still restrictive relative to those that prevailed before the crisis, but this may be a 

response to legislation that changed the regulations governing credit cards in addition
