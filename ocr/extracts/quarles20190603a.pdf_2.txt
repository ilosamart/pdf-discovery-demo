Good morning to you all.  I am sorry I cannot be present at the Alternative 

Reference Rates Committee’s (ARRC) fourth roundtable, but I wanted to share these 

remarks with you at what is the start of the next critical stage in the transition away from 

LIBOR.1 

Since 2014, the official sector has publicly warned that LIBOR could become 

unstable.  Not everyone paid attention to those warnings, but the risks that we pointed to 

have materialized.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has intervened to preserve 

LIBOR’s stability only through the end of 2021.  Despite that development, some 

continue to speculate that LIBOR can remain in production indefinitely.  My key 

message to you today is that you should take the warnings seriously.  Clarity on the exact 

timing and nature of the LIBOR stop is still to come, but the regulator of LIBOR has said 

that it is a matter of how LIBOR will end rather than if it will end, and it is hard to see 

how one could be clearer than that.   

The Federal Reserve convened the ARRC based on our concerns about the 

stability of LIBOR.  The ARRC was charged with providing the market with the tools 

that would be needed for a transition from LIBOR:  an alternative rate that did not share 

the same structural instabilities that have led LIBOR to this point, a plan to develop 

liquidity in the derivatives market for this new rate so that cash users could hedge their 

interest rate risk, and models of better contract language that helped limit the risk from a 

LIBOR disruption.
