a relatively small number of risk categories.  Thus there would be a broad risk segmentation of 

asset classes and insurance liabilities.  However, as we gained experience with the CA, we would 

have the option of making it increasingly granular in order to achieve greater risk sensitivity.   

The CA, as a consolidated capital framework, would help prevent intra-group regulatory 

arbitrage opportunities and the potential for double leverage.10  It would also be compatible with 

supervisory stress testing, which--as you all know--is now a central component of our 

supervisory program for making systemically important firms highly resilient, as well as for 

giving us a more complete picture of risks in the financial system as a whole.  Obviously, the 

compliance costs associated with the CA will be higher than those of the BBA.  But this 

enhanced regulation is justified by the increased risks to the financial system associated with 

these firms.  Indeed, it is our obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to impose stricter regulation 

on these firms.  Even so, by constructing a separate consolidated approach to capital for 

systemically designated insurance firms, compliance costs for these firms should be considerably 

lower than if they had to conform to the bank holding company capital regime.  Finally, I would 

note that adoption by the Federal Reserve of a fully consolidated capital requirement for 

systemically important insurance companies might also help advance the international 

development of appropriate and effective capital requirements for insurance firms of global 

systemic importance. 

Conclusion 

As noted earlier, the Board’s prudential regulatory objectives pertaining to supervised 

insurance companies are to protect the safety and soundness of the consolidated company, to 

protect any subsidiary depository institutions of the company, and to mitigate any threats to
