employment.  In the eyes of many commentators, that inflation has remained so low 

through the post-crisis period even as interest rates have fallen to levels that historically 

would have been very stimulative to the economy suggests that the natural rate has fallen.     

Why might the natural rate have fallen?  There are a number of compelling 

narratives, including low productivity growth, demographic trends, increased uncertainty, 

and a higher demand for precautionary saving.  If these narratives sound familiar, it is 

because they are more or less the same set of explanations put forward as reasons for the 

slow pace of growth in recent years.  Thus, a lessening of any of these factors, such as a 

sustained increase in the pace of productivity growth, would likely push up the natural 

rate of interest as well as GDP growth. 

What are the consequences of a higher natural rate of interest?  As the natural rate 

moves up, any given level of the policy rate would be more accommodative, so the policy 

rate would also have to move up to continue the gradual removal of policy 

accommodation.  It is important to point out that this higher policy path would be 

motivated by sustained stronger growth and improved economic conditions, not a greater 

desire to slow the economy. 

Could there be a benefit from a higher natural rate of interest?  In addition to its 

value in signaling that the economy is doing better, a higher rate could facilitate the 

conduct of monetary policy.  A lower natural rate of interest can complicate the operation 

of conventional monetary policy.  Since it is difficult to cut nominal interest rates below 

zero, conventional monetary policy is more likely to be constrained at low levels of the 

natural interest rate.  The higher the natural interest rate, the more space central banks
