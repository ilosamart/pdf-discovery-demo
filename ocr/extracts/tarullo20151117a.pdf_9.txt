runs or minimizing their ill effects, and so the need for bank-like regulation is greater in the 

presence of material run risk.   

Second, are banks still informally or indirectly at risk despite the migration to nonbank 

entities?  This could be the case if banks sponsor the shadow banks and implicitly or explicitly 

provide them with a liquidity backstop or credit support, and it would call for greater regulatory 

attention either to the shadow banks conducting the activity or to the banksâ€™ connection with 

those shadow banks.   

Third, is the activity at issue primarily migrating out of the most systemic banks--global 

systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs)--or smaller banks?  Migration of activity 

out of GSIBs might on net be beneficial for financial stability because it would leave the GSIBs 

less systemic, even if the activity migrates to less-regulated shadow banks, though I would 

caution that an especially careful analysis would be needed before reaching this conclusion.   

In this regard, I would note that one way to limit the growth of shadow banking that 

simply arbitrages bank regulation is to make sure that the regulated sector itself is not 

unnecessarily burdened.  This aim lies behind our efforts to tailor banking regulation by 

reference to the risks posed to the economy and the financial system by banks of different sizes, 

scopes, and business activities.   

In addition, it suggests a couple of additional considerations for evaluating specific forms 

of shadow banking.  Here, though, the relevance of these considerations is for determining 

whether to adjust banking regulation, as much as it is for determining whether regulation of the 

shadow banks would be warranted.  One such consideration is whether the activity is high-risk, 

and whether banks have a good track record in addressing the attendant risks.  Migration may be 

of less concern where banks historically have done a poor job of managing the risks of the
