cash lenders.  Because the composition and size of broker-dealers’ inventories can change 

rapidly with the levels of trading activity, broker-dealers find the very flexible and inexpensive 

short-term financing offered by triparty repos to be extremely attractive.  To the extent that this 

borrowing appeared riskless to lenders, broker-dealers were potential suppliers through triparty 

repos of the safe, liquid assets that were in such demand.     

Broker-dealers who borrow in the triparty repo market want to have access to their 

securities for routine trading purposes—for example, to make deliveries to clients during the day.  

To allow for that, the market developed a critical operational feature called the ―daily unwind.‖  

Each day, the clearing banks ―unwind‖ all repo trades, returning securities to borrowers and cash 

to lenders, even for longer-dated term transactions.  However, the securities still require 

financing during the day.  To this end, borrowers rely on intraday overdrafts at the two major 

clearing banks.  At the end of the day, the transactions are ―re-wound.‖  Thus, the risks 

associated with the portfolios of securities are fully transferred twice each day.   

The lenders in this market widely believed that the two clearing banks would always 

unwind their maturing trades in the morning, returning cash to their account, despite no 

contractual provision requiring that the clearing banks do so.  The fact that lenders believed they 

were protected in this way by the clearing bank helped perpetuate the illusion that, particularly 

when lending overnight, they were invested in a money-like asset that would always be highly 

liquid and safe, even though in reality the borrower was usually an entity that could go bankrupt.   

This illusion faded as the financial crisis progressed.  Significant strains were created by 

concerns about the financial strength of the broker-dealers, uncertainty about the value of the 

underlying collateral, and belated recognition that the clearing banks were not contractually 

obligated to unwind maturing trades.  Only when the prospect of dealer failures became very
