It is an honor and a pleasure to join you today to celebrate a milestone in your 

participation in the Financially Hers management and empowerment program.  Each of you has 

demonstrated your commitment to taking control of your finances by attending 10, 20, or 30 

hours of coursework in personal finance.  I know how difficult it is to find those hours in an 

already overloaded life.  I started my career in banking as a part-time drive-through teller and, 

for many years, spent most nights studying banking and finance.  So I commend your effort and 

hope you find, as I did, that the time you have invested yields a lifetime of personal and financial 

dividends.  

Through Financially Hers, you have gained common-sense knowledge and the 

confidence to make financial decisions that will serve you and your families now and in the 

future.  Some of you are already entirely responsible for the financial decisions that impact you 

or your families.  Those of you who make financial decisions jointly will become a better partner 

in making those decisions, and some of you will become a resource for your family, friends, and 

neighbors on financial matters.  I hope that for many of you, this is just the first step in a lifetime 

of learning.  Knowledge is power, and I submit that financial knowledge is security.   

I would like to thank Patricia Hasson, the president of the Consumer Credit Counseling 

Service of Delaware Valley, for inviting me to be here. The incredible energy she brings to 

efforts like this shows not only her commitment to helping others but also her passion for helping 

women access the tools they need to take control of their financial futures.  I would also like to 

thank Patty for her service on the Consumer Advisory Council at the Federal Reserve Board of 

Governors.  The Council advises the Fed about policies that impact consumers.  And when Patty
