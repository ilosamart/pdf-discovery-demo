Extreme economic events have often challenged existing views of how the 

economy works and exposed shortcomings in the collective knowledge of economists.  

To give two well-known examples, both the Great Depression and the stagflation of the 

1970s motivated new ways of thinking about economic phenomena.  More recently, the 

financial crisis and its aftermath might well prove to be a similar sort of turning point.  

Today I would like to reflect on some ways in which the events of the past few years 

have revealed limits in economists’ understanding of the economy and suggest several 

important questions I hope the profession will try to answer.  Some of these questions are 

not new, though recent events have made them more urgent.  Appropriately, some are 

addressed by the papers prepared for this conference.  Pursuing answers to these 

questions is vital to the work of Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers, and 

the Fed is likewise engaged in ongoing research to seek answers.  

The Influence of Demand on Aggregate Supply 

The first question I would like to pose concerns the distinction between aggregate 

supply and aggregate demand:  Are there circumstances in which changes in aggregate 

demand can have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply?  

Prior to the Great Recession, most economists would probably have answered this 

question with a qualified “no.”  They would have broadly agreed with Robert Solow that 

economic output over the longer term is primarily driven by supply--the amount of output 

of goods and services the economy is capable of producing, given its labor and capital 

resources and existing technologies.  Aggregate demand, in contrast, was seen as 

explaining shorter-term fluctuations around the mostly exogenous supply-determined
