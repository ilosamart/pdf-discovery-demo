Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the . . . federal 

funds rate may be appropriate to support” our dual-mandate objectives.12  What does this 

mean in practice?  To me, it means that we should allow the data on the U.S. economy to 

flow in and inform our future decisions.  

I believe that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent in two 

distinct ways.13  Monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming 

data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives 

of price stability and maximum employment.  This information on where the economy is 

relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest rate feedback 

rules.  Data dependence in this sense is well understood, as it is of the type implied by a 

large family of policy rules, including Taylor-type rules, in which the parameters of the 

economy needed to formulate such rules are taken as known. 

But, of course, key parameters needed to formulate such rules, including u* and 

r*, are unknown.  As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should be—and in the 

United States, I believe, is—data dependent in a second sense:  Policymakers should and 

do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and 

improve estimates of r* and u*.  Consistent with my earlier discussion, in the Summary 

of Economic Projections, FOMC participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly 

revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest 

rates remained well below previous estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those 

earlier estimates would have predicted.  And these revisions to u* and r* appeared to
