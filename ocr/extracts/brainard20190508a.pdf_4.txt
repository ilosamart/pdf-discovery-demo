room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool.  For example, following the 

most recent recession in 2008 and 2009, we kept interest rates as low as the Committee 

thought they could go, which was close to zero, for many years.   

Another big change in the economy is that inflation doesn’t move as much with 

economic activity and employment as it has in the past.  This is what economists mean 

when they say the Phillips curve is very flat.  In many ways, the flatter Phillips curve has 

advantages:  It means that the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers 

that may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in 

inflation, unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.  Similarly, inflation doesn’t fall as 

much in recessions.   

But there is an important risk with today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack:  It 

makes it more difficult to boost inflation to our objective of 2 percent on a sustainable 

basis.  And, as we know from other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the 

central bank’s objective, lower inflation tends to get embedded in people’s expectations.  

Expectations that inflation will remain low in turn can create a self-fulfilling dynamic 

with actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.  

And because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates, that, in turn, can also reduce 

the amount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from 

slipping into recession.   

In fact, in recent years, central banks around the world have had to use a larger 

variety of policy tools than they traditionally used to respond to the financial crisis and 

support economic expansion.
