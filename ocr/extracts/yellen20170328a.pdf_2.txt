Thank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community 

Reinvestment Coalition’s annual conference.  It is a pleasure to address a group of 

organizations committed to improving the lives of low- and moderate-income Americans 

and strengthening communities.  I am especially pleased to be with you in 2017, which 

marks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). 

As you know, the CRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the 

communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods.  Since its enactment, the CRA has helped channel capital into 

communities and, in the process, supported innovative and effective approaches to 

community development.   

We at the Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously.  We evaluate 

the CRA performance of the state-chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and 

written evaluations public.1  We currently are improving our examination procedures and 

examiner training.  We also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually improve 

our implementation of the law.  And, as many of you know, we recently revised our 

interagency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are 

considered in assessing CRA performance, among them workforce development, which 

is my topic today.2   

Workforce Development Initiatives and Challenges 

Workforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types 

of initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement
