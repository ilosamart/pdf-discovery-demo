The secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) has only been in existence three months, 

and SOFR futures have only been trading for two months, but on a daily basis there are already 

more transactions underlying them than there are underpinning LIBOR.  And SOFR itself 

reflects over $700 billion in overnight repurchase agreement (repo) transactions every day.  One 

of the many benefits of using a rate so firmly anchored in a market of this depth is that no one 

can question whether SOFR is representative.  It clearly is.  

With LIBOR reliant on expert judgment rather than direct transactions, many banks 

increasingly uncomfortable providing that judgment, and the official sector unable to compel 

them to do so indefinitely, it was obvious to us that this structure—which bases so many trillions 

of financial instruments on such a small number of underlying transactions—was potentially 

unstable.  It was clear that the market needed to develop alternatives in case the worst happened, 

and this was the reason that we convened the ARRC four years ago.   

We asked the ARRC to identify a robust alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR and to develop 

a plan to promote its use.  Sandie O’Connor will speak shortly about the ARRC’s work, but I 

want to emphasize that this has been a model of cooperative effort between the private sector and 

the public sector.  When the ARRC started, the interest rate benchmarks that they would 

eventually narrow their choice down to did not even exist.  Those rates have not been easy to 

create, and as the ARRC expressed interest in a Treasury repo rate benchmark that would span 

the widest possible scope of the market, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York put great effort 

in working with the Federal Reserve Board and Office of Financial Research to create SOFR.  

The result, the rate the ARRC has chosen, reflects the largest and deepest rates market in the 

world and is a huge accomplishment for all of us.
