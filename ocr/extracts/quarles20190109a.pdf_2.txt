Members of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), I appreciate this opportunity 

to speak with you.   

It needs no retelling in this audience that the insurance industry is of significant 

importance to the economy, both domestically and internationally.  Insurers occupy a meaningful 

role in the financial sector, meeting the financial needs of consumers and businesses with a 

distinct business model that calls for appropriately tailored policies.   

As you know, the Federal Reserve has a role as consolidated supervisor of some insurers, 

a role we continually strive to fulfill in the most appropriate and tailored manner.  The Federal 

Reserve also participates as a member of “Team USA”--together with the state insurance 

supervisors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and the Federal 

Insurance Office (FIO)--in the international insurance standard-setting process, including the 

ongoing development of an insurance capital standard (ICS) for internationally active insurance 

groups.  In my remarks today, I will touch on these topics.  In the hope of providing greater 

transparency, I will also provide some updates on the Board’s forthcoming proposal on insurance 

holding company capital requirements, often referred to as the Building Block Approach (BBA).
