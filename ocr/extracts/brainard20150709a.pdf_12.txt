institution would look like following resolution in order to bolster public and market confidence 

that resolution would be orderly. 

We look forward to assessing the plans submitted earlier this month, which we expect to 

demonstrate concrete progress on the detailed feedback that was provided by the regulators over 

the past year. In parallel, Board supervision staff have been engaged in an extensive horizontal 

review of the operational readiness of the systemic banking institutions on several dimensions of 

the resolution planning that were detailed in earlier supervisory guidance. Together, the annual 

plan submissions along with the ongoing supervisory examination of operational readiness 

provide potent, complementary mechanisms in addressing too big to fail. 

Finally, in order to make the firms resolvable, it will be necessary for the largest, most 

complex firms to maintain enough long-term debt at the top-tier holding company that could be 

converted into equity to recapitalize the institution’s critical operating subsidiaries so as to 

prevent contagion.  The availability of sufficient capacity at the parent to both absorb losses and 

recapitalize the critical operating subsidiaries is designed to provide comfort to other creditors of 

the firm and thereby forestall destructive runs, since the long-term unsecured debt issued by the 

parent holding company would be structurally subordinate to the claims on the operating 

subsidiaries.13   We are in the process of developing a proposal for a long-term debt requirement 

that would fully address the estimated capital needs of each institution in a gone-concern 

scenario.

13 Notably, the Financial Stability Board’s proposed Total Loss Absorbency Capacity (TLAC) framework would 

also require global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to deduct TLAC issued by other G-SIBs from their own 

TLAC exposures.  This provision is critical to ensuring that authorities can impose losses on TLAC holders without 

generating contagion.
