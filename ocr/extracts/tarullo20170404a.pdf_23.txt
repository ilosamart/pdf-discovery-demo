I have heard two arguments for this idea.  One is that Congress did not require that the 

stress test be used to limit capital distributions.  The other is that it is somehow an unacceptable 

encroachment on the prerogatives of bank boards of directors to limit their discretion to declare 

dividends or authorize stock repurchases.   

While Congress did not explicitly call for stress tests to be used to assure adequate capital 

levels in larger banks, it did call for increasingly stringent capital measures as the systemic 

importance of banks increased.  Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which contains the stress 

testing requirement, is singularly focused on achieving financial stability objectives.  Moreover, 

as I noted earlier, Congress in the 1980s gave the federal banking agencies authority--within 

their discretion--to set capital requirements individually for specific banks.  Again, as noted 

earlier, using stress tests to do so is not only wholly within that discretion.  It is a more 

regularized way of doing so than an ad hoc judgment on a bank-by-bank basis. 

The argument that bank boards should not be constrained in making capital distributions 

amounts to an argument that there should be no capital regulation, since even traditional capital 

regulations limited boards from, say, declaring a dividend that would take the bank below 

minimum capital levels.  And those who make this argument seem to have forgotten that some 

banks continued to pay dividends in 2007 and 2008 even as their situations became increasingly 

precarious. 

Another unwise idea would be to give the supervisory model to the banks.  Some have 

argued that it is only fair to do so, because otherwise banks cannot know exactly what their 

capital requirements will be.  For example, if a bank doesnâ€™t know with precision what capital 

charge will effectively be applied to a certain class of home equity loans, it will be handicapped 

in deciding how many such loans to offer, and on what terms.
