To put these numbers in context, let’s look at data from other advanced 

economies.  Prime-age male participation has fallen some across most of these economies 

since 1995 (figure 8).  But the decline in the United States has been much larger than 

most, and U.S. participation was below the middle of the pack at the outset.  As a result, 

the United States now has the fourth lowest participation rate among 34 advanced 

economies.  For women’s participation, the details are different, but the bottom line is 

similar.  In the mid-1990s, the United States ranked in the upper tier for prime-age 

women’s participation, but since then participation by women has advanced rapidly in 

many countries while it has declined slightly in the United States.  Now the United States 

is sixth lowest among these 34 countries.  

Researchers have investigated numerous possible reasons for the decline in prime-

age participation.  Among men, the drop in participation is much sharper for those with 

only a high school education or less.  The drop for women is also sharper for those who 

are high school educated.  This pattern is consistent with the idea that a modern economy 

demands ever-higher skills, and that workers without those skills are being left behind 

(figure 9).  But the international experience suggests that this outcome is not inevitable:  

The drop in participation among those with less education is much smaller in some 

comparable countries than in the United States.7   

The research into labor force participation in the United States and across the 

world does not find a magic fix, but it does suggest a variety of policies that might better 

prepare people for the modern workforce as well as support and reward labor force
