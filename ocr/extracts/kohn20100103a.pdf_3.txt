multiple fronts to stabilize the financial markets and foster a rebound in the economy.    

 Expanding liquidity facilities.  Our first actions were to ease the access of 

depository institutions to Federal Reserve liquidity.  But, as the crisis worsened, it 

became apparent that these actions would be insufficient.  Securities markets had come to 

play a prominent role in channeling credit in our economy, and severe disruptions outside 

the U.S. banking sector were threatening to reduce economic activity.  To counter the 

financial shocks hitting the economy and support the flow of credit to households and

credit freely to solvent institutions at a penalty rate against adequate collateral.  By 

making liquidity available more broadly, we were trying to break the vicious spiral of 

uncertainty and fear feeding back on asset values and credit availability, and from there 

to the economy.  We also found we needed to innovate by making liquidity available 

through auctions as well as standing facilities to overcome firmsâ€™ reluctance to borrow 

from the Federal Reserve out of concern that the borrowing could be inferred by market
