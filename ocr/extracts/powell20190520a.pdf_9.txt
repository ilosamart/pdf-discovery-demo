Regarding the third factor—leverage in the financial system—today banks at the 

core of the financial system are fundamentally stronger and more resilient.  Our post-

crisis regulatory framework is based on robust capital requirements backed by strong 

stress tests, resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system (figure 6).  

These stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad 

macroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system.  We publish the 

scenarios that describe the macro and financial developments every year by mid-February 

and release the test results in June.  In the pre-crisis environment, supervisors focused 

more on the most likely outcomes, not on these tail risks.  Since we began routine stress-

testing in 2011, the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized 

by major stress in the corporate sector, where large numbers of firms default on their 

loans and bonds.  As actual economic conditions have improved, the scenarios have 

gotten tougher.  The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after the losses from the 

scenario, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above the levels those banks 

had before the crisis.  Loss-absorbing capacity elsewhere in the financial system is also 

much improved.  Leverage at broker-dealers is far below levels before the crisis and 

remains low relative to the norms of the past several decades.  Insurers also appear well 

capitalized. 

As for our fourth factor—funding risk—the susceptibility of the financial system 

to runs also appears low.  In part because of the post-crisis regulatory regime, large banks 

hold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and rely relatively little on short-term 

wholesale funding (figure 7).  Money market funds hold much safer assets.  And CLOs, 

which have facilitated the growth of leveraged loans, have stable funding:  Investors
