few years?  Let me first be clear that the FOMC does not intend to embark on any 

predetermined course of tightening following an initial decision to raise the funds rate 

target range--one that, for example, would involve similarly sized rate increases at every 

meeting or on some other schedule.  Rather, the actual path of policy will evolve as 

economic conditions evolve, and policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or 

even reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and 

inflation.  Reflecting such data dependence, as well as some historically unusual policy 

considerations that I will discuss shortly, the average pace of tightening observed during 

previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of 

monetary policy over the next few years.  Our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate 

over time will be to achieve and sustain economic conditions close to maximum 

employment with inflation averaging around 2 percent, responding, as best we can, to the 

inevitable twists and turns of the economy. 

Keeping in mind the all-important proviso that policy is never predetermined but 

is always data dependent, what can we say about the appropriate path of policy, assuming 

the most likely outcomes for real activity, inflation, and related factors?  The answer is 

that it depends, of course, on one’s outlook for the economy.  Today I will focus on the 

modal outlook presented by FOMC participants’ submissions to the March Summary of 

Economic Projections (SEP), which assumes that no further unanticipated disturbances 

buffet the economy.  As I noted at my press conference after last week’s FOMC meeting, 

participants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through 

late 2017 to levels at or somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level, 

accompanied by growth in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its
