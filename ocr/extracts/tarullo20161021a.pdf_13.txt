would suggest that a comparison of the reconfigured financial regulatory system in the United 

Kingdom serves as an instructive counterpoint to the U.S. system. 

Some Thoughts on Post-Crisis Scholarship Topics and Pedagogy 

Scholarship 

Insofar as I have succeeded in identifying questions that will be central to the further 

development and refinement of a regulatory system that takes account of the financial system as 

a whole, all of what I have already said should be fertile ground for legal and economic 

scholarship.  However, not every important topic for research fits neatly into one of these cross-

cutting issues, so let me mention some policy issues that may especially benefit from academic 

work. 

First is the issue of measures and standards for evaluating systemic risk.  Numerous 

financial economists have done very useful work in creating metrics for the systemic importance 

of financial institutions--a literature that has already informed regulatory efforts to designate and 

categorize such institutions and, as it develops further, will surely continue to do so.5  But there 

are also specific legal standards, such as the financial stability factor now mandated in the review 

of proposed bank and holding company mergers, that could also benefit from academic work.6 

Second is the set of issues associated with corporate governance in a prudentially 

regulated institution.  John Armour, Lucien Bebchuk, Jeff Gordon, Jon Macey, and others have 

already tackled some of these issues--such as incentive compensation arrangements, the
