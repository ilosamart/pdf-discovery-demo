The Shape of the Recovery 

 Often in the past, very steep recessions, such as the one we have been through, are 

followed by sharp recoveries.  As I noted at the beginning of my talk, I donâ€™t expect that 

outcome this time; instead, I think the most likely scenario is a gradual pickup in economic 

activity as the forces that got us into this difficult situation slowly fade away.     

First, although financial conditions are improving and capital markets are open for larger 

firms, credit remains unusually tight for many borrowers, especially consumers and smaller 

businesses that are dependent on banks.  Banks are still rebuilding their capital, and their lending 

will be held back as they work through the embedded losses in their portfolios, particularly for 

consumer and commercial real estate loans.  Beyond this challenge, some securitization markets 

are still impaired.   

As the economy improves and credit losses become easier to estimate, banks should be 

able to build capital from earnings and outside investors, and they will have greater confidence in 

the prospective profitability of lending.  They will become more able and willing to compete for 

new business--in effect, allowing low market interest rates to pass through to more borrowers.  

These developments will induce more borrowing and spending, further improving the economy, 

but this process will take time.   

Second, I do not expect that the recovery in housing construction will boost growth 

substantially this year, in contrast to its usual pattern early in economic recoveries.  A large 

overhang of vacant homes is likely to weigh on new construction for some time, even though 

residential construction activity has declined dramatically since its peak in 2005 and inventories 

of unsold new homes have fallen to very low levels.  In addition, the pace of foreclosures is 

likely to remain elevated for a while, adding to the stock of homes for sale.  On the positive side,
