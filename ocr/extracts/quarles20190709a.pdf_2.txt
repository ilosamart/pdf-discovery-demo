Thank you Eric, and thank you to everyone at the Boston Fed and throughout the 

system who have contributed to this conference.  This gathering comes a few weeks after 

the announcement of this year’s stress test results, so let me begin by recounting the 

highlights of those results.  They show that our financial system remains resilient and that 

capital planning by banks continues to improve.  The largest and most complex banks 

were tested against a severe hypothetical recession and retained strong capital levels, well

and lasting economic downturn and still be able to lend to households and businesses.  

Additionally, most firms are now meeting the high expectations we have set to make sure 

capital planning takes into account their specific risks and vulnerabilities.  This is an 

improvement from last year.  Overall, these results are good news that confirm our 

financial system is significantly stronger than before the crisis. 

Now let me turn to the purpose of this conference, which is to sharpen our 

understanding of the experience gained from stress testing and apply these lessons to 

think about the future.  And let me begin by acknowledging that—notwithstanding our 

openness to learning from the collective experience of all of us in this room—the future 

of stress testing will, in a number of important ways, necessarily resemble the past.  For 

example, we’re still going to have them.  Over the course of the last 18 months, I have 

heard overwhelmingly—from academics, from think tanks of every stripe, from banks of 

every size, from regulatory colleagues both domestic and foreign—that stress tests should 

continue to be a key element of the Federal Reserve’s supervision of systemically 

important banks and a key aspect of the Fed’s efforts to promote financial stability.  

Stress tests should be regular, rigorous, and dynamic.  And the banks’ performance on
