at least twelve reviewers, whose verdicts were largely favorable, with almost 

all recognizing that they were dealing with a major work.   

4. Supplementary Notes.  MIP includes excellent “Supplementary Notes and 

Studies in the Literature” including on the work of Walras (Notes B and C), 

Wicksell (Note E), of whom like almost all who studied him became admirers, 

on Newcomb, Fisher and the Transactions Approach to the Quantity Theory 

(Note F), Marshall, Pigou and the Cambridge Cash-Balance Approach (Note 

G), Monetary Aspects of the Casselian System (Note H), The Classical and 

Neoclassical Theory of Money and Interest (Note J), and Keynes’ General 

Theory (Note K).  In his review of MIP, Kenneth Arrow9 described the 

literature notes as “sparkling”--not a word frequently used in such a context. 

5. Harry Johnson’s comments.  In his 1962 review article on recent work on 

monetary theory and policy,10 Harry Johnson devoted almost a quarter of the 

review to MIP, which he described as “monumentally scholarly”, but argued 

that its analysis of the real balance effect was “conceptually inadequate and 

crucially incomplete”.11  

Johnson (1962) argued further that 

. . . the more elegant approach to monetary theory lies along 

inside-money rather than outside-money lines, and that the 

foundation of the theory of monetary equilibrium and stability 

should be the substitution effect rather than the . . . wealth effect 

of a change in real balances.
