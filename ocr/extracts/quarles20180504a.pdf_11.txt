interaction between the specific needs of their various business lines and bank 

management’s preferences.  In any case, this picture illustrates the complexities that are 

inherent in understanding banks’ underlying demand for reserve balances, a topic for 

which more research would be quite valuable to policymakers.    

So, what does this finding say about the longer-run level of reserve balances 

demanded by banks?  The answer is that there is a large degree of uncertainty.  In fact, 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveyed primary dealers and market participants 

last December to solicit their views about the level of reserves they expect to prevail in 

2025.12  A few features of the survey responses stand out.  All respondents thought that 

the longer-run level of reserve balances would be substantially lower than the current 

level of more than $2 trillion.  In addition, there appeared to be a widely held view that 

the longer-run level of reserves will be significantly above the level that prevailed before 

the financial crisis.  But even so, the respondents did not agree about what that longer-run 

level will be, with about half anticipating a level ranging between $400 billion and 

$750 billion.         

It is important to point out that the Fed’s balance sheet will remain larger than it 

was before the crisis even after abstracting from the issue of banks’ longer-run demand 

for reserve balances.  The reason is that the ultimate size of the Fed’s balance sheet also 

depends on developments across a broader set of Fed liabilities.  One such liability is the 

outstanding amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation--that is, paper money--which 

has doubled over the past decade to a volume of more than $1.6 trillion, growing at a rate
