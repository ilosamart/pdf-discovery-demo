Of course, an alternative strategy--one consistent with classical principles of 

international adjustment--is to refrain from intervening in foreign exchange markets, 

thereby allowing the currency to rise and helping insulate the financial system from 

external pressures.  Under a flexible exchange-rate regime, a fully independent monetary 

policy, together with fiscal policy as needed, would be available to help counteract any 

adverse effects of currency appreciation on growth.  The resultant rebalancing from 

external to domestic demand would not only preserve near-term growth in the emerging 

market economies while supporting recovery in the advanced economies, it would 

redound to everyoneâ€™s benefit in the long run by putting the global economy on a more 

stable and sustainable path.    

 Finally, any costs for emerging market economies of monetary easing in advanced 

economies should be set against the very real benefits of those policies.  The slowing of 

growth in the emerging market economies this year in large part reflects their 

decelerating exports to the United States, Europe, and other advanced economies.  

Therefore, monetary easing that supports the recovery in the advanced economies should 

stimulate trade and boost growth in emerging market economies as well.  In principle, 

depreciation of the dollar and other advanced-economy currencies could reduce (although 

not eliminate) the positive effect on trade and growth in emerging markets.  However, 

since mid-2008, in fact, before the intensification of the financial crisis triggered wide 

swings in the dollar, the real multilateral value of the dollar has changed little, and it has 

fallen just a bit against the currencies of the emerging market economies.
