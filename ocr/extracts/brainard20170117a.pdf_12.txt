stronger inflation outcomes.  But risks outside our borders are still tilted to the downside.  

In particular, despite recent progress, policy space in Japan and the euro area is perceived 

to be very limited, and the euro-area banking sector remains fragile.  Downside risks are 

also present in emerging market economies such as China, which faces capital outflow 

pressures and high and rapidly growing corporate indebtedness.  With a low U.S. neutral 

rate, conventional U.S. monetary policy does not have as much room as it did prior to the 

financial crisis to counter adverse shocks from abroad.  

Conclusion 

Speculation has increased of late about the possibility of a significant fiscal policy 

shift on the horizon.  The effects will depend on the timing, magnitude, and composition 

of the policies, the extent to which the policies boost aggregate supply relative to 

aggregate demand, the cyclical position of the economy, and the responses of the dollar 

and longer-term interest rates, given the fragile global economic environment and 

projections for the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio.  Against this uncertain backdrop, monetary 

policy will continue to be guided by actual and expected progress toward our goals, the 

level of the neutral rate, and the balance of risks.  A gradual approach will remain 

appropriate as long as inflationary pressures remain muted, the economy remains short of 

our objectives, the neutral rate remains low, and downside risks from abroad remain, 

although this will depend on the fiscal trajectory, as it evolves, and its uncertain effects 

on the economy and financial markets.
