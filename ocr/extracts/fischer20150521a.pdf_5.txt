The exchange rates established by the LMU became ineffective during and after 

World War I, and the Union was formally ended in 1927.9  Kindleberger writes 

consolingly that “from 1865 to 1867, . . . the Latin Monetary Union worked reasonably 

well, and its success suggested the desirability of expanding it to arrive at a ‘universal

Economic Community (EEC), was signed in 1957 by the six original members:  Belgium, 

France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany, the same group that had 

set up the Coal and Steel Community.  The aim was economic integration among the six 

members, including a common market and a customs union.  At that time, the Bretton 

Woods agreement and capital controls were still producing reasonable stability in 

exchange rates. 

However, as Bretton Woods began to unravel in the 1960s, exchange rates 

became more unstable, and appreciations and depreciations against the dollar led to 

sizable shifts in bilateral rates among European currencies.  Yet the EEC continued to 

work within the Bretton Woods framework, even as the Bretton Woods approach began 

to be modified at the end of the decade and the beginning of the 1970s.  Of particular 

difficulty to members of the EEC, under some circumstances the exchange rate bands 

specified in the Smithsonian agreement permitted movements of up to 9 percent between
