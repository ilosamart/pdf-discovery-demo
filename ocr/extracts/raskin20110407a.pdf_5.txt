cholesterol actually was high and an error in the test resulted in a clean bill of health?  That 

would be a false negative, and I’m sure you can see the problems it would pose.  You might not 

change your diet and exercise habits, and your doctor probably wouldn’t refer you for further 

testing or give you that firm lecture that they like to give about the importance of taking better 

care of yourself.  Instead, your rising cholesterol levels would go undetected and untreated until 

your next checkup, or even worse, until you suffer a heart attack.    

In the context of bank supervision, a false negative occurs when an examiner does not 

identify and address a deteriorating or failing bank in a timely manner.  History has shown that 

the costs of these false negatives can balloon during times of broad economic and financial 

stress, which results in a significant drag on the economy and weakens banks’ ability to lend.  

There were clearly too many of these false negatives in the recent crisis, particularly among the 

largest financial firms, both here and abroad.   

In addition to the billions of dollars of direct costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund as a 

result of bank failures, the deep recession of 2007 to 2009 most likely would have been mitigated 

had the risk of exposure to real estate at many banks been recognized earlier.  Many of the 

reform efforts that regulators and the Congress have undertaken--reforms that are clearly needed-

-are aimed at improving regulators’ ability to identify and address troubled institutions earlier, 

and to limit the impact of failures when they do happen.   

 Now, returning to the medical analogy, imagine that your test results show that your 

cholesterol level is worryingly high, only in this case you are actually the picture of health.  This 

is a false positive, and it poses problems of its own.  While there may be some ancillary benefits 

to improving your diet and exercise habits, the inaccurate test result likely would cause you
