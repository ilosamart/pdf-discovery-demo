recognize that this regulation was designed to reduce the concentration of liquidity risk 

on the balance sheets of the large, interconnected banking organizations that proved to be 

a major amplifier of financial instability at the height of the crisis.

the resilience and resolvability of these systemic banking organizations.  With recent and 

upcoming proposals, much of the new regulatory architecture will be in the process of 

implementation or in train.  Even so, I would expect the rules and their application to 

continue to be strengthened and modified as financial risks evolve, just as I would expect
