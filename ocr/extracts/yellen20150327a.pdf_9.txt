Moreover, I would assert that simple rules are, well, too simple, and ignore important 

complexities of the current situation, about which I will have more to say shortly.  

  The FOMC will, of course, carefully deliberate about when to begin the process 

of removing policy accommodation.  But the significance of this decision should not be 

overemphasized, because what matters for financial conditions and the broader economy 

is the entire expected path of short-term interest rates and not the precise timing of the 

first rate increase.  The spending and investment decisions the FOMC seeks to influence 

depend primarily on expectations of policy well into the future, as embedded in longer-

term interest rates and other asset prices.  More important than the timing of the 

Committee’s initial policy move will be the strategy the Committee deploys in adjusting 

the federal funds rate over time, in response to economic developments, to achieve its 

dual mandate.  Market participants’ perceptions of that reaction function and the 

implications for the likely longer-run trajectory of short-term interest rates will influence 

the borrowing costs faced by households and businesses, including the rates on corporate 

bonds, auto loans, and home mortgages.     

How Are Economic and Financial Considerations Likely to Shape the Course of 

Monetary Policy over the Next Several Years?   

Let me therefore turn to the second question I posed earlier:  How are economic 

and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next 

using a core consumer price index), and Y is the output gap.  The latter can be approximated using Okun’s 
law, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = −2(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 − 𝑈𝑈∗), where U is the unemployment rate and U* is the natural rate of unemployment.  If 
RR* is assumed to equal 2 percent (roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate) and 
U* is assumed to equal 5-1/2 percent, then the Taylor rule would call for the nominal funds rate to be set a 
bit below 3 percent currently, given that core PCE inflation is now running close to 1-1/4 percent and the 
unemployment rate is 5.5 percent.  But if RR* is instead assumed to equal 0 percent currently (as some 
statistical models suggest) and U* is assumed to equal 5 percent (an estimate in line with many FOMC 
participants’ SEP projections), then the rule’s current prescription is less than 1/2 percent.
