it was never intended to be a substitute for a bank’s own risk management processes, nor should 

it be.1      

And this brings us to the outer circle:  banking supervision. First and foremost, examiners 

need to understand and work within the scope of their role.  For example, examiners should not 

substitute their judgment for that of bank management.  A bank’s board and senior management 

are responsible for running the bank, and it is not appropriate for examiners to be overly engaged 

in the routine business of a healthy bank.  There will of course be times when examiners are 

justified in questioning decisions or requiring action when a bank may be operating in an unsafe 

and unsound manner or is not in compliance with law. 

In that regard, we have heard from some community bankers that pressure from 

examiners may affect a bank’s willingness to lend to creditworthy small businesses and 

consumers.  We have worked hard to ensure that our examiners are well-trained and employ a 

balanced approach to reviewing banks’ credit policies and practices.  We will continue to 

monitor this closely.  

I would also suggest that examiners are regulators and as such should not view banks as 

their customers or clients.  There are times when the interests of banks and regulators are 

aligned, and there are many instances where our objectives diverge.  This doesn’t mean that 

examiners and banks will inevitably have a contentious relationship.  Indeed, I think many 

banks, particularly those that are well run, would characterize their relationship with examiners 

as professional and constructive, and would agree that examination findings are not arbitrary and 

in fact help them to improve their internal systems.  That is as it should be.  A regulator’s 

                                                 
1 Although not discussed here because I would like to focus my brief remarks on the balance of responsibilities 
between banks and supervisors, market discipline--when appropriate transparency exists--can also play an important 
role in creating incentives for banks to identify and mitigate risks.
