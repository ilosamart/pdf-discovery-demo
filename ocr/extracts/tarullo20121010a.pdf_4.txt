 The necessarily somewhat extemporized character of Dodd-Frank has had several 

consequences for the development of financial stability regulation.  First, many of the new 

authorities and requirements of Dodd-Frank require extensive elaboration through administrative 

rulemaking, often coordinated or agreed among three or more agencies.  Second, as I will explain 

in a moment, the provisions of the law that use the concept of risk to financial stability as a 

directly applicable legal standard provide only general guidance for regulators in applying that 

standard.  This is not unusual for statutes in new areas of regulation, but it still poses a challenge 

for regulators, particularly in the early stages of implementation or enforcement.  Third, broad as 

Dodd-Frank is in some respects, it does not grant direct regulatory authority in some areas that 

academic and agency analysis suggests may pose systemic risk.  Finally, the law made important 

institutional changes, creating novel governmental entities specifically designed to address 

financial stability, and binding existing agencies more closely together in their rulemaking and 

supervisory activities.  The relationships among existing agencies and the evolving practice of 

these new entities may in turn pose some novel practical and administrative law issues. 

 My remarks this afternoon address some aspects of the job of creating a financial stability 

regulatory system in light of these features of Dodd-Frank and of the fact that theories of 

financial stability that might inform the fashioning of this system are in many respects still 

undeveloped or, at the least, contested.  I will begin with a brief survey of Dodd-Frank’s 

financial stability provisions before turning to a few examples. 

Dodd-Frank as a Statutory Framework for Financial Stability Regulation 

Dodd-Frank creates a legal and institutional framework within which financial stability 

regulation is to be developed but, with a couple of notable exceptions, it does not delineate the 

steps that should actually be taken to promote financial stability.  A useful point of comparison is
