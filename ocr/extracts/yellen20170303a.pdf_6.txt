inflation with a substantial lag.  Among other things, this implies looking through short-

term and transitory developments and focusing on the medium-term outlook--roughly 

two or three years out--when making policy decisions.  Third, our monetary policy must 

be risk sensitive.  Because the outlook is uncertain, we must assess appropriate policy 

with an eye toward the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be 

significantly wrong.   

We have followed this basic strategy for decades and, in 2012, the FOMC 

formalized it in our “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”6  

The Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually.  But the challenges brought 

about by the financial crisis, and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that 

followed, compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy.  In 

particular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it 

became necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary 

accommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently 

low inflation.7  Those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and 

increasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal 

funds rate--enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the 

U.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions 

more generally. 

Much has been written and said already about the provision of additional 

accommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the FOMC completed its latest round of
