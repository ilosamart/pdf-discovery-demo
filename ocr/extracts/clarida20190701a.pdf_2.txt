I am delighted to be in Helsinki at this important conference on monetary policy 

and the future of Europe’s monetary union.1  Today I would like to discuss the broad 

review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers 

and I are undertaking this year.  We are examining the policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum 

employment and price stability.  In my remarks, I will describe the motivation for and 

scope of this review and discuss some of the events that are taking place.  In our review, 

we are being transparent and open minded, and we are seeking perspectives from a broad 

range of interested individuals and groups, including academics, other specialists, and the 

public at large. 

Motivation for the Review 

The fact that the Federal Reserve is conducting this review does not suggest that 

we are dissatisfied with the existing policy framework.  Indeed, we believe our existing 

framework has served us well, helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned 

dual-mandate goals.  Nonetheless, in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade, 

we believe it is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, 

we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain 

these goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2  I note that central banks in other 

countries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and 

their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing.

Federal Open Market Committee participants.  I would like to thank Etienne Gagnon and Ellen Meade for 
assistance in preparing these remarks. 
2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy 
framework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes to its framework.
