invested funds.  Manifestations of this dynamic include the reemergence of deals that do not 

provide investors with the traditional protection of maintenance covenants--so-called covenant 

lite structures--and of deals financing the distribution of dividends to equity-holders, as well as a 

gradual increase in the levering of the underlying corporate assets by borrowers.  None of these 

developments may, per se, be indicative of unwise or imprudent lending, and in fact each of 

these may respond to a perceived need on the part of some market participants.  However, the 

dynamics of competition are very much on display, including the resultant pressures on fund 

managers to accept and deploy incremental investments, and the pressures on arranging banks to 

maintain their market share.  Indeed, these circumstances were recently highlighted to me by 

market participants.  We will therefore continue to watch conditions in the leveraged loan market 

closely in the coming months, and we will speak out forcefully if we perceive pressures 

continuing to build.   

Tools for Addressing Financial Imbalances 

If substantial evidence of financial imbalances on a broader scale were to develop, 

particularly if accompanied by significant use of leverage, I believe that supervision and 

regulation should constitute our first line of defense.  Indeed, in the wake of the crisis, our 

supervisory process has been significantly modified to take more explicitly into account possible 

financial stability implications and effects on the broader economy, a perspective that is 

frequently described as “macroprudential.”  Our concerns now extend beyond the capacity of 

individual institutions to protect their capital and balance sheets.   

In taking this broader perspective, we continue to rely on many traditional supervisory 

tools.  For example, should they feel the need to more directly address a continued building of 

pressures in the leveraged loan market, supervisors might require institutions to strengthen their
