First, we produce an annual report that outlines the developments in nonbank financing, 

detailing global trends and potential risks and providing reliable information to foster public 

discussion.  Second, the FSB develops policies to promote the resilience of these firms (without 

impeding the growth of sustainable nonbank financing models), and we work closely with other 

multinational organizations to monitor implementation.  Finally, and going forward, we must 

begin analyzing the effectiveness of the policies on nonbank financing that have been 

implemented.  

Analysis 

The same spirit of self-reflection should guide the FSB’s efforts in other policy areas.  

Stakeholders trust the FSB to undertake thoughtful, detailed work on emerging risks to financial 

stability.  Yet identifying those risks before a crisis means dealing in uncertainty, and making 

policy on evolving issues, where no one can claim complete expertise.  To maintain that trust, we 

must be willing to make improvements when the evidence justifies it--to undertake rigorous 

analysis, before and after issuing new standards, and to follow that analysis where it leads. 

Many post-crisis policies, including those aimed at the implicit subsidy for “too-big-to-

fail” institutions, have been in place long enough to allow for evaluation.  We can now begin to 

ask fundamental, critical questions: What have the effects of these reforms been, whether 

intended or unintended, salutary or adverse?  Have we successfully reduced or eliminated the 

problem?  Has there been a tradeoff, in the form of new, unintended risks or costs?  

As I have described elsewhere, the FSB is launching a global study with multinational 

policymakers to start answering these important questions as part of its broader effort to evaluate 

the effects of post-crisis reforms.  We intend to bring analytical rigor to these questions, and we 

recognize that the academic community has undertaken much work in this area.  As a result, we
