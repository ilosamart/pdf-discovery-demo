might have been strong positives for the banks’ overall set of stakeholders, as well as for 

society more broadly, but were clearly negatives for shareholders, given that such actions 

would have entailed large transfers to underwater creditors. 

 This conflict of interest can make it hard for even the best-intentioned regulators 

to muster the conviction to take full advantage of either the appropriate legal tools or the 

resources available under the existing institutional framework.  Under what 

circumstances does one tell a firm that is still well above its regulatory capital 

requirement that it must do a share issue that will be helpful for the economy as a whole, 

but highly dilutive to its existing equity holders?   

 This discussion brings us to the role of the now ongoing stress-testing framework 

for large financial institutions.  As you may know, the Federal Reserve has been 

conducting annual stress tests and capital-planning reviews of the 18 largest banks under 

the auspices of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program, and is 

adding 12 more firms this year, consistent with requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.5 

 During normal times, when banks are relatively healthy, the CCAR process 

functions as an important complement to more conventional capital regulation and, like 

capital regulation, it can be thought of as an ex ante instrument to increase the general 

                                                 
5 The Federal Reserve conducts the CCAR annually to help ensure that companies have forward-looking 
capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that result in sufficient capital to enable 
the institutions to continue lending to households and businesses during times of economic and financial 
stress.  As part of the CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy, internal capital 
adequacy assessment processes, and their plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or 
stock repurchases.  The CCAR includes a supervisory stress test to support the Federal Reserve’s analysis 
of the adequacy of the firms’ capital.  Boards of directors of the institutions are required each year to 
review and approve capital plans before submitting them to the Federal Reserve.  The fourth CCAR will 
begin soon, with the release of instructions and economic scenarios.  For more information, see the Board’s 
website at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/ccar.htm.
