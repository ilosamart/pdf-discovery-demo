losses in the event of distress--demand prudent risk-taking, thereby limiting the problem 

of too-big-to-fail.   

Financial stability risks can also grow large outside the regulated banking sector, 

as amply demonstrated by the events of 2007 and 2008.  In response, a number of 

regulatory changes affecting what is commonly referred to as the shadow banking sector 

have been instituted.  A specific example of such risks, illustrative of broader 

developments, was the buildup of large counterparty exposures through derivatives 

between market participants and AIG that were both inappropriately risk-managed and 

opaque.  To mitigate the potential for such risks to arise again, new standards require 

central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, enhanced reporting 

requirements for all derivatives, and higher capital as well as margin requirements for 

noncentrally cleared derivatives transactions.13 

Another important step was the Congress’s creation of the Financial Stability 

Oversight Council (FSOC).  The council is responsible for identifying risks to financial 

stability and for designating those financial institutions that are systemically important 

and thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve.  Both of these 

responsibilities are important to help guard against the risk that vulnerabilities outside the 

existing regulatory perimeter grow to levels that jeopardize financial stability.14  

                                                 
13 One area in which regulations have shifted to a lesser degree in the United States is that of time-varying 

macroprudential tools, in which regulatory requirements are adjusted to address changes in vulnerabilities 

that may affect the financial system.  For example, U.S. regulatory authorities have adopted rules that allow 

use of the countercyclical capital buffer, but other time-varying tools are limited in the United States.  This 

issue is discussed in, for example, Stanley Fischer (2015), “Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy,” 

speech delivered at “Macroprudential Monetary Policy,” 59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Boston, Boston, October 2,
