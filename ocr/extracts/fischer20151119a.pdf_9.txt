Emerging Asia has played an outsized role in commodity markets for some time 

now.  Specifically, China, with its investment-heavy growth model, has accounted for a 

substantial amount of incremental commodity demand over the past two decades.  Since 

2000, China has accounted for roughly 40 percent of the increase in global demand for oil 

and 80 percent of the growth in demand for steel.  For copper, all of the incremental rise 

in global demand has come from China, with demand excluding China falling over the 

period.       

The strength of emerging Asian demand growth pushed commodity prices up 

sharply over most of the past decade, at least temporarily reversing what seemed to be an 

inexorable decline in both commodity prices and the terms of trade of commodity 

producers in the preceding two decades.  Higher prices were a tremendous boon to 

commodity producers and supported a decade of strong growth in a number of emerging 

market economies, as well as commodity sectors in certain advanced economies, 

including Australia and the United States.   

Since mid-2014, commodity prices have plummeted, with oil prices falling almost 

60 percent and a broad index of metals prices losing about one-third of its value, dragging 

down growth in many commodity producers.  Although rapid commodity output growth 

in recent years, which has reflected in part the response of producers to previous price 

increases, has certainly contributed to the fall in commodity prices, the slowing of 

demand growth from China and emerging Asia has also been an important factor.   

While the path ahead for commodity prices is, as always, uncertain, declining 

investment rates in emerging Asia, particularly China, present the prospect of a prolonged 

decline in the growth rate of commodity demand.  And prices could remain low for quite
