the Congress twice each year on the economy and monetary policy.16  The FOMC, the 

Fed’s monetary policymaking arm, releases a statement after each of its meetings that 

explains the Committee’s policy decision and reports the vote on that decision.  The 

FOMC also publishes the minutes of each meeting just three weeks after the meeting 

occurs and provides, with a lag, full meeting transcripts.  In addition, the FOMC has 

begun providing the public a quarterly summary of Committee participants’ forecasts of 

key economic variables and, more recently, their assessments of the longer-run values to 

which these variables would be expected to converge over time.17  The information 

released by the FOMC provides substantial grist for the activities of legions of “Fed 

watchers” who analyze all aspects of monetary policy in great detail. 

Apart from traditional monetary policy, the Federal Reserve’s response to the 

financial crisis has involved a range of new policy measures, about which the Fed has 

provided extensive information.  For example, the Board has regularly published detailed 

information about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the special liquidity facilities 

that were introduced.  We created a section on our website devoted to these issues and 

initiated a regular monthly report as well.18  And we are committed to exploring new 

ways to enhance the Federal Reserve’s transparency without compromising our mandated 

monetary policy and financial stability objectives.19
