stock of total deferred tax assets to estimate the pro forma value, in accordance with existing capital rules. 
Finally, after-tax changes to retained earnings were combined with projected preferred dividend 
payments to estimate the change in equity capital and pro forma equity capital for year-end 2010.10 [Footnote 10. 
Common dividends were assumed to be zero in the more adverse scenario. End footnote 10.] Pro forma risk-weighted assets were 
defined as RWA from 4Q 2008 plus any assets brought onto the balance sheet in accordance with FAS 140.11  

[Footnote 11. The supervisors conducting the credit analysis worked closely with accounting specialists in the 
agencies to ensure that the firms' projections were consistent with existing accounting standards. Additionally, 
supervisors evaluated the potential impact of proposed changes to FAS 140 and FIN 46(R) which are expected 
to be finalized in May 2009 and implemented in January 2010. The agencies' accounting specialists discussed the 
amendments with FASB members and staff and other experts to assess the reasonableness of firm estimates of 
assets likely to be brought on to the balance sheet starting in 2010 as a result of the amendments. The on-boarding 
of assets were also factored into our assessment of risk-weighted assets and the associated ALLL needs. .

A BHC was considered to require an additional SCAP buffer if its pro forma Tier 1 ratio was below 6 percent or if its 
pro forma Tier 1 Common ratio was below 4 percent at the end of 2010. For many firms, if a buffer was required to 
meet the Tier 1 Common capital ratio of 4 percent, the additional common or contingent common equity that would 
be raised would be sufficient to bring its Tier 1 ratio to or above 6 percent. 
The initial supplemental capital buffer estimates are based on year-end 2008 capital and risk- weighted assets, 
adjusted for FAS 140. These estimates thus do not reflect developments affecting the firms' capital positions and 
corporate structure since the end of the year. To capture these effects, the estimates for the initial capital buffers 
were adjusted to reflect certain "capital actions," representing a direct increase or decrease in the determination of 
capital needs. These adjustments were based on information supplied by participating BHCs, subject to consultation 
and review by supervisors. Capital action adjustments reflect factors such as contracted material sales or 
dispositions of businesses, holdings or discontinued operations, contracted exchanges of securities with a BHCs 
capital structure, and the amount (if any) of mandatory convertible preferred to convert to common by year-end 
2010. The results were also adjusted to reflect Q1 2009 operating performance. The final supplemental capital 
buffer is the initial estimate plus or minus the impact of these adjustments. 
V. Indicated Additional Capital Buffers under SCAP 
V.A. Aggregate SCAP Buffer 
The initial results using data through Q4 2008 suggest that the aggregate capital needed for the 19 BHCs 
to reach the SCAP capital buffer targets in the more adverse scenario is $185 billion, the vast majority of which 
needs to be in the form of Tier 1 Common capital (table 2). Capital needs are mainly in the form of Tier 1 Common 
capital, which reflects the fact that while many institutions have a sufficient amount of capital, they need to take steps 
to improve the quality of that capital. 
The final capital buffer incorporates capital actions and the impact of Q1 2009 operating performance. These 
adjustments are substantial, reflecting strong pre-provision net revenues at some firms in the first quarter and, to a 
much larger degree, efforts already taken by some firms prior to the conclusion of the SCAP to raise common equity 
by selling subsidiaries, converting preferred stock, or issuing common shares. After taking into account the 
completed or contracted capital actions and the
