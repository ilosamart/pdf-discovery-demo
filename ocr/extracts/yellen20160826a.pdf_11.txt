removing monetary policy accommodation primarily by adjusting short-term interest 

rates rather than by actively managing its asset holdings.13  That strategy--raising short-

term interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a 

relatively large balance sheet and plentiful bank reserves--depended on our ability to pay 

interest on excess reserves.   

Where Do We Go from Here?  

What does the future hold for the Fed’s toolkit?  For starters, our ability to use 

interest on reserves is likely to play a key role for years to come.  In part, this reflects the 

outlook for our balance sheet over the next few years.  As the FOMC has noted in its 

recent statements, at some point after the process of raising the federal funds rate is well 

under way, we will cease or phase out reinvesting repayments of principal from our 

securities holdings.  Once we stop reinvestment, it should take several years for our asset 

holdings--and the bank reserves used to finance them--to passively decline to a more 

normal level.  But even after the volume of reserves falls substantially, IOER will still be 

important as a contingency tool, because we may need to purchase assets during future 

recessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions.14  Forecasts now show the 

                                                 
13 The FOMC’s “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans” call for reducing the Federal Reserve’s 

securities holdings in a “gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of 

principal on securities held in the [System Open Market Account]” (Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles and 

Plans,” press release, September 17, second bullet, 

www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm). Consistent with those plans, the 

Federal Open Market Committee anticipates that it will maintain its current reinvestment strategy “until 

normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” (for instance, see Board of Governors 

of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, 

December 16, paragraph 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm. 
14 If the FOMC were to again increase the size of the balance sheet markedly in response to a future 

recession, then the ability to pay interest on reserves could be critical during the subsequent recovery period 

to help control short-term interest rates while the balance sheet remains elevated.  Beyond this motivation 

for retaining IOER, the ability to pay interest on reserves could also be important to the operation of any 

special liquidity and credit facilities that might be created to deal with systemic disruptions to the financial
