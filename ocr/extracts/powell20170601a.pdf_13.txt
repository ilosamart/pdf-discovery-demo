reserve supply.  This process was operationally and resource intensive for the Desk and 

its counterparties.  As a consequence of QE, however, reserves have been highly 

abundant and will remain so for some years.  To affect financial conditions, the Federal 

Reserve has therefore used administered rates, including the interest rate paid on excess 

reserves (IOER) and, more recently, the offering rate of the overnight reverse repurchase 

agreement (ON RRP) facility.  This approach, sometimes referred to as a “floor system,” 

is simple to operate and has provided good control over the federal funds rate.  In 

November 2016, when the Committee discussed using a floor system as part of its 

longer-run framework, I was among those who saw such an approach as “likely to be 

relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, 

and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.”24  

Some have advocated a return to a framework similar to the pre-2007 system, in 

which the volume of reserves would likely be far below its present level and the federal 

funds rate would be managed by frequent open market operations.25  This “corridor” 

framework remains a feasible option, although, in my view, it may be less robust over 

time than a floor system.   

Concluding Remarks 

After a tumultuous decade, the economy is now close to full employment and 

price stability.  The problems that some commentators predicted have not come to pass.  

Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather,
