inflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource 

utilization--which may serve as an indicator of firms’ marginal costs--is persistently high 

or low.17 

While this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains 

useful, questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the 

Great Recession and the subsequent slow recovery.  For example, the influence of labor 

market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been 

commonly thought prior to the financial crisis.  Although inflation fell during the 

recession, the decline was quite modest given how high unemployment rose; likewise, 

wages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered.  

Whether this reduction in sensitivity was somehow caused by the recession or instead 

pre-dated it and was merely revealed under extreme conditions is unclear.18  Either way, 

the underlying cause is unknown.  Does the reduced sensitivity reflect structural changes, 

such as globalization or a greater role for intangible capital in production that have 

reduced the importance of cyclical swings in domestic activity for firms’ marginal costs 

and pricing power?  Or does it perhaps reflect the well-documented reluctance--or, 

                                                 
17 In the economic literature, this general description of the inflation process is referred to as the 
expectations-augmented Phillips curve.  In its simplest form, the Phillips curve relates inflation to expected 
inflation and the intensity of resource utilization in the economy.  In practice, however, empirical 
specifications also typically include measures of supply shocks, such as changes in the relative prices of 
energy or imported goods, as additional determinants.  Two well-known variants of the Phillips curve are 
the traditional “accelerationist” specification and the so-called New Keynesian Phillips curve; the former 
approximates inflation expectations using a moving average of past inflation, while the latter assumes that 
inflation expectations are “rational” and consistent with the predictions of a structural model of the entire 
economy.  Some adherents of either type of Phillips curve argue that their preferred model can explain the 
behavior of inflation during and after the financial crisis.  For example, Gordon (2013) presents evidence in 
favor of an accelerationist model, while Del Negro, Giannoni, and Schorfheide (2015) make this claim for a 
New Keynesian model. 
18 See Blanchard (2016) for evidence on how the responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization has 
changed over time.  Interestingly, research suggests that this sensitivity began declining well before the 
crisis.
