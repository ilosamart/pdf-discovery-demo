from the CRA reports that those with more credit experience are more likely to be 
involved in the opt-out process than those with less credit experience. 

Consumers in the group who said they had heard of the federal law were asked further 
how they had heard of the law. Most responses mentioned their information was from 
television, newspapers, and magazines. Some consumers also mentioned family, 
acquaintances, and other sources. Less than 10 percent of those with credit cards and 
aware of the law indicated that they learned about the opt-out possibility from the 
prescreened solicitation itself (data not in table). 

The survey also asked those respondents with general-purpose credit cards who had 
received prescreened solicitations for more information about their experiences with the 
mailings they had received.23 One question asked whether the information contained in 
the mailings was helpful. About 9 percent of the respondents to this question indicated 
they did not know, and so it seems probable they did not pay very much attention to the 
information (table 5). The rest of the respondents were close to evenly divided on 
whether the information received was helpful (about 40 percent) or not (just under 50 
percent). Within the groups, a much higher proportion of the negative responders took 
the more extreme position that it was very unhelpful, probably indicating an expression 
of frustration with receiving so much “junk mail.” Regardless, the finding that a 
significant portion of consumers appeared to be generally familiar with the kind of 
information in the prescreened solicitations is consistent with the view that prevalence of 
prescreened solicitations is useful in disseminating pricing information and encouraging 
competitive conditions in markets for credit cards generally, even if only a small minority 
of recipients actually respond to a given prescreened solicitation program. 

For those respondents who said that the information was helpful, a follow-up question 
asked what specific information was helpful. Nearly 70 percent mentioned interest rates 
or annual percentage rates (table 5). Some noted information about particular rate 
features, for example, introductory rates or standard rates. About 35 percent of the 
respondents specifically mentioned various fees such as annual fees, balance transfer 
fees, and late fees. All of this again suggests that many consumers seem to know what 
the prescreened solicitations contain, which is important for price competition to work, 
even if they do not respond to, or even focus very carefully on, the contents of any given 
piece of mail that they receive from card issuers.24 

23 The survey design did not contemplate asking those without general-purpose credit cards many 
follow-up questions about their experiences with solicitations because the small sample size of this group in 
the nationally representative survey would not permit much further breakdown of their experiences. 

24 A follow-up question asked both those who said the information was helpful and those who said it 
was not how it could be made more helpful. Respondents gave a wide variety of answers, but those already 
favorably inclined toward the information more often suggested aspects of format and clarity (data not in 
table). Those unfavorably inclined indicated more often either that they did not know how the information 
could be improved, or just said fewer mailings should be sent. The latter group just seemed more frustrated 
with the frequency of “junk mail,” likely because they were not looking for any more credit cards.
