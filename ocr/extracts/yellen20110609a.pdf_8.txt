to be underwater as borrowers with prime mortgages in high-income neighborhoods.  

Because houses are, on average, a much larger share of assets for homeowners in low- 

and moderate-income neighborhoods, these homeowners had few other assets to draw 

upon to compensate for the drop in house prices.9  As a result, borrowers in these 

neighborhoods who suffered a job loss or other economic misfortune were more likely to 

default on their mortgages.  Indeed, 13 percent of mortgages originated to borrowers in 

low- and moderate-income neighborhoods were 90 days or more overdue in the first 

quarter of 2011, compared with 6 percent of mortgages originated to borrowers in high-

income neighborhoods. 

 The higher rates of delinquency suggest that homeownership may have been a 

riskier proposition over the past decade for households in low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods than in high-income neighborhoods.  Delinquency rates are higher, in 

part, because borrowers in these communities were more likely to end up in complicated 

or inappropriate mortgage products, unacceptably often as a result of unfair and deceptive 

lending practices.  But borrowers in these communities may also be more sensitive to 

house price declines because they may have fewer financial resources outside of housing, 

and they may have had little equity in the property to begin with.10  

                                                            
9 Houses represented nearly three-fourths of total assets for homeowners in low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods in 2007, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances.  In contrast, homes typically 
represented a bit over half of gross assets for homeowners in higher income neighborhoods in 2007. 
10 The median combined loan-to-value ratio on securitized subprime purchase mortgages originated in 2005 
through 2007 was 100 percent.  See Christopher Mayer, Karen Pence, and Shane M. Sherlund (2008), “The
