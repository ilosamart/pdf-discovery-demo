The persistence of the weakness in core price inflation deserves attention.  For the 

post-recession period as a whole, low levels of resource utilization surely accounted for a 

substantial part of the weakness.  But resource utilization has increased dramatically 

since 2009, and core price inflation has remained quite low. 

A sizable decline in import prices over the past year has also contributed.  As a 

result of the sharp increase in the dollar over the past year or so, prices for non-oil 

imports fell at an annual rate of a little over 4 percent in the first half of the year and look 

to decline a further 2 percent at an annual rate over the second half.  Estimates suggest 

the dollarâ€™s rise will hold down core inflation between 1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this 

year, restraint that would wane if the dollar stabilized going forward. 

However, recent weakness is not completely explained by import prices.  Services 

prices excluding energy, which are generally relatively little affected by changes in the 

dollar, have also shown no sign of acceleration in recent years.  Instead, inflation in this 

category has moved lower over the past year.  In August, the 12-month change in non-

energy services prices was 2 percent, 1/4 percentage point lower than the pace of increase 

from 2012 through the middle of 2014.   

The outlook for inflation is critical for purposes of assessing progress toward our 

2 percent goal, since monetary policy operates with a lag.  In this regard, the gravitational 

force of long-term inflation expectations is critically important.  Although the story on 

this front is mostly reassuring, it warrants monitoring.  Projections from the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters suggest that longer-run inflation expectations--which appear to 

be most relevant for predicting future inflation--have remained at 2 percent since the end 

of 2012.  Household surveys, such as University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers,
