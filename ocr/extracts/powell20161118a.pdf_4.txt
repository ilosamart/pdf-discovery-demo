foreign economies, the differential was just about zero in the more recent period, indicating that 

real import growth barely kept pace with GDP growth.  Trade relative to GDP has held up better, 

though, in the United States and Latin America.      

Is the trade slowdown just another manifestation of slow growth, or is it an independent 

concern?  That depends on the reasons for the slowdown.  Weak global growth is surely part of 

the explanation, as emphasized by several recent empirical studies, including a special chapter on 

the topic in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook.5  As can be seen in slide 5, global GDP 

growth has fallen from an average of 3.5 percent before the Global Financial Crisis to about 

2.5 percent since its end.   

But weak global growth alone does not explain why trade has slowed to about the same 

pace as GDP after growing faster than GDP for decades.  Part of the reason could be that the 

particular expenditure categories in which international trade flows are concentrated have 

become especially weak.  A stark case in point is the Global Financial Crisis, when plummeting 

demand for investment and durable goods--two highly traded expenditure categories--

contributed to the sharp 4 percentage point fall in the ratio of world trade to GDP.  The special 

weakness in some components of demand has persisted beyond the crisis and could also explain 

some of the recent sluggishness in trade relative to GDP.  In particular, as you can see from the 

middle two bars of slide 5, the slowdown in world investment growth--from about 4.5 percent 

growth before the Global Financial Crisis to only about 3 percent growth since 2011--has been
