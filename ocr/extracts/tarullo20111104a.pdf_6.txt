capital requirements as they come into effect.  We will provide more detail on this point in a few 

weeks when we issue guidance and instructions for the 2012 capital review. 

Last, it is important to note that supervisors may require banking organizations to 

increase capital ratios above the minimum levels specified in Basel I and II for a variety of safety 

and soundness reasons.  Institution-specific measures of this sort are explicitly contemplated in 

both Basel II and U.S. banking regulations.  During the financial crisis, we used our safety and 

soundness authority to require banks to hold sufficient capital to weather the impact of the crisis 

and the serious recession that followed.  Similarly, our annual capital plan review is a forward-

looking exercise that, in estimating losses and reduced revenues that would follow an adverse 

economic scenario, may result in requiring banks to maintain more capital than would a static 

snapshot of minimum capital levels.   

Unlike the Basel 2.5 and Basel III capital standards, the quantitative liquidity framework 

requires further work in the Basel Committee.  The committee has developed two 

complementary liquidity requirements:  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was designed to 

promote short-term liquidity resiliency of firms, while the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 

directed at medium-term structural liquidity mismatches.  The framework presented to the 

GHOS in 2010 was genuinely pathbreaking, in that it was the first effort ever to establish 

quantitative liquidity requirements.  Precisely because of the novelty of this exercise, questions 

were raised in the GHOS as to how the definition and calibration of the new ratios aligned with 

actual experience in the crisis, and whether the ratios might result in some adverse unintended 

consequences on financial markets.  Consequently, the GHOS agreed to delay implementation of 

both standards and provide for what were termed “observation periods,” during which further 

analysis will be done and changes very likely made.
