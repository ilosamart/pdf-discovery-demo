that there has also been substantial pass-through to corporate bond rates.  Based on this 

evidence, a reasonable estimate is that, if the Fed were to undertake an additional $500 

billion Treasury LSAP, both long-term Treasury and corporate bond rates might be 

expected to decline by something on the order of 15 to 20 basis points.   

This observation leads to an important conceptual question:  How should one 

expect a firm to respond when its long-term borrowing costs fall not because of a change 

in the expected future path of short-term rates--as would be the case with a conventional 

monetary easing--but rather because of a change in the term premium?  By way of a 

benchmark, it should be emphasized that many macro models--including the Fed staffâ€™s 

FRB/US model--implicitly treat the two sorts of shocks as having similar effects on 

corporate investment.  But is there any reason to believe that, in reality, the response to 

the two might differ? 

A basic corporate finance analysis suggests the answer may be yes--and, in 

particular, that a shock to the term premium is more likely to elicit a financing response 

on the part of firms, as opposed to a change in their capital spending plans.  To see why, 

consider the following example.  A firm faces a rate on its 10-year bonds of 2 percent.  At 

the same time, it expects that the sequence of rolled-over short-term rates over the next 

10 years will average 3 percent.  Hence, there is a term premium of minus 1 percent.  

What should the firm do?  Clearly, it should take advantage of the cheap long-term debt 

by issuing bonds.  But if the firm is not facing a binding financing constraint, it is less 

obvious that the bargain 2 percent rate on these bonds should exert any influence on its 

capital spending plans.  After all, it can use the proceeds of the bond issue to pay down 

short-term debt, repurchase stock, or buy short-term securities.  These capital-structure
