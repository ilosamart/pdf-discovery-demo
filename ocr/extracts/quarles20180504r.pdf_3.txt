Monetary Policy and the Efficiency of the Financial System  

Before I delve into the more specific complicated subject of how one type of bank 

regulation affects the Fed’s balance sheet, let me say a few words about financial 

regulation more generally.   

As I have said previously, I view promoting the safety, soundness, and efficiency 

of the financial system as one of the most important roles of the Board.  Improving 

efficiency of the financial system is not an isolated goal.  The task is to enhance 

efficiency while maintaining the system’s resiliency.  Take, for example, the Board’s two 

most recent and material proposals, the stress capital buffer and the enhanced 

supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR).  The proposal to modify the eSLR, in particular, 

initially raised questions in the minds of some as to whether it would reduce the ability of 

the banking system to weather shocks.  A closer look at the proposal shows that the 

opposite is true.  The proposed change simply restores the original intent of leverage 

requirements as a backstop measure to risk-based capital requirements.  As we have seen, 

a leverage requirement that is too high favors high-risk activities and disincentivizes low-

risk activities.  

We had initially calibrated the leverage ratio at a level that caused it to be the 

binding constraint for a number of our largest banks.  As a result, those banks had an 

incentive to add risk rather than reduce risk in their portfolios because the capital cost of 

each additional asset was the same whether it was risky or safe, and the riskier assets 

would produce the higher return.  The proposed recalibration eliminates this incentive by 

returning this leverage ratio to a level that is a backstop rather than the driver of decisions 

at the margin.  Yet, because of the complex way our capital regulations work together--
