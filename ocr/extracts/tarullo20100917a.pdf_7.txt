though, the analogy is not a perfect one.  While banks and their depositors are assured that the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will keep the latter whole in the event of the former’s 

failure, the Federal Reserve does not make binding commitments to lend to any institution and 

actively discourages reliance on the window for regular funding.   

A third question about the G-M proposal arises because of the significant changes in 

current law and practice that would be required were the proposal to be adopted.  The prohibition 

on ABS holdings by anyone other than NFBs is the obvious and major example.  But there are 

several others:  In addition to the possibly problematic features of discount window lending in 

general for the proposal, the Federal Reserve has traditionally opened the window to non-

depository institutions only in particularly stressed conditions.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, any 

use of credit ratings in federal regulations will be prohibited, an obvious complication to the G-

M proposal.  This part of Dodd-Frank has accelerated and expanded the efforts already underway 

at the federal banking agencies to lessen regulatory reliance on ratings.  In truth, it may pose no 

greater challenge for the G-M proposal than for many existing capital rules.4  Still, it may require 

extension of G-M’s confidence that the regulator could adequately oversee ABS ratings to 

confidence that it could assign ratings in the first place.  I would observe that the substantial 

effort expended by staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to evaluate the 

creditworthiness of a relatively small number of securitizations in the Term Asset-Backed 

Securities Loan Facility suggests the enormity of that task.  Furthermore, the wisdom of having a 

government agency--even the independent central bank--assume such a permanent, central role 

in credit allocation should at least be subject to debate. 

A final regulatory issue is raised by another G-M response to their expectation that equity 

returns for NFBs will be lower than for traditional banks.  In place of the equity capital
