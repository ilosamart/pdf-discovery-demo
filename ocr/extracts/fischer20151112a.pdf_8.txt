U.S. Monetary Policy and the Dollar  

The stronger dollar and some of the factors causing it, including weaker foreign 

demand, have played an important role in accounting for revisions to the expected path of 

U.S. policy rates compared with what was expected in the summer of last year.  The 

forecasts made by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants on a quarterly 

basis, which are published in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), provide a 

good indication of the extent to which forecasts for inflation, output growth, and the 

federal funds rate have changed since the summer of 2014.  The June 2014 SEP showed 

U.S. GDP growth centered at roughly 3 percent in 2015 and core inflation running around 

1-3/4 percent, and the median participant projected that the appropriate level of the 

federal funds rate at the end of 2015 would be 1-1/4 percent before rising to 2-1/2 percent 

at the end of 2016.9  But in the most recent SEP following the September 2015 FOMC 

meeting, the median participant saw GDP growth at only 2 percent this year, core 

inflation at 1-1/2  percent, and the federal funds rate below 1/2 percent at the end of 2015 

before rising to only 1-1/2 percent at the end of 2016.10   

This greater degree of monetary accommodation seems appropriate given the 

adverse effects on U.S. aggregate demand coming from the rise in the dollar, an 

associated weakening of foreign economic prospects, and other developments that have 

restrained spending and kept inflation undesirably low.  Monetary policy easing helps 

through “crowding in” domestic demand, which in turn helps boost price inflation and 

makes it less likely that inflation expectations drift below our 2 percent target.
