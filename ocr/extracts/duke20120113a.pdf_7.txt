Balancing Safety and Soundness with Credit Availability 

 Since 2008, many banks have seen their assets’ quality criticized and their ratings 

downgraded.  This is not surprising given the severity of the economic downturn and the effect it 

had on the quality of bank assets.  However, some bankers complain that examiners also 

tightened their approach.  Indeed, we repeatedly hear that fear of examiner criticism is one of the 

reasons banks hesitate to lend to small businesses.  We take these concerns seriously.  In 

response, we are actively communicating with examiners and have stepped up examiner training 

to ensure that supervision in the field is consistent with policy.  At the same time, I think it is 

important to continually reevaluate our supervisory policies and procedures to ensure that the 

policies themselves are not unnecessarily constricting credit availability.  Here are a few such 

policies that we are currently evaluating at the Federal Reserve.  

CRE concentrations 

 First, is the interagency supervisory guidelines issued in 2006 that required additional risk 

monitoring of CRE lending whenever loans reached certain thresholds--100 percent of capital for 

loans secured by construction and land acquisition activities and 300 percent of capital for loans 

secured by total non-owner occupied commercial real estate, including construction and land 

acquisition activities. 5  Although these thresholds were never intended to be hard caps, we hear 

from banks that they are now widely regarded as such.  Many bankers have told me that they 

manage their loan portfolios to stay below these thresholds and forego growth in these loan 

categories, even when promising, creditworthy lending prospects are available.  These reports 

were so widespread that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on
