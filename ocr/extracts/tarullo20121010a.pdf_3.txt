protection.  Banking law reforms enacted after the 1980s savings and loan debacle had traces of 

concern with financial stability, but the emphasis was still on the regulation of individual 

depository institutions.  Most other banking law changes of the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in 

the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, were essentially deregulatory.1  These laws, along with 

the administrative actions that both preceded and implemented them, removed many restrictions 

on activities, affiliations, and the geographic reach of commercial banks without substituting new 

regulatory mechanisms to control the institution-specific risks that could arise from the growth of 

financial services conglomerates, much less the systemic risks created by the rapid integration of 

capital markets and traditional lending activities.2  The major regulatory initiative of this period 

was the Basel II package of changes to capital requirements, an exercise whose shortcomings 

included an enhancement, rather than diminution, of regulatory incentive for procyclicality in 

bank lending, and thus could arguably increase systemic risk.   

 By the time financial stress began rising rapidly in the second half of 2007, systemic risk 

and financial instability had come to seem more theoretical than real to many regulators, 

academics, and financial market participants.  There had been little in the way of Congressional 

discussion of systemic risk issues, and little in the way of well-developed recommendations.  To 

be sure, some academics – mostly finance professors – and a few intrepid, heterodox voices 

among central bank research staffs identified risks that might be building and, in general terms, 

the need for macroprudential regulation to complement traditional microprudential oversight.  

But even they tended more to diagnosis and warning than to prescription.  Thus, although major 

regulatory legislation is often preceded by long periods during which key ideas and proposals are 

circulated and discussed, Congress was writing on a mostly blank slate in crafting an immediate 

legislative response to the financial crisis.
