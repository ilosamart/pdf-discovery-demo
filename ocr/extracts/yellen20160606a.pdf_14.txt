of underlying forces affecting the economy.  At present, many estimates show the neutral 

rate to be quite low by historical standards--indeed, close to zero when measured in real, 

or inflation-adjusted, terms.13  The current actual value of the federal funds rate, also 

measured in real terms, is even lower, somewhere around minus 1 percent.  With the 

actual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate, the 

stance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative.14   

Although the economy is now fairly close to the FOMCâ€™s goal of maximum 

employment, I view our modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for 

several reasons.  First, with inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild 

undershooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could 

help move inflation back up to 2 percent more quickly.  Second, a stronger job market 

could also support labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater 

labor force participation.  A third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint 

on conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero.  If inflation 

were to move persistently above 2 percent or the economy were to become notably 

overheated, the Committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds 

rate.  However, if inflation were to remain persistently low or the expansion were to 

                                                 
13 The neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, and 
estimates will vary depending on the methodology employed.  However, we know that the neutral rate must 
have been well below its historical norm in recent years, because with the actual real interest having been 
as low as it has been lately, the economy would have otherwise expanded much more than has been the 
case.  In recent years, the neutral rate has likely been held down below normal levels because of the factors 
I discussed earlier, including persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low 
rates of household formation, and weak productivity growth.  As I have noted before (see Yellen, 2015b), 
there is empirical evidence to support the conclusion that the neutral rate is currently not far from zero.  
See, in particular, Lubik and Matthes (2015), Laubach and Williams (2016), and Johanssen and Mertens 
(2016).  
14 The targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.37 percent, less the 12-month core inflation rate for personal 
consumption expenditures through April, equals about negative 1.2 percent.
