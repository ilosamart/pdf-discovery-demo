to apply:  structural reforms to boost domestic demand and potential growth and reduce 

excessive saving.  For some economies, a rebalancing of demand toward domestic sectors will 

require significant changes in relative prices, and hence more flexible exchange rates will need to 

be part of the equation.  These measures will not be undertaken solely to satisfy the ethereal 

principle of global rebalancing enunciated at countless meetings in international policy circles; 

instead, these measures will be undertaken because they are in the best interests of the countries 

themselves.  In particular, more flexible exchange rates will help domestic demand fill in the gap 

left once foreign demand falls back to a more sustainable level.  More flexible exchange rates 

also provide domestic policymakers greater scope to focus on domestic goals of full employment 

and price stability. 

It is worth underscoring that even if authorities around the world aggressively undertake 

structural reforms that ameliorate current global imbalances, these actions will not preclude the 

emergence of large current account surpluses and deficits in the future.  But the emergence of 

such imbalances should not necessarily be worrisome.  As I noted earlier, in a world where 

different economies are periodically buffeted by different types of shocks, some of which may be 

quite persistent, cross-country dispersion in external balances is a perfectly natural way of 

smoothing the effects of these shocks over time. 

What is important is to ensure that international capital flows do not combine with other 

weaknesses in the financial system to lay the groundwork for some future global crisis.  

Consequently, we need to work simultaneously on rebalancing global demand and strengthening 

the structure, operation, and governance of financial systems.  Neither task is easy, but both are 

essential to a more stable world than the one we have experienced over the past few years.
