or economic circumstances, such as widespread buildups of leverage in good times that 

could ultimately unwind in destabilizing ways.  

To be sure, a macroprudential approach to oversight does not avoid the need for 

careful microprudential regulation and supervision.  The oversight of individual 

institutions serves many purposes beyond the enhancement of systemic stability, 

including the protection of the deposit insurance fund, the detection of money laundering 

and other forms of financial crime, and the prevention of unlawful discrimination or 

abusive lending practices.  Equally important, however, is that microprudential oversight 

also provides the knowledge base on which a more systemic approach must be built; we 

cannot understand what is going on in the system as a whole without a clear view of 

developments within key firms and markets.  Without a strong microprudential 

framework to underpin them, macroprudential policies would be ineffective. 

That said, a key lesson of the crisis is that a purely microprudential approach, 

focused on the conditions of individual firms or markets, may fail to detect important 

systemic or cross-cutting risks.  For example, a traditional microprudential examination 

might find that an individual financial institution is relying heavily on short-term 

wholesale funding, which may or may not induce a supervisory response.  The 

implications of that finding for the stability of the broader system, however, cannot be 

determined without knowing what is happening outside that particular firm.  Are other, 

similar financial firms also highly reliant on short-term funding?  If so, are the sources of 

short-term funding heavily concentrated?  Is the market for short-term funding likely to 

be stable in a period of high uncertainty, or is it vulnerable to runs?  If short-term funding 

were suddenly to become unavailable, how would the borrowing firms react--for
