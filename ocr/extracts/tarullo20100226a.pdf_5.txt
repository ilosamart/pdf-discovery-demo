creation of an independent consumer financial services protection agency and the

specifics of the legislation, my summary of the reform agenda as it has evolved to this 

point will include some proposed legislative elements, as well as various administrative 

measures being pursued by the regulatory agencies under existing statutory authority.  

It is perhaps instructive to organize this agenda by reference to the “three pillars” 

of financial regulation enunciated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision--

Basel II arrangement for capital requirements, this frame of reference can also be applied 

to the broader set of reform measures.   

As to minimum prudential rules, U.S. banking agencies are joining with our 

international counterparts in the Basel Committee to modify capital and liquidity
