compositions unchanged at the average shares in 2008 and 2009, but at a cost to the 

portfolio’s credit quality (figure 6).  Regression results confirm that in choosing among 

foreign government bonds, U.S. investors have put more weight on returns since the 

crisis.6 

But search for higher returns has not been the only motivation for international 

investors post-crisis:  Demand for liquid high-grade “safe” or money-like assets has also 

increased from foreign official investors for investment of foreign exchange reserves, 

from pension funds and other institutions who face portfolio allocation constraints or 

regulatory requirements, and from investment strategies requiring cash-like assets for 

margining and other collateral purposes.  Some shift to safe assets is also seen in U.S. 

portfolios:  U.S. investors actively rebalanced their holdings of foreign financial sector 

bonds toward those with higher credit ratings, but at some cost in returns (figure 7; figure 

8).7   

Taken together, developments in U.S. bond portfolios do not indicate a worrisome 

pickup in risk-taking in external investments.  But it is important to recognize that 

portfolio reallocations that seem relatively small for U.S. investors can loom large from 

the perspective of the foreign recipients of these flows.  At roughly $400 billion at the 

end of 2012, emerging market bonds accounted for a tiny fraction of the roughly 

$25 trillion in bonds held by U.S. investors.  But to the recipient countries, these holdings 

can account for a large fraction of their bond markets.  Even relatively small changes in
