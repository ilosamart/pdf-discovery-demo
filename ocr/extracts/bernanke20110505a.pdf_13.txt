Macroprudential considerations have also been important for the Federal 

Reserve’s rulemaking, particularly those rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.  For 

example, with other regulators, we recently proposed rules to set margin requirements for 

over-the-counter derivatives that are not cleared through a central counterparty.  The 

proposed rules reflect not only safety-and-soundness concerns but also macroprudential 

goals; specifically, the rules seek to increase the resiliency of the financial system as a 

whole by reducing the potential for contagion between swap market participants.  Under 

the proposed rules, the most-stringent margin requirements would apply to derivatives 

contracts between swap dealers or other major swaps market participants, as such 

arrangements could otherwise involve a risk of “default chains” in which distress at one 

major firm could cascade through the swap markets.   

As I mentioned earlier, the macroprudential approach to financial regulation is 

gaining increasing adherence internationally.  Along with our efforts to implement 

reforms domestically, the Federal Reserve has for some time been working closely with 

foreign counterparts to help coordinate the reform process at the international level.  The 

objectives of international coordination are of the highest importance.  These goals 

include maintaining a level competitive playing field across countries, minimizing 

opportunities for multinational firms to take advantage of weaker or inconsistent 

regulations in some jurisdictions, establishing consistent and complementary standards, 

and ensuring effective oversight of internationally active firms and markets.  The Group 

of Twenty has devoted considerable attention to financial-sector policies in its meetings 

during the past couple of years.  The Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on
