throughout a financial network determines the systemwide implications of liquidity 

shocks or other financial stresses in one part of the network.  This finding is one reason 

why efforts to collect more and better data on the precise linkages among financial 

institutions are so important.  Without such comprehensive and detailed data, it is simply 

not possible to understand how stress in one part of the network may spread and affect 

the entire system. 

Networks that are more interconnected are inherently more complex than those in 

which market participants have fewer links to one another, and complexity can 

exacerbate the kinds of coordination problems highlighted by Diamond and Dybvig and 

by Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet.  Of course, “complexity” is difficult to define in a 

completely systematic and satisfactory manner, but one way emphasized in recent work 

by Hyun Song Shin is to consider the number of links required to connect savers to 

borrowers.

  Shin’s analysis of interconnectedness among financial institutions is based 

on the idea that the ultimate amount of lending and borrowing that can occur in an 

economy is determined by economic fundamentals such as income growth, which change 

only slowly over time, whereas interbank claims can grow or contract far more quickly.  

Of course, claims within the entire financial system net out to zero, but they do affect the 

leverage of the institutions involved.  In Shin’s model, financial institutions seek to take 

on more leverage during a boom, when banks have strong capital positions and risks are 

perceived to be low, but can increase leverage, in the aggregate, only by borrowing and 

lending more intensively to each other.  This causes the resulting network of intertwining 

claims to extend further and further.  Conversely, when fundamental conditions or market 

sentiments change and financial institutions prefer to shed risk, they can deleverage in the
