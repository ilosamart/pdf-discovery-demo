economic performance turns out to be disappointing and progress toward our goals 

proceeds more slowly than we expect, then the future path of interest rates likely would 

be more accommodative than we currently anticipate.  As I have noted many times, 

monetary policy is not on a preset path.  The Committee will be closely monitoring 

incoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate 

stance of monetary policy.  

Overall, I suspect that many of the labor market issues you will be discussing at 

this conference will be at the center of FOMC discussions for some time to come.  I thank 

you in advance for the insights you will offer and encourage you to continue the 

important research that advances our understanding of cyclical and structural labor 

market issues.
