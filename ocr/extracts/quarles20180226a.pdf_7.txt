Perhaps most important in explaining the growth slowdown has been the 

lackluster increase of productivity in recent years.  Labor productivity has averaged an 

annual growth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 2-1/4 percent pace 

prevalent over the two decades leading into the financial crisis.  Why has productivity 

growth been so anemic?  A number of theories have been raised, but there does not 

appear to be a clear answer--and certainly not a consensus answer.   

One school of thought is that productivity growth has not slowed down much at 

all; rather, new technologies and products have made economic output harder to 

measure.6  It is not difficult to think of technological developments that have had a deep 

and pervasive effect on our daily lives (smartphone apps, for example) but perhaps in a 

manner that is difficult to describe in the existing vocabulary of economic statistics.  

However, the counter to this argument is that troubles in measuring “newness” are not 

especially new.  Measuring the effect of new technologies has always been difficult, and 

there is little evidence to suggest that it has become more difficult. 7 

Others argue a somewhat pessimistic view that the slowdown reflects a paucity of 

new inventions--or at least new inventions that lead to more rapid productivity growth.8   

In a break with the easy dichotomy I offered earlier, others tie the slowdown in 

productivity growth more tightly to developments related to the aftermath of the financial 

crisis.  Slow investment growth--which, as already mentioned, had prevailed until 

recently--damps the contribution of new capital to worker productivity.  It could also be 

                                                 
6 See Hatzius and others (2016) for an overview of some issues that new technologies and products may be 

introducing into the measurement of GDP and productivity. 
7 See Syverson (2017) and Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016). 
8 Gordon (2016) argues that recent technological advances have been relatively minor compared with the 

large advances that drove rapid increases in productivity in the past.
