In this lecture, I would like to emphasize both aspects of our global 

connectedness--spillovers from the United States to foreign economies and the effect of 

foreign economies on the United States.   

I. International Transmission of Monetary Policies 

The recognition that a change in interest rates in one nation can spill over to other 

countries dates back at least to the 18th-century writings of David Hume on the 

international effect of changes in the money supply.5  The standard models incorporating 

the international transmission of monetary policy were developed by Marcus Fleming 

and Robert Mundell.  In the Mundell-Fleming framework, as well as in modern 

developments of the same theme, a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy 

in the United States spills over to foreign economies by causing their interest rates to 

fall--though typically by less than in the United States--and their currencies to appreciate 

against the dollar.  At the same time, international capital flows tend to shift toward 

foreign economies in response to their relatively more attractive interest rates.   

The pass-through of changes in U.S. policy rates abroad depends importantly on 

how foreign monetary authorities respond.  A decline in U.S. policy rates has a relatively 

large effect on foreign policy rates in economies that opt to limit exchange rate 

fluctuations, at least for economies with reasonably open capital accounts.  By contrast, a 

central bank in an economy with a freely floating exchange rate might choose to lower its 

interest rate by a much smaller amount than in the United States if it believes that 

domestic conditions so warrant.  In this case, the countryâ€™s exchange rate would
