situation could provide a bridge to an acquisition, a more orderly failure, or an internally 

generated recovery of the institution.  Any of these outcomes would forestall fire sales of assets 

or a default that could cascade across the financial system.  But while LOLR lending might be 

the best of a bad set of choices when confronted with those circumstances, those frantic efforts 

are the very situations that pose the highest risk of the central bank taking on mispriced credit 

risk.  The prospect--perhaps even expectation--of such action can foster significant moral hazard.  

While the central bank can, to some extent, control the potential moral hazard by pricing 

credit risk correctly or, more practically, by reducing credit risk close to zero by taking a large 

amount of collateral, this approach could at times actually compound liquidity stress.  If the 

central bank requires so much collateral that the risk to other short-term creditors rises, then 

those creditors have an even greater incentive to run, thereby exacerbating the situation and 

complicating a bankruptcy or orderly liquidation proceeding.  Similarly, if central bank lending 

facilitates exit by the uninsured depositors of a troubled bank, the costs borne by remaining 

creditors or the deposit insurance fund will increase.  Indeed, it is for this reason that the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) placed restrictions on 

discount window lending by the Federal Reserve to undercapitalized banks.8  

Thus, while liquidity regulation should not require self-insurance against low probability, 

severe systemic events, it has an important role to play alongside capital regulation and 

resolution mechanisms in reducing the likelihood of systemic events and making them more 

8 A central bank can also increase liquidity in the financial system by reducing its target interest rate, at least until it 
reaches the zero lower bound.  Like LOLR actions, this may well be the right policy choice when confronted with 
liquidity stress.  Again, though, the potential costs of reliance on interest rate reductions--including risks of 
undesirably high inflation, excessive leverage leading to financial stability concerns, or both--argue for a regime of 
well-considered liquidity regulations.
