We are strongly committed that at least one such rate be developed and actively 

used as soon as practicable.  And we look forward to working with financial institutions 

and other market participants to achieve this end. 

In the near term, the Federal Reserve, along with other government agencies, 

intends to meet with a wide range of market participants, including end users, to hear 

their views as to how change can be effected and to begin the work of developing 

alternatives to LIBOR.  Later this year, we will convene a group of the largest global 

dealers to discuss these issues, following a model that was successfully used to promote 

derivatives reform.  Searching for potential alternative rates and encouraging their use 

will be a key point of that discussion.  Of course, end users will be affected by these 

changes as well, and we will also consult closely with key participants outside of the 

dealer community to make sure that reform meets their needs and is not disruptive to 

them.  In particular, end users who want to continue to use LIBOR will certainly be able 

to do so, and we will work toward the goal of ensuring that any changes to LIBOR will 

not require borrowers or lenders to amend their existing contracts.  And the markets that 

reference dollar LIBOR are so enormous that there will surely be more than enough 

liquidity to support both a new risk free rate as well as LIBOR itself. 

One of the lessons that I take from our study of LIBOR is that these existing 

legacy contracts are quite important.  As I mentioned earlier, many financial contracts, 

including derivatives contracts, do not have robust backups in the event that the reference 

rates they use cease to exist.  Some derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, can be quite 

long lasting, and, over a long enough period of time, there is always a risk that any given 

reference rate will cease being published.  It is important that financial contracts address
