each area.  Internationally, the Basel Committee will continue work on the indicators used in its 

capital surcharge methodology and, of course, has yet to finalize the list of systemically 

important banks and the assignment of those banks to the various surcharge buckets.  In both 

arenas it is important to move as quickly as feasible to complete all this work, so as to provide 

more clarity to banks, markets, and the public on the details of capital requirements, while still 

ensuring that the final regulations and requirements are well-crafted.   

But if details are still lacking, the direction of these reforms is now clear.  When fully 

implemented, these reform strands together will increase significantly the safety and soundness 

of the financial system and make much less likely the need for some future TARP.  At a time 

when there is considerable disagreement over the best direction for many aspects of financial 

regulation, that result is one I suspect commands broad support among policymakers, policy 

analysts, and the public.
