information is needed to derive the concrete implications of the consensus statement for 

the FOMC’s policy decisions.   

The challenge facing the FOMC now is to devise ways to communicate its policy 

intentions during a period in which policy will most likely be constrained by the zero 

bound on short-term rates and asset purchases will be actively used to foster faster 

growth.  I think the existing FOMC postmeeting statement already goes some way in this 

direction.  With respect to the path of the federal funds rate, it offers a date--mid-2015--as 

the earliest time at which the Committee currently anticipates that liftoff might be 

warranted.  As the simulations illustrate, this date is later than the modified Taylor rule 

would predict and closer to the predictions of the optimal policy simulation.  This later 

liftoff date is consistent with the Committee’s statement that “a highly accommodative 

stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the 

economic recovery strengthens.”23  Moreover, the simulations also suggest that, once 

liftoff from the zero lower bound occurs, it would be optimal for the federal funds rate to 

remain for some time below the prescriptions from a rule, such as the modified Taylor 

rule, that might in the past have provided a good guide to the Committee’s action.  

Finally, with respect to asset purchases, the guidance indicates that, subject to ongoing 

evaluations of their efficacy and costs, purchases will continue until there is a substantial 

improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  

Importantly, this open-ended plan reflects a goal-oriented approach in which the ultimate 

quantity of asset purchases will be geared to the attainment of sufficient progress toward 

the Committee’s employment goal.
