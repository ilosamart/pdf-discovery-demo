imbalances that could contribute to financial instability.  Standard asset-valuation models 

suggest that a persistently low neutral rate, depending on the factors driving it, could lead 

to higher ratios of asset prices to underlying income flows--for example, higher ratios of 

prices to earnings for stocks or higher prices of buildings relative to rents.  If asset 

markets were highly efficient and participants had excellent foresight, this would not 

necessarily lead to imbalances.  However, to the extent that financial markets extrapolate 

price movements, markets may not transition smoothly to asset valuations that reflect 

underlying fundamentals but may instead evidence periods of overshooting.18  Such 

forces may have played a role in both the stock market boom that ended in the bust of 

2001 and the house price bubble that burst in 2007-09.   

The risks of such financial imbalances may be greater in the context of the kind of 

explicit inflation target overshooting policies proposed in the paper.  Again, if market 

participants were perfectly rational, overshooting policies would not likely pose financial 

stability risks.  But the combination of low interest rates and low unemployment that 

would prevail during the inflation overshooting period could well spark capital markets to 

overextend, leading to financial imbalances.  

Macroprudential tools are the preferred first line of defense to address such 

financial imbalances, which should in principle enable monetary policy to focus on price 

stability and macroeconomic stabilization.  But the development and deployment of 

macroprudential tools is still relatively untested in the U.S. context, and the toolkit is 

limited.  Although important research suggests that the situations under which monetary 

policy should take financial imbalances into account are likely to be very rare, some
