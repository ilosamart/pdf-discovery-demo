In Example 2, in which the dealer is an intermediary with a matched book of repo 

borrowing and lending, there is, in principle, a capital requirement on its asset-side repo 

loan to the hedge fund.  However, the Basel III risk-based capital rules allow banks and 

bank holding companies to use internal models to compute this capital charge for repo 

lending, and the resulting numbers are typically very small—for all practical purposes, 

close to zero—for overcollateralized lending transactions, with repo being the canonical 

example.  

I’m not arguing that the very low risk-based charges on repo lending in Basel III 

are “wrong” in any microprudential sense.  After all, they are designed to solve a 

different problem—that of ensuring bank solvency.  And if a bank holding company’s 

broker-dealer sub makes a repo loan of short maturity that is sufficiently well-

collateralized, it may be at minimal risk of bearing any losses—precisely because it 

operates on the premise that it can dump the collateral and get out of town before things 

get too ugly.  The risk-averse lenders in the triparty market—who, in turn, provide 

financing to the dealer—operate under the same premise.  As I noted earlier, these 

defensive reactions by providers of repo finance mean that the costs of fire sales are 

likely to be felt elsewhere in the financial system.   

2. Liquidity requirements 

Liquidity requirements, such as those embodied in the Basel III Liquidity 

Coverage Ratio (LCR), can impose a meaningful tax on certain SFTs in which the dealer 

acts as a principal.  If the dealer holds a corporate bond and finances it with repo 

                                                                                                                                                 
because it has sent $102 in Treasury securities over to its counterparty lender and only received $100 cash.  
If the repo lender defaults, the borrower could be out $2.
