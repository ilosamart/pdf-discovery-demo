year across the three most commonly cited wage measures was about 2-1/2 percent, 

compared with an average change from the end of 2009 to the end of 2014 of 2 percent.2   

The recent news on inflation--the second leg of our dual mandate--has also been 

mixed.  The price of oil has rebounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the 

year on expectations that supply and demand are likely to come into better alignment.  

Over the same period, the dollar has receded a bit, on net, from its peak in January, 

though it is still about 15 percent above the level in mid-2014 in inflation-adjusted trade-

weighted terms.  As a result, non-oil import prices look likely to stabilize this quarter 

after a year and a half of declines.  Still, it should be noted that these developments 

coincided with the easing in financial conditions since mid-February and are likely due, 

at least in part, to expectations of more gradual U.S. monetary policy tightening.  If those 

expectations were to shift materially, the conditions supporting higher inflation could 

diminish.   

While there are thus signs that inflation will move higher over the medium term, 

measures of core inflation have yet to convincingly exceed the low levels that have 

prevailed over much of the recovery.  The 12-month change in core personal 

consumption expenditure (PCE) prices, a reasonable proxy for the underlying trend in 

inflation, was only 1.6 percent in April.  This is still noticeably below our target and is 

roughly equal to the average change in core and total PCE inflation from the end of 2009 

to the end of 2014.      

We cannot rule out that stubbornly low inflation may be having an effect on 

inflation expectations.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation--which reflect

compensation per hour in the business sector, and average hourly earnings.
