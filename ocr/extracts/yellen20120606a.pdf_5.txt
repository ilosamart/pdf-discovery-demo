source of very significant headwinds.  Housing has typically been a driver of economic 

recoveries, and we have seen some modest improvement recently, but continued uncertainties 

over the direction of house prices, and very restricted mortgage credit availability for all but the 

most creditworthy buyers, will likely weigh on housing demand for some time to come.  When 

housing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied dwellings 

and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow a good deal of that demand to be met for 

a time without a sizeable expansion in homebuilding.  Moreover, the enormous toll on household 

wealth resulting from the collapse of house prices--almost a 35 percent decline from its 2006 

peak, according to the Case-Shiller index--imposes ongoing restraint on consumer spending, and 

the loss of home equity has impaired many households’ ability to borrow.    

A second headwind that will likely become more important over coming months relates 

to fiscal policy.  At the federal level, stimulus-related policies are scheduled to wind down, while 

both defense and nondefense purchases are expected to decline in inflation-adjusted terms over 

the next several years.  Toward the end of this year, important decisions regarding the extension 

of current federal tax and budget policies loom.  I will return to the associated uncertainties and 

their potentially detrimental effects later. 

A third factor weighing on the outlook is the likely sluggish pace of economic growth 

abroad.  Strains in global financial markets have resurfaced in recent months, reflecting renewed 

uncertainty about the resolution of the European situation.  Risk premiums on sovereign debt and 

other securities have risen again in many European countries, while European banks continue to 

face pressure to shrink their balance sheets.  Even without a further intensification of stresses, the 

slowdown in economic activity in Europe will likely hold back U.S. export growth.  Moreover,
