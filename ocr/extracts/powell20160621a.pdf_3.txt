based may be based on relatively few actual trades.  This calls into question whether LIBOR can 

ultimately satisfy IOSCO Principle 7 regarding data sufficiency, which requires that a 

benchmark be based on an active market.  That Principle is a particularly important one, as it is 

difficult to ask banks to submit rates at which they believe they could borrow on a daily basis if 

they do not actually borrow very often.   

That basic fact poses the risk that LIBOR could eventually be forced to stop publication 

entirely.  Ongoing regulatory reforms and changing market structures raise questions about 

whether the transactions underlying LIBOR will become even scarcer in the future, particularly 

in periods of stress, and banks might feel little incentive to contribute to U.S. dollar LIBOR 

panels if transactions become less frequent.  Market participants are not used to thinking about 

this possibility, but benchmarks sometimes come to a halt.  The sudden cessation of a benchmark 

as heavily used as LIBOR would present significant systemic risks.  It could entail substantial 

losses and would create substantial uncertainty, potential legal challenges, and payments 

disruptions for the market participants that have relied on LIBOR.  These disruptions would be 

even greater if there were no viable alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR that market participants 

could quickly move to.   

 These concerns led the FSB and Financial Stability Oversight Council to call for the 

promotion of alternatives to LIBOR, and led the Federal Reserve to convene the ARRC in 

cooperation with the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 

and Office of Financial Research.  LIBOR is currently the dominant reference rate in the market 

because of its liquidity.  We are not under any illusions that moving a significant portion of 

trading to an alternative rate will be simple or easy.  But I believe the ARRC has provided a
