inflation was running above its target range at the time.  The Bank’s rate cuts helped 

stabilize the economy, and Mexican output returned to its pre-crisis level by late 2010.  

Strong countercyclical policy actions of this type were unlikely to have been feasible in 

Mexico a few decades ago; with little in the way of inflation-fighting credibility and an 

immature financial sector, the monetary authority in earlier years was often forced to 

respond to a crisis by tightening monetary conditions, rather than loosening them, in an 

effort to limit capital flight, exchange rate depreciation, and increases in inflation.   

Of course, we should not be surprised that central bank independence has 

contributed to Mexico’s improved macroeconomic stability over the past two decades.  A 

broad consensus among economists--supported by considerable empirical evidence--

holds that a central bank’s credibility and effectiveness are enhanced when it is able to 

make monetary policy based on its assessment of what is in the economy’s long-run 

interest rather than in response to short-term political pressures.  The benefits of a sound 

monetary framework are further enhanced when combined with good fiscal, regulatory, 

and trade policies.  

As you probably know, the Federal Reserve is also celebrating an anniversary this 

year--the centennial of its founding.  Like the Bank of Mexico, the Federal Reserve is an 

independent central bank, and, as in the case of the Bank of Mexico, that independence 

has evolved and gradually strengthened over time.  For example, in the early years 

following the Fed’s founding in 1913, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller 

of the Currency served on the Federal Reserve Board, an arrangement that only changed 

in the 1930s when the Fed underwent significant structural reforms.  The Federal Reserve 

was also less than fully independent during and just after World War II, when it agreed to
