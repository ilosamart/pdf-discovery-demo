Notwithstanding a number of shocks over the past year, the U.S. economy is 

performing reasonably well.  Job gains have been robust in recent years, and the 

unemployment rate has declined to 4.9 percent, likely close to its long-run sustainable 

level.  After running at a subdued pace during the first half of the year, gross domestic 

product growth has picked up in the most recent data, and inflation has been firming 

toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent target.1   

Although the economy has moved back to the vicinity of the Committee’s 

employment and inflation targets--suggesting that the cyclical drag on the economy has 

been greatly reduced, if not largely eliminated--along some dimensions this has not been 

a happy recovery.  Unease with the economy reflects a number of longer-term challenges, 

challenges that will require a different set of policy tools than those used to address 

nearer-term cyclical shortfalls in growth.  Prominent among these challenges are low 

equilibrium interest rates and sluggish productivity growth in the United States and 

abroad.  I will first touch on low interest rates before turning to productivity.  The federal 

funds rate and policy rates in other advanced economies remain very low or even 

negative.  Longer-term rates are also low by historical standards, even taking into account 

the increase of the past two weeks.   

Such low interest rates, together with only tepid growth, suggest that the 

equilibrium interest rate--that is, the rate that neither boosts nor slows the economy--has 

fallen.  Why does this matter?  Importantly, low interest rates make the economy more 

vulnerable to adverse shocks by constraining the ability of monetary policy to combat 

recessions using conventional interest rate policy--because the effective lower bound on
