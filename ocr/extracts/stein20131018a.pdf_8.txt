below 5 percent, and the ratio cannot be restored simply by suspending dividends and 

share repurchases.7  In my view, these features of the program are among its most crucial. 

 At the same time, having the authority to do something is necessary, but not 

sufficient—there also needs to be the institutional will.  And this will is likely to be 

especially critical in a time of crisis, again because of the increased prominence of the 

debt-overhang problem.8  A firm that is told that it needs to improve its capital position 

will, given the interests of its shareholders, strongly prefer to do so by reducing assets 

rather than by engaging in a dilutive share issue, even though the latter is more desirable 

from the perspective of aggregate credit provision.  And it can be expected to make its 

case forcefully.   

So if we are serious about taking a macroprudential approach to regulation—one 

which aims to protect not just the solvency of individual firms, but the health of the 

financial system as a whole and its ability to continue to perform its intermediation role 

in times of stress—it is incumbent on us as regulators to do all that we can to develop 

both the intellectual case, and the institutional resolve, to be able to push back with equal 

force when the time comes.   

Thank you.  I look forward to the rest of our discussion.  

                                                 
7 More precisely, the rule underpinning the CCAR states that if the Federal Reserve objects to a firm’s 
capital plan, the firm must resubmit, showing how it will address the causes of the objection.  So, in the 
case where the capital plan is objected to because the firm misses the post-stress target of 5 percent 
common equity (and assuming this cannot be addressed by simply turning off all planned dividends and 
share buybacks), the firm's resubmission would have to show how it will get back above this target.  This 
plan might include a mix of asset sales, equity issues, and other measures, but the Federal Reserve, in 
principle and under appropriate circumstances, has the authority to object to a plan that is overly reliant on 
asset sales and other measures and withhold its non-objection to a plan unless the firm addresses all the 
shortfall-via-equity issues, over some defined time frame. 
 
8 Another complicating factor that may make regulators shy away from pushing for new equity issues in the 
midst of a crisis is the lack of a government backstop.  A number of observers have argued that the 
availability of a backstop in the form of TARP capital played a key role in the original SCAP stress tests.
