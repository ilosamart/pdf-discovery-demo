Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional 

monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether 

our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what 

adjustments would be most appropriate.  There is a growing literature on such policy 

alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or 

deploying negative interest rates.15  These options merit further assessment.  However, 

they are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare.  For the time 

being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy 

actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the 

Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along 

with maximum employment.  

Recent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress 

 Against the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient 

for conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic 

developments and their implications for policy.  The economy has seen welcome 

progress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by 

the Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions:  The labor market has 

continued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated 

past near-term risks from abroad.   

Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that 

we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely 

will be, somewhat gradual.  This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below
