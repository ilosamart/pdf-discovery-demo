accommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher 

employment.11  Other policymakers misperceived the level of the natural rate of 

unemployment, which we now believe had shifted up markedly in the 1960s.  With the 

higher natural rate, the labor market was much tighter and provided much greater upward 

pressure on inflation than policymakers realized in real time.  As a result, they were 

continually “behind the curve.”12   

The channel through which monetary policy can amplify and extend inflation’s 

response to shocks becomes even stronger when we take account of expectations.  If 

people come to expect that upward blips in inflation will result in ongoing higher 

inflation, they will build that view into wage and price decisions.  In this case, people’s 

expectations become a force adding momentum to inflation, and breaking inflation’s 

momentum can require convincing people to change their minds and behavior--never an 

easy task.  Arguably, this is why a federal funds rate near 20 percent--roughly 10 percent 

in real terms--was required in the early 1980s to turn the tide on high inflation.  The cost, 

in the form of very high unemployment, is clear in the Great Inflation figures.  

The Great Inflation taught us that a main task of monetary policy is to keep inflation 

expectations anchored at some low level.   

This idea is behind the adoption in recent decades of inflation targets, such as the 

Fed’s 2 percent objective, by central banks around the world.  When monetary policy 

tends to offset shocks to inflation, rather than amplifying and extending them, and when 

people come to expect this policy response, a surprise rise or fall in labor market 

tightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation.  Research 

                                                 
11 Romer and Romer (2002) make this argument. 
12 I discuss this argument in greater depth in Powell (2018).
