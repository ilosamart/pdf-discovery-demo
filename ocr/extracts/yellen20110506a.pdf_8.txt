outcome.  The recent financial crisis certainly highlighted the fact that financial markets 

are prone to speculative excesses and behavior that may exacerbate systemic risk.  But, as 

central bankers and supervisors, we must remain humble about our ability to preempt 

market forces in ways that predictably enhance welfare.   

 An alternative to limiting capital mobility is for countries to rely on more-

standard policy tools as an initial line of defense against the challenges posed by capital 

flows.  For example, the effects of undesired capital movements prompted by variations 

in the business cycle can be addressed directly with the mix of fiscal and monetary 

policies.  Countries facing overheating, with strong capital flows being attracted by rising 

interest rates, may consider a tighter fiscal policy to reduce both the extent of overheating 

and the related strength of capital inflows.  And some countries facing strong capital 

inflows may help alleviate pressures by lifting controls on capital outflows.  Exchange 

rate flexibility can also play a crucial role in helping modulate the effects of capital flows, 

as exchange rates appreciate in response to an inflow (or depreciate in the face of 

outflows), thereby contributing to external balance and damping further such flows by 

altering asset valuations.  Increased exchange rate flexibility should also discourage 

excessive currency mismatches, as market participants better gauge the risks of future 

currency movements.  Notably, in some cases, volatile capital flows have been a 

symptom of deeper distortions within the recipient country, and addressing these 

distortions has required a shift in the underlying mix of the countryâ€™s policies.    

 Past experience also highlights that attempts to limit financial openness are 

themselves imperfect.  Clearly, capital controls can influence capital flows if applied with 

enough force.  But how effective are they and at what cost?  The Chilean controls on
