And since banks are profit-maximizing entities, they will likely compare rates of return 

across various HQLA-eligible assets in determining how many reserves to hold.  If 

relative asset returns are a key driver of reserve demand, then interest rates across various 

types of HQLA will adjust on an ongoing basis until banks are satisfied holding the 

aggregate quantity of reserves that is available.   

Recent research by the Board staff shows that banks currently display a 

significant degree of heterogeneity in their approaches to meeting their LCR 

requirements, including in their chosen volumes of reserve balances.11  Figure 2 shows a 

subset of this research to illustrate this point.  The top and bottom panels represent 

estimates of how two large banks have been meeting their HQLA requirements over time.  

In each panel, the blue portions of the bars denote the share of HQLA met by reserve 

balances, while the red, yellow, and brown slices of the bars represent the share met by 

Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and other HQLA-eligible assets, 

respectively.  Despite holding roughly similarly amounts of HQLA, the two banks exhibit 

very different HQLA compositions, with the bank depicted in the top panel consistently 

holding a much larger share of HQLA in the form of reserve balances than the bank 

shown in the bottom panel.  This finding suggests that there likely is no single 

“representative bank” behavioral model that can capture all we might want to know about 

banks’ demand for central bank reserve balances.   

Some of the differences we see in bank behavior likely relate to banks’ individual 

liquidity needs and preferences.  Indeed, banks manage their balance sheets in part by 

taking into account their internal liquidity targets, which are determined by the
