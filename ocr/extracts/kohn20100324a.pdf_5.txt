recession.   

 The Federal Reserve responded by providing funding when it became unavailable to 

banks and other intermediaries.  We reduced the spread of the discount rate over the target 

interbank rate, lengthened the maximum maturity of loans to banks from overnight to 90 days, 

and also provided discount window credit through regular auctions to overcome the reluctance to 

borrow.  In addition, we created emergency liquidity facilities to meet the funding needs of key 

market participants, including primary securities dealers, money market mutual funds, and other 

users of short-term funding markets.2  We did so while generally adhering to time-honored 

central banking principles for countering a financial panic:  Lend freely to solvent institutions at 

a penalty and against good collateral.  We also lent dollars to other central banks so that they 

could help banks in their jurisdictions meet their dollar funding needs, thus easing pressures on 

U.S. money markets. 

 Now that the financial markets are functioning much better, we have closed the 

emergency facilities that we created to lend to nonbanks.  The homework assignment is to think 

about the design of liquidity facilities going forward.  I’ve tentatively concluded that the recent 

crisis has demonstrated that in a financial system so dependent on securities markets and not just 

banks, we need to retain the ability to lend against good collateral to certain groups of sound, 

regulated, nonbank financial firms.  I’m not suggesting that we establish permanent contingency 

liquidity facilities, just that the Federal Reserve retain the authority to create the tools necessary 

to meet liquidity needs of groups of nonbank institutions should a panic impair the ability of 

securities markets, as well as banks, to function and the Board of Governors find that the absence
