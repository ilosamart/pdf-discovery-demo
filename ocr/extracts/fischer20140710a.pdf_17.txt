what may be a human proclivity to take risks.29  But of course, banks that are heavily 

consumer deposit financed also fail from time to time, as a result of bad lending 

decisions.   

It could be that large banks can finance themselves more cheaply because they are 

more efficient, that is, that there are economies of scale in banking.  For some time, the 

received wisdom was that there was no evidence of such economies beyond relatively 

modest-sized banks, with balance sheets of approximately $100 billion.  More recently, 

several papers have found that economies of scale may continue beyond that level.  For 

example, the title of a paper by Joseph Hughes and Loretta Mester, “Who Said Large 

Banks Don’t Experience Scale Economies? Evidence from a Risk-Return Driven Cost 

Function”30 suggests that large institutions may be better able to manage risk more 

efficiently because of “technological advantages, such as diversification and the 

spreading of information…and other costs that do not increase proportionately with size.” 

That said, these authors conclude that “[W]e do not know if the benefits of large size 

outweigh the potential costs in terms of systemic risk that large scale may impose on the 

financial system.”  They add that their results suggest that “strict size limits to control 

such costs will likely not be effective, since they work against market forces…”  

The TBTF theory of why large banks are a problem has to contend with the 

history of the Canadian and Australian banking systems.  Both these systems have several 

very large banks, but both systems have been very stable--in the Canadian case, for 150 

29 In this regard one cannot fail to be impressed by the fact that in countries with a death penalty for 
corruption, some people appear nonetheless to be willing to take the chance of becoming rich illegally.
