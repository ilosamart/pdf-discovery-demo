the most difficult jobs that central banks face is in dealing with episodes of credit market 

overheating that pose a potential threat to financial stability.  As compared with inflation 

or unemployment, measurement is much harder, so even recognizing the extent of the 

problem in real time is a major challenge.  Moreover, the supervisory and regulatory tools 

that we have, while helpful, are far from perfect.   

These observations suggest two principles.  First, decisions will inevitably have to 

be made in an environment of significant uncertainty, and standards of evidence should 

be calibrated accordingly.  Waiting for decisive proof of market overheating may amount 

to an implicit policy of inaction on this dimension.  And, second, we ought to be open-

minded in thinking about how to best use the full array of instruments at our disposal.  

Indeed, in some cases, it may be that the only way to achieve a meaningfully 

macroprudential approach to financial stability is by allowing for some greater overlap in 

the goals of monetary policy and regulation. 

Thank you very much.
