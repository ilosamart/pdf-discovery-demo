of R&D done by the private sector has correspondingly increased.7  Second, the share of 

R&D spending targeted to basic research, as opposed to more applied R&D activities, has 

also been declining.8  These two trends--the declines in the share of basic research and in 

the federal share of R&D spending--are related, as government R&D spending tends to 

be more heavily weighted toward basic research and science.  The declining emphasis on 

basic research is somewhat concerning because fundamental research is ultimately the 

source of most innovation, albeit often with long lags.  Indeed, some economists have 

argued that, because of the potentially high social return to basic research, expanded 

government support for R&D could, over time, significantly boost economic growth.9  

That said, in a time of fiscal stringency, the Congress and the Administration will clearly 

need to carefully weigh competing priorities in their budgetary decisions.   

Another argument sometimes made for expanding government support for R&D 

is the need to keep pace with technological advances in other countries.  R&D has 

become increasingly international, thanks to improved communication and dissemination 

of research results, the spread of scientific and engineering talent around the world, and 

the transfer of technologies through trade, foreign direct investment, and the activities of 

multinational corporations.  To be sure, R&D spending remains concentrated in the most-

                                                 
7 The federal share of total U.S. R&D spending was 26 percent in 2008, while the private-sector share was 
67 percent. The remaining funding comes from universities and colleges, private foundations, and other 
nonprofits. Three decades prior, the federal and private-sector shares were 50 percent and 46 percent 
respectively.  See table 5 in National Science Foundation (2010).

9 For example, see Jones and Williams (1998).  Griliches (1992) reports estimates of the average social 
return that cluster in the range of 20 to 60 percent a year.  See also Hall, Mairesse, and Mohnen (2009).  
The estimates in the literature are typically for average social returns; the return to an additional dollar of 
R&D spending, which is the relevant variable for determining whether further spending is warranted, may 
be lower than the average return.
