Council are serving as the forum through which the financial services sector shares important 

information and develops critical infrastructure protection policies.  Through their coordination, 

affected institutions and law enforcement agencies can share threat information and mitigation 

techniques.  

In addition, a recent Executive Order issued by the President represents a continued 

commitment to enhancing the security and resiliency of the nation’s critical infrastructure to 

meet future threats.

Conclusion  
 

In closing, these have been some of my reflections on reputation as it applies to the 

business of banks.  The concept of trust is relevant to how bankers engage in a business that is of 

benefit to the public and provides meaningful innovation to the core function of financial 

intermediation, as well as to how we as supervisors can engage in a process of observation that is 

forward-looking and of benefit to both the public and the institutions that we regulate.        

Thank you for your attention today.  I look forward to taking your questions.
