We need policies that support innovation and create a favorable environment for 

investment in both the skills of workers and the tools they have.  Indeed, the recent tax 

reforms were designed in part to boost capital investment and thus productivity.  Once 

again, my goal tonight is to highlight the importance of growth-enhancing policies.  

Because these policies are not the province of the Fed, I will not advocate for particular 

approaches.  Instead, I will just observe that researchers and policy analysts have 

proposed many promising ideas that may be capable of attracting wide support.  Policies 

that succeed in enhancing productivity growth would greatly benefit future generations of 

Americans.   

Conclusion 

To conclude, the United States is currently in the midst of one of the longest 

economic expansions in our history.  Unemployment is low and inflation is close to our 

2 percent objective.  My colleagues and I on the FOMC are focused on using our 

monetary policy tools to sustain those favorable conditions.   

Tonight I have also highlighted some longer-term challenges we face, including 

low labor force participation by prime-age workers and low productivity growth.  By 

promoting macroeconomic stability, the Fed helps create a healthy environment for 

growth.  But these longer-term issues require policies that are more in the province of 

elected representatives.  The nation would benefit greatly from a search for policies with 

broad appeal that could promote labor force participation and higher productivity, with 

benefits shared broadly across the nation.
