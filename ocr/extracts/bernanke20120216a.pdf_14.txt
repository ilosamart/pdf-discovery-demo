about supervisory practices gives us extremely valuable feedback that will help us 

improve supervision and better understand the issues that banks and examiners confront 

in the field. 

Conclusion 

To conclude, I would like to reemphasize the importance that my colleagues on 

the Board and I place on the Federal Reserve’s relationship with community banks.  The 

Fed is committed to fair, consistent, and informed examinations that take into account the 

size, complexity, and individual circumstances of each bank we oversee.  We will 

continue to rely on the many channels of communication I discussed today to improve 

our supervision, and we will do all we can to eliminate unnecessary costs.  By engaging 

in a constant dialogue with community banks through various communication channels 

and through the examination process, the Federal Reserve is able to collect important 

information about local economies and better inform banks about the applicability and 

expectations of new rules and regulations intended to help keep them safe and sound.  

Despite economic uncertainties, the condition of community banks is improving, which is 

reassuring given their undeniable importance to the health of our nation’s economy. 

My thanks to the FDIC and Marty Gruenberg for convening this important 

conference.
