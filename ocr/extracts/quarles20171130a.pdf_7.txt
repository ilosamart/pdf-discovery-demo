But when we examine the assets at the center of digital currency systems, I think we 

should begin to think clearly about the long-term properties we seek for large-scale payment 

networks and systems used by the general public.  Today, the vast majority of our payments by 

volume and value are processed by regulated financial institutions.  In the U.S. payment system, 

digital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners large headlines. But from the 

standpoint of analysis, the “currency” or asset at the center of some of these systems is not 

backed by other secure assets, has no intrinsic value, is not the liability of a regulated banking 

institution, and in leading cases, is not the liability of any institution at all.  Indeed, how to treat 

and define this new asset is complicated.3   

While these digital currencies may not pose major concerns at their current levels of use, 

more serious financial stability issues may result if they achieve wide-scale usage.  Risk 

management can act as a mitigant, but if the central asset in a payment system cannot be 

predictably redeemed for the U.S. dollar at a stable exchange rate in times of adversity, the 

resulting price risk and potential liquidity and credit risk pose a large challenge for the system.  

During times of crisis, the demand for liquidity can increase significantly, including the demand 

for the central asset used in settling payments.  Even private-sector banks and certainly non-

banks can have a hard time meeting large-scale demands for extra liquidity at the very time when

3 For example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission published a statement on digital currencies making 
clear that many fall into the category of commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act 
(www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7231-15).  The Securities and Exchange Commission has published 
guidance on the treatment of digital currencies under the Securities Exchange Act (www.sec.gov/news/press-
release/2017-131).  The Internal Revenue Service has published guidance on the tax treatment of digital currencies 
(www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf).  And the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has published guidance 
on the treatment of digital currencies under the Bank Secrecy Act (www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-
