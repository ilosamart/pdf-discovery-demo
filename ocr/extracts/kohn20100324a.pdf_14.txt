Another approach to this problem is for central banks to target a gradually rising price 

level rather than a constant inflation rate.  Imagine a plot of the consumer price index (CPI) from 

today onward increasing 2 percent each year.  Central banks would commit to adjusting policy to 

keep the CPI near that line. 

The advantage of this approach, in theory at least, is that when a negative shock drives 

prices below the target level, people will automatically expect the central bank to increase 

inflation for a while to get back to trend.  In principle, that expectation would lower real interest 

rates without the central bank changing its inflation commitment, even if nominal interest rates 

were pinned at zero.  It could also make it easier for people to make long-term economic 

decisions because they could anticipate that inflation misses would be reversed over time, 

reducing uncertainty about the future price level. 

While I appreciate the elegance of this price-level-targeting idea, I have serious doubts 

that it would work in practice.  Central to the idea is that the Federal Reserve would be 

committing to hit a price level that was growing at a constant rate from a fixed point in the past.  

The specific inflation rate that could be expected in the future would change over time, 

depending on the inflation that had been realized up to that point.  You could know what 

inflation rate to expect only if you knew both the current consumer price index and the Fed’s 

target for the index in the future.  In addition, the inflation rate that you could expect would be 

different for different horizons.  Moreover, central banks are able to control inflation only with a 

considerable lag and even then only imprecisely, so the process of hitting a target would likely 

involve frequent overshooting and correction and consequently frequently shifting inflation 

objectives.
