levels consistent with price stability, central banks, for the first time in many decades, 

had to take seriously the possibility that inflation can be too low as well as too high. 

A second complication for policymaking created by low inflation arises from the 

fact that low inflation generally implies low nominal interest rates, which increase the 

potential relevance for policymaking of the zero lower bound on interest rates.  Because 

the short-term policy interest rate cannot be reduced below zero, the Federal Reserve and 

central banks in other countries have employed nonstandard policies and approaches that 

do not rely on reductions in the short-term interest rate.  We are still learning about the 

efficacy and appropriate management of these alternative tools. 

In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss these issues in the context of 

current economic and policy developments.  I will comment on the near-term outlook for 

economic activity and inflation.  I will then compare that outlook to some quantitative 

measures of the Federal Reserveâ€™s objectives, namely, the longer-run outcomes that 

FOMC participants judge to be most consistent with its dual mandate of maximum 

employment and price stability.  Finally, I will observe that, in a world in which the 

policy interest rate is close to zero, the Committee must consider the costs and risks 

associated with the use of nonconventional tools when it assesses whether additional 

policy accommodation is likely to be beneficial on net. 

The Outlook for Growth and Employment 

The arbiters across the river in Cambridge, the business cycle dating committee of 

the National Bureau of Economic Research, recently made their determination:  An 

economic recovery began in the United States in July 2009, following a series of forceful 

actions by central banks and other policymakers around the world that helped stabilize
