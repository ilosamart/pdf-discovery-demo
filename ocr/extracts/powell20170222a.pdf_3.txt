couple of years.  Although inflation is currently below our objective, core inflation has 

generally been close to 2 percent over the past 20 years.  This outcome reflects the 

success of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations. 

Many indicators show that we have also made significant progress toward 

maximum employment.  Since 2010, payroll employment has increased by almost 16 

million jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.8 percent--in line 

with most estimates of the longer-run normal level (or natural rate) of unemployment and 

with the median estimate by FOMC participants in the December 2016 Summary of 

Economic Projections (SEP).  Accordingly, the red line in the figure indicates that the 

unemployment rate gap has essentially been closed.2 

 A variety of other measures also suggest that we are close to maximum 

employment.  Surveys of household sentiment about the availability of jobs and of 

business sentiment regarding the difficulty of filling jobs have now reached levels seen in 

prior periods of full employment.  Moreover, although the pace of wage increases is 

slower than during pre-crisis periods of full employment, wages have been increasing 

faster than both output per hour (productivity) and inflation, and labor’s share of income 

has begun to move up after a long decline. 

All in all, we appear to be close to our employment objective, and are nearing our 

inflation objective.  While the pace of progress has at times been frustratingly slow, this 

outcome is a better one than that achieved by most other advanced economies.  Even so, 

it is worth remembering that the current and future states of the economy are always

rate for 2017 is 4.7 percent.
