“close to” (technically, within 2 standard deviations of) the corresponding forecast 

values.  In line with our earlier discussion, the left panel of the figure suggests that, 

although monetary policy during the period following the 2001 recession was 

accommodative, it was not inconsistent with the historical experience, given the 

macroeconomic environment of the time. 

The right panel of the figure shows the forecast behavior of house prices during 

the recent period, taking as given macroeconomic conditions and the actual path of the 

federal funds rate.  As you can see, the rise in house prices falls well outside the 

predictions of the model.  Thus, when historical relationships are taken into account, it is 

difficult to ascribe the house price bubble either to monetary policy or to the broader 

macroeconomic environment. 

A possible objection to this conclusion is that, because of changes in methods of 

housing finance, the responsiveness of house prices to monetary policy may have been 

different in the past decade than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.  For example, during 

2003 and 2004, about one-third of mortgage applications were for adjustable-rate 

mortgage (ARM) products.  Low policy rates feed through to monthly mortgage 

payments more directly when the mortgage interest rate is adjustable and tied to short-

term rates.  This linkage could rationalize a stronger effect of monetary policy on house 

prices in the more recent period (Iacoviello and Neri, forthcoming). 

Some evidence on this question is provided in Slide 7, which shows illustrative 

initial monthly mortgage payments for a median-priced house for different types of 

mortgages.14  The interest rates used in calculating these payments are actual averages for 

prime borrowers for the period from 2003 to 2006, as provided by Freddie Mac.  A
