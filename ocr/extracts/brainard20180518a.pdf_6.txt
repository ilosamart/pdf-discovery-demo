The Importance of Place   

 First, we should update the area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA activities 

while retaining the core focus on place.  This is the most important aspect of refreshing the CRA, 

and also the one that will require the most care.  As our Federal Advisory Council noted, “…a 

bank’s ability to engage in meaningful community development efforts continues to require a 

meaningful knowledge of and presence in local communities.”9  A significant strength of CRA 

evaluations is that a bank’s performance is evaluated taking into account the demographics of its 

communities, the types of housing and businesses they serve, and the other financial institutions 

serving those communities.   

The current regulations use branches and deposit-taking ATMs as a proxy for the 

communities the bank serves because these were the primary mechanisms for delivering services 

when the CRA was enacted and for many years subsequently.  This reflected an environment 

where interstate banking was not allowed, and physical branches were necessary for deposit 

taking and lending.  Today, changes in technology and consumer preferences have made it 

possible for banks to serve customers far beyond their physical branches and deposit-taking 

ATMs--via online and mobile platforms.  

Even so, as much as technology has made banking transactions more convenient for 

customers, it has not eliminated the need for branches.  For large parts of the country, branches 

and deposit-taking ATMs remain an important way that banks engage with a community.  

Branches and ATMs are still necessary for depositing and withdrawing cash.  Branches also 

provide personal service and assistance to consumers and business customers. They provide a
