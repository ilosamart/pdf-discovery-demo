risk management.  First, it has its own macroeconomic goals on which it must maintain a 

sharp focus.  Second, it is too blunt an instrument for dealing with systemic risk.  All the 

same, I cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that situations could emerge in 

which monetary policy should play some role in reining in risk-taking behavior.  I will 

return to this point later. 

In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss key issues that must be resolved 

before an effective policy regime for the containment of systemic risk can be established.  

First, we must understand the sources of systemic risk and design surveillance practices 

that enable us to detect threats to financial stability early on.  Second, we must develop a 

tool kit of supervisory policy instruments--so-called macroprudential policies--and 

guidelines on how and when to deploy them.  And third, we must strive to avoid 

situations in which macroprudential and monetary policies are working at cross-purposes, 

given that macroprudential policies affect macroeconomic performance and that 

monetary policy may affect risk-taking incentives.   

All of these issues raise complex questions of design and implementation.  

Interesting parallels may be drawn, however, between the design issues we face in 

macroprudential policy and those we have grappled with in conducting monetary policy.  

These parallels include the appropriate roles of rules versus discretion, the need for 

policies that are robust in addressing uncertainty, and the assignment problem, all of 

which I will discuss later.  The fertile field of monetary policy research may therefore 

offer lessons that can fruitfully be applied to managing systemic risk.
