However, it is possible that, even after improving economic prospects help young 

people overcome these impediments and boost household formation rates, 

homeownership rates among the Great Recession generation could lag.  Young people’s 

attitudes toward homebuying may have changed as a result of witnessing their parents’ 

experiences during the housing crisis.  Instead of seeing homeownership as a reliably safe 

investment, many of today’s young adults may now see some risk that houses could 

become financial albatrosses due to events beyond their control.  If this is the case, the 

Great Recession cohort may be slower to buy a home than previous cohorts, even after 

meeting their pre-recession career and earnings expectations.  Indeed, research suggests 

that dramatic economic events, such as the Great Depression, can have a significant 

effect on individuals’ risk-taking over their lifetime.25 

Moreover, there is some evidence that today’s young people have a skeptical view 

of the wisdom of buying a home as a result of the housing crisis.  The percentage of 

renters in the 18-to-34 age group who thought housing was a safe investment dropped 

significantly from 2003 to the first quarter of this year, from 85 percent to 59 percent, 

respectively.26  Of course, it is premature to conclude that the financial crisis has 

permanently altered young people’s attitudes toward housing investments, and several 

surveys indicate that young people continue to express a desire to become homeowners 

someday.

Affect Risk-Taking?” NBER Working Paper Series 14813 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of

26 The data are from results of the Fannie Mae National Housing Survey, which were provided directly to 
the Federal Reserve.  The relevant survey question asked respondents, “Do you think homeownership is a 
safe investment (with a lot of potential or very little potential) or a risky investment (with very little 
potential or a lot of potential)?”
