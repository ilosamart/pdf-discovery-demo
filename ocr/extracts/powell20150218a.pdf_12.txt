But caution on the part of supervisors is certainly understandable here.  It is worth 

remembering that the destructive potential of the subprime mortgage market was not 

obvious in advance and not fully reflected in real-time measures of balance sheet 

exposure.  In light of that demonstrated uncertainty, since the crisis, supervisors have 

opted to react earlier and more aggressively to the buildup of risk.   

Let’s now turn to post-crisis market conditions, which exhibit both similarities 

and differences compared with the pre-crisis period.  Borrowing through leveraged loans 

by speculative-grade companies has been brisk since 2010, with about $800 billion of 

institutional loans now outstanding (figure 8).  Over much of the post-crisis low interest 

rate period, demand for higher-yielding assets has been very strong, often outstripping 

supply.  Price and nonprice terms in the syndicated leveraged loan market have been 

highly favorable to borrowers, as credit spreads declined, albeit not to particularly low 

levels (figure 4), and leverage multiples increased (figure 3).  The share of loan 

agreements that lack traditional maintenance covenants increased to historic highs 

(figures 9 and 10).12 

CLOs and other stably funded investors continue to be the primary owners of 

leveraged loans.  But in recent years, mutual funds that invest in fixed income assets have 

seen large inflows and have become more significant investors in this market.  Some of 

these funds, including those holding syndicated leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, 

provide investors with what is called “liquidity transformation”--providing daily liquidity

conditions, is designed to support economic activity by creating incentives to take credit and duration risk.
