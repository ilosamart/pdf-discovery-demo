recent softness in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation.  In my view, 

the neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain close to zero in real terms 

over the medium term.  If that is the case, we would not have much more additional work 

to do on moving to a neutral stance.  I will want to monitor inflation developments 

carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to 

help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target. 

Meanwhile, in recent days, we have begun to hear acknowledgement from other 

major central banks that they too are seeing conditions that suggest policy normalization 

could be on the table before too long, against the backdrop of a brighter global outlook.  

As I just discussed, the pace and timing of how central banks around the world proceed 

with normalization, and the importance of balance sheet policy relative to changes in 

short term rates in these normalization plans, could have important implications for 

exchange rates and financial conditions globally.
