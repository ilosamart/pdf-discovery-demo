foreign borrowers, shows a similar pattern of increased risky loan underwriting by 

international lenders, an increase that is also significantly inversely related to U.S. 

interest rates.  Together, these results suggest a potential spillover from accommodative 

U.S. monetary policy through increased risk-taking in syndicated loans globally, although 

preliminary results also indicate that investors still require extra return for this extra risk.   

Another area in which to look for links between low interest rates and risk-taking 

is in cross-border securities purchases.  The role of low interest rates in advanced 

economies in encouraging capital flows to EMEs where returns are higher has been a 

familiar theme.4  And recent studies have found that asset prices in EMEs do respond 

systematically to U.S. monetary policy shocks.5   

For evidence of increased risk-taking in cross-border investment, let’s look at the 

composition of U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios.  Although emerging market bonds 

remain a relatively small proportion of the aggregate U.S. cross-border bond portfolio 

(figure 4), within foreign government bonds, U.S. investors have modestly shifted their 

portfolio shares toward higher-yielding bonds of emerging market sovereigns (figure 5).  

Ex post, these portfolio reallocations delivered a higher return to U.S. investors on this 

part of their portfolio relative to what they would have received if they had left portfolio
