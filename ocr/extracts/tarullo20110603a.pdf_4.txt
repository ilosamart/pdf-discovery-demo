Rationale for Enhanced Capital Requirements 

Last fall central bank governors and heads of supervision from countries represented on 

the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed to the important package of reforms in 

capital regulation known as Basel III.  The Basel III requirements for better quality of capital, 

improved risk weightings, higher minimum capital ratios, and a capital conservation buffer 

comprise a key component of the post-crisis reform agenda.  But they are just that – a 

component.  Although a few features of Basel III reflect macroprudential concerns, in the main it 

was a microprudential exercise.  The new minimum equity capital ratio and conservation buffer 

were calibrated on the basis of an historical examination of the individual loss experiences of 

banks in the United States and six other countries.   

A macroprudential perspective on capital requirements complements the microprudential 

orientation of Basel III.  There would be very large negative externalities associated with the 

disorderly failure of any SIFI, distinct from the costs incurred by the firm and its stakeholders.  

The failure of a SIFI, especially in a period of stress, significantly increases the chances that 

other financial firms will fail, for two reasons.  First, direct counterparty impacts can lead to a 

classic domino effect.  Second, because losses in a tail event are much more likely to be 

correlated for firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, and other capital market 

instruments, all such firms are vulnerable to accelerating losses as troubled firms sell their assets 

into a declining market. 

A SIFI has no incentive to carry enough capital to reduce the chances of such systemic 

losses.  The microprudential approach of Basel III does not force them to do so.  The rationale 

for enhanced capital requirements for SIFIs is to take these costs into account, make SIFIs less 

prone to failure, and thereby to make the financial system safer.  An ancillary rationale is that
