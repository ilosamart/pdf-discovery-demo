effective in promoting stronger economic recovery and job gains, they have little effect 

on the types of jobs that are created, particularly over the longer term.  So, while 

monetary policy can help, it does not address all of the challenges that low- and 

moderate-income workers are confronting.  That said, the existing mandate regarding 

maximum employment requires policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) to understand labor market dynamics, which obviously must include an 

understanding of low- and moderate-income workers. 

Regulatory and Supervisory Touchpoints 

In addition to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory 

policies have the potential to address some of the challenges faced by low-income 

communities and consumers.  The Federal Reserve is required by law--by virtue of the 

Bank Holding Company Act--to approve various applications, such as mergers, 

acquisitions, and proposals to conduct new activities.  This statutory review requires an 

explicit consideration of public benefits and the effects of the proposed transaction on the 

convenience and needs of the communities to be served.  This assessment is, as many of 

you know, a critical opportunity for community input and analysis. 

Indeed, as people with their feet firmly planted on the ground in communities 

across America, you probably remember James Q. Wilson’s theory of “broken windows” 

in community policing:  Move in quickly when vandalism and disorder first start to 

appear--even if it is only a broken window or graffiti on a stop sign--or else face losing 

the whole neighborhood as disrespect for the law rapidly spreads.17
