The Federal Reserve Board has recently proposed important new rules to increase 

the prospects for the orderly resolution of a GSIB with minimal effect on financial 

stability.  Last October, the Board proposed a rule to subject the eight U.S. GSIBs to total 

loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements, building on the 

international TLAC standard established by the Financial Stability Board.4  The proposal 

would require these systemically important firms to maintain outstanding a large quantity 

of long-term debt that could be used to absorb losses and recapitalize the firm in an 

orderly resolution under either the Bankruptcy Code or the orderly liquidation authority.5    

The proposal would also apply internal TLAC and long-term debt requirements to 

the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign GSIBs in order to facilitate the 

recapitalization of a failed foreign GSIB’s U.S. operations.  Finally, the proposal would 

restrict the operations of GSIB holding companies (as distinct from their operating 

subsidiaries) so that those legal entities could go through a resolution proceeding without 

setting off short-term wholesale funding runs or otherwise jeopardizing financial 

stability. 

In May of this year, the Board issued another proposal to make GSIBs more 

resolvable.  This second proposed rule would impose restrictions on GSIBs’ qualified

5 Under the proposal, a U.S. GSIB would be required to hold at a minimum (i) a long-term debt amount of 
the greater of 6 percent plus its GSIB surcharge of risk-weighted assets and 4.5 percent of total leverage 
exposure and (ii) a TLAC amount of the greater of 18 percent of risk-weighted assets and 9.5 percent of 
total leverage exposure.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt, and Clean Holding Company Requirements for Systemically 
Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies and Intermediate Holding Companies of Systemically Important

of Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies,” notice of proposed rulemaking (Docket 
No. R-1523), Federal Register, vol. 80 (November 30), pp. 74931-32.  The GSIB has to satisfy both 
constraints.  TLAC encompasses both equity capital and eligible long-term debt.
