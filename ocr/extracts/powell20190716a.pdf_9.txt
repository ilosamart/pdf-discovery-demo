Bank of England commissioned a review over the past year of the future of the United 

Kingdom’s financial system and what it might mean for the bank’s agenda, toolkit, and 

capabilities.3  For our part, the Federal Reserve is conducting, for the first time, a public 

review of the strategy, tools, and communications that we use to promote our goals of 

maximum employment and price stability.4  The heart of this review has been a series of 

Fed Listens events around the country, in every Reserve Bank District, to hear directly 

from the constituencies we serve.  These events have been live-streamed on the internet.  

Last month, we hosted a research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to 

explore ways to more effectively and sustainably achieve our mandated goals.  Beginning 

soon, the FOMC will devote time at its regular meetings to assessing the lessons from 

these events.  We will publicly report the conclusions of our discussions, likely during the 

first half of next year.5 

Other central banks, many represented in this room, are also looking deeply at the 

challenges posed by the current environment and assessing tools and strategies.  I look 

forward to learning from your experiences and sharing ours in the coming months and 

years as we face the trials and opportunities of this new era. 

For all of us, the turmoil that preceded this new world was severe, although not as 

extreme as that faced by those around the table in Bretton Woods 75 years ago.  Tonight
