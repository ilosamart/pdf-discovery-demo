be consistent with further substantial gains.  A modest increase in the federal funds rate 

would be highly unlikely to halt this progress, although such an increase might slow its 

pace somewhat. 

Second, we need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of 

monetary policy are felt only after long lags.  This means that policymakers cannot wait 

until they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy.  I would not consider 

it prudent to postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the 

verge of reaching, our inflation objective.  Doing so would create too great a risk of 

significantly overshooting both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and 

2 percent inflation, potentially undermining economic growth and employment if the 

FOMC is subsequently forced to tighten policy markedly or abruptly.  In addition, 

holding rates too low for too long could encourage inappropriate risk-taking by investors, 

potentially undermining the stability of financial markets.  That said, we must be 

reasonably confident at the time of the first rate increase that inflation will move up over 

time to our 2 percent objective, and that such an action will not impede continued solid 

growth in employment and output.  

An important factor working to increase my confidence in the inflation outlook 

will be continued improvement in the labor market.  A substantial body of theory, 

informed by considerable historical evidence, suggests that inflation will eventually begin 

to rise as resource utilization continues to tighten.2  It is largely for this reason that a
