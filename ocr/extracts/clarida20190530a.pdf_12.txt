monetary policy, we plan to resume periodic open market operations to accommodate the 

normal trend growth in the demand for our liabilities.17   

 As balance sheet normalization has progressed, the effective federal funds rate has 

firmed relative to the IOER rate.  Last year, after the federal funds rate moved up closer 

to the top of the target range set by the FOMC, we made technical adjustments in our 

operations by lowering the IOER rate relative to the top of the target range by 5 basis 

points in June and then again in December to keep the federal funds rate well within its 

target range.  At our May FOMC meeting, we made another technical adjustment in the 

IOER rate, reducing it by another 5 basis points to 2.35 percent.  Since then, the effective 

federal funds rate has been trading close to the level where it began the year.   

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications 

Before I conclude my prepared remarks, allow me to say a few words about our 

review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.18  While we 

believe that our existing approach to conducting monetary policy has served the public 

well, the purpose of this review is to evaluate and assess possible refinements that might 

help us best achieve our dual-mandate objectives on a sustained basis.  

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and 

price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.  We 

want to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in 

                                                 
17 In contrast to the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases conducted over recent years, these 
periodic technical open market operations would not have any implication for the stance of monetary 
policy; rather, such operations would be aimed at maintaining a level of reserve balances in the banking 
system consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation.
