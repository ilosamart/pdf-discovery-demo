It must be noted that, even among the productivity optimists, there are differences 

over how the expected progress will affect job creation and income distribution.  In 

particular, some in this camp believe that we are likely to see a continuation of the pattern 

by which recent productivity growth seems to have mostly benefited relatively skilled 

workers.  It may also have favored returns to capital investment, as opposed to labor, in 

greater proportion than past productivity gains.   

While there is some reason for optimism about the prospects for technological 

progress, there are grounds for concern over the decline in the dynamism of the U.S. 

labor market, an attribute that has contributed to productivity growth in the past and has 

traditionally distinguished the United States from many other advanced economies.  

Historically, the U.S. labor market has been characterized by substantial geographic 

mobility.  Our high rates of geographic mobility are one facet of the overall dynamism of 

our labor market, which is also manifest in the continual churning of jobs through hirings 

and separations, as well as firm expansions and contractions--a process that the 

economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.”5  To give a sense of the 

magnitude of this process, while net job gains and losses are typically measured in the 

hundreds of thousands each calendar quarter, gross job creation and destruction 

commonly run at a pace of roughly 7 million jobs each quarter.  Creative destruction has 

been shown to improve productivity as jobs that have low productivity are replaced with 

jobs that yield greater productivity.6
