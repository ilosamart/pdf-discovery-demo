foundations laid, attention turned to the tougher standards for institutions whose size and 

complexity are such that their distress could pose risks to the system as a whole.   

Tailoring Standards for Greater Systemic Risk 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Board to adopt enhanced prudential standards for large 

banking organizations, as well as for nonbank financial companies that have been designated as 

systemically important, and to tailor the standards so that their stringency increases in proportion 

to the systemic footprint of the institutions to which they apply.  In addition, rigorous planning 

and operational readiness for recovery and resolution are required to ensure that big, complex 

institutions are subject to the same market discipline of failure as other normal companies in 

America.4 

Within this framework, the first line of defense is to require big, complex institutions to 

maintain a very substantial stack of common equity in order to enhance loss absorbency and to 

induce the institutions to internalize the associated risks to the system.  These requirements are 

                                                            
4 The regulatory and supervisory framework for banking organizations incorporates multiple thresholds.  Banking 

organizations with less than $1 billion in assets generally qualify under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy 

Statement and are not subject to holding company risk-based capital requirements.  Banking organizations and 

certain other financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets are subject to the incentive compensation 

provisions in section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Banking organizations with more than $10 billion in assets are 

subject to the Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress test requirement, risk committee requirement, and requirement 

for a separate Volcker rule compliance program.  Banking organizations with $50 billion or more in assets are 

subject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements under sections 165 and 166 of the odd-

Frank Act, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and capital plan rule, and a modified Liquidity 

Coverage Ratio.  Banking organizations with either more than $250 billion in total assets or more than $10 billion in 

on-balance-sheet foreign exposures are subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements, the full 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, and the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer 

requirement.  Global systemically important banking organizations are subject to the enhanced supplementary 

leverage ratio and the supervisory Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR), and would be subject to 

risk-based capital surcharge requirements under the Boardâ€™s outstanding proposal. They may also be subject to a 

long-term debt requirement.
