Thinking Through a More Integrated Approach to Financial Regulation 

It is only moderately reductionist to say that, from the New Deal through the crisis, the 

nature and scope of regulation was determined by the categorization of financial actors.  If an 

entity was classified as a bank or a broker-dealer or an investment company, it was subject to a 

regulatory regime fashioned to deal with the risks associated with that form of intermediation or, 

perhaps more precisely, the risks that were perceived to be so associated.  Such an approach 

always provided for some interesting legal discussions, since forms of intermediation that served 

similar purposes and carried broadly similar risks might be subject to quite different regulatory 

constraints. 

But when, as noted earlier, nonbank forms of intermediation began to threaten traditional 

bank intermediation and when, in what was at least partly an effort to maintain the franchise 

value of commercial banks, strictures on bank activities and affiliations were significantly 

relaxed, the foundation of the New Deal regime was substantially eroded.  With the notable 

exception of an increased emphasis on capital, which itself was decidedly microprudential in 

focus, the prudential regime was not shored up or extended to other kinds of intermediaries, 

much less replaced--a signal failure that contributed to the severity of the crisis.  This may be a 

good point at which to note in passing that the pre-crisis failures were not limited to the 

underappreciation of systemic or macroprudential risks.  Even from a purely microprudential 

perspective, for example, the Basel II changes to the capital requirements for large banks were 

ill-conceived.2 

A natural reaction to this legacy might be to shift from a regime based predominantly on 

the form of an intermediary to one built predominantly on its functions.  As a practical matter,
