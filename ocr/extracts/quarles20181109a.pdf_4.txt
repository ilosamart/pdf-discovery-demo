management, providing room to adjust our approach to assessing capital planning 

practices.  Finally, as we make changes to our regime, the issue of volatility in the stress 

test results becomes more pronounced.  As I’ll discuss, we are considering how to 

balance the need to preserve the dynamism in stress testing with the need to ensure that 

firms have sufficient notice regarding the capital requirements to which they are held. 

Stress Capital Buffer 

Many of you are familiar with the Federal Reserve’s proposal to integrate the 

stress test with the regulatory capital rule--known as the stress capital buffer (SCB).1  I 

believe the SCB proposal represents an important milestone as we enter the next chapter 

of our stress testing regime.  For those who are not familiar with the SCB, let me provide 

a little background about how our capital rule currently works, and how it would be 

modified by the SCB. 

As devoted readers of our capital rules may know, our regulatory capital rule 

includes both minimum capital requirements and a buffer that sits on top of those 

minimum requirements.  The buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to 

supervisors, and it requires the firm to reduce its capital distributions as the firm 

approaches the minimum requirements.  Under the current capital rule, all firms are 

subject to a fixed buffer requirement of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets--the largest 

firms are also subject to a global systemically important bank surcharge and potential 

countercyclical capital buffer. 

For large firms, the SCB would replace the fixed 2.5 percent risk-based buffer 

with a firm-specific buffer the size of which would be based on the firm’s stress test 

results.  In this way, we are integrating the automatic restrictions on capital distributions 

in the current capital rule with the output of the most dynamic tool we have for assessing 

risk--the stress test--to create a more robust and dynamic regulatory capital regime.  The 

SCB would also result in a more transparent and simplified system of regulatory capital 

requirements, because a firm will be held to a single, integrated capital regime.
