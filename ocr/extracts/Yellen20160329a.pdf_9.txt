Risks to the Outlook for Real Economic Activity 

Although the baseline outlook has changed little on balance since December, 

global developments pose ongoing risks.  These risks appear to have contributed to the 

financial market volatility witnessed both last summer and in recent months.   

One concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly 

influenced by developments in China.  There is a consensus that China’s economy will 

slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and 

from exports toward domestic sources of growth.  There is much uncertainty, however, 

about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place 

to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it.  These uncertainties were 

heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy. 

A second concern relates to the prospects for commodity prices, particularly oil.  

For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic 

activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer.  But the 

apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part 

reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some 

countries and energy firms.  In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result 

might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail 

significant financial strains and increased layoffs.  In the event oil prices were to fall 

again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global 

economy. 

If such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow 

U.S. economic activity, at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market
