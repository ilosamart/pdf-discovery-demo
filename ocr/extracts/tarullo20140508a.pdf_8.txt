institutions of sufficient combined size, interconnectedness, and leverage could threaten the 

entire financial system, and, therefore, must be subject to a stricter regulatory regime. 

The special regulatory aims for such institutions should reflect this systemic focus.  The 

very large negative externalities associated with such failures could be realized through a classic 

domino effect or through contagion effects.  As the financial crisis showed, losses in a tail event 

are likely to be correlated for large firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, and 

other capital market instruments, and relying on similar sources of short-term funding.  Thus, the 

regulatory framework should aim to reduce the chances of distress or failure at such firms to a 

greater extent than traditional, microprudential regulation would.  Moreover, it should explicitly 

take into account the correlations and inter-dependencies in asset holdings and funding.  Finally, 

the regulatory system should aim to offset the perception of too-big-to-fail status, which carries 

with it the possibility of funding advantages in normal times, and protection of creditors and 

perhaps even shareholders in highly stressed times.  The systemic perspective and consequent 

aim of protecting financial stability argue for the stronger and broader regulatory measures that 

have been undertaken in recent years.  

At the other end of the spectrum are community banks, conventionally defined as those 

with less than $10 billion in assets.  The roughly 5,700 banks in this group constitute 98 percent 

of insured commercial banks in the United States, but hold just under 20 percent of the aggregate 

assets of all commercial banks.  Indeed, 90 percent of community banks are what supervisors 

classify as “small” community banks—those with less than $1 billion in assets.  While these 

banks will suffer the fallout from systemic problems, they are unlikely to cause such problems.  

The regulatory aim, therefore, is about as close as can be to the traditional microprudential bank 

regulatory aims of protecting the federal DIF and limiting the use of insured deposits by
