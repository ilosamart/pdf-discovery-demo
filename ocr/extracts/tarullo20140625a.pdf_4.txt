While the basic approach has remained consistent, much else has changed.  In the first 

place, of course, the requirement for stress testing has become statutory, as Congress drew on the 

lessons of SCAP in crafting prudential standards for large financial firms in the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).1  Second, the annual 

supervisory stress test has been incorporated into CCAR, a broader program that requires large 

banking organizations to submit a capital plan annually.  The CCAR process gives supervisors 

an opportunity to evaluate plans for capital distributions against the backdrop of the firm’s 

overall capital position under both baseline and hypothesized stressed conditions.  It also 

provides a regular, structured, and comparative way to assess the capacity of these firms to 

manage their capital positions and, by implication, more generally to manage their risks.  I will 

return to this feature of CCAR a bit later. 

Third, there have been substantial enhancements to the supervisory stress test.  Perhaps 

the most important change has been the development of independent supervisory models.  

Because the original SCAP was developed on the fly and under considerable time pressure, 

supervisors necessarily had to rely on firms’ own estimates of losses and revenues as a starting 

point for analysis, although they evaluated the firms’ estimates and made significant adjustments.  

In each stress test that has followed, and building upon the considerable progress in data 

collection, we have made completely independent estimates of a progressively greater proportion 

of potential net income or losses.  These improvements in data and models have increased our 

ability to distinguish risks within portfolios.   

We have also refined the formulation of the hypothetical scenarios that form the basis of 

the stress tests.  The severely adverse scenario is designed to reflect, at a minimum, the economic
