manager will be inclined to accommodate early exits by drawing down on the fund’s cash 

reserve while planning to sell securities and replenish the cash stock later.  

Why, at the end of the day, should one care if run-like incentives come 

predominantly from the strategic behavior of fund investors, as opposed to that of fund 

managers?  Isn’t there the same worrisome fragility in either case?  Perhaps, but the 

policy response may differ depending on the exact diagnosis.  In the former case, when 

the primary worry is AUM runs on the part of investors, there is at least in principle a 

natural regulatory fix:  One could impose exit fees on open-end funds that are related to 

the illiquidity of the funds’ assets, in an effort to make departing investors more fully 

internalize the costs that they impose on those who stay behind.  In the latter case, when 

the problem is driven more by the portfolio choices of fund managers, it is harder for me 

to see an obvious regulatory response, so I am more inclined to share the authors’ view 

that if there is, indeed, a significant financial stability problem, monetary policy would be 

left to take up some of the slack. 

To be clear, I am not advocating for exit fees of the sort I just described; I do not 

think we know enough about the empirical relevance of the AUM-run mechanism, to say 

nothing of its quantitative importance, to be making such recommendations at this point.  

But, given the detailed nature of the microdata that are available on individual fund 

holdings and returns, there is clearly room to make significant further progress on this 

front.  Indeed, recent work by Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang is very much in this spirit, 

although it restricts its analysis to equity funds and doesn’t consider the fixed-income 

categories that are the focus of the current paper.
