Regular stress tests of both capital and liquidity at our largest banking firms 

provide a key bulwark in the new supervisory architecture.4  Minimum capital 

requirements must be met under severely adverse macroeconomic conditions and, for the 

very largest firms, in the face of severe market shocks, including the failure of a firm’s 

largest counterparty.  By providing a forward-looking assessment that takes into account 

correlations among risks under stressed conditions, these stress tests on capital and 

liquidity are powerful tools for building resilience in our largest banking firms.  But they 

also have some limitations.  For instance, while the severity of the stresses can be varied 

from year to year, it is difficult to introduce entirely new scenarios each year to target 

specific sectoral risks without introducing excessive complexity.  And while the new U.S. 

framework requires that capital buffers are calibrated for the riskiness of their assets and 

exposures, the proportion of capital required does not vary systematically to counter the 

cyclicality that arises through elevated asset valuations and other channels.5 

4 The Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, or CLAR, is the Federal Reserve Board’s periodic 
simultaneous supervisory examination of firms’ liquidity buffers and risk-management policies.  We use 
CLAR to analyze and adjust our supervisory program for emerging firm practices and risk areas not 
captured in the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).  For example, CLAR enables monitoring of firm liquidity 
positions for buildups of concentrations of risk beyond the 30-day threshold.  It also allows us to look more 
closely at risks that may emanate from areas such as intraday credit, which are not captured within the LCR 
but are captured by firms’ internal stress-testing frameworks. 
5 As the Board laid out in its November 2013 policy statement on the scenario design framework for stress 
testing, it uses a recession approach to develop the severely adverse scenario of the stress tests.  See Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Policy Statement 
for Developing Scenarios for Future Capital Planning and Street Testing Exercises,” press release, 
November 7, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20131107a.htm.  The severely adverse 
scenario is anticipated to feature an unemployment rate over the first six to eight quarters of the scenario 
that increases between 3 percentage points and 5 percentage points, which is the amount by which 
unemployment has increased in the most recent three severe recessions.  However, if such an increase does 
not raise the level of the unemployment rate to at least 10 percent--the average level to which it has 
increased in the most recent three severe recessions--the path of the unemployment rate in most cases will 
be specified so as to raise the unemployment rate to at least this level.  Under this methodology, the 
increase in the unemployment rate would be slightly greater if the initial unemployment rate were low--as it 
would be after a sustained long expansion.  Moreover, setting a floor for the unemployment rate recognizes 
the fact that not only do cyclical systemic risks build up at financial intermediaries during robust 
expansions, but that these risks are also easily obscured by the buoyant environment.  Note, however, that 
while the approach to specifying the severely adverse scenario is designed to avoid adding sources of
