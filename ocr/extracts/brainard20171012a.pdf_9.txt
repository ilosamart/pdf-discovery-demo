Today, when many central banks in advanced economies are operating with two 

distinct tools, policymakers consider the effects of the balance sheet as well as the policy 

rate in their assessment of the extent of accommodation provided by monetary policy.  In 

the United States, from the time tapering was first discussed to the September 2017 

meeting, when the path for balance sheet runoff was adopted, FOMC minutes and 

statements suggest that participants considered the degree of accommodation provided by 

both policy tools in their discussions of the sequencing and timing of changes to policy 

settings.  Discussions about the sequencing of “normalization” and the delay of balance 

sheet runoff “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” 

effectively consider the extent to which maintaining the balance sheet may continue to 

provide makeup support for the economy while enabling the policy rate to escape the 

lower bound earlier than otherwise in a low neutral rate environment.   

As Bernanke acknowledges, now that many central banks have developed 

playbooks specifying the operational modalities associated with asset purchases, and 

there is some familiarity with their effects on asset prices and financial conditions, there 

is a greater likelihood that asset purchases would become a part of the policy reaction 

function, along with forward guidance, during lower-bound episodes.  Yet, as I have 

noted previously in the international context, asset purchases can complicate policy 

frameworks and communications, because their deployment and withdrawal has tended 

to be discontinuous and discrete and thus may be associated with greater uncertainty 

about the policy reaction function.13  It appears the public closely follows statements 

about both the policy rate and asset purchases to glean possible information about the
