in oil prices has also given a boost to drilling activity.  However, some crosscurrents 

could weigh on aggregate demand this year.  The recent increases in longer-term interest 

rates could restrain housing activity as well as other interest-sensitive areas of demand, 

and some further pickup in the dollar could weigh on net exports and business

October.  Increased optimism could lead to faster growth in consumption and business 

investment, although the spending data, thus far, do not suggest a noticeable acceleration.  

Some of the increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices could be tied to

progress that we have made over the past year, with the economy closer to meeting full 

employment and inflation objectives, has contributed to the favorable shift in the balance 

of risks.   The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign 

risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had 

been for the preceding two years.   

Nonetheless, the neutral real rate of interest--or the level of the real federal funds 

rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment 

and stable inflation--is expected to remain low both in the near term and in the longer 

run, and inflation is only slowly recovering from a protracted period of low levels.  The 

nominal neutral interest rate--which adjusts the real neutral rate for the level of inflation--
