which amounts to quasi-fiscal policy, with manifold implications for central bank 

independence as well as for the quality of fiscal policy decisions.21 

The Great Recession and the use of unconventional central bank instruments 

The basic delegated-authority governance framework I have described--mandated 

goals, instrument independence, and accountability--has allowed the Federal Reserve to 

respond to dramatic changes in the economic environment over the past 20 years.  In 

particular, during the Great Recession, instrument independence afforded the FOMC the 

flexibility needed to develop new tools that could address the large and extraordinary 

challenges it faced in pursuing its dual mandate.  The legislative proposals just discussed 

appear to be motivated by the belief that the Fed’s response during the crisis was 

somehow ineffective or inappropriate.  In fact, the Fed’s response was a carefully 

considered exercise of instrument independence that was effective, appropriate, and 

necessary in light of the congressional mandate to which it is held accountable.  Indeed, 

without those operations, the U.S. economy would have suffered a significantly deeper 

and longer recession than the very substantial recession we did suffer. 

Financial stability 

The research on monetary policy independence at the end of the 20th century was 

conducted on the assumption that the central bank was focused on its direct 

macroeconomic mandates such as inflation and employment.  After the global financial 

crisis, we cannot ignore the fact that central banks are typically tasked with multiple 

responsibilities, often among them, preserving or contributing to financial stability.
