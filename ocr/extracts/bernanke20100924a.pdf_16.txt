discussed the idea in the 1920s.  Although economists and psychologists have long 

recognized the challenges such ambiguity presents and have analyzed the distinction 

between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion, much of this work has been abstract and 

relatively little progress has been made in describing and predicting the behavior of 

human beings under circumstances in which their knowledge and experience provide 

little useful information.10

Another issue that clearly needs more attention is the formation and propagation 

of asset price bubbles.  Scholars did a great deal of work on bubbles after the collapse of 

the dot-com bubble a decade ago, much of it quite interesting, but the profession seems 

still quite far from consensus and from being able to provide useful advice to 

policymakers.  Much of the literature at this point addresses how bubbles persist and 

expand in circumstances where we would generally think they should not, such as when 

all agents know of the existence of a bubble or when sophisticated arbitrageurs operate in 

a market.  As it was put by my former colleague, Markus Brunnermeier, a scholar 

affiliated with the Bendheim center who has done important research on bubbles, “We do 

not have many convincing models that explain when and why bubbles start.”

  Research in this area could aid our understanding of crises 

and other extreme situations.  I suspect that progress will require careful empirical 

research with attention to psychological as well as economic factors.

Savage Axioms,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 75 (4), pp. 643-69; for a more recent, and

  I would 

add that we also don’t know very much about how bubbles stop either, and better
