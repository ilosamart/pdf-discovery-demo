• There is a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of RWA, to ensure that 

banking organizations build capital when they are able to. 

• A countercyclical capital buffer has been created that enables regulators to raise 

risk-based capital requirements when credit growth is judged to be excessive. 

• A minimum international leverage ratio of 3 percent has been set for tier 1 capital 

relative to total (i.e., not risk-weighted) on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance-

sheet exposures. 

• There is a risk-based capital surcharge for global systemically important banks 

(G-SIBs) based on these firms’ systemic risk.  

In addition, in the United States 

• The Federal Reserve is planning to propose risk-based capital surcharges for U.S. 

G-SIBs, based on the BCBS proposal for G-SIBs.6 

• The relevant U.S. regulators (the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the 

Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)) have raised the 

Basel III leverage ratio for U.S. G-SIBs to 5 percent; U.S. G-SIBs that do not 

achieve this ratio will face limits on their ability to distribute dividends and to 

pay discretionary employee bonuses.7  

• Foreign banking organizations with U.S. nonbranch assets of $50 billion or more 

will have to form U.S. intermediate holding companies that will have to meet 

6 As my colleagues Chair Yellen and Governor Tarullo have noted, it may be appropriate to go beyond the 
risk-based surcharges proposed by the BCBS.  The goal would be to reach a point where any remaining 
TBTF subsidies have been offset and where other social costs of a potential failure by the firm have been 
internalized.   
7 In addition, the subsidiary banks of the U.S. G-SIBs will need to meet a 6 percent leverage ratio to be 
considered well capitalized from the viewpoint of prompt corrective action regulations.
