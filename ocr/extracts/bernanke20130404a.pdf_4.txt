Let me close by congratulating the University of Dayton for its leadership in 

hosting the RISE forum.  I hope this innovative program, which I’m told is the world’s 

largest student investment conference, succeeds in its ambitious goal of bringing together 

the current and future leaders of finance to focus on creating a better economic future.
