Changes in the Use of Payment Instruments 

Consumer credit pricing and availability also appear to affect consumer 

preferences for different payment methods.  When consumers decide how to pay for their 

purchases, they may have a variety of payment options to choose from, including cash, 

checks, debit cards, credit cards, prepaid cards, and even, increasingly, their mobile 

phones.  The Federal Reserve has tracked changes in consumersâ€™ use of payment 

instruments in a number of studies over the past decade.  These studies cast an interesting 

light on the effects that weakened economic conditions have had on the mix of payments. 

The number of checks processed in the United States has been declining since the 

late 1990s, as consumers, businesses, and governments have shifted away from checks 

and toward electronic payment methods.  The annual number of checks dropped from 

more than 40 billion in 2000 to 30 billion in 2006, and we expect the data for 2009 to 

show continued declines. 

At the same time, the use of debit and credit cards has risen.  Debit card 

payments, in particular, have grown remarkably:  Between 2000 and 2008, the number of 

debit card transactions grew at an annual rate of more than 17 percent, while the value of 

debit card transactions grew 15 percent per year.  Credit card transactions have grown at 

a slower pace than debit card transactions over the same period--about 2 percent per year 

in number and roughly 5 percent per year in value.  For smaller-value payments, both 

types of cards, but especially debit cards, have served as substitutes for checks and, very 

likely, cash.  Although the nature of cash makes direct measurement of aggregate cash 

payments difficult, we can infer a trend in usage from changes in the level of small-

denomination currency that is most frequently used in cash payments.  The amount of
