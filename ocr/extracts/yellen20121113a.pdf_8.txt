stance of monetary policy would both affect and respond to economic conditions.  In this 

situation, the FOMC began to rely heavily on forward guidance about both the likely 

future path of the federal funds rate and the Committee’s intentions concerning asset 

purchases and sales.8  But, for this guidance to have its maximum effect, it must be 

understood and believed by the public, and therefore provide the public with a solid basis 

for forming their borrowing and spending decisions today.9  In my view, such credibility 

can be achieved only if the public understands the FOMC’s objectives and intentions.   

Communications after the Financial Crisis 

Chairman Bernanke asked me to take up these challenges in 2010 as chair of a 

new FOMC communications subcommittee.10  Central bank transparency had long been 

an issue of great interest to both of us, and the Chairman had been an exceptionally 

strong voice for central bank transparency in his academic work and in his earlier service 

on the Board of Governors.  Throughout the Chairman’s term, the FOMC has made 

important strides in transparency through actions such as introducing the Committee’s 

quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which provides information about 

                                                 
8 The FOMC also provided information concerning its “exit strategy” in the minutes of its June 2011 
meeting (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), Minutes of the Federal Open 
Market Committee, June 21-22, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20110622.pdf).  
The Committee indicated that it intends to normalize the size and composition of its balance sheet by 
selling off agency securities at a gradual pace after it begins the process of raising the federal funds rate.    
9 Economic theory suggests that the public’s expectations concerning the time path of the Federal Reserve’s 
asset holdings--which includes both the ultimate size of those holdings and the length of time that these 
assets will be retained on the Fed’s balance sheet--influence longer-term yields and the term premiums 
embedded in those yields today.  For empirical estimates of these effects see, for example, Canlin Li and 
Min Wei (2012), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale 
Asset Purchase Programs,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2012-37 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May),

10 Similar subcommittees acting in the early 1990s dealt with FOMC policies concerning the disclosure of 
the minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings.  An FOMC subcommittee in 1999 laid the groundwork for 
the current FOMC postmeeting statements.  And a subcommittee appointed in 2006, led by the then Vice 
Chairman Kohn, considered the adoption of a numerical inflation objective and recommended 
enhancements that were incorporated in the Summary of Economic Projections.
