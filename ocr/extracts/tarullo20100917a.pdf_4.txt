would be liabilities of the NFBs.  The government would regulate the NFBs directly, as it does 

all banks, but also by setting requirements for the ABS that could be bought by the NFBs.  This 

regulation is intended to provide market confidence in the liabilities of the NFBs, which would 

be further buttressed by NFB access to the discount window. 

A key feature of the proposal is that, by law, only NFBs could buy securitized assets.  

The consequent franchise value would compensate NFBs for the costs they incur because they 

can hold only high-quality securities, are subject to supervision and prudential requirements, and 

have to operate in a highly transparent fashion.  In essence, ABS-backed repo funding would be 

limited to NFBs.   

The first two questions I would pose about this creative policy proposal are the most 

basic: What problem is it supposed to solve, and how does the breadth of the remedy align with 

that problem?  Given their analysis of the breakdown of the repo market, Gorton and Metrick’s 

answer might be self-evident: The G-M proposal aims to solve the information problems that 

increased the risk from maturity transformation associated with ABS repo funding.  This, of 

course, is not solving for the entire shadow banking system, though an effective plan for 

reforming the ABS repo market would be a major accomplishment in itself.2   

But in proposing a solution to this problem, G-M would significantly restrict all asset-

backed securitization.  While it is obvious that too much credit was created through ABS and 

associated instruments in the years preceding the crisis, it seems at least reasonable to question 

whether the best policy response is this dramatic a change in the regulatory environment.  One 

wonders, for example, if it is desirable to forbid anyone but NFBs from buying ABS, particularly 

if there are investors interested in holding these assets regardless of their utility in repo 

arrangements.  The severe problems now associated with ABS began with assets held by
