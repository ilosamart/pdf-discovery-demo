I noted previously--and it is now commonly accepted--that monetary policy can 

affect systemic risk through a number of channels.15  First, monetary policy has a direct 

effect on asset prices for the obvious reason that interest rates represent the opportunity 

costs of holding assets.  Indeed, an important element of the monetary transmission 

mechanism works through the asset price channel.  In theory, an increase in asset prices 

induced by a decline in interest rates should not cause asset prices to keep escalating in 

bubble-like fashion.  But if bubbles do develop, perhaps because of an onset of excessive 

optimism, and especially if the bubble is financed by debt, the result may be a buildup of 

systemic risk.  Second, recent research has identified possible linkages between monetary 

policy and leverage among financial intermediaries.16  It is conceivable that 

accommodative monetary policy could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and 

excessive risk-taking in the financial system.   

Macroprudential interventions may also have macroeconomic spillovers.  For 

example, research suggests that rigorous enforcement of supervisory standards for capital 

following the real estate-related loan losses of the early 1990s may have slowed the 

economy’s recovery from the recession.  Today, we all understand the need for more 

stringent bank capital and liquidity requirements to stem systemic risk.  But, with high 

unemployment in so many economies, the new Basel III agreement recognizes the 

desirability of a phase in period for these standards.   The implementation of tighter 

standards over a multi-year period should mitigate the concern that the macroprudential
