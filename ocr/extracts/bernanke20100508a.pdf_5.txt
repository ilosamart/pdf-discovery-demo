 Even though I hope I have persuaded you that purely economic measures of 

personal well-being are not as narrow as sometimes thought, I have so far dodged the key 

questions:  Ultimately, what makes us happy?  What makes our lives satisfying in the 

long run?  And, more subtly, how is the state of mind we call happiness, at least as social 

scientists define the term, related to our long-run life satisfaction?  We can look inward 

for answers, but, at least for someone trained as a social scientist, the most direct way to 

tackle the question is just to go out and ask people--lots of people.  In fact, psychologists 

for some time have been running surveys in which they have asked thousands of 

randomly selected people in countries all around the world to rate their own happiness or 

life satisfaction, and recently economists have gotten into the act.  There is now a field of 

study, complete with doctoral dissertations and professorships, called “the economics of 

happiness.”  The idea is that by measuring the self-reported happiness of people around 

the world, and then correlating those results with economic, social, and personal 

characteristics and behavior, we can learn directly what factors contribute to happiness. 

 The results of these studies are quite interesting.  One finding is that most people 

consider themselves to be reasonably happy, despite the undeniable hardships that many 

people face.  Asked a question like, “Taken altogether, how would you say things are 

these days--would you say you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?”, about 

90 percent of respondents in the United States reply that they are very happy or pretty 

happy, a relatively high percentage.4  Perhaps people don’t want to admit to survey-takers 

that they are unhappy, but the explanation preferred by most researchers is that human

Answer to the Easterlin Paradox?” Journal of Development Economics, vol. 86 (April), pp. 22-42.  These 
authors also report that approximately 80 percent of respondents in 11 European nations report themselves 
as “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their lives.
