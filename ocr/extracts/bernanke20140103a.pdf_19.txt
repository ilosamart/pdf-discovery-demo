namely, fiscal policy.  Federal fiscal policy was expansionary in 2009 and 2010.18  Since 

that time, however, federal fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive; according to the 

Congressional Budget Office, tax increases and spending cuts likely lowered output 

growth in 2013 by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points.  In addition, throughout much of 

the recovery, state and local government budgets have been highly contractionary, 

reflecting their adjustment to sharply declining tax revenues.  To illustrate the extent of 

fiscal tightness, at the current point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment 

at all levels of government had increased by nearly 600,000 workers; in contrast, in the 

current recovery, government employment has declined by more than 700,000 jobs, a net 

difference of more than 1.3 million jobs.  There have been corresponding cuts in 

government investment, in infrastructure for example, as well as increases in taxes and 

reductions in transfers. 

Although long-term fiscal sustainability is a critical objective, excessively tight 

near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive.  Most importantly, with 

fiscal and monetary policy working in opposite directions, the recovery is weaker than it 

otherwise would be.  But the current policy mix is particularly problematic when interest 

rates are very low, as is the case today.  Monetary policy has less room to maneuver 

when interest rates are close to zero, while expansionary fiscal policy is likely both more 

effective and less costly in terms of increased debt burden when interest rates are pinned 

at low levels.  A more balanced policy mix might also avoid some of the costs of very 

low interest rates, such as potential risks to financial stability, without sacrificing jobs 

and growth.
