ensure banks’ resilience even in severely adverse business conditions. 

The Rise of Business Leverage 

Let’s start with the basic facts.  Many measures confirm that the business sector 

has significantly increased its borrowing as the economy has expanded over the past 

decade.  Business debt relative to the size of the economy is at historic highs.  Corporate 

debt relative to the book value of assets is at the upper end of its range over the past few 

decades (figure 1).  And investment-grade corporate debt has shifted closer to the edge of 

speculative grade.   

At the moment, the business sector is quite healthy overall.  Business income is 

strong, reflecting healthy profit margins.  And because interest rates are quite low by 

historical standards, the costs of servicing today’s higher levels of debt remain low 

relative to business income (figure 2).  Despite crosscurrents, the economy is showing 

continued growth, strong job creation, and rising wages, all in a context of muted 

inflation pressures.   

But if a downturn were to arrive unexpectedly, some firms would face challenges.  

Not only is the volume of debt high, but recent growth has also been concentrated in the 

riskier forms of debt.  Among investment-grade bonds, a near-record fraction is at the 

lowest rating—a phenomenon known as the “triple-B cliff.”  In a downturn, some of 

these borrowers could be downgraded into high-yield territory, which would require 

some investors to sell their holdings, thereby confronting traditional high-yield investors 

with a sudden influx of bonds.
