Money Markets:  Money markets involve money-like investments such as 

commercial paper and repo.  Investors in these markets include money market funds, 

corporations and other large holders of excess cash seeking a safe return in the short term, 

frequently no longer than overnight.  Borrowers in money markets include banks, 

securities dealers and other financial companies, nonfinancial corporations, and 

governments.  By linking investors seeking a safe return with borrowers needing short-

term credit, money markets do what commercial banks have always done, but without 

deposit insurance and other aspects of the safety net provided for regulated depository 

institutions.  After Lehman failed and the Reserve Fund “broke the buck,” money market 

fund investors realized that their investments were not as safe and liquid as “money” after 

all.  There were widespread runs in these markets, and it took a U.S. Treasury guarantee, 

augmented by a number of unprecedented liquidity facilities established by the Federal 

Reserve, to stabilize the money market fund industry and, more importantly, stave off a 

sudden stoppage of the flow of credit to households and businesses.   

This experience tells us clearly that disruptions in the money markets can threaten 

the broader financial system.  Regulation to increase the resilience of the money markets 

needs to reflect their systemic importance.  Some important steps have been taken to 

address the most immediate risks--for example, through the liquidity standards for large 

institutions I mentioned earlier.  But the risks associated with dislocations in the money 

markets go far beyond the large banks.   

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken some important steps 

to address the money market fund issue, notably through its 2014 rule amendments.8  To
