degree than in the past.  We should invite reflection on the design and impact of our efforts, 

solicit input on risks to financial stability, and better communicate our mission and activities to 

the public, without the veneer of technical jargon. 

 The FSB can begin this work at home, by strengthening the role of the regional groups 

that are already part of the organization.  In 2011, the FSB established six consultative groups 

representing large regions of the globe.  The intent was to expand our outreach beyond the 

membership of the G20 and to better reflect the FSB’s global mission and impact.  Today, the 

groups meet once or twice a year and help the FSB obtain broader input into its policy 

development agenda.  They can, and should, have the opportunity to do more--not only to 

promote implementation of international policy initiatives but also to give a clear view of 

financial stability developments in their respective regions.  A study of the groups’ operations is 

now underway, which will shed light on how to upgrade their effectiveness as an outreach and 

feedback mechanism.  

We can also engage more effectively outside the FSB--with businesses, public 

institutions, market participants, and scholars--and give the public the means and the opportunity 

to provide meaningful feedback on our work.  Some steps are already underway.  We established 

a new expectation that all FSB policy recommendations will be open for at least 60 days of 

public comment, instead of the shorter periods used in the past.  We began a recent effort around 

the differences in regulatory environments and market conditions across jurisdictions--known as 

“market fragmentation”--by convening key stakeholders and academics for a full-day workshop, 

which I hope will be the rule for future projects, not the exception.  Earlier this year, we released 

publicly the FSB work program for the first time.3
