import of key capital goods.  These factors enhance productivity and growth and result in the 

availability of a greater variety of goods to consumers at lower prices.  It is safe to say that over 

the years, the Asian economies have benefited from their high degree of export orientation 

through all of these transmission mechanisms.14 A number of academic studies have found a 

causal link between openness and growth.15  A simple scatter plot of economic growth across 

countries over the period from 2000 to 2007 against their export orientation, presented in 

slide 12, is telling: More trade-intensive economies have grown significantly faster over this 

period, and the fast-growing emerging Asian economies shown by the red dots have generally 

been among the most export-oriented.   

How did greater focus on trade develop in Asia?  At first, increased export orientation in 

Asia was achieved by taking advantage of low-cost, low-skilled labor to produce low value-

added products for foreign markets.  Over time, countries such as Japan and South Korea moved 

up to higher value-added exports, in part through technological and knowledge spillovers.  Later, 

with the rise of China, many emerging Asian economies became integrated into global supply 

chains, with China acting as the endpoint of a giant Asian assembly line.  

Given that trade benefited the Asian economies on the way up, it seems natural that the 

slowdown in global trade, whatever its causes, could lead to some loss of dynamism and growth 

in the region.  For China, the shift away from trade dependence is partly a reflection of policy 

choice, with rebalancing seen as a way to sustain growth in the face of some exhaustion of the 


14 Some--Page (1994), for example--have argued that industrial policies favoring certain export industries have also 
played an important role in Asiaâ€™s success, but it seems to be generally agreed that industrial support was only 
maintained conditional on successful performance on world markets.
