For example, in 1999, more than 25 percent of first-time homebuyers had credit scores 

below 620 compared with fewer than 10 percent in 2012 (figure 15).

  Although I expect 

housing demand to expand along with the economic recovery, if credit is hard to get, 

much of that demand may be channeled into rental, rather than owner-occupied, housing. 

At the Federal Reserve, we continue to foster more-accommodative financial 

conditions and, in particular, lower mortgage rates through our monetary policy actions.  

We also continue to monitor mortgage credit conditions and consider the implications of 

our rulemakings for credit availability.  For your part, I urge you to continue to develop 

new and more sustainable business models for lending to lower-credit-score borrowers 

that lead to better outcomes  for borrowers, communities, and the financial system than 

we have experienced over the past few years.

 Staff calculations are based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel.  First-

time homebuyers are measured as consumers who have no record of ever having a mortgage at the end of 

the second quarter of a given year and opened a mortgage in the third quarter.  This estimate includes all 

types of mortgages but excludes first-time homebuyers who purchased their homes with cash.  The credit 

score was generated from the Equifax 3.0 risk model and measured the credit score as of the end of the 

second quarter.  Consumers without a credit score are excluded from the analysis.
