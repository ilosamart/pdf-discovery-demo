short term only by withdrawing credit from one another.  Such deleveraging can be 

particularly destabilizing in longer intermediation chains as debt claims that are called by 

one financial intermediary to shore up its own assets adversely affect the liability sides of 

other institutions’ balance sheets.  As deleveraging accelerates and more and more 

financial institutions hoard liquidity, other institutions may become concerned that their 

own funding may dry up and may preemptively withdraw funding from others.  

Fundamentally strong institutions are forced to liquidate assets at fire sale prices, which 

results in more deleveraging and instability. 

More-complex network structures are likely to be more opaque than less complex 

ones.  For example, as the number of intermediaries standing between borrowers and 

lenders grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand how one member of the 

network fits into the overall system.  The well-publicized difficulties that some mortgage 

borrowers have had in simply figuring out who owns their mortgages illustrates the 

extent to which lengthening intermediation chains have increased the complexity of the 

financial system.  Moreover, in many cases, market participants may have strong 

incentives not to disclose their connections to one another.  If a bank has a profitable 

relationship with a borrower, it may be unwilling to disclose it to other banks for fear that 

competitors will reduce or eliminate the rents that it earns.    

Ricardo Caballero and Alp Simsek illustrate how a lack of information can create 

systemic risk in financial networks.

  In a model that is structurally similar to the 

incomplete interbank network model of Allen and Gale, Caballero and Simsek examine 

how banks might respond to news of a liquidity shock when each bank knows the 

identities of its own counterparties but not the identities of its counterparties’
