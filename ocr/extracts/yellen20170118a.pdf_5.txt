equivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushes 

inflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate. 

Does price stability mean having no inflation whatsoever?  Again, the answer is 

no.  By “price stability,” we mean a level of inflation that is low and stable enough that it 

doesn’t need to figure prominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions.  

Based on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year--an 

inflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks.1  Individual 

prices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time.  Such 

movements are essential to a well-functioning economy.  They allow supply and demand 

to adjust for various goods and services.  By “inflation,” we mean price changes as a 

whole for all of the various goods and services that households consume.   

No one likes high inflation, and it is easy to understand why.  Although wages 

and prices tend to move in tandem over long periods, inflation erodes household 

purchasing power if it is not matched with similar increases in wages, and it eats away 

the value of households’ savings.  So, then, why don’t we and other central banks aim for 

zero inflation?  There are several technical reasons, but a more fundamental reason is to 

create a buffer against the opposite of inflation--that is, deflation.  Deflation is a general 

and persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced 

during the Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of 

the past two decades.  Deflation can feed on itself, leading to economic stagnation or 

worse.  It puts pressure on employers to either cut wages or cut jobs.  And it can be very 

hard on borrowers, who find themselves repaying their loans with dollars that are worth
