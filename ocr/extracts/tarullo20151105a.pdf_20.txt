flexibility enjoyed by banks in shifting capital and liquidity around the globe was deployed in 

pursuit of unsustainable activity that eventually ran badly aground.   

 Third, as I suggested earlier, even where concerns about “trapped” capital or liquidity are 

more sensibly based, reasonable ex ante constraints by host country authorities in pursuit of a 

sound and stable domestic financial system are likely to be far preferable to ex post constraints--

for example, ringfencing--that are imposed when the foreign bank is under the greatest pressure.
