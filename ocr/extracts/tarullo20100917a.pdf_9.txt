ownership by commercial banks in an effort to avoid implicit contractual guarantees.  This is a 

legitimate concern, to be sure, but one that might be at least imperfectly addressed through 

specific restrictions on relationships between affiliates in a bank holding company.  The relevant 

comparison is thus between the residual costs of the regulated relationship and the effects of an 

anti-competitive industry structure. 

A second variant on the G-M approach, also motivated by industry structure problems, 

would be to turn NFBs from privately owned public utilities (as G-M describe them) to actual 

public utilities.  However, the extent to which this change in ownership structure would 

ameliorate the anti-competitive problems is uncertain.  Moreover, the concerns mentioned earlier 

with respect to government judgments on credit allocation would remain, even if they are 

provided another layer of insulation through the device of a government corporation.  In 

addition, of course, the history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale of the 

potential for a government monopoly with a conservative mandate to expand its operation into 

much riskier activities. 

At first glance, then, it is not at all clear that structural modifications to the basic G-M 

approach would be preferable to the proposal as they have described it.  Options that depart from 

the G-M approach would need to find different ways of solving the information problems that  

G-M identify.  Let me briefly speculate about possible alternatives that would use regulatory 

requirements to create a class of ABS in which markets could, without inquiry into the nature 

and quality of the underlying assets, have confidence even in periods of stress.  One way, of 

course, would be to follow more closely the deposit insurance analogy by establishing an 

insurance system.  G-M suggest that an insurance system for the repo market would be 

impractical, question whether insuring collateral (i.e., certain classes of securitized assets) would
