What about Japan?  

Finally, I would like to turn to Japan, whose experience combines elements of 

both its emerging Asian neighbors and of other advanced economies.  Like other Asian 

economies, Japan shares a history of current account surpluses and export-dependent 

growth.  Also like other Asian economies, the Japanese economy bounced back faster 

from the global financial crisis, at least prior to its tragic earthquake and tsunami, than 

most advanced economies, and more robustly than in any Japanese recovery since the 

mid-1970s.  Strong exports to the rest of Asia supported this rebound.  However, Japan 

has not been immune to the slowdown in trade affecting the region.  Japanese exports 

have flattened out since about the middle of 2010, contributing to a negative trade 

balance for the first time since 1980.  Like its neighbors, Japan will need to look for 

alternative engines of growth.   

Notwithstanding its similarities to emerging Asia, the Japanese economy faces 

fiscal and demographic challenges similar to those of other advanced economies in 

Europe and the United States.  Japanese government spending helped propel the 

economy’s bounceback from recession, but it has also added to public debt, which the 

International Monetary Fund now projects will rise to 237 percent of gross domestic 

product (GDP) this year, the largest among the major advanced economies.2  Along with 

this high debt, aging of the population and slow GDP growth pose important concerns for 

fiscal sustainability. 

To date, the savings of Japanese household and firms have been more than 

enough to finance the government deficit; indeed, interest rates on government debt have
