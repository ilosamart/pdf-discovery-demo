I have argued that there is a synergy between banksâ€™ stable funding model and 

their investing in assets that have modest fundamental risk but whose prices can fall 

significantly below fundamental values in a bad state of the world.  This synergy helps 

explain both why deposit-taking banks might have a comparative advantage at making 

information-intensive loans and, at the same time, why they tend to hold the specific 

types of securities that they do.
