activity.  Another salient consideration is whether the activity at issue has significant synergies 

with core banking activities.  If so, then migration out of the traditional banking sector could 

damage the efficiency of banks and increase their vulnerability. 

Short-Term Wholesale Funding 

 While I favor assessment of the specific risks and costs associated with a particular form 

of nonbank intermediation, I also believe that the greatest risks to financial stability are the 

funding runs and asset fire sales associated with reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and 

thus I place particular emphasis on this factor.  If there is one lesson to be drawn from the 

financial crisis, it is that the rapid withdrawal of funding by short-term credit providers can lead 

to systemic problems as consequential as those associated with classic runs on traditional banks.5  

When financial intermediaries must rapidly liquidate a substantial amount of longer-term assets 

that they can no longer fund, the impact can reverberate throughout the financial system.  The 

resulting declines in asset prices can trigger margin calls on other investors, who themselves may 

need to de-lever by selling their own holdings, adding to the fire sale-induced price impact on 

these, and potentially other, assets.  In the worst case, the result can be the kind of generalized 

asset price decline and liquidity freeze observed at the height of the financial crisis.   

The total amount of short-term wholesale funding within the financial system is lower 

today than immediately before the crisis, but volumes are still large relative to the size of the 

financial system.  For example, nearly half of the liabilities of broker-dealers consist of short-

term wholesale funding, an amount that is nearly the same as it was during the crisis.6  

Numerous regulatory reforms have addressed the use of short-term wholesale funding by
