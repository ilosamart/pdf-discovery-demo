operations.  For example, we have adopted a more multidisciplinary approach that makes 

better use of the wide range of expertise and skills at the Federal Reserve--in economics, 

financial markets, payments systems, and other specialties, as well as bank supervision.  

We will be doing more cross-firm comparisons to better understand differences in the 

practices of different firms and the risks they face, and we will be complementing on-site 

examinations with off-site, quantitative analyses by experts in a range of disciplines.  As 

we improve our supervision, we will be sure not to lose sight of the diversity of our 

banking system.  Banks of all sizes, including regional and community banks, make 

critical contributions to our economy; thus, we must continue our efforts to ensure the 

stability and vitality of smaller banks as well as larger ones. 

As we’ve been working to make our supervision more effective, we have also 

been taking care to ensure we do not inadvertently impede sound lending.  Businesses 

need access to credit to maintain or expand their payrolls and make productive 

investments.  Banks need to continue to lend to creditworthy borrowers to earn a profit 

and remain strong.  If bankers become overly conservative in response to past lending 

mistakes--or if examiners force such behavior--it will hurt bankers’ own long-term 

interests and the economy in general.  For this reason, we have joined with the other 

federal banking agencies to issue a series of policy statements to examiners: on the 

importance of bank lending to creditworthy borrowers, on small business lending, and on 

commercial real estate loan restructuring.4  We have followed up this formal guidance
