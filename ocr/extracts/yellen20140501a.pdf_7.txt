community banks,8 and the impact of Dodd-Frank on community banks.9  I’m pleased to say that 

the conference was so successful that the Federal Reserve and CSBS are planning another in 

September.10   

In addition to research, our understanding of community banks is enhanced by the Fed’s 

outreach to community bankers.  At the most basic level, supervisory staff at each Reserve Bank 

gain insights from their regular contact with community bankers.  Additional knowledge comes 

by way of community outreach initiatives, which provide the added benefit of informing the Fed 

about local economic conditions.   Here in Washington, in addition to participating in events like 

this one, the Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions 

Advisory Council (CDIAC).11 The council, which includes representatives from small banks, 

credit unions, and savings associations from each Federal Reserve district, provides information 

about economic conditions around the country and those issues that are of greatest concern to 

community institutions.   

In addition, we have been taking steps to improve our communication with community 

bankers.  In that regard, we have been using various platforms to go beyond formal policy 

issuances and better explain our supervisory expectations for community banks.  We have also
