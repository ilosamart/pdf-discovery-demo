the operation of cyclical forces.12  Regardless, because inflation is ultimately a monetary 

phenomenon, the Federal Reserve has the capacity and the responsibility to ensure inflation 

expectations are firmly anchored at—and not below—our target. 

As I have argued in the past, the fact that inflation has been running somewhat below our 

longer-run goal of 2 percent may not be entirely due to labor market slack or to transitory 

shocks; it also likely reflects some softening in inflation’s underlying trend.13  First, estimates of 

underlying inflation based on statistical filters are lower than they were before the financial crisis 

and are currently below 2 percent.  Second, estimates of longer-run inflation expectations based 

on the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and on inflation compensation from 

financial market pricing are also running lower than before the financial crisis.14   

Our goal now is to get underlying trend inflation around our target on a sustained basis.  

What would this take?  We can get some sense from statistical models.  Although there is no one 

widely agreed-upon method of measuring underlying inflation, one statistical approach that has 

received attention in recent years captures the idea that underlying inflation responds to the
