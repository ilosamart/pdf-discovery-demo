for low- and moderate-income families, which made them extremely vulnerable to the 

eventual housing market collapse.

  Families at the lower end of the income distribution 

saw a substantial drop in their net worth between 2007 and 2009, and families in the 

middle of the income distribution fared even worse.

  Combined with widespread 

unemployment, housing and stock price declines, and increasing rates of mortgage 

defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies, the assets of many American families have been 

significantly eroded.  The effect of these developments may be to attenuate the revival of 

normal consumption patterns that would otherwise be dictating increases in consumer 

demand and growth.  

Diversity of Views 

Even if the usual effectiveness of monetary policy is being attenuated by the 

factors that I have mentioned, that conclusion should not be taken as implying that 

additional monetary accommodation would be unhelpful.  Indeed, the opposite 

conclusion might well be the case--namely, that additional policy accommodation is 

warranted under present circumstances. 

My FOMC colleagues and I have recently been faced with complex decisions 

about the use of unconventional policy tools under extraordinary economic and financial 

conditions.  And while we may not all agree with every decision, I believe that the public 

can have a very high degree of confidence in the fundamental integrity and soundness of 

our decisionmaking process.
