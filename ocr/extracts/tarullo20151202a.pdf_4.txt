 As this is the last outreach meeting of this EGRPRA process, I think it useful to add that 

we are committed to a systematic analysis and consideration of all the comments that we receive.

commanded attention from so many commenters.   

Thank you again for your participation in today’s session.  I look forward to hearing your 

views.
