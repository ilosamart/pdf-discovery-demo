sufficient income are facing capacity constraints in the mortgage market.  However, even 

if the interest rate channel is less powerful right now than it was before the crisis, asset 

purchases still work to support economic growth through other channels, including by 

boosting stock prices and house values.  The resulting improvement in household wealth

Turning to the potential costs of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, there are 

some that definitely need to be monitored over time.  At this stage, I do not see any that 

would cause me to advocate a curtailment of our purchase program.   

To address one concern that I have heard, there is no evidence that the Federal 

Reserve’s purchases have impaired the functioning of financial markets, and, while we 

continue to monitor market function carefully, so long as we pursue our purchases 

sensibly, I do not expect market functioning to become a problem in the future.  Further, 

I’ve argued previously, and still judge, that the FOMC has the tools it needs to withdraw 

accommodation, even if the balance sheet at that time is large.  These tools include a new 

one, approved by the Congress during the financial crisis, which allows the Federal 

Reserve to pay banks interest on their reserves.  A suite of supporting tools, such as 

reverse repurchase agreements with a wide range of counterparties and the Term Deposit 

Facility, are routinely tested to make sure that the Federal Reserve is prepared to use 

them and that they will work as planned.   

Two additional costs have been discussed at recent meetings of the FOMC.  First,
