of loans to banks from overnight to 90 days, and provided discount window credit through 

regular auctions in an effort to overcome banks’ reluctance to borrow at the window due to 

concerns about the “stigma” of borrowing from the Federal Reserve.  We also lent dollars to 

other central banks so that they could provide dollar liquidity to banks in their jurisdictions, thus 

easing pressures on U.S. money markets.  As the crisis intensified, however, the Federal Reserve 

recognized that lending to banks alone would not be sufficient to address the severe strains 

affecting many participants in short-term financing markets.  Ultimately, the Federal Reserve 

responded to the crisis by creating a range of emergency liquidity facilities to meet the funding 

needs of key nonbank market participants, including primary securities dealers, money market 

mutual funds, and other users of short-term funding markets, including purchasers of securitized 

loans.2

Why couldn't the Federal Reserve maintain its routine lending practices and rely on 

lending to commercial banks, which in turn lend to nonbank firms?  The reason is that financial 

markets have evolved substantially in recent decades--and, in retrospect, by more than we had 

recognized prior to the crisis.  The task of intermediating between investors and borrowers has 

shifted over time from banks--which take deposits and make loans--to securities markets--where 

borrowers and savers meet more directly, albeit with the assistance of investment banks that help 

borrowers issue securities and then make markets in those securities.  An important aspect of the 

shift has been the growth of securitization, in which loans that might in the past have remained 

on the books of banks are instead converted into securities and sold to investors in global capital 

markets.  Serious deficiencies with these securitizations, the associated derivative instruments, 

and the structures that evolved to hold securitized debt were at the heart of the financial crisis.
