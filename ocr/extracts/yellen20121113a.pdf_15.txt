the other variable to move away from its objective.  In particular, reducing inflation may 

sometimes require a monetary tightening that will lead to a temporary rise in 

unemployment.  And a policy that reduces unemployment may, at times, result in 

inflation that could temporarily rise above its target.  

Communicating the Economic Outlook and Its Policy Implications 

How can we translate the principles embodied in the Committee’s consensus 

statement of longer-run goals and strategy into a concrete plan of action for the current 

situation?  And, having done so, how can we make such a plan understandable to the 

public?  I’ll next illustrate a method I use to help me judge the best plan of action at a 

particular time.  I will then describe the communications tools the Committee is now 

using to explain its strategy and discuss others it is considering to better explain its policy 

decisions to the public.  

In addition to clearly specified goals, concrete recommendations about 

appropriate monetary policy require the specification of a baseline outlook for the 

economy and also a realistic, quantitative model of the economy to assess how monetary 

policy choices affect the likely paths of the FOMC’s goal variables--namely, inflation 

and the unemployment rate.  Figure 1 presents such an outlook, one based on a survey of 

the Federal Reserve’s primary dealers conducted during the week prior to the September 

FOMC meeting.  The baseline paths through 2015 of the unemployment rate and inflation 

shown by the solid black lines in the upper two panels track the median of the dealers’ 

forecasts of these variables.  Beyond 2015, the path assumes that the unemployment rate 

converges over time to 6 percent--the median forecast of the long-run unemployment 

rate, which is the upper end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal
