so, game theorists would point out that the anticipated breakdown of cooperation in the future 

would alter the types of arrangements firms would be willing to enter into in the first place, and 

that this could, in turn, reduce risky behavior and the likelihood that a crisis would occur.   

This is obviously a complex issue, with potentially different conclusions depending on 

the context of a specific regulatory system and industry structure.  But pursuit of this line of 

inquiry might yield notable policy implications.  That is, understanding how a systemic 

resolution mechanism could maintain, reduce, or reverse incentives to engage in what might 

otherwise be socially desirable cooperation could affect the optimal design of that mechanism 

and other elements of financial regulation.   

Market Structure and Externalities  

The third topic I want to mention today is how systemic risk may be affected by the 

interaction of market structure and externalities where firms’ incentives are at odds with social 

efficiency.  The IO literature has identified examples in which, depending on the circumstances, 

concentrated market structures can exacerbate, reduce, or even create new negative externalities.  

While the finance literature has extensively studied externalities associated with various forms of 

intermediation, researchers are only beginning to explore how optimal behavior from a firm’s 

perspective might be shaped by its competitive environment and how, in turn, the aggregation of 

firm decisions in various environments could affect economy-wide risk. 

One particularly promising area for inquiry is the relationship among industry structure, 

firm incentives to diversify risk, and systemic risk.  In principle, larger firms are better able to 

diversify their balance sheets and thereby insulate themselves from idiosyncratic risks.  

However, some researchers have argued that when the financial system is dominated by a few 

large firms, the result may be that these few large firms have balance sheets that are highly
