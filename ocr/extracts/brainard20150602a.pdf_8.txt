most immediate effect appears to be a shift in asset demand toward countries with 

relatively higher expected interest rates, such as the United States. 

Inflation, Employment, and the Implications for Monetary Policy 

Foreign headwinds also appear to be affecting U.S. inflation.  Weak foreign 

demand appears to be the dominant factor driving recent reductions in the prices of some 

non-oil commodities and also likely played some role in last yearâ€™s decline in oil prices, 

although changes in supply are likely the more important driver.   

The stronger dollar is also weighing on U.S. inflation through lower import 

prices.  Non-oil import prices are reported to have declined at an annual rate of 

4-1/2 percent last quarter, and data on trade prices through April suggest a decrease of a 

similar magnitude this quarter.  Based on the share of imports in consumption, 

econometric models imply that falling import prices might subtract about 0.3 percentage 

point from consumer price inflation this year.   

Starting this month, with the end of calendar-based forward guidance, the 

decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding the level of the 

federal funds rate will depend on the evolution of incoming economic data.  While the 

date of liftoff will not be predetermined, the conditions governing the decision to lift off 

have been clearly stated.  First, to have reasonable confidence that inflation will be on 

track to reach its target of 2 percent over the medium term, I will be looking closely at a 

variety of indicators--in particular, signs that core inflation is firming, deflationary 

pressures from abroad are abating, and both survey- and market-based measures of 

inflation expectations are stable.
