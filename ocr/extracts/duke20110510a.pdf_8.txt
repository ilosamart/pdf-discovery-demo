in small business credit and think about potential solutions.  Through this initiative, the 

Federal Reserve sought to deepen its understanding of the dynamics of the supply of and 

demand for small business credit, to identify specific credit gaps, and to learn of 

promising practices and suggestions for improvement.  In the course of just five months, 

the Fed hosted more than 40 meetings around the country and finished with a wrap-up 

forum in Washington, D.C., designed to summarize what we had heard and to plan next 

steps.7  Some of the meetings took the form of small focus groups or listening sessions.  

Other meetings were larger in scale, with more formal agendas focusing on a particular 

aspect of small business financing, such as minority entrepreneurship, the role of 

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), or federal guarantee loan 

programs.  Several meetings focused on a specific industry, such as auto suppliers.  

Whether small or large, all of the meetings brought together small business 

owners, small business trade groups, financial institutions and other private lenders, bank 

supervision officials, CDFIs, and other small business support service providers to 

discuss ways to improve the flow of credit to viable small businesses.  Although the 

information obtained through these meetings was anecdotal in nature, common themes 

did emerge.  And the ability to obtain real-time information directly from lenders and 

potential borrowers has proved invaluable to our understanding of the issues affecting 

credit availability. 

Illustrating the importance of small business access to credit, a compilation of the 

key findings of our outreach effort was included in Chairman Bernanke’s semiannual
