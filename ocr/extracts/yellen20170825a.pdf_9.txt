stress tests.  In addition to contributing to greater loss-absorbing capacity, the CCAR 

improves public understanding of risks at large banking firms, provides a forward-

looking examination of firms’ potential losses during severely adverse economic 

conditions, and has contributed to significant improvements in risk management. 

Reforms have also addressed the risks associated with maturity transformation.  

The fragility created by deposit-like liabilities outside the traditional banking sector has 

been mitigated by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

affecting prime institutional money market funds.  These rules require these prime funds 

to use a floating net asset value, among other changes, a shift that has made these funds 

less attractive as cash-management vehicles.  The changes at money funds have also 

helped reduce banks’ reliance on unsecured short-term wholesale funding, since prime 

institutional funds were significant investors in those bank liabilities.  Liquidity risk at 

large banks has been further mitigated by a new liquidity coverage ratio and a capital 

surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).  The liquidity coverage ratio 

requires that banks hold liquid assets to cover potential net cash outflows over a 30-day 

stress period.  The capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs links the required level of capital for 

the largest banks to their reliance on short-term wholesale funding.11 

While improvements in capital and liquidity regulation will limit the reemergence 

of the risks that grew substantially in the mid-2000s, the failure of Lehman Brothers 

demonstrated how the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a 

                                                 
11 Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, in which supervisors 

analyze the liquidity risks and practices at large banks, has promoted improvements in liquidity-risk 

management.  The U.S. banking agencies also have proposed a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to help 

ensure that large banks have a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon, and we are working toward 

finalization of the NSFR.
