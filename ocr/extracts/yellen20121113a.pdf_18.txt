This path illustrates one of the key features of optimal policy under a balanced 

approach to the dual mandate.  Provided that long-term inflation expectations are firmly 

anchored, the federal funds rate is set to balance the benefits from a faster reduction of 

the unemployment rate against the losses from a temporary and modest increase of 

inflation above 2 percent.  The more rapid reduction in unemployment along the optimal 

control path than in the baseline reflects the stimulus to demand provided by lower 

nominal and real interest rates, higher asset prices, and the expectation of more rapid 

growth in employment and income.19   

The computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously 

complicated, and, as I’ll discuss, it’s challenging to communicate.  It rests on many 

assumptions about the outlook for the economy and its structure.  An alternative and 

much simpler approach would entail setting the federal funds rate according to the 

prescriptions of a policy rule, such as the well-known Taylor rule or a variant.  Many 

studies have shown that, in normal times, when the economy is buffeted by typical 

shocks--not the extraordinary shock resulting from the financial crisis--simple rules can 

come pretty close to approximating optimal policies.  In fact, empirical research suggests 

that a modified version of the original Taylor rule fits the behavior of the Fed reasonably 

well from the late 1980s until the financial crisis.  Given that participants in financial 

markets are familiar with both the FOMC’s historical behavior and simple rules, the 

communications challenges might arguably be less severe if the FOMC followed such a 

                                                 
19 It is also worth noting that the “Exit Strategy Principles” adopted by the FOMC in June 2011 indicate 
that the Committee intends to gradually sell off agency securities to normalize the size and composition of 
its portfolio after liftoff of the federal funds rate.  This assumption pertaining to asset sales is incorporated 
into the FRB/US simulations, and provides a further reason why, along the optimal control path, the federal 
funds rate stays low for so long, rising only gradually after liftoff.
