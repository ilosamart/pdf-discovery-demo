soften their effect on groups of particular concern.24  Nonetheless, the housing issue is 

often politically important, and it could be argued that the political authorities should 

have some representation in discussing measures taken to deal with it.   

This representation can be done as in the British case by having a separate 

committee to make financial stability decisions, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), 

located in the Bank of England, whose membership is different from that of the Monetary 

Policy Committee and on which also sits a nonvoting member from the U.K. Treasury.25  

In the U.S. case, the Financial Stability Oversight Council is a coordinating committee, 

with all of the principal regulators as members and the Secretary of the Treasury as 

chairman.  Because the member regulatory agencies are independent, coordination among 

them--the function of the FSOC--is critical to the financial regulatory system’s success in 

addressing risks to financial stability. 

There are many other models for the governance of the responsibility for financial 

stability.  For instance, in Australia, there is a single integrated prudential regulator, the 

Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, as well as the Council of Financial 

Regulators, whose chair is the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and whose 

members are drawn from the central bank, the prudential authority, the Australian 

Securities and Investments Commission, and the Treasury.  These various approaches 

                                                 
24 The use of the federal funds rate also affects particular sectors more than others--but that effect is 
softened by being spread over the entire economy. 
25 A few of the members--namely, the governor and deputy governors of the Bank of England--are on both 
the Monetary Policy Committee and the FPC, but the remaining members do not overlap.  The FPC 
members are the governor, three of the deputy governors, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct 
Authority, the bank’s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, four external members 
appointed by the chancellor, and a nonvoting representative of the Treasury.  The current membership of 
the FPC is available on the Bank of England’s website at
