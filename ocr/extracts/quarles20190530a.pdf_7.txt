severe strains in corporate debt markets, exploring the resilience of the participating 

banks to the risks associated with the increase in business borrowing. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve monitors a wide range of indicators for signs of 

potential risks to financial stability that may merit a policy response, and we now publish 

a summary of this monitoring in our semiannual Financial Stability Report.  If 

vulnerabilities are identified as being meaningfully above normal, the Federal Reserve 

can require large banks to increase their loss-absorbing capacity through increases in the 

CCyB.6  

Despite all of these efforts, we understand that these tools have limitations.  First, 

central bankers’ experience with macroprudential tools, including the CCyB, is limited.  

Second, regulation and macropudential tools can reduce economic efficiency and hamper 

economic growth by limiting the ability of the market to allocate financial resources.  For 

this reason, the Federal Reserve has been evaluating ways in which our supervisory and 

financial stability goals can be achieved more efficiently, and it has been participating in 

global efforts to evaluate the effects of reforms under the auspices of the Financial 

Stability Board.  Third, macroprudential policies that are targeted to banks may create an 

incentive for financial intermediation to migrate outside of the regulated banking system.  

The vulnerabilities may still emerge, albeit elsewhere in the financial system—perhaps in 

institutions or structures that are less stable and resilient than our banks.  In part reflecting 

                                                 
6 CCyB also builds financial-sector resilience during periods when financial vulnerabilities are high and 
there is a risk of potential losses within the banking sector that could strain the supply of credit.  
Furthermore, the CCyB might be a more effective tool than monetary policy to mitigate financial 
vulnerabilities, as the benefits are comparable to those of using monetary policy while the costs are an 
order of magnitude smaller.
