It is a pleasure to speak at this commemoration of 20 years of Bank of England 

monetary policy independence.  In my remarks today, I will consider how central 

banking in the United Kingdom and the United States has evolved in response to the 

challenges of recent years.  I will address a limited set of topics and will have time to

These remarks are divided into three parts.  In the first part, I will discuss several 

aspects of aggregate monetary policy:  central bank independence, policy transparency,

two banks to their lender-of-last-resort function.  And, third, I will close with brief 

reflections on the central bank’s responsibility for financial stability.
