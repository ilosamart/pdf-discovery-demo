5. Since I have covered sociology, I might as well cover political science as well.  

In regard to politics, I have always liked Lily Tomlin’s line, in paraphrase:  “I 

try to be cynical, but I just can’t keep up.”  We all feel that way some time.  

Actually, having been in Washington now for almost 11 years, as I mentioned, 

I feel that way quite a bit.  Ultimately, though, cynicism is a poor substitute 

for critical thought and constructive action.  Sure, interests and money and 

ideology all matter, as you learned in political science.  But my experience is 

that most of our politicians and policymakers are trying to do the right thing, 

according to their own consciences, most of the time.  If you think that the bad 

or indifferent results that too often come out of Washington are due to base 

motives and bad intentions, you are giving politicians and policymakers way 

too much credit for being effective.  Honest error in the face of complex and 

possibly intractable problems is a far more important source of bad results 

than are bad motives.  For these reasons, the greatest forces in Washington are 

ideas, and people prepared to act on those ideas.  Public service isn’t easy.  

But, in the end, if you are inclined in that direction, it is a worthy and 

challenging pursuit. 


6. Having given you the essence of sociology and political science, let me wrap 

up economics while I’m at it.  Economics is a highly sophisticated field of 

thought that is superb at explaining to policymakers precisely why the choices 

they made in the past were wrong.  About the future, not so much.  However,
