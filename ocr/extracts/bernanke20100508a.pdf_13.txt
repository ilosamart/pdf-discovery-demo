evening.  As they rode, Lincoln told the friend that he believed in what economists would 

call the utility-maximizing theory of behavior, that people always act so as to maximize 

their own happiness, and for no other reason.  Just then, the carriage crossed a bridge, and 

Lincoln saw a pig stuck in the muddy riverbank.  Telling the carriage driver to stop, 

Lincoln struggled through the rain and mud, picked up the pig, and carried it to safety.  

When the muddy Lincoln returned to the carriage, his friend naturally pointed out that he 

had just disproved his own hypothesis by putting himself to great trouble and discomfort 

to save a pig.  “Not at all,” said Lincoln.  “What I did is perfectly consistent with my 

theory.  If I hadn’t saved that pig, I would have felt terrible.” 

The story points out that, sometimes, happiness is nature’s way of telling us we 

are doing the right thing.  True.  But, by the same token, ephemeral feelings of happiness 

are not always reliable indicators we are on the right path.  Ultimately, life satisfaction 

requires more than just happiness.  Sometimes, difficult choices can open the doors to 

future opportunities, and the short-run pain can be worth the long-run gain.  Just as 

importantly, life satisfaction requires an ethical framework.  Everyone needs such a 

framework.  In the short run, it is possible that doing the ethical thing will make you feel, 

well, unhappy.  In the long run, though, it is essential for a well-balanced and satisfying 

life. 

Thank you for this opportunity to address you.  This is an exciting day for the 

graduates and their families.  I congratulate you on your accomplishment and wish you 

the best in the next stage of your lives.
