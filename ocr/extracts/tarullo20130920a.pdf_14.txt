account these costs.  Thus, the aim of financial stability capital standards is to reduce 

further the probability that the firm might fail under stress through a requirement to hold 

additional capital.  These additional capital requirements can also help offset any funding 

advantage derived from the perceived status of such institutions as too-big-to-fail.  

In acting on this rationale for capital standards to mitigate risks to financial 

stability, we first sought to ensure that there would be an international initiative to 

develop financial stability capital standards for global systemically important financial 

institutions.  The Basel Committee, an international body of supervisors that includes the 

U. S. banking agencies, took up this agenda and developed a framework covering more 

than two dozen large financial firms from around the world.  Later this year, we will issue 

under the authority granted by Dodd-Frank a proposed set of capital surcharges congruent 

with that framework.  

The task of determining how much additional capital is needed to reduce the 

probability of a systemically important firm’s failure to more acceptable levels is not a 

straightforward one.  In calibrating the surcharge, the Basel Committee, with a good bit 

of input from the Federal Reserve, began with what has been termed the “expected 

impact” approach, which calls for additional capital to reduce the probability of the firm’s 

failure sufficiently to equalize the expected impact on the financial system of the failure 

of a systemically important firm and the failure of a banking firm just outside systemic 

status.

  But implementing this concept is complicated by the fact that, despite some very 

useful metrics that have been developed in the past few years for measuring the systemic

 For example, if the loss to the financial system from the failure of a systemically important firm would be 

five times that resulting from failure of the non-systemic firm, then the firm would have to hold additional 

capital sufficient to make the expected probability of failure one-fifth that of the non-systemic institution.
