From a competitive equity standpoint, we believe that U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks 

should operate on a level playing field with their domestic counterparts.  This is generally 

consistent with the long-standing treatment of large and complex bank and nonbank subsidiaries 

around the world.   

As such, our rules subject a large foreign bank to the same capital and liquidity 

requirements as domestic bank holding companies by requiring the foreign bank to hold its U.S. 

subsidiaries through a U.S. intermediate holding company (IHC) and imposing capital and 

liquidity requirements to the IHC.  At the same time, we have adjusted our approach for the U.S. 

branches of a foreign bank with a large U.S. presence in recognition that branches are subject to 

a narrower set of permissible activities and operate as a direct extension of the parent bank.  For 

these U.S. branches, we have imposed local liquidity requirements in light of the liquidity 

vulnerabilities that many U.S. branches of foreign banks experienced in the crisis, but no 

separate capital requirements.   

For IHCs that are subsidiaries of foreign-owned G-SIBs, the Federal Reserve requires 

such a firm to issue a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments to its foreign parent, 

known as internal TLAC, including a minimum amount of unsecured long-term debt.6  In the 

event that an IHC was experiencing significant financial distress, the internal TLAC could be 

used to replenish the IHCâ€™s equity and maintain its solvency.  The U.S. implementation of 

internal TLAC is modeled on the internal TLAC framework developed by the Financial Stability 

Board (FSB), which includes a calibration of the amount of loss-absorbing resources that should
