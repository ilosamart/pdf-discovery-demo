with risk-based constraints and stress tests regulating capital at both the operating and 

holding company levels--this improvement in incentives is obtained with virtually no 

change in the overall capital requirements of the affected firms.  Federal Reserve staff 

estimate the proposal would potentially reduce capital requirements across the eight large 

banks subject to the proposal by $400 million, or 0.04 percent of the $955 billion in 

capital these banks held as of September 2017.2  So this recalibration is a win-win:  a 

material realignment of incentives to reduce a regulatory encouragement to take on risk at 

a time when we want to encourage prudent behavior without any material capital 

reduction or cost to the system’s resiliency.  Taken together, I believe these new rules 

will maintain the resiliency of the financial system and make our regulation simpler and 

more risk sensitive. 

Liquidity Regulations  

Let me now back up to the time just before the financial crisis and briefly describe 

the genesis of liquidity regulations for banks.  Banking organizations play a vital role in 

the economy in serving the financial needs of U.S. households and businesses.  They 

perform this function in part through the mechanism of maturity transformation--that is, 

taking in short-term deposits, thereby making a form of short-term, liquid investments 

available to households and businesses, while providing longer-term credit to these same 

entities.  This role, however, makes banking firms vulnerable to the potential for rapid, 

broad-based outflows of their funding (a so-called run), and these institutions must 

                                                 
2 Required capital at the bank subsidiaries of these firms would be reduced by larger amounts--and would 
only allow the firm to move that capital to different subsidiaries within the firm—but, more importantly, 
the overall capital regime prevents this capital from being distributed out of the banking organization as a 
whole except in this de minimis amount.  Thus, the overall organization retains the same capital levels 
without the structure of capital regulation creating an incentive to add risk to the system.
