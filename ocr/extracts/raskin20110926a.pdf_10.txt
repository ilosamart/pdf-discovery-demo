San Francisco suggests that a similar policy put in place in 1961 had effects on longer-

Another significant policy action taken at last week’s FOMC meeting is that the 

principal payments from our holdings of agency securities will now be reinvested in 

agency MBS rather than in Treasury securities.  Our announcement appears to have been 

successful in narrowing the spread between rates on agency MBS and Treasury securities 

of comparable maturity.  That spread had widened substantially since earlier this year, 

and the continuation of such a trend could have pushed up mortgage rates and adversely 

affected the housing sector.   

Potential Attenuating Factors 

In my judgment, the Federal Reserve’s deployment of our policy tools has been 

completely appropriate in promoting maximum employment and price stability.  Ideally, 

such policy decisions would be informed by precise quantitative information about the 

effects of each tool.  In reality, however, the estimated effects of the FOMC’s policy 

actions are subject to considerable uncertainty.  Such uncertainty is intrinsic to real-world 

monetary policymaking at any time but is particularly relevant under circumstances 

where the scope for conventional monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound 

on the federal funds rate, leaving unconventional tools as the only means of providing 

further monetary accommodation.   

Although these monetary policy tools have been successful in pushing down 

interest rates across the maturity spectrum, the magnitude of the transmission to
