sufficient expertise to thoroughly check out a vendor and monitor its performance.   

Beyond consumer compliance supervision, the Federal Reserve has expanded our 

ability to conduct more of the work of bank examinations off site.  If banks have 

electronic loan records, it is possible for examiners to assess loan quality and underwriting 

practices remotely, spending much less time on site.  This approach has the potential to 

improve examination efficiency and to reduce the examination-related disruption to 

banking operations.  However, if banks prefer more face-to-face interaction with 

examiners--and there are banks that do--we will continue the traditional on-site review. 

Our efforts to further tailor bank supervision at community banks continue.  Staff 

members from the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and

called for in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA).  

We are still in the midst of this effort, which is being conducted with a broad mandate to 

identify and revise where possible outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome 

regulations, including those that apply to community banks.  The agencies are carefully 

considering public comments.  Although some burden-reducing measures may require 

congressional action, the agencies will act to implement regulatory relief when possible 

before the end of the EGRPRA review period.  The results of our EGRPRA review will be 

included in the agenciesâ€™ joint report to the Congress. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve System has expanded our economic research into 

issues of consequence to community banks and has worked to encourage similar research 

efforts at academic institutions.  Several years ago, a group of economists from across the
