like size caps.  And indeed, if we were faced with a static, once-and-for-all decision, I don’t 

think economic reasoning alone could give us a definitive answer as to whether caps should be 

preferred to capital surcharges.  This ambiguity is in some sense the central message of 

Weitzman’s original analysis.   

One way to resolve this tension is to refrain from putting ourselves in the position of 

having to make a once-and-for-all decision in a setting of substantial uncertainty.  Rather, it 

might be preferable to try to learn from the incoming data and adjust over time, particularly since 

the recent changes to capital regulation already on the books may represent an informative 

experiment.  In my view, this observation about the potential for learning tips the balance in 

favor of capital surcharges.  For example, the capital-surcharge schedule proposed by the Basel 

Committee for globally important systemic banks may be a reasonable starting point.  However, 

if after some time it has not delivered much of a change in the size and complexity of the largest 

of banks, one might conclude that the implicit tax was too small, and should be ratcheted up.

In principle, this turning-up-the-dials approach feels to me like the right way to go:  It retains the 

flexibility that makes price-based regulation attractive, while mitigating the risk that the implicit 

tax rate will be set too low.  Of course, I recognize that its gradualist nature presents practical 

challenges, not least of which is sustaining a level of regulatory commitment and resolve 

sufficient to keep the dials turning so long as this is the right thing to do. 

Before wrapping up, let me briefly mention another piece of the puzzle that I think is 

sometimes overlooked, but strikes me as having the potential to play an important 

complementary role in efforts to address the TBTF problem--namely, corporate governance.  

Suppose we do everything right with respect to capital regulation, and set up a system of capital

 Again, it should be emphasized that the underlying problem is not simply an institution’s size, but rather its 

systemic footprint--which in addition to sheer size, is related to its complexity, interconnectedness, and global span 

of operations.
