In contrast, community banks that moved beyond their traditional business model and 

entered unfamiliar or more complex lines or markets experienced difficulties.  For example, 

small banks that turned to a more transactional model and funded construction loans, often 

outside of their local markets, with borrowings rather than core deposits were more likely to fail.  

This experience helps explain why our supervisory intensity will often increase for banks, 

including community banks, that embark upon unfamiliar activities. 

A similar pattern obtains in the Federal Reserve’s supervision of consumer compliance in 

community banks.  It is axiomatic that all financial consumers deserve the same protection, 

whether they are doing business with a very large bank, a regional bank, or a community bank.  

But community banks do not have large systems with hundreds or thousands of employees in 

contact with consumers on a daily basis.  So, while the substantive goals of consumer protection 

remain the same across banks, the way in which we check compliance at community banks takes 

account, again, of their size, less complex structure, and business model.  These characteristics of 

community banks informed the revisions to our risk-focused consumer compliance supervision 

framework, which was implemented in January 2014.4   

Under the revised program, examination intensity is explicitly based on an individual 

community bank’s risk profile, including its consumer compliance culture and how effectively it 

identifies and manages consumer compliance risk.  Examiners do more comprehensive risk 

assessments before they arrive on site, permitting them to focus on areas of higher risk at 

individual banks.  The program also calls for examiners to spend less time on low-risk 

compliance issues at community banks.  Of course, in cases where a firm’s risk profile is high or 

an international context, see Franco Fiordelisi, Stefano Monferra, and Gabriele Sampagnaro (2014), “Relationship 
Lending and Credit Quality,” Journal of Financial Services Research, vol. 46, pp. 295–315.
