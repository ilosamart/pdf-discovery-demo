Second, and a direct corollary of the first, imposing the tax at the level of the 

intermediary naturally raises the question of disintermediation.  In other words, might the 

SFT market respond to the tax by evolving so that large hedge funds are more readily 

able to borrow via repo directly from money market funds and securities lenders, without 

having to go through broker-dealers?  I can’t say that I have a good understanding of the 

institutional factors that might facilitate or impede such an evolution. But if the market 

ultimately does evolve in this way, it would be hard to argue that the underlying fire-sales 

problem has been addressed.  

2. Modified liquidity regulation 

A conceptually similar way to get at matched-book repo would be to modify 

liquidity regulation so as to introduce an asymmetry between the assumed liquidity 

properties of repo loans made by a broker-dealer, and its own repo borrowing.  For 

example, in the context of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), one could assume that a 

dealer’s repo loans to a hedge fund roll off more slowly than do its own repo borrowings 

from the triparty market.  This assumption would create a net liquidity exposure for a 

matched repo book, and would thereby force the dealer to hold some long-term debt or 

other stable funding against it.  Although the implementation is different, the end result is 

quite close to that obtained with the capital-surcharge approach I just described: in one 

case, there is a broad stable funding requirement for intermediaries against a matched 

repo book; in the other case, there is an equity requirement.  It follows that, whatever its 

other advantages, going the modified-NSFR route does not eliminate concerns about 

disintermediation and regulatory arbitrage.
