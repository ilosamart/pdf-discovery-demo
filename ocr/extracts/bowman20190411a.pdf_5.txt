and five emergency evacuations of Montecito, California.11 Within 24 hours of the wildfires and 

mudslides, the community bank declared an emergency and began executing its disaster response 

strategy.12 The bank used a wide range of communication channels, from Facebook to text 

messaging, to keep in touch with its employees and its customers. It created a disaster assistance 

package for personal and small business borrowers. The bank offered new lines of credit 

(including a 24-hour turnaround on small business lines). It made payment deferrals on already-

existing loans and provided free safe deposit boxes. The bank even delivered more than 15,000 

water bottles and offered more than 1,500 respirators for local residents at its branches.  

Small businesses value that level of commitment to local customers.  And they recognize 

the benefits of working with local community banks that understand their regions and businesses. 

The relationship-based nature of community bank lending helps small businesses that often lack 

the detailed balance sheets or detailed income statements required by larger banks.13 Even when 

small businesses do have the right paperwork, large banks are still less likely to engage in 

lending at small bank levels. That’s because the transaction costs for underwriting a $100,000 

loan are comparable to a $1 million loan. None of this is lost on small businesses, which, 

according to the Federal Reserve’s Small Business Credit Survey, continue to express greater 

satisfaction with small banks compared to both big banks and fintech lenders.14
