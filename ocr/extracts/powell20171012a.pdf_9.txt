outside of China.10  What this shock would do to debt-at-risk is shown by the red 

cross-hatched portions of the bars in the chart.  But it would be a bigger deal if the rise in 

borrowing costs was accompanied by a more generalized adverse turn of events in EMEs, 

modeled here as a 20 percent earnings reduction and a 20 percent hit to the value of EME 

currencies against the dollar.  The estimated effects of these additional shocks on debt-at-

risk are shown by the slashed red portions of the bars.11  In this case, aggregate EME 

debt-at-risk rises from about 30 percent of GDP to around the level seen prior to the 

Asian financial crisis.12  Notably, the increase comes mainly from China, where 

debt-at-risk jumps to about 85 percent of GDP.  Outside of China, risky debt also rises 

substantially but seemingly not to levels that would be considered unmanageable.   

Overall, based on this analysis, I would conclude that corporate debt represents a 

moderate degree of vulnerability for EME prospects.  The situation is not alarming, but 

risks are significant and bear close watching, especially in China.   

The Evolution of Federal Reserve Policy  

What of the evolution of monetary conditions in the advanced economies?  I will 

confine myself here to Fed policy.  One factor that favors easier adjustment in EMEs is 

                                                 
10 A 1 percentage point positive shock to the borrowing costs of EME corporates undoes about half of the 
decline in average borrowing costs from 2009 to 2016.  Although on the face of it, this shock does not seem 
too large, as discussed in Beltran and others (2017), it is applied to the average interest rate on the entire 
existing debt, not just on new debt.  Given that the average interest rate for EME firms is about 
4-3/4 percent, a 1 percentage point rise increases the interest expense by about a fifth.   
11 The calibration of the shocks is the same as in Beltran and others (2017).  A 20 percent earnings shock 
corresponds to about half of the decline in EME corporate earnings experienced after the global financial 
crisis.  It is difficult to say how much emerging market currencies might depreciate under stress, but 
20 percent currency depreciation seems well within the plausible range.  While the calibration of the shocks 
is the same as the above-mentioned study, the effects have been updated to reflect a larger sample of firms 
that is now available.  Qualitatively, the results and conclusions do not change from this update.   
12 In computing the new debt-at-risk after exchange rate shocks, we need the share of debt that is foreign 
currency-denominated, which is taken from Ayala, Nedelijkovic, and Saborowski (2015).
