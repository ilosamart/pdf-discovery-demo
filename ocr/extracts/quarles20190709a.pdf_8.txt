our qualitative assessment reflects the experience of the past 10 years of stress testing, 

and in particular, the great improvement in risk management by large banks and the 

cumulative effect of the Fed’s improved supervision of large institutions.  As I said 

earlier, for stress testing to remain effective, it must respond to changes in the economy, 

the financial system, and risk-management capabilities. 

The changes to CCAR have occurred in the context of a similarly dramatic 

improvement in the strength and resilience of the financial system.  The firms have more 

than doubled their capital since the first round of stress tests in 2009.  Since that time, the 

common equity of the largest 18 firms has increased by more than $650 billion. 

Let me now turn to the most recent changes to CCAR and stress testing and put 

them in the context of the history I have just related.  Congress revisited large bank 

supervision last year in S. 2155, yet the legislation it passed reaffirmed the important role 

of stress testing.  This shouldn’t be surprising, because the experience of stress testing 

over the last 10 years has demonstrated that it is a highly useful element of large bank 

supervision and the promotion of financial stability. 

Something else that shouldn’t be surprising is that this experience has revealed 

that periodic stress testing has turned out to be a less useful supervisory tool to evaluate 

the risks of smaller and less complex financial institutions.  Congress made use of this 

experience by raising the threshold for stress testing to $100 billion in assets and 

providing more flexibility for the Fed to tailor stress testing for all firms.  This step has, 

once again, advanced the principles demonstrated in the first stress test and ever since.  It 

has increased transparency because incorporating and disclosing what we have learned 

about the varying effectiveness of stress testing at different types of institutions is making
