provided a net boost to the global economy.  Indeed, the large rise in U.S. bond yields 

during this episode precipitated a nearly commensurate rise in interest rates in many 

foreign economies and caused the prices of risky assets to fall globally.  EMEs with weak 

fundamentals experienced sharp capital outflows, an abrupt tightening of financial 

conditions, and large exchange rate depreciations.9  The EME experience in 2013 seemed 

reminiscent of past episodes of U.S. tightening--including in the 1980s and again in the 

mid-1990s--that had sizable adverse spillovers to EMEs, particularly in Latin America. 

I am reasonably optimistic that the spillovers from ongoing U.S. normalization 

will be manageable for the foreign economies, including the EMEs.  While there will 

almost inevitably be some bumps along the road, there are a number of reasons why I 

think that that policy normalization will not cause sizable disruptions for our trading 

partners: 

• First, the Fed will remove accommodation only in response to an outlook for 

improving economic conditions and firming inflation.  The stronger U.S. 

economy and associated improvements in business and consumer confidence 

should support recoveries abroad through both trade and financial channels and 

lessen perceptions of downside risks to the global recovery.    

• Second, central banks in the advanced foreign economies--and in the EMEs with 

stronger fundamentals--should be able to mitigate an undesirable tightening of 

their own financial conditions through appropriate policy actions.  An important 

lesson of the taper tantrum was that effective communications and actions by 

major central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of
