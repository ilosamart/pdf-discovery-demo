price inflation.  At a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely 

to be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to 

consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for 

some prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could 

increase the labor force and boost economic activity.  

More broadly, when a person who was previously unemployed or discouraged 

secures a job, not only does it boost the economy, but that person also may gain a greater 

sense of economic security, self-sufficiency, and self-worth and be better able to invest in 

their family’s future.  With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that 

inhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may better grasp how 

much these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much 

targeted intervention is required through other policy means.4   

There is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth 

rate and equality of opportunity.  Large disparities in opportunity based on race, ethnicity, 

gender, or geography mean that the enterprise, exertion, and investments of households 

and businesses from different groups are not rewarded commensurately.  To the extent 

that disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect 

such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged 

groups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth 

will fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.5
