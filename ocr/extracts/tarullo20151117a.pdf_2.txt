 The financial crisis highlighted two major vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system.  

First was the magnitude of the too-big-to-fail problem.  Second was the size and fragility of the 

so-called shadow banking system and the extent to which shadow banking activities not subject 

to prudential regulation were integrated with the regulated banking sector.  In the intervening 

years, much has been done to address too-big-to-fail.  With regard to shadow banking concerns, 

the specific forms related to mortgage lending that linked the regulated and unregulated sectors, 

such as the notorious structured investment vehicles (SIVs), collapsed during the crisis.  Changes 

in capital, accounting, and other regulatory standards make these arrangements very unlikely to 

reappear.  Moreover, the kind of very large nonbank financial firms whose failures deepened the 

crisis are now subject to consolidated prudential regulation and supervision.  So, in a quite direct 

sense, the answer to the question posed by this conference of whether we are safer than before 

the crisis is easy to answer in the affirmative. 

 Of course, “safer” does not necessarily mean safe enough.  With respect to the largest 

banks, we continue to pursue the aim of promoting orderly resolution through evaluation of their 

resolution plans and through a long-term debt requirement, as proposed a few weeks ago.  In 

addition, the banking agencies will be proposing a net stable funding ratio rule, aimed at assuring 

adequate medium-term liquidity, in the next few months.  And the Federal Reserve is currently 

engaged in a review of its annual stress testing and capital planning exercises, one goal of which 

is to reflect better the range of risks confronted by these institutions. 

 With respect to shadow banking, the subject of my remarks today, the circumstances are 

somewhat different.  While the specific pre-crisis linkages to the regulated sector have been 

removed or better regulated, the possibility of other connections remains.  More generally, risks 

to financial stability may arise anew from activities mostly or completely outside the ambit of
