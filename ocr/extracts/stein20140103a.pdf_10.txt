The Model 

We have developed a simple model to try to make these ideas precise and to flesh 

out further empirical implications.  I won’t try to walk you through it in all of its detail, 

but I will try to give you a flavor for the basic structure and the main results.

The model has three dates--0, 1, and 2--with a timeline illustrated in figure 3.  

There is a collection of different long-lived fixed-income assets indexed by i.  The 

payoffs on these assets are all perfectly correlated.  In particular, each asset i pays off R at 

time 2 if the aggregate state of the world is such that there has been no default, and it 

pays off a lower amount, zi, if there has been a default.  At time 1, there is an interim 

news event.  With probability p, the news is good, which means that all assets will 

definitely not default at time 2.  And with probability (1 - p), the news is bad, which 

means that there is a subsequent probability of default on all assets of (1 - q) at time 2.  

Thus, in the bad-news state at time 1, the fundamental value of asset i is Fi = qR +  

(1 - q)zi.  However, if there is bad news at time 1, the market value of asset i will be 

depressed by a temporary fire-sale effect and will be given by kiFi ≤Fi.  The value of ki is 

endogenous and asset specific in our model and depends on the equilibrium quantity of 

asset i that is liquidated at time 1; I will return to this feature momentarily. 

Household preferences are as follows:  Households are risk neutral over 

fluctuations in their consumption.  However, they derive additional utility--which can be 

thought of as transactions services--from holding completely safe claims, since these 

claims can be used in a money-like fashion.  The upshot of these assumptions is that 

households require a fixed rate of return on any risky claims, no matter how risky, but a

 The basic structure of the model is very similar to that in Stein (2012).
