Technological and Organizational Changes in Payment, Clearing, and Settlement  

Today, I will focus on newly emerging distributed ledger technologies and related 

protocols, which were inspired originally by Bitcoin, and their potentially important 

applications to payment, clearing, and settlement in the wholesale markets. 

Successive waves of technological advance have swept through payment, 

clearing, and settlement over the past two centuries.  In the 19th century, railroads and the 

telegraph helped improve speed and logistics.  In the second half of the 20th century, 

computers were introduced to deal with the clearing of overwhelming volumes of paper 

checks and stock certificates stimulated by post-war growth.  Starting at about the same 

time and continuing through today, new electronic networks have been established to 

allow high-speed computerized financial communication.  As automation has evolved, 

payment, clearing, and settlement systems have been developed for conducting and 

processing transactions within and between firms.  However, many of these systems have 

historically operated in silos, which can be hard to streamline or replace.  In some areas, 

business processes may still rely heavily on manual or semi-automated procedures. 

 Over time, banks and other firms have organized various types of clearinghouses 

to coordinate clearing and settlement activities in order to reduce costs and risks.  The 

adoption of multilateral clearing in the United States was a key organizational innovation 

that began with the founding of the New York Clearing House in the 1850s.  This led to 

notable efficiencies and risk reduction in the clearing of checks.  Multilateral clearing 

was also used early on to improve clearing in the securities and derivatives markets.  By 

the 1970s, the United States turned to technologies based on the centralized custody and 

clearing of book-entry securities in order to respond to the paperwork crisis in the
