moral and economic imperative that must be the driving purpose that unifies and 

animates our efforts.  Indeed, the high road demands that we become effective 

institutional innovators for positive changes in our communities and for housing practices 

that promote community well-being.  When we traveled the low road, the only question 

was:  Will this practice make me rich?  Taking the high road means we continually ask:   

Do our financial and legal arrangements contribute to the public welfare and the common 

good?   

 Yes, our economy has started to rebound, but we need a strong housing market in 

order to ensure a complete, stable, and sustainable recovery.  The meltdown in the 

housing sector set off our economic crisis, and the reconstruction of the housing sector 

will help bring it to a close.  Each of you has a role to play in this mission, and I urge you 

to embrace this challenge and to do your part to contribute to the economic rebuilding of 

our country. 

 Thank you.
