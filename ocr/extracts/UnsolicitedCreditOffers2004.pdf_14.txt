WHY MANY CREDITORS AND INSURERS USE PRESCREENING 

Many companies have found that prescreening improves marketing efficiency. 
Companies using prescreening have found that it facilitates the solicitation process by 
limiting solicitations to those consumers who satisfy the established credit criteria, 
reducing account acquisition costs for creditors and insurers. For example, prescreening 
allows many creditors and insurers to avoid the cost of sending solicitations to large 
numbers of consumers who ultimately would not qualify for the credit or insurance 
products being offered. Likewise, prescreening allows many creditors and insurers to 
reduce the number of responses that they must reject and the related costs of providing 
required rejection letters and dealing with those who may be dissatisfied. 

Also, creditors and insurers have found that by having access to credit record information 
at the prescreening phase, they are better able to control certain risks relating to the 
offering of their products. For example, by prescreening, a creditor or insurer can use the 
information in a credit file twice, once to select prospective customers, and a second 
time, if the prospect replies, to verify that no substantive change has occurred in the 
individualâ€™s credit status. Having information about the consumer at two points in time 
increases the predictability of risk involving that consumer. 

As discussed below, in a competitive market, these market efficiencies and better control 
of risks result in lower prices, more product choices, and wider credit and insurance 
availability to consumers, including those traditionally underserved. Consumers further 
benefit by the receipt of fewer solicitations that do not match their credit or insurance 
circumstances.
