number of changes already made by banking agencies.  There will be increased emphasis on 

market discipline, liquidity regulation, activities restrictions, and more effective supervision.  But 

the crisis reinforces the point that robust capital requirements should continue to be a central 

component of the financial regulatory system.  The U.S. banking agencies, and most of our 

counterparts from countries represented in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, made 

strengthening the capital regime a high priority in the latest financial reform agenda. 

Basel III makes a number of important changes to address deficiencies in the pre-crisis 

capital rules:   

First, reflecting both intuitive good sense and market realities during the crisis, Basel III 

creates a new minimum common equity capital requirement.  Moreover, the agreement provides 

a definition of common equity that will prevent firms or national regulators from including in the 

calculation of common equity certain assets that could dilute its loss-absorbing character. 

Second, the minimum common equity ratio will be set at 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, 

with an additional requirement for a 2.5% “conservation buffer.”   The minimum ratio should be 

understood as defining the amount of common equity needed for a firm to be regarded as a 

viable financial intermediary.  The conservation buffer is a new feature of capital regulation, 

intended specifically to reflect the losses that a firm may suffer during periods of financial stress. 

Thus the concept behind the two-level requirement is that a banking organization should 

be able to withstand losses associated with systemic stress and still be a viable financial 

intermediary.  This concept is comparable to the approach we adopted during the Supervisory 

Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in early 2009.  There, you may recall, we used a special 

stress test to provide a rough estimate of losses that the large banking organizations could face in
