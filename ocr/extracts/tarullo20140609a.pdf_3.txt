First, it has long been recognized that the unique features of deposit-taking financial 

institutions raise the question whether generally applicable corporate law and governance 

principles are adequate.  Because banks are financial intermediaries that use deposits to provide 

much, if not most, of the funding for their lending, an insolvent bank may well be unable to 

satisfy all its deposit liabilities.  The fear of this possibility lies at the heart of banking runs and 

panics.  In the days before federal deposit insurance, the impracticality of contractual solutions to 

reduce the vulnerability of depositors led to a variant of normally applicable limited liability 

rules.  Many states enacted so-called double liability rules, whereby shareholders could be liable 

for the losses of a failed bank in an amount equal, and in addition, to their investment in the 

bank.  Presumably, these rules were intended to change the calculus of shareholders as to the 

risks they wished their banks to assume and, perhaps, the degree to which they monitored 

management. 

Following the creation of federal deposit insurance, a series of constraints on normal 

corporate prerogatives has been applied to insured institutions, justified in large part by the need 

to counteract the resulting moral hazard and to protect the federal deposit insurance fund (DIF).  

Bank charters have always differed from general corporate charters insofar as they grant special 

privileges and forbid certain activities by the chartered institutions.  In addition, special 

prudential requirements have always applied to chartered banks.  Perhaps the most important of
