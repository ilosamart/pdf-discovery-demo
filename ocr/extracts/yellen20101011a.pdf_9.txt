institutions held mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, or positions in mortgage-related 

derivatives.  The result was the massive vulnerability of the financial system to a collapse 

of housing prices.  What seemed like moderate risks taken by individual institutions 

ultimately led to an enormous risk to the system as a whole.   

A third element is the extraordinary interconnectedness and complexity within the 

financial system.  The intricate and opaque web of connections among financial players 

multiplies the dangers of contagion in the form of lost confidence, frozen liquidity, fire 

sales, and domino effects.4  A key factor in this channel of systemic risk is the 

institutional arrangements in payment, clearing, and settlement systems.  For example, 

weaknesses in the market infrastructure for repurchase agreements, or repos, and over-

the-counter derivatives intensified the crisis.5   

Systemic risk reflects the confluence of factors that may grow slowly over years. 

Therefore, surveillance must look at a variety of indicators and be forward looking, 

considering the paths of factors that influence such risk for years to come.  To facilitate 

timely recognition of the emergence of systemic risk, we should design quantifiable 

indicators related to the three elements I just outlined:  risk buildup at systemically 

important institutions and within the financial sector more broadly, positive correlations 

of risk among financial market participants, and interconnectedness among those 

participants.
