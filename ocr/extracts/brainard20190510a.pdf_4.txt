households, particularly those with low and moderate income, on an annual basis.5  These

Wealth across Households 

Let us start by taking a look at how the wealth of middle-income households has 

evolved over recent years.6  Over the past three decades, the wealth of middle-income 

households increased an average of about 1 percent per year, adjusted for inflation (figure 

1).7  That compares with average annual growth of 2.6 percent in real gross domestic 

income over this period.  By comparison, the average wealth of the households in the top 

decile of the income distribution has increased three times faster per year, on average, 

than the wealth of middle-income households, more than doubling over the period as a 

whole.   

The past decade is even more sobering.  Middle-income families still have not 

fully recovered the wealth they lost in the Great Recession.  On average, households at all 

levels of income lost wealth as a result of the declines in asset prices and rise in 

unemployment during the crisis (figure 2).  But the recovery in wealth since the Great 

Recession has been much less for middle- and lower-income households than for higher-

income households.  The wealth of the top 10 percent of households is 19 percent higher

6 The published data set includes data on the distribution of nominal wealth by wealth percentiles.  For this 
speech, Board staff analyzed the data, with the wealth distribution by income percentiles and other 
demographic categories.  Wealth and all of its subcomponents are reported here in 2018 dollars using the 
personal consumption expenditures price index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see table 1.1.4, 
which is available at https://www.bea.gov).  Wealth is defined as the sum of assets, including financial and 
nonfinancial assets, net of liabilities, including mortgages, consumer debt, and other liabilities. 
7 Income groups at each point in time are defined here using current household income.  Specific 
households may move across income groups over time.  Since households in the high-income group during 
their working years may, in retirement, move to low- or middle-income groups, some of the wealth 
assigned to low- or middle-income groups in this analysis comes from households with high lifetime 
income.
