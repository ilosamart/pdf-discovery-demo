Further ahead lies the answer to the question of whether developments in the 

global economy will permit the continuation of the export-centered growth strategy that 

underlies the Asian miracle or whether we will later conclude that this period, the period 

after the Great Recession and the global financial crisis, marked the beginning of a new 

phase in the economic history of the modern global economy.7  Either way, the question 

of the economic future of India is of major importance not only to the 18 percent of the 

worldâ€™s population that lives in India, but also to the other 82 percent of the global 

population.   

At a more structural level are three recent developments whose potential 

importance is currently difficult to assess: the setting up of the Asian Infrastructure 

Investment Bank; the likely inclusion of the Chinese yuan in the Special Drawing Rights 

basket; and the possible establishment of the TPP, a partnership in which China is not 

expected to be a founding member.8    

These are interesting and potentially important developments.  Underlying the 

answer to the questions of what they portend, is the answer to the basic question of 

whether the economic center of gravity of the world will continue its shift of recent 

decades toward Asia--in particular, to China or, perhaps, to China and India.  This shift 

would represent a return in some key respects to the global order of two centuries ago and 

earlier, before the economic rise of the West.

8 At this point, the reader will recall the supposed remark by Chou En-lai that it is too early to assess the 
importance of the French revolution.  The most plausible current version of that story is that Chou was 
answering a question about the importance of the 1968 student riots in Paris. 
   The countries expected to become members of the TPP are, in alphabetical order, Australia, Brunei, 
Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam.
