None of these changes will be easy or immediate.  To help us achieve them, we 

must continue to strengthen our mechanisms for international cooperation, including in 

the Basel Committee, the Financial Stability Board, and the Group of Twenty Mutual 

Assessment Process, and work together to enhance surveillance by the International 

Monetary Fund.       

 I am pleased that our French hosts are focusing the work of the Group of Twenty 

on these challenging, but crucially important, issues.  I am hopeful that we will make 

substantive progress on them in the year ahead--an outcome that will strengthen the 

global economy and benefit all countries.
