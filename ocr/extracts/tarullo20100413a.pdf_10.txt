In any case, I hope that interested parties will consider the merits of these possibilities and help 

advance the debate. 

There are other ways to incorporate non-governmental views into the regulatory system. 

We have already taken steps in this direction in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's overhaul 

of its approach to supervising the largest financial holding companies.  As part of this effort--and 

with the aim of advancing both our microprudential and macroprudential goals--we have created 

a quantitative surveillance mechanism (QSM) to regularize the collection and analysis of 

relevant data.  Among other things, the QSM will use market-based indicators such as stock 

prices, option prices, credit default swap spreads, and short-term funding costs to provide an 

external perspective on the condition of these institutions--one that will be formally presented to 

regular meetings of senior supervisory and other Federal Reserve staff.  Market-based indicators 

of macroeconomic and financial market risks that could pose threats to the largest institutions 

also will be used to assess their condition.    

Indeed, the relatively undeveloped nature of macroprudential analytic and oversight 

functions argues for extensive transparency by regulators and involvement of non-regulators.  If, 

for example, the Congress creates a council of regulators with, among other responsibilities, the 

task of issuing periodic financial stability reports, the public at large will have ample opportunity 

to comment on the council's analyses.  Personally, I would go further and establish an advisory 

committee that would assess not just the stability report, but other macroprudential evaluations 

such as scenarios used in stress testing.  By formalizing this activity, senior regulatory officials 

would be required to confront and respond to the critiques directly, an exercise that would help 

develop the embryonic function of macroprudential oversight.
