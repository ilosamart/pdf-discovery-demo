Addressing These Challenges 

Among those responding to these challenges are innovative local practitioners 

who are implementing programs designed to expand job opportunities for low-wage 

workers.  Consider Impact Services in Philadelphia, an organization that builds 

relationships with the local business community to better understand their hiring needs 

and then devises programs that supply those firms with appropriately skilled workers 

from the community.8   The National Fund for Workforce Solutions is another example.  

This organization works with local communities to organize funding collaboratives to 

support regional industries.9

So progress is being made, thanks to coalitions like these across the country that 

are working for practical changes at the community level.  But the 21st century labor

This collaborative is working to address a local skills gap by creating a comprehensive workforce development system

skills that are in high demand.  Educators then develop a curriculum that prepares students to access the local job 
market.  During the National Fund’s first five years of existence, it worked with more than 3,000 employers to serve 
more than 42,000 job seekers and workers across 32 communities. For more information about the National Fund for
