reported in the Q4 2008 FR Y-9C). Firms were asked to address potential other-than-temporary-
impairment charges that may be required under both scenarios. 
As noted above, BHCs with trading account assets exceeding $100 billion as of December 31, 
2008 were asked to provide projections of trading-related losses for the more adverse scenario, 
including losses from counterparty credit risk exposures, including potential counterparty defaults, and 
credit valuation adjustments taken against exposures to counterparties whose probability of default 
would be expected to increase in the adverse scenario.6 [Footnote 6. Under the baseline scenario, BHCs were 
instructed to assume no further losses beyond current marks. End footnote 6.] To calculate these losses, the firms 
conducted a stress test of their trading book positions and counterparty exposures as of market close on February 
20, 2009, based on an instantaneous re-pricing of trading positions equal to the changes in market 
pricing variables that occurred over the period of June 30, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Aside from the 
dollar loss estimates, BHCs were asked to disclose the positions that were included in this analysis as 
well as the risk factors that were stressed and the changes in variables employed (for example, changes 
in rates and spreads, and percentage changes in equities, foreign exchange, and commodities). Firms 
were also asked to provide the results of the stress tests conducted in the usual course of business from 
January 2009 or the most recent dates available. 
Resources to Absorb Losses 
Institutions were also instructed to provide projections of resources available to absorb losses 
under the two scenarios, including pre-provision net revenue, and the allowance for loan losses, over 
the two-year horizon. 
For purposes of this exercise, PPNR is defined as net interest income plus non-interest income 
minus non-interest expense. It is therefore the income after non-credit-related expenses that would 
flow into the firms before they take provisions or other write-downs or losses. The participating BHCs 
were instructed to project the main components of PPNR under each of the macroeconomic scenarios. 
The firms were instructed to explain clearly the assumptions underlying these projections, especially 
those regarding business or market share growth. Especially in the more adverse scenario, pre-provision 
net revenue projections materially exceeding their 2008 values would require strong supporting 
evidence in the absence of documentation of nonrecurring events that negatively affected 2008 net 
revenue. 
Institutions were also instructed to estimate the portion of the year-end 2008 allowance for 
loan and lease losses available to absorb credit losses on the loan portfolio under each scenario, while 
maintaining an adequate allowance at the end of the scenario horizon. This calculation could either 
result in a drawdown of the year-end 2008 ALLL or indicate a need to build reserves over the scenario 
horizon. The adequacy of loan loss reserves was assessed against the likely size, composition, and risk 
characteristics of the loan portfolio at the end of the scenario in 4Q 2010.
