To begin with, I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as 

out of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market.  To be 

classified as unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought 

work within the past four weeks.  Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not 

counted as unemployed.  These include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in 

school, and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members.  

Even in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not 

to work.   

But some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work 

if the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher.  Examples here 

include people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects 

for employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended.  In 

October, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they 

had not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were 

available for work.  This is a considerable number of people, and some of them 

undoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to 

strengthen.  Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could 

change their minds in a stronger job market.   

Another margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate 

consists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a full-

time job and cannot find one--those classified as “part time for economic reasons.”  The 

share of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great 

Recession to around 6-1/2 percent by 2010.  Since then, however, the share of these part
