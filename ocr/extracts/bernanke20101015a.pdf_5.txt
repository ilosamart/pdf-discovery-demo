their pace of spending.  That said, progress has been and is likely to be uneven, as the 

process of balance sheet repair remains impeded to some extent by elevated 

unemployment, lower home values, and limited ability to refinance existing mortgages.   

Household finances and attitudes also have an important influence on the housing 

market, which has remained depressed, notwithstanding reduced house prices and record-

low mortgage rates.  The overhang of foreclosed properties and vacant homes remains a 

significant drag on house prices and residential investment. 

In the business sector, indicators such as new orders and business sentiment 

suggest that growth in spending on equipment and software has slowed relative to its 

rapid pace earlier this year.  Investment in nonresidential structures continues to contract, 

reflecting stringent financing conditions and high vacancy rates for commercial real 

estate.  The availability of credit to finance investment and expand business operations 

remains quite uneven:  Generally speaking, large firms in good financial condition can 

obtain credit in capital markets easily and on favorable terms.  Larger firms also hold 

considerable amounts of cash on their balance sheets.  By contrast, surveys and anecdotes 

indicate that bank-dependent smaller firms continue to face significantly greater problems 

in obtaining credit, reflecting in part weaker balance sheets and income prospects that 

limit their ability to qualify for loans as well as tight lending standards and terms on the 

part of banks.  The Federal Reserve and other banking regulators have been making 

significant efforts to improve the credit environment for small businesses, and we have 

seen some positive signs.  In particular, banks are no longer tightening lending standards 

and terms and are reportedly becoming more proactive in seeking out creditworthy 

borrowers.
