management practices, and the structure of these markets continues to evolve.  For 

example, if traditional providers of liquidity scale back their activity in response to 

changes in regulation and market structure, over time, this shift may create incentives for 

other providers, which are not similarly constrained, to step in.   

Stress tests, such as those announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC) offer one way to help ensure that market participants are prepared for sharper 

spikes in market volatility.  For instance, in the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s most recent 

stress test, the severely adverse scenario featured a large decrease in the prices of 

corporate bonds.   

We are in the early stages of data-based analysis of possible recent changes in the 

resilience of market liquidity.  An upcoming study of the October 15 event will shine 

some light on the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market, but there is still much we need 

to learn.  More broadly, at the Board, we will closely monitor and investigate the extent 

of changes in the resilience of liquidity in important markets, while deepening our 

understanding of different contributors and how market participants are adapting.
