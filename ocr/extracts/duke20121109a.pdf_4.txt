views of community banks, one that has been more comprehensive than any I have seen in my 

time at the Board.  

We launched these efforts at the Board’s public meeting on June 7 of this year, when the 

capital proposals were approved and we began accepting comments.  At that meeting, I reiterated 

my support for strong levels of high-quality capital in banks of all sizes, including community 

banks.4  The large number of community banks that failed over the past several years as a result 

of problems in their real estate loan portfolios has highlighted the importance of having a strong 

cushion of loss-absorbing capital.  However, I also emphasized the importance of getting the 

details of the proposals right.  I encouraged community banks, therefore, to submit comments on 

the proposals to help us understand the costs that revisions to the capital framework could add 

for smaller banks and the changes to their businesses that might result. 

This summer we held a series of “Ask the Fed” sessions aimed primarily at banking 

organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve to provide an overview of the proposals, answer 

questions, and receive feedback.  More than 3,000 bankers participated in these sessions, via 

teleconference or in person.  We later summarized some of the most common questions that our 

staff received in an article in the first issue of Community Banking Connections, a new Federal 

Reserve publication specifically for community bankers.5  Board members and staff have also 

been meeting directly with various industry groups, including state bankers’ associations, to hear 

their views on the proposals.
