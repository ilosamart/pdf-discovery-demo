extremely difficult to predict.  For my part, I believe that the enormous gains in human 

welfare that the information technology explosion seems to be generating are likely to 

continue, and will perhaps eventually return measured productivity growth to its long-run 

historical pace.  

Conditions for Liftoff 

Although the recovery has been slow, there has been significant cumulative 

progress.  An increase in the target federal funds range likely will be warranted before the 

end of the year.  Liftoff should occur when the expected return from raising the interest 

rate outweighs the expected costs of doing so.  In deciding when that time has come, we 

will continue to monitor a wide range of information regarding labor market conditions, 

inflation, and financial and international developments.  We anticipate that it will be 

appropriate to raise the target range when there has been further improvement in the labor 

market and we are reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent 

objective over the medium term.  

Policy Normalization 

Full normalization of monetary policy would allow the Fed to rely on its 

traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate.  However, as long 

as our balance sheet remains sizable, we will not be able to implement monetary policy 

with our traditional tool of repurchases.  It is important that, when we change the rate for 

the first time in a long time, we are certain that we have the operational tools to control 

the federal funds rateâ€”and, accordingly, we have developed and tested new operational 

tools to control the federal funds rate.
