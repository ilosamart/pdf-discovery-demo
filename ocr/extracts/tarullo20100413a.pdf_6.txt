supposed to be in a first-loss position upon failure of the firm.  Shareholders, therefore, should 

pay the price for the firm's failure and should not benefit from a government-managed resolution 

process.  

To promote market discipline on the part of the creditors of large, interconnected firms, 

unsecured creditors of the firms must also bear losses.  Here is where the potential conflict of 

policy goals is obvious.  While losses imposed on creditors will increase market discipline in the 

longer term, the immediate effect could be to provoke a run on other firms with broadly similar 

positions or business strategies.  Thus, the allocation of such losses may need to depend on the 

facts of the individual case.  At the very least, however, subordinated debt, or other financial 

interests that can qualify as regulatory capital, should be fully exposed to losses.  

As is implicit in the foregoing discussion, a novel resolution regime will probably not 

acquire complete credibility until it is actually applied successfully. Other devices, such as the 

so-called “living will” requirement, could help, but some uncertainty will inevitably remain.  For 

this reason, among others, it is important to ensure that other regulatory tools will help 

compensate for the uncertainties associated with an essentially untested mechanism.  It also 

suggests the importance of exploring additional means to increase market discipline.  A good 

resolution mechanism is an essential component of an effective regulatory system, but standing 

alone it is far from sufficient. 

A second proposal that has received considerable attention is to require large financial 

institutions to hold so-called contingent capital, which is basically debt that converts to common 

equity as a result of some predefined triggering event.  There are actually two distinct concepts 

that may be characterized as "contingent" capital.  The first is a requirement for a specified kind 

of capital instrument to be issued by the firm--one that would have debt-like characteristics in
