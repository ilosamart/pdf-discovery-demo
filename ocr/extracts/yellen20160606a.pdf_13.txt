inflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years, while 

proxies for these expectations inferred from financial market instruments like inflation-

protected securities have moved down more noticeably.  It is unclear whether these 

indicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price 

setting; for example, the financial market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward 

inflation risk more than actual inflation expectations.  But the indicators have moved 

enough to get my close attention.  If inflation expectations really are moving lower, that 

could call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as I 

expect.  

Policy Implications  

Let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook, as well as the 

uncertainties associated with that outlook, for monetary policy.  My overall assessment is 

that the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing 

support to the economy by encouraging further labor market improvement that will help 

return inflation to 2 percent.  At the same time, I continue to think that the federal funds 

rate will probably need to rise gradually over time to ensure price stability and maximum 

sustainable employment in the longer run.           

Several considerations lead me to this conclusion.  First, the current stance of 

monetary policy is stimulative, although perhaps not as stimulative as might appear at 

first glance.  One useful measure of the stance of policy is the deviation of the federal 

funds rate from a “neutral” value, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that would 

be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential.  

This neutral rate changes over time, and, at any given date, it depends on a constellation
