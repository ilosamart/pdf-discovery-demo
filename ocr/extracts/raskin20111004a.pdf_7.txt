The PSA aligns the incentives of borrowers, servicers, and investors reasonably 

well when mortgage defaults are low.  Under normal circumstances, mortgage servicing 

is profitable.  A servicer primarily processes mortgage payments and minimizes labor and 

overhead costs by harnessing economies of scale and automating the process as much as 

possible. 

The PSA does not perform nearly as well under stressed circumstances.  When 

mortgage delinquencies are high, mortgage servicing is not profitable, and servicers may 

feel extra pressure to cut costs as much as possible.  In addition, servicers may not be 

properly motivated to perform loan modifications even when such modifications are in 

the best interests of borrowers and investors.  Servicer compensation is not generally tied 

to the performance of the loan, and in most cases a servicer receives no extra payment for 

preventing a default.  Further, loan modifications are labor intensive, and this extra labor 

cost is not reimbursed under the contract.  Instead, the PSA provides for the 

reimbursement of some foreclosure expenses. 

Other language in the contract also does little to encourage loan modifications, 

particularly in the case of securitized mortgages.  Many PSAs provide minimal guidance 

about modifications beyond specifying that servicers should apply “usual and normal” 

servicing standards or the same standards that they apply to the loans held in portfolio.  

With such vague guidance, servicers assert that they are worried about litigation risk if 

they employ servicing approaches that have not been widely adopted throughout the 

industry.  Furthermore, even when the PSAs provide guidance about loan modifications, 

it can differ widely across PSAs, often preventing servicers from designing a uniform 

modification program for their entire portfolio.
