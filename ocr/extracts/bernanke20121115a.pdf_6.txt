To be clear, the reduction in mortgage originations and home purchases for all 

groups relative to the pre-crisis period partly reflects weakness in the effective demand 

for housing rather than the unavailability of mortgage credit.  Unemployment, income 

loss, and income insecurity prevent many households from purchasing homes, and 

concerns about the future direction of the labor market, housing prices, and the economy 

more generally keep other potential buyers on the sidelines.  In addition, the fall in home 

prices means that many current homeowners cannot rely as much as they could in the 

past on tapping their existing home equity to trade up to larger or better homes, while 

underwater homeowners may be financially unable to move from their current homes.  

Although the decline in the number of willing and qualified potential homebuyers 

explains some of the contraction in mortgage lending of the past few years, I believe that 

tight credit nevertheless remains an important factor as well.  The Federal Reserve’s 

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicates that lenders 

began tightening mortgage credit standards in 2007 and have not significantly eased 

standards since.

  Terms and standards have tightened most for borrowers with lower 

credit scores and with less money available for a down payment.  For example, in April 

nearly 60 percent of lenders reported that they would be much less likely, relative to 

2006, to originate a conforming home-purchase mortgage to a borrower with a 10 percent 

down payment and a credit score of 620--a traditional marker for those with weaker 

credit histories.

  As a result, the share of home-purchase borrowers with credit scores 

below 620 has fallen from about 17 percent of borrowers at the end of 2006 to about

 A conforming mortgage is one that is eligible for purchase or credit guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie
