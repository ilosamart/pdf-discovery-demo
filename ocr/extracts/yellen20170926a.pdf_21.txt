normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  For changes in the price of core 

imports, the 2017:H2 extrapolations are based on a regression of this series on current 

and lagged changes in exchange rates.  This approach predicts that core import prices 

should rise about 4-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year.32  Energy 

and food prices over the second half of 2017 are assumed to rise at annual rates of 

10 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively; these assumptions (which take into account 

published monthly PCE data through July and published CPI data through August, as 

well as recent movements in gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma) 

ensure that the combined contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2017 is 

consistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total 

and core inflation.  Finally, nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports 

are assumed to remain unchanged at their 2017:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation 

expectations are assumed to remain constant at 2 percent. 

After computing historical 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, 

the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counterfactual 

simulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2017:Q4.  One by one, each explanatory 

variable of the model is set to zero, and the model is simulated; the resulting difference 

between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that 

                                                 
32 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest 
downward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if 
one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate.  If the post-2001 pattern persists 
in coming years, then 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE 
inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains 
near 4-1/2 percent (the median of the longer-run projections provided by FOMC participants) and there are 
no further shocks to the exchange rate and other factors.  If, however, core import prices were expected to 
resume trending down relative to consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the 
unemployment rate consistent with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat 
lower than 4-1/2 percent.
