consider regulatory and supervisory expectations regarding third-party risk management. Written 

guidance may allow for risk-based or more tailored approaches, but a number of factors

helping community banks chart their way through changing times? Let me be clear. It is 

management’s job, not an examiner’s job, to set the bank’s innovation strategy. However, I think 

supervisors need to recognize and be thoughtful about how we might affect the way banks

“Smaller, nonbank fintech firms and banks have raised concerns that the overall burden of the third-party 
supervisory regime stifles the ability of new firms to partner with banks. . . . [C]ommunity banks have expressed 
concern about their capacity to undertake the requisite due diligence and ongoing vendor management (especially 
with larger vendors).”
