 Good afternoon.  For more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has 

provided an influential forum for the discussion of social, political and economic 

challenges facing the nation, and I appreciate very much your inviting me to speak today.  

My comments will focus on recent increases in commodity prices and the effects of those 

developments on the outlook for inflation, the economic recovery now under way, and 

the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Let me emphasize at the outset that these 

remarks reflect my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1    

 Since early last summer, the prices of oil, agricultural products, and other raw 

materials have risen significantly.  For example, the price of Brent crude oil has risen 

more than 70 percent and the price of corn has more than doubled; more broadly, the 

Commodity Research Bureau’s index of non-fuel commodity prices has risen roughly 40 

percent.  The imprint of these increases has become increasingly visible in overall 

measures of inflation.  For example, inflation as measured by the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE) moved up to an annual rate of about 4 percent over the 

three months ending in February after having averaged less than 1-1/2 percent over the 

preceding two years.  Moreover, survey data suggest that surging prices for gasoline and 

food have pushed up households’ near-term inflation expectations and are making 

consumers less confident about their economic circumstances.   

 Some observers have attributed the recent boom in commodity prices to the 

highly accommodative stance of U.S. monetary policy, including the marked expansion 

of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the maintenance of the target federal funds 

rate at exceptionally low levels.  Such an interpretation of recent developments naturally

Trevor Reeve, David Reifschneider, Stacey Tevlin, and William Wascher for their assistance in preparing 
these remarks.
