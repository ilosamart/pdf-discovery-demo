I am pleased to be here with this distinguished group of market participants, 

academics, government officials, and many others who are vitally interested in the 

issues before us today.1  I am sure that all of us recognize the importance of the 

U.S. Treasury markets to our economy and our financial system; indeed, to the 

world economy and the global financial system.  As Bill just outlined, for the next 

two days, we will collectively address the most important questions facing the 

Treasury markets today.2  Are there significant problems in these markets that are 

not likely to self-correct?  More specifically, is liquidity in broad decline, or more 

prone to sudden disappearance?  If so, what are the causes?  And what are the costs 

and benefits of potential market-led or regulatory responses?  The design of this 

conference is to provide a forum for differing perspectives on these issues.   

  It has been one year since the events of October 15, 2014.  Appropriately, 

the conference will begin with a review of the findings of the recent Joint Staff 

Report issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Board of Governors, the 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 

the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.3  The report analyzes in depth the
