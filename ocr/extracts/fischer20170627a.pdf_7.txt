Borrowing by households and businesses 

In the private nonfinancial sector, which includes corporations and households, 

total debt remains well below its long-run trend, largely driven by subdued borrowing 

among households.  However, the corporate business sector appears to be notably 

leveraged, with the current aggregate corporate-sector leverage standing near 20-year 

highs.   

Some studies, including one by the International Monetary Fund in this Aprilâ€™s 

Global Financial Stability Report, have recently highlighted this vulnerability, so let me 

briefly offer my perspective.6  Despite the elevated levels of corporate borrowing, recent 

developments show signs of improvement.  Leverage has declined slightly since its peak 

a year ago, and firms with high debt growth appear relatively healthy.  Interest expenses 

relative to earnings also declined of late and are below their median value since 2001.  

Furthermore, the fraction of corporate debt due within one year relative to total debt 

stands at historically low levels.  Thus, positive shocks to interest rates may adversely 

affect the ability of some firms to service debt, but this risk may have only limited 

system-wide effects.  Nonetheless, elevated leverage leaves the corporate sector 

vulnerable to other shocks, such as earnings shocks.  

In the household sector, new borrowing is driven mostly by borrowers with higher 

credit scores, and the amount of debt that borrowers have relative to their incomes is 

falling, suggesting that the debt is more manageable.  That said, two pockets in the 

household sector deserve scrutiny.  Auto loan balances and delinquency rates are high for 

borrowers with lower credit scores, meaning that the riskiest borrowers are borrowing
