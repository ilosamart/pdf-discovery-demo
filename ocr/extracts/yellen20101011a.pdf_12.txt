sector stress testing, building on the tests carried out in the United States in 2009 and in 

Europe this year, will provide valuable information about the ability of the financial 

system to weather significant economic or financial shocks.  We should refine the stress-

testing methodology as we develop a more sophisticated understanding of institution-

level systemic risk factors.  These enhancements can be carried out by the quantitative 

surveillance unit that we have already established in our supervision of the largest 

financial institutions to better integrate macroprudential considerations with regular 

supervisory practice.   

Qualitative information on credit will complement the quantitative evidence.  The 

Fed recently introduced the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing 

Terms, adding to the information collected from the existing commercial bank Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, a survey on credit supply and 

demand.8 

Systemic risk surveillance is both a science and an art:  science in that we will 

analyze closely a wide range of data that research shows to be diagnostic, and art in that 

we will have to exercise judgment about when excesses become so dangerous that action 

is required.  The Fed and other regulators in the United States and abroad have made 

important progress in developing systemic risk indicators.  Still, we must recognize the 

inherent difficulty in forecasting crises and acknowledge the failure of past risk-

monitoring efforts.  Moreover, we must be mindful of the inadequacy of indicators that 

focus too specifically on the markets and channels that transmitted the crisis of 2007 and 

2008.  Like Tolstoy’s unhappy families, every financial crisis is a crisis in its own way.
