conditions under which it would determine that a "threat to financial stability" may exist and the transmission 
channels through which distress at a firm could affect the broader economy.  What is noteworthy for my purposes 
today – beyond the elaborate nature of this exercise – is that ultimately the FSOC will make each determination on a 
very company-specific basis, with attention to the particular risks posed by each individual company.  Indeed, 
recognizing that the assessment of different kinds of financial firms may require varying analytic frameworks, the 
FSOC has segmented its work.  So, for example, it will consider asset managers and hedge funds separately from 
other forms of financial intermediaries.   
32 In fact, of course, the antitrust agencies and the courts have over the years given greater or lesser weight to 
possible efficiencies resulting from a merger, thereby introducing a consideration other than competition as such. 
33 As noted earlier, the two governing provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act differ somewhat.  For the 
present purpose of discussing financial stability analysis, however, we need not dwell on these differences. 
34 The HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in a particular market and then adding those 
squared market shares.  The antitrust agencies have specified the relative level of scrutiny that can be expected from 
particular combinations of changes in, and post-merger HHIs, although they are careful to point out that HHI is not a 
"rigid screen."  U.S. Department of Justice, Horizontal Merger Guidelines §5.3 (Aug. 19, 2009).  
35 In the Wells-Wachovia and JPMorgan-Washington Mutual cases, concerns about the impact of Wachovia’s 
failure on the Deposit Insurance Fund may also have played a role.

39 There are eight U.S. banks on this list, as well as many foreign-based firms with significant U.S. operations.  
However, the buckets to which they will be assigned will not be finalized under more up-to-date data is available 
and analyzed next year.  Once final agreement has been reached by the Basel Committee, ordering  the systemically 
important banks into categories with progressively increasing surcharges, the Federal Reserve Board intends to 
propose matching provisions for covered U.S. banks under its Section 165 authority.  In conducting our annual 
reviews of the capital levels and planning processes of major U.S. bank holding companies, we have already 
instructed the eight firms on the Basel Committee list to include their estimated required surcharge in their plan for 
reaching their ultimate capital requirement. 
40 The Basel Committee has not yet completed its work on this initiative.  Its proposal has been published in Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision, Consultative Document on a Framework for Dealing with Domestic 
Systemically Important Banks (June 2012).  The proposal is that national authorities would designate these 
institutions (as compared to the global systemically important banks, which are to be designated by the Basel 
Committee itself), and that the nature of the enhanced loss absorbency for any such institutions also be left to 
national discretion (as compared to the global systemically important banks, for which capital surcharges are to be 
required and their amounts specified by the Basel Committee).
