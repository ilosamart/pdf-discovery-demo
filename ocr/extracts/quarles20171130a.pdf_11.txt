account for the effects that it has on both the financial and technology networks that make up our 

payment system.   

The innovation that is beginning to flow from the development of digital currencies--and 

other technologies--will likely have a long-run effect on the technical networks and the business 

processes used in the payment system and the wider financial system.  Privately developed 

digital currencies as currently configured would raise concerns about the effect on financial 

stability if they take on more prominence in the payments and overall financial system.  Central 

bank digital currencies are also not immune to a large range of risks and could even adversely 

affect financial stability.  As such, central banks should tread cautiously as they contemplate 

issuing them.  But this does not mean that we should avoid further innovation.  Working 

cooperatively, private-sector participants and central banks can incorporate innovation that may 

be able to strike the right balance of improving the technical networks without adversely 

generating financial stability concerns.  I am optimistic that the Federal Reserveâ€™s work with the 

payments industry will facilitate a future with a safe and more efficient payment system.
