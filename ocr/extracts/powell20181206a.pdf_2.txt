Thank you for the kind introduction, and thank you to the Housing Assistance 

Council (HAC) for inviting me to be part of this discussion of rural housing.  I 

understand that you will shortly be presenting awards to people who are working at the 

local and national levels and in both the public and private sectors and whose efforts have 

improved housing conditions for the rural poor.  All of you who work in these roles are 

doing your country a great service by helping to advance economic opportunity in our 

communities.  I want to thank the award recipients for the difference you make in the 

lives of people in rural communities.  

I am happy to report that our economy is currently performing very well overall, 

with strong job creation and gradually rising wages.  The unemployment rate is 

3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969.  A strong job market has encouraged more people to 

participate in the labor market, another positive development.  In fact, by many national-

level measures, our labor market is very strong.   

As those at this conference are acutely aware, however, aggregate statistics can 

mask important variations between different demographic and income groups, as well as 

significant regional differences.  For example, unemployment rates in some persistently 

poor rural counties remain much higher than the national figures.  The annual average 

unemployment rate in 2017 exceeded 10 percent in 27 persistently poor rural counties, 

and the rate was 20 percent or more in 2 of those counties.  Recent Fed research found 

that, since 2007, labor force participation rates for those in their prime working years in 

rural areas have increasingly lagged rates in urban areas.  Labor force participation has 

been particularly low for those with only a high school diploma or less.1  Research has
