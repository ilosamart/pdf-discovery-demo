dramatically.  This source of liquidity risk can occur even in the absence of a default.  For 

example, after the UK referendum on Brexit, the resulting price swings triggered many CCPs to 

make substantial intraday and end-of-day margin calls.  Fortunately, members had prepared and 

were able to make the needed payments, but the sums involved caught many off guard and the 

experience served as a useful warning.   

According to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the top 

five CCPs requested $27 billion in additional margin over the two days following the 

referendum, about five times the average amount.5  In most cases, clearing members have an 

hour to meet intraday margin calls.  Clearing members have no choice but to hold enough liquid 

resources to meet the range of possible margin calls, as the consequences of missing a margin 

call are considerable. 

Brexit was only the most recent example in which margin calls were unexpectedly large.  

Margin calls were also quite large after the stock market crash of October 1987.  That episode 

helps to demonstrate how complicated payments flows can be and why liquidity risk also needs 

to be viewed from a macroprudential perspective, considering potential risks to flows across the 

system.  After falling about 9 percent the week before, on October 19, 1987, the S&P 500 stock 

market index fell about 20 percent.  Margin calls were about 10 times their normal size, and 

caused a very complicated set of payment flows across multiple exchanges, CCPs, and banks.6
