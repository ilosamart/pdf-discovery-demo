Economic Challenges 

  Notwithstanding the progress that I’ve noted, critical challenges--both near term 

and longer term--remain.  We have yet to see evidence of a sustained recovery in the 

housing market.  Mortgage delinquencies for both subprime and prime loans continue 

to rise as do foreclosures.  The commercial real estate sector remains troubled, which is 

a concern for communities and for banks holding commercial real estate loans. 

Some of the toughest problems are in the job market.  The unemployment rate 

has edged off its recent peak, but at 9.7 percent, it is still close to its highest level since 

the early 1980s.  Although layoffs have eased in recent months, hiring remains very 

weak.  More than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or 

longer, nearly double the share of a year ago.  I am particularly concerned about that 

statistic, because long spells of unemployment erode skills and lower the longer-term 

income and employment prospects of these workers. 

That said, my best guess is that economic growth, supported by the Federal 

Reserve’s stimulative monetary policy, will be sufficient to slowly reduce the 

unemployment rate over the coming year.  If economic conditions improve, as I expect, 

we should see increased optimism among consumers and greater willingness on the part 

of banks to lend, which in turn should aid the recovery.  Meanwhile, for the near term, 

inflation appears to be well controlled.  Productivity improvements have helped firms 

control costs, and little pricing power is evident.  Inflation expectations, as measured in 

the financial markets or in surveys, appear stable.
