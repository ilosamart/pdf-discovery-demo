with compensating controls.  Similarly, when our own examiners evaluate model risk, they 

generally begin with an evaluation of the processes firms have for developing and reviewing 

models, as well as the response to any shortcomings in a model or the ability to review it.  

Importantly, the guidance recognizes that not all aspects of a model may be fully transparent, as 

with proprietary vendor models, for instance.  Banks can use such models, but the guidance 

highlights the importance of using other tools to cabin or otherwise mitigate the risk of an 

unexplained or opaque model.  Risks may be offset by mitigating external controls like “circuit-

breakers” or other mechanisms.  And importantly, models should always be interpreted in 

context.    

Second, our guidance on vendor risk management (SR 13-19/CA 13-21), along with the 

prudential regulators’ guidance on technology service providers, highlights considerations firms 

should weigh when outsourcing business functions or activities--and could be expected to apply 

as well to AI-based tools or services that are externally sourced.15  The vast majority of the banks 

that we supervise will have to rely on the expertise, data, and off-the-shelf AI tools of nonbank 

vendors to take advantage of AI-powered processes.  Whether these tools are chatbots, anti-

money-laundering/know your customer compliance products, or new credit evaluation tools, it 

seems likely that they would be classified as services to the bank.  The vendor risk-management 

guidance discusses best practices for supervised firms regarding due diligence, selection, and 

contracting processes in selecting an outside vendor.  It also describes ways that firms can 

provide oversight and monitoring throughout the relationship with the vendor, and considerations
