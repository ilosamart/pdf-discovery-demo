I am very pleased to participate in this event in honor of Stanley Fischer.  Stan 

was my teacher in graduate school, and he has been both a role model and a frequent 

adviser ever since.  An expert on financial crises, Stan has written prolifically on the 

subject and has also served on the front lines, so to speak--notably, in his role as the first 

deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund during the emerging 

market crises of the 1990s.  Stan also helped to fight hyperinflation in Israel in the 1980s 

and, as the governor of that nation’s central bank, deftly managed monetary policy to 

mitigate the effects of the recent crisis on the Israeli economy.  Subsequently, as Israeli 

housing prices ran upward, Stan became an advocate and early adopter of 

macroprudential policies to preserve financial stability. 

Stan frequently counseled his students to take a historical perspective, which is 

good advice in general, but particularly helpful for understanding financial crises, which 

have been around a very long time.  Indeed, as I have noted elsewhere, I think the recent 

global crisis is best understood as a classic financial panic transposed into the novel 

institutional context of the 21st century financial system.1  An appreciation of the 

parallels between recent and historical events greatly influenced how I and many of my 

colleagues around the world responded to the crisis. 

Besides being the fifth anniversary of the most intense phase of the recent crisis, 

this year also marks the centennial of the founding of the Federal Reserve.2  It’s 

particularly appropriate to recall, therefore, that the Federal Reserve was itself created in
