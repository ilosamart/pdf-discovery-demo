services.  Thanks in part to these developments, China’s current account surplus (not shown 

here) has fallen sharply as a share of its GDP over the past several years.12   

These are welcome developments as China’s huge trade surplus created an unsustainable 

situation, contributing both to internal imbalances within the Chinese economy and to global 

imbalances.  But the rebalancing toward domestic demand will likely put a damper on China’s 

trade for some time as resources shift away from trade-intensive manufacturing.  In principle, 

this drag on China’s trade could be partly or even completely offset by stronger imports by 

Chinese consumers.  Evidence of a shift toward imports of consumer goods, however, is limited 

thus far, and further substantial progress depends on the Chinese authorities’ ability to remove 

distortions that currently depress consumption and boost saving.  It may well be, however, that 

the rising power of the Chinese consumer will in time propel another long round of rapid 

increases in world trade.   

Implications for Growth in the Region 

Having examined developments in world and Chinese trade, let me turn to the 

implications of these trends for economic growth in the emerging Asia region.   

There is little doubt that for many years China and other emerging Asian economies have 

benefited from rapid expansion of trade.13  Greater trade can provide a host of economic benefits, 

including enabling the pursuit of comparative advantage, fostering more competition (which 

leads to more efficiency), generating technological and knowledge spillovers, and facilitating 


12 Over the past couple of years, though, China’s current account surplus has turned up again, especially as a share 
of world GDP.
