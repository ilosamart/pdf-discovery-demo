productivity and hours worked in 2018 each have been exceeding their respective longer-

run rates as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.2  In other words, while 

growth in aggregate demand in 2018 has been above the expected long-run growth rate in 

aggregate supply, it has not been exceeding this year’s growth in actual aggregate supply. 

Ultimately, hours growth will likely converge to a slower pace because of 

demographic factors.  But how rapidly this happens will depend in part on the behavior of 

labor force participation.  And recent years’ developments suggest there may still be 

some further room for participation in the job market--especially in the prime-age group 

of 25-to-54-year-olds--to rise.  Labor participation by prime-age women has increased 

around 2 percentage points in the past three years and is now at its highest level in a 

decade.  That said, it is still 1-1/2 percentage points below the peak level reached in 2000.  

Labor force participation among 25- to 54-year-old men has risen by roughly 1 

percentage point in the past several years.  But it is still 2 percentage points below levels 

seen a decade ago, and it is 3 percentage points below the levels that prevailed in the late 

1990s. 

As for productivity growth, there is considerable uncertainty about how much of 

the rebound in productivity growth that we have seen in recent quarters is cyclical and 

how much is structural.  I believe both factors are at work.  The structural, or trend, 

component of productivity growth is a function of capital deepening through business 

investment as well as a multifactor component sometimes referred to as the “Solow 

residual.”  Initial estimates from the recent GDP release indicate that equipment and 

software investment in the third quarter moderated from the rapid pace recorded in the
