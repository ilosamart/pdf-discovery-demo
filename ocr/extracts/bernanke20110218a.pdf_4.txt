that, in the past, I have dubbed the global saving glut.1  Over the past 15 years or so, for 

reasons on which I have elaborated in earlier remarks, many emerging market economies 

have run large, sustained current account surpluses and thus have become exporters of 

capital to the advanced economies, especially the United States.  These inflows 

exacerbated the U.S. current account deficit and were also a factor pushing U.S. and 

global longer-term interest rates below levels suggested by expected short-term rates and 

other macroeconomic fundamentals.    

My earlier comments on the global saving glut hypothesis focused on the sources 

of the capital inflows to the United States and their effects on global longer-term interest 

rates and the U.S. current account, without attention to the composition of those flows.  

My paper for the Banque de France Financial Stability Review extends the basic global 

saving glut hypothesis to consider the portfolio preferences of foreign investors in the 

United States and the implications of those preferences.2  Several researchers have argued 

that capital flows from emerging markets to advanced economies will tend to be directed 

to the safest and most liquid assets, of which, these researchers argue, there is a relative 

shortage in emerging markets.3  My paper confirms empirically that the global saving
