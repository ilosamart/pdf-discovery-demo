most states.  Thus, governments may wish to revisit their criteria for accumulating and 

using fiscal reserves.  Building an adequate reserve fund during good times may not be 

politically popular, but doing so can pay off during bad times as well as lessen the 

tendency to overspend when times are good. 

In principle, some smoothing of expenditures over good and bad times could also 

take place through the capital budget.  In particular, maintaining or even increasing the 

pace of construction spending when the economy is weak could add valuable 

infrastructure and provide local jobs; it may even allow a government to get more “bang 

for the buck” because of increased competition among private contractors when demand 

is slack.  Voters and policymakers may understandably be reluctant to approve new bond 

issues and take on additional costs for debt payments in a period of fiscal and economic 

stress, but they might be less reluctant if governments were to accumulate larger rainy 

day funds and assign a higher priority to tapping them for infrastructure purposes in times 

of economic weakness. 

Another development that has compounded the difficulties faced by many state 

governments is that their revenues--always sensitive to economic conditions--appear to 

have become even more tied to the economy over time.  One reason for this greater 

sensitivity is that capital income, which tends to vary substantially more than wage and 

salary income, has become an increasingly important source of state personal income 

taxes.6  Also, sales taxes may have become more cyclical because of an increasing 

tendency to exempt certain necessities, for which demand is relatively more stable.  As
