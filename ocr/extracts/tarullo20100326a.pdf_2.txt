 Effective responses to dire situations often require bold actions that would be 

unthinkable in calmer times.  So it was in the financial crisis, when central banks 

undertook extraordinary monetary policy measures and governments made major 

financial firms wards of the state.  Yet sometimes a crisis also accelerates adoption of 

policies and practices that might beneficially have been implemented beforehand and 

then are sensibly continued after the crisis has passed.  This evening I will examine an 

instance of this latter phenomenon, as defined by the Federal Reserve’s experience with 

comprehensive stress testing of major financial institutions during the crisis.   

 The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) was fashioned in early 

2009 as a key element of a crucial plan to stabilize the U.S. financial system.  The stress 

tests, as they have been popularly called, required development on the fly, and under 

enormous pressure, of ideas that academics and supervisors had been considering for 

some time.  After describing the concept, design, and implementation of last year’s tests, 

I will explain how our experience has helped prompt major changes in Federal Reserve 

supervision of the nation’s largest financial institutions.  Then I will discuss how this 

experience has stimulated debate over the merits of publicly releasing supervisory 

information.1  

Origins and Execution of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program   

 By February 2009, many steps had already been taken to restore the health of, and 

confidence in, U.S. banks.  The U.S. Treasury had injected capital into banks under the 

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had 

expanded guarantees for bank liabilities under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
