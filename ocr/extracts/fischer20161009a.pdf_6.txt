achieve and maintain our objectives.  That assessment is based on our view that the 

neutral nominal federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary 

nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel--is currently low by 

historical standards.  With the federal funds rate modestly below the neutral rate, the 

current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which 

is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives.  But since monetary policy 

is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in 

the near future, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to 

get monetary policy to a neutral stance over the next few years.  

This view is consistent with the projections of appropriate monetary policy 

prepared by FOMC participants in connection with our September meeting.4  The median 

projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1.1 percent at the end of next 

year, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent by the end of 2019.  Most 

participants also marked down their estimate of the longer-run normal federal funds rate, 

with the median now at 2.9 percent. 

However, as we have noted on many previous occasions, policy is not on a preset 

course.  The economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and our assessment of the 

appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the 

economic outlook and associated risks.
