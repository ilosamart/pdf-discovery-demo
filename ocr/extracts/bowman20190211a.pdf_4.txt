examinations of community banks.  We are also charged with supervising financial 

institutions to make sure they comply with applicable federal consumer protection laws 

and regulations.  Here too, we apply a risk-focused approach to consumer compliance 

supervision, focusing most intensely on those areas involving the greatest compliance 

risk.  Similarly, we want to ensure that rules that address the risks posed by the business 

models of the largest banks do not unintentionally create barriers to entry or unnecessary 

burden for community banks.  

During the remaining time with you today, I will touch on the condition of 

community banks, and supervision and regulation of community banks.  I am also 

interested in hearing your perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the current 

community bank landscape.   

Condition of Community Banks 

When I analyze how community banks are faring, I always keep in mind that the 

range of institutions we call community banks is remarkably diverse.  As Kansas State 

Bank Commissioner, I oversaw banks that had four employees and less than $20 million 

in assets up to institutions with more than 100 employees and more than $1 billion in 

assets.  Itâ€™s the same picture nationwide.  Though if we look more closely, we can see 

that three out of four community banks hold assets of less than $500 million.  As a 

regulator, I am particularly interested in how our work affects institutions of this size.    

One good reason for this interest is the distinct contribution community banks 

make to economic activity.  For example, while community banks account for just 17 

percent of financial industry assets, they are responsible for some 53 percent of bank 

lending to small businesses.
