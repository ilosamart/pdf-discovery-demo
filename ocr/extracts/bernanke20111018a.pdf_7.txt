 Forward guidance about the future path of policy rates, already used before the 

crisis, took on greater importance as policy rates neared zero.  A prominent example was 

the Bank of Canada’s commitment in April 2009 to keep its policy rate unchanged at 

1/4 percent until the end of the second quarter of 2010, depending on the outlook for 

inflation.3  This commitment was successful in clarifying for market participants the 

bank’s views on the likely path of policy rates and appears to have helped reduce longer-

term interest rates, thus providing additional policy accommodation.  In 2010, the Bank 

of Japan, which faced ongoing deflation in consumer prices, also used conditional 

forward guidance, saying that “The Bank will maintain the virtually zero interest rate 

policy until it judges, on the basis of the ‘understanding of medium- to long-term price 

stability,’ that price stability is in sight, on condition that no problem will be identified in 

examining risk factors, including the accumulation of financial imbalances.”4 

 Some central banks provide forward guidance directly by releasing forecasts or 

projections of their policy rate.  This practice had already been adopted by the Reserve 

Bank of New Zealand (in 1997), the Norges Bank (in 2005), and the Swedish Riksbank 

(in 2007).  Each of these central banks used those projections during the financial crisis to 

indicate that they were likely to keep rates at low levels for at least a year. 

 In the United States, the FOMC introduced language in its March 2009 statement 

indicating that it anticipated rates to remain at low levels for an “extended period,” and at 

its August 2011 meeting the Committee elaborated by indicating that it anticipated rates
