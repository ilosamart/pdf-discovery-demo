vulnerability to funding runs and asset fire sales.  These may be associated either with some of 

the same kinds of short-term funding found in systemically important banking organizations or 

in the potential for rapid and substantial investor redemptions of their holdings in certain 

investment funds.  Where substantial leverage--either nominal or synthetic--is also present, the 

risks are only greater.  Efforts to calibrate these, and possibly other, risks will remain an 

important feature of shadow banking regulation, along with refining ways in which such risks 

may be mitigated. 

Before turning to another, though related, set of questions, let me digress a bit to note 

another implication of a regime in which regulation is developed with a view to risks to the 

financial system as a whole.  The motivation both for more stringent regulation of systemically 

important firms and for regulation of shadow banking arises in large part from the potential 

contribution of each to systemwide contagion.  A complementary motivation for some 

macroprudential measures is the importance of maintaining effective financial intermediation 

even during a period of severe recession or financial stress.  But this reasoning should, I think, 

move us toward less regulatory stringency for some parts of the financial system, as well as 

greater stringency in other parts.  For example, as banking regulation is strengthened to take 

account of the progressively more systemic significance of larger or more complicated 

institutions, there is a good argument for a less demanding regime for smaller institutions whose 

contribution to systemic contagion would almost surely be somewhere between modest and 

inconsequential.  This observation raises the issue, which I have discussed previously, as to 

whether even within a particular form-based area of financial regulation we should be moving 

toward quite different regimes.4
