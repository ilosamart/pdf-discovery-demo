Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the 35th Annual Economic Policy 

Conference of the National Association for Business Economics.  Before we begin our 

conversation, I want to share a few thoughts about the outlook for the economy and 

monetary policy.1 

Current Economic Situation and Outlook 

The U.S. economy expanded at a robust pace in 2018, and my baseline outlook 

for 2019 foresees somewhat slower but still-solid growth in the year ahead.  In July, just 

about four months from now, the current economic expansion will become the longest on 

record.  The Federal Reserve is charged by the Congress with achieving and sustaining a 

dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and the economy is as close 

as it has been in many years to meeting these goals. 

The unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years, and average 

monthly job gains have continued to well outpace the increases needed over the longer 

run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.  Most measures of nominal wage 

growth are running at or somewhat above the 3 percent pace, and recent wage gains have 

been strongest for lower-skilled workers.   

Moreover, the strength of the labor market appears to have encouraged people to 

join the labor force and others, who might have left it, to continue working.  The labor 

force participation rate--the share of people who are either working or looking for work--

has moved up 1/2 percentage point over the past year, and the participation rate of prime-

staff for his assistance in preparing this text.
