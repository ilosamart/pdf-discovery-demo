more pronounced than the slowdown in world GDP growth or in world consumption.  But the 

differences are not huge, suggesting that this explanation can go only so far.   

Indeed, research suggests that other factors are also important in accounting for the 

slowdown in world trade.6  One such factor is the deceleration in the pace of trade liberalization 

policies.  From the early 1990s through the mid-2000s, trade barriers were coming down rapidly, 

including the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the 2001 entry of 

China into the World Trade Organization, and the 2005 expiration of the multifibre agreement 

restricting textile imports to the United States and European Union.  These changes resulted in 

the most rapid increases in the trade-to-GDP ratio since 1870.  As the pace of trade liberalization 

has slowed in recent years, perhaps reflecting limits to further gains from trade agreements, it is 

only natural that the trade-to-GDP ratio should flatten out as well.   

Another related factor is the maturation of global value chains.  Increased fragmentation 

of production across international borders--a natural outgrowth of the gains from specialization--

meant more trade for any given value of final production, thus adding to the major expansion in 

gross trade flows in the 1990s and 2000s.  As shown in the next slide, global value chain 

participation, as measured by the share of foreign value added in world exports, increased 

substantially during this period.  It is quite plausible that the process of increased fragmentation 

of production across borders is subject to “diminishing returns” and has its natural limits.  

Consistent with this notion, the trend toward greater product fragmentation has slowed in recent 

years.
