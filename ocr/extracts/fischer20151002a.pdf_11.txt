in identifying every significant potential threat accurately and in a timely manner.  This is 

another reminder of the importance of building resilience in the financial system. 

Nonetheless, the limited macroprudential toolkit in the United States leads me to 

conclude that there may be times when adjustments in monetary policy should be 

discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability.  The deployment of monetary 

policy comes with significant costs.  A more restrictive monetary policy would, all else 

being equal, lead to deviations from price stability and full employment.  Moreover, 

financial stability considerations can sometimes point to the need for accommodative 

monetary policy.  For example, the accommodative U.S. monetary policy since 2008 has 

helped repair the balance sheets of households, nonfinancial firms, and the financial 

sector.   

Given these considerations, how should monetary policy be deployed to foster 

financial stability?  This topic is a matter for further research, some of which will look 

similar to the analysis in an earlier time of whether and how monetary policy should react 

to rapidly rising asset prices.  That discussion reached the conclusion that monetary 

policy should be deployed to deal with errant asset prices (assuming, of course, that they 

could be identified) only to the extent that not doing so would result in a worse outcome 

for current and future output and inflation.16   

There are some calculations--for example, by Lars Svensson--that suggest it 

would hardly ever make sense to deploy monetary policy to deal with potential financial 

instability.  The contention that macroprudential measures would be a better approach is 

persuasive, except when there are no relevant macroprudential measures available.  I
