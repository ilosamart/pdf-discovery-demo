size caps or structural limitations on banks--whatever their merits and demerits--embody 

basic policy decisions that are properly the province of Congress.

However, that does not mean there is no role for regulators.  On the contrary, 

Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve the authority, and the 

obligation, to apply regulations of increasing stringency to large banking organizations in 

order to mitigate risks to financial stability.  In any event, it is unlikely that the problems 

associated with too-big-to-fail institutions can be efficiently ameliorated using a single 

regulatory tool.  The explicit expectation in Section 165 that there will be a variety of 

enhanced standards seems well-advised.  We should be considering ways to use this 

authority in pursuit of three complementary ends: (1) ensuring the loss absorbency 

needed for a credible and effective resolution process, (2) augmenting the going-concern 

capital of the largest firms, and (3) addressing the systemic risks associated with the use 

of wholesale funding.     

There is clear need for a requirement that large financial institutions have 

minimum amounts of long-term unsecured debt that could be converted to equity and 

thereby be available to absorb losses in the event of insolvency.  Although the details 

will, as always, be important, there appears to be an emerging consensus among 

regulators, both here and abroad, in support of the general idea.  Debt subject to this kind 

of bail-in would supplement the increased regulatory capital in order to provide greater 

assurance that, should the firm become insolvent, all losses could be borne using 

resources within the firm.  This requirement for additional “gone concern” capital would
