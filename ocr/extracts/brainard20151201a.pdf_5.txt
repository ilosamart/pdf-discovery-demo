two decades preceding the crisis, which is close to the level of the intercept term in the 

Taylor (1993) rule, which in turn is based on empirical analysis of the period from the 

mid-1980s to the early 1990s.  In contrast, the Blue Chip consensus longer-run rate is 

currently around 1.1 percent, about 1 percentage point lower than the pre-crisis average.7   

Similarly, although the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not 

explicitly defined “normal,” the central tendency or the median of the longer-run level of 

the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) might reasonably 

be considered a rough proxy.  By this proxy, forecasts of the neutral rate have moved 

down noticeably over the past several years. The median projection of the longer-run 

level of the real federal funds rate was 2-1/4 percent in January 2012, when projections of 

the longer-run federal funds rate were first included in the SEP.  By comparison, the 

median projection for the longer-run real federal funds rate had fallen by 3/4 percentage 

point to 1-1/2 percent in the most recent SEP.8 

Market measures of expected forward rates evidence a similar decline.  For 

example, we can back out an implied 1-year real rate 10 years from now from the 

Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, yield curve.  The most recent readings 

are around 1.3 percent, close to 2 percentage points below the average rate from 1999 

through 2007.  Swaps prices tell a similar story.  The implied expected 1-year real rate 10 

years from now is currently close to 1 percent, again well below levels prior to the 

financial crisis. 

                                                 
7 Here the longer-run real rate is defined as the consensus longer-run nominal federal funds rate minus the 
consensus longer-run rate of CPI inflation.  Because most forecasts of economic conditions far into the 
future are predicated on the economy being at full employment, forecasts of relatively low actual real rates 
are consistent with forecasts of relatively low neutral rates. 
8 In the SEP, longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each 
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.
