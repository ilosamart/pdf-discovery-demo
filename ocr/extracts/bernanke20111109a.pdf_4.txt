Federal Reserve Efforts to Support Small Businesses 

The Federal Reserve System is committed to supporting small business and 

entrepreneurship.  We do that, for example, through research that adds to our stock of 

knowledge about the catalysts for and barriers to entrepreneurship, and through outreach 

programs to help small business owners and other community stakeholders gain access to 

a range of financing and technical assistance.   

For instance, in a recent forum sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and held 

in Jacksonville, Florida, both small business owners and their lenders stressed that it 

takes more than an enterprising spirit to succeed; entrepreneurs also must seek 

appropriate training and resources.  Forum participants emphasized the need to support 

organizations that offer valuable technical assistance and training programs, including 

state and regional economic development offices, small business development centers, 

community colleges, technical schools, and rural cooperative extension offices.  Similar 

forums in Chicago, Atlanta, and Denver--conducted by the Federal Reserve in 

cooperation with the Opportunity Finance Network, a national trade association for 

community development financial institutions (CDFIs)--highlighted examples of banks 

working closely with community development loan funds and other CDFIs to streamline 

client referral processes to match small businesses with appropriate lenders.  Our regional 

meetings also focused on providing capital and support services to minority-owned small
