I am pleased to join you for the ninth biennial Federal Reserve System 

Community Development Research Conference.  This conference has established itself as 

an important venue for sharing research and exchanging ideas on how best to support the 

advancement of low- and moderate-income communities.   

The many economic decisions an individual makes early in his or her working 

life--their first job, how much and what kind of an educational investment to make, how 

to finance that investment, whether to strike out on their own, and whether to rent or buy

similarly leave a lasting mark on the many Americans who came of age in its shadow.  

It is important to understand the headwinds encountered by the Great Recession 

generation as they navigated a daunting job market, and the lessons they have taken from 

the crisis, particularly with respect to investments in education and housing.  And it is 

important to identify what actions can be taken to improve economic outcomes for the 

Great Recession generation, as their experiences will powerfully influence not just 

growth today, but also the contours of opportunity faced by their children.
