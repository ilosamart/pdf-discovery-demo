operational criteria to require banking organizations16 to undertake independent analyses 
of the credit-worthiness of their securitization exposures.17  Implementation in the United 
States of the changes to the Basel Accord contained in the Revisions Document would be 
significantly affected by the need for the agencies to comply with section 939A of the 
Act. 

 The table below provides an overview of where credit ratings are referenced and 
used as the basis for a capital requirement along two dimensions of exposure category 
and capital framework.

III.  Request for Comment  

 This ANPR seeks comment on standards of credit-worthiness other than credit 
ratings that may be used for purposes of the risk-based capital standards.  The various 
alternative approaches in this ANPR may present challenges of feasibility in varying 
degrees.  The agencies would appreciate commenters’ views on the feasibility of 
implementing the suggestions for alternative approaches in this ANPR and any 
methodologies that commenters may provide.    

                                                                                                                                                 
Committee and International Organization for Securities Commissioners); “Enhancements to the Basel II 
Framework” (July, 2009, Basel Committee); and “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector” 
(December, 2009, Basel Committee). 
16 For simplicity, and unless otherwise indicated, this ANPR uses the term “banking organization” to 
include banks, savings associations, and bank holding companies. 
17 These operational criteria would require a bank to have a comprehensive understanding of the risk 
characteristics of its individual securitization exposures; be able to access performance information on the 
underlying pools on an on-going basis in a timely manner; and have a thorough understanding of all 
structural features of a securitization transaction.  Enhancements Document, paragraphs 565(i)-(iv).
