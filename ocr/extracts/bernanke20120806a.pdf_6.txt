Continued work on the measurement of economic well-being will likely lead to 

greater recognition by economists of the contributions of psychology--an area that has 

been explored by pioneers like 2002 Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman.  One topic on the 

frontier of economics and psychology is the neurological basis of human decisions, 

including decisionmaking under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social 

decisionmaking.5  Researchers are investigating behavioral tendencies in a variety of 

circumstances--for instance, by examining human responses to perceived inequality, 

losses, risk, and uncertainty; the need for autonomy; and the importance for well-being of 

social ties and community.  For example, brain imaging research has documented 

differences in the brain regions that light up in response to losses and gains--a clear 

physical manifestation of the “loss aversion” documented in the earlier behavioral studies 

in economics and psychology.6  Evolutionary psychologists suggest that humans 

experienced evolutionary benefits from brain developments that included aversion to loss 

and risk, and from instincts for cooperation that helped strengthen communities.   

Measurement of well-being is an important direction, but just one of many new 

directions for economic measurement being explored in the field generally and at this 

conference in particular.  I am glad to see scholars and practitioners continuing to push 

the frontiers of economic measurement with a broad perspective and with open minds.  

As Arthur Conan Doyle’s immortal character Sherlock Holmes aptly put it, “It is a capital 

mistake to theorize before one has data.”7  As I said at the beginning, good economic
