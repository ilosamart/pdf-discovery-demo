I would note that our monetary policy remains accommodative after the small 

increase in the federal funds rate adopted in December.  And my colleagues and I 

anticipate that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only 

gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate is likely to 

remain, for some time, below the levels that we expect to prevail in the longer run.   

Given the large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC is 

employing new tools to implement monetary policy.  In particular, to raise the federal 

funds rate we increased the interest rate we pay on reserve balances that depository 

institutions hold at the Federal Reserve.  We also employed an overnight reverse 

repurchase facility, through which we interact with a broad range of firms to help provide 

a soft floor for the federal funds rate consistent with our target range.3  These new tools 

have worked well, and the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates have 

increased slightly, as expected.  We will continue to monitor financial market 

developments closely, and we can make adjustments to our tools if necessary to maintain 

control over money market rates.  

At our meeting last week, we left our target for the federal funds rate unchanged.  

Economic data over the intermeeting period suggested that improvement in labor market 

conditions continued even as economic growth slowed late last year.  But further declines 

in oil prices and increases in the foreign exchange value of the dollar suggested that 

inflation would likely remain low for somewhat longer than had been previously 

expected before moving back to 2 percent.  In addition, increased concern about the 

global outlook, particularly the ongoing structural adjustments in China and the effects of
