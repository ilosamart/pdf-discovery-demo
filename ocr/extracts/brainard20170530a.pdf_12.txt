between the yields on longer-dated assets and the path of expected short-term interest 

rates over the holding period.  By some estimates, the effect is modestly above 90 basis 

points currently.9  Thus, balance sheet normalization should be associated with higher 

term premiums, which in turn, other things held equal, should be associated with higher 

long-term Treasury yields.  Most studies find that higher Treasury yields also affect 

yields and prices of other securities:  increasing interest rates faced by private-sector 

borrowers, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive, which tends to boost the 

exchange value of the dollar, and making fixed-income assets more attractive relative to 

stocks, tending to depress share prices.  Together, these channels contribute to a 

tightening in financial conditions.10 

These effects are, of course, in many respects, similar to the effects of increases in 

short-term interest rates. 11  Thus, away from the zero lower bound, the two tools are, to a 

large extent, substitutes for one another.  As a result, the FOMC will be in the unfamiliar 

posture of having two tools available for adjusting monetary policy.  It is, therefore, 

important to clarify how they will be used in relation to each other.  While, under most 

circumstances, the two tools are largely substitutes for one another in terms of their 

effects on the economy the federal funds rate is the tool with which we have the most 

                                                 
9 Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei (2017) estimate that the cumulative effect of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases 
results in a reduction in the 10-year Treasury yield term premium moderately in excess of 90 basis points 
currently. 
10 It seems likely that many investors have developed an expectation of the likely path of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet once the process of normalization is well underway, and these expectations are 
already priced into asset prices.  See, for instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York May 2017

11 There may be differences in the specific ways changes in short-term rates and the balance sheet transmit 
to different asset prices and the exchange rate, although estimates are limited and lack precision.
