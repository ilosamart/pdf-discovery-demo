Second, in describing the costs of the existing arrangements, the paper estimates 

that the Treasury’s post-2008 extension of the weighted average maturity (or duration) of 

the Federal debt offset--in a purely mechanical sense--about 35 percent of the effect of 

the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs on the level of 10-year 

Treasury yields.2  I would challenge this ex post framing of the issue.  Maturity extension 

merely continued a policy begun by the Treasury well before the crisis and was also 

broadly consistent with the Treasury’s past behavior at times of substantial increases in 

borrowing.  My starting point would be that the Federal Open Market Committee did 

what it thought was appropriate ex ante to return the economy to full employment and 

stable prices, taking Treasury decisions concerning debt management as exogenous.   

As the authors acknowledge, there are good reasons to think that any term 

premium effect of the maturity extension must have been much smaller than the 

“35 percent” figure implies.  The paper’s estimate is based solely on what is sometimes 

referred to as the “duration removal” channel.  There are other channels that would not be 

offset by maturity extension--in particular, a channel by which the Federal Reserve 

signals the strength of its commitment to achieving the dual mandate.  My view is that it 

is quite difficult to explain the observed effects of LSAPs on asset prices without 

reference to these other channels.  In addition, according to the authors’ estimates, the 

“announcement effects” of the Treasury’s maturity extension policy seem to be only half 

the size of the effects of comparable Fed announcements. 

The LSAPs tripled the Federal Reserve’s share of outstanding 10-year duration, 

from 12 percent to 36 percent, and had quite significant effects on the prices of financial 

                                                 
2 The term “LSAPs” is used here to include QE1 (that is, the first round of quantitative easing by the Fed), 

QE2 (the second round), the maturity extension program, and QE3 (the third round).
