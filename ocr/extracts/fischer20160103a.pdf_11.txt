Macroprudential tools are primarily regulatory or supervisory in nature and target 

specific activities, markets, and financial institutions.  In the United States, we now have 

some experience with such tools.  The interagency guidance on leveraged lending issued 

in 2013 and the annual coordinated stress tests (the Dodd-Frank Act stress test, or

DFAST, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

of 2010; and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR), focused on the 

capital adequacy of the largest banking firms, are two examples implemented for a few 

years now and for which data are available for an assessment of their effectiveness.16

An important new element of the post-crisis capital regime is the Countercyclical 

Capital Buffer (CCyB), which the Federal Reserve put out for comment on December 21,

2015.17 The CCyB is designed to be activated when there is an elevated risk of above-

normal losses in the future and released when the risk of above-normal losses recedes.

The higher levels of capital would increase the resilience of the largest banks because 

they would be better positioned to absorb the losses.  

Despite the tools that the Fed can use to support financial stability, including the 

Fed’s authority to impose margin requirements on secured financing transactions, the Fed 

has fewer macroprudential tools at its command than some other central banks, 

particularly with respect to real estate.  Regulators in many countries facing or 

anticipating problems with rising real estate prices often turn to controls over loan-to-

value or debt-to-income ratios. Such measures are potentially important, as the real 

estate sector is the most common source of the beginnings of financial instability.  In the
