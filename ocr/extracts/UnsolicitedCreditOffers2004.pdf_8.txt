receiving unwanted “junk mail,” these observers note that prescreened solicitations can 
become lost or stolen and potentially lead to fraudulent activity that may impair a 
consumer’s credit rating or result in out-of-pocket losses. Some also believe that 
individuals’ rights to privacy are compromised when creditors or insurers use CRA 
records to contact them through prescreened solicitations. Finally, some observers are 
concerned that the large volume of credit offers made through prescreened solicitations 
might encourage some consumers to take on more debt than they can reasonably handle. 

This report has not found that prescreened solicitations have a significant bearing on the 
extent of these problems, and, therefore, finds that further restrictions on prescreened 
solicitations are not likely to alleviate such problems. Moreover, any substantive 
restrictions would be likely to significantly reduce the beneficial effects of prescreened 
solicitations on competition and consumer access to credit and insurance. These findings 
and conclusions are covered in more detail below. 

Availability and Use of Opt-Out Provisions 

Consumers who prefer not to receive prescreened written offers of credit or insurance are 
able to act on this preference through a process of “opting out.” The most important 
means of opting out is by using the statutory mechanism contained in section 604 of the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which governs the use of prescreening techniques. 
Section 604 specifically establishes a set of rules that regulate how creditors and insurers 
may use CRA records as the basis for sending unsolicited firm offers of credit or 
insurance to consumers. It also prescribes a mechanism by which consumers can elect 
not to receive these prescreened solicitations by opting out. Section 604 further requires 
creditors and insurers using prescreening to notify consumers of this opt-out right in each 
prescreened solicitation they send. 

Beyond the statutory provision for opting out, voluntary mechanisms established by 
industry groups and individual companies permit consumers to eliminate their names 
from listings used for prescreened written offers of credit or insurance. These voluntary 
mechanisms are important in the marketplace, accounting for an estimated one-third of 
the individuals on the opt-out lists maintained by the national CRAs. 

Currently, about 6 percent of consumers with credit records have opted out of receiving 
prescreened written offers of credit or insurance. The large number of individuals who 
have opted out suggests that it is not especially difficult to do so if individuals are aware 
of this option. A consumer survey indicates that about one-fifth of consumers are aware 
of their right under federal law not to receive prescreened solicitations. If awareness of 
this right was more widespread, it is likely that more consumers would opt out. 

Analysis of CRA records indicates that consumers with more credit accounts are more 
likely to opt out than those with fewer accounts. The higher opt-out rate for those with a 
relatively large number of credit relationships may indicate that such individuals (1) are
