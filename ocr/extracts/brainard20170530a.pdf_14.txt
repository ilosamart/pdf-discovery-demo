normalization, I favor an approach of monitoring money markets carefully to gauge the 

appropriate longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy 

implementation. 

Finally, while subordination of the balance sheet to the federal funds rate should 

be our baseline policy, in my view, there may be circumstances when we may need to 

rely on the balance sheet more actively.  During the period when the balance sheet is 

running down, if the economy encounters significant adverse shocks, it may be 

appropriate to commence the reinvestment of principal payments again in order to 

preserve conventional policy space.   

Conclusion 

In recent quarters, the balance of risks has become more favorable, the global 

outlook has brightened, and financial conditions have eased on net.  With the labor 

market continuing to strengthen, and GDP growth expected to rebound in the second 

quarter, it likely will be appropriate soon to adjust the federal funds rate. And if the 

economy evolves in line with the SEP median path, the federal funds rate will likely 

approach the point at which normalization can be considered well under way before too 

long, when it will be appropriate to adjust balance sheet policy.  I support an approach 

that retains the federal funds rate as the primary tool for adjusting monetary policy, sets 

the balance sheet to shrink in a gradual and predictable way for both Treasury securities 

and MBS, and avoids spikes in redemptions.  

While that remains my baseline expectation, I will be watching carefully for any 

signs that progress toward our inflation objective is slowing.  With a low neutral real rate, 

achieving our symmetric inflation target is more important than ever in order to preserve
