prices might resume declines, the values of businesses large and small would drop, and, 

critically, unemployment would likely start to rise again.  Such outcomes would 

ultimately not be good for savers or anyone else.

 I will turn, finally, to the question of how the Federal Reserve is held accountable 

in a democratic society.  

The Federal Reserve was created by the Congress, now almost a century ago.  In 

the Federal Reserve Act and subsequent legislation, the Congress laid out the central 

bankâ€™s goals and powers, and the Fed is responsible to the Congress for meeting its

the same time, the Congress wisely designed the Federal Reserve to be insulated from 

short-term political pressures.  For example, members of the Federal Reserve Board are 

appointed to staggered, 14-year terms, with the result that some members may serve 

through several Administrations.  Research and practical experience have established that 

freeing the central bank from short-term political pressures leads to better monetary
