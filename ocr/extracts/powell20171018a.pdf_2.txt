banking and payments services.  I will discuss the roles of banks, fintech companies, and 

other stakeholders in moving the United States forward to a better payment system.  I will

in pursuing that goal.  I will argue that, for policymakers as well as the private sector, the 

challenge is to embrace technology as a means of improving convenience and speed in 

the delivery of financial services, while also assuring the security and privacy necessary 

to sustain the public’s trust.    As always, the views I express here are my own.
