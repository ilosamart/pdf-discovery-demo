family members increased between 2006 and 2010 by over 1 million more than would be 

expected by the demographic trend.9  In this downturn, the unemployment rate among 

younger adults rose by more than among the population as a whole.  And when they are 

unemployed or have low incomes, younger individuals are particularly likely to live with 

their parents or older family members rather than moving out on their own.   

As the unemployment rate continues to decline--albeit likely at a slower pace than 

any of us would like--household formation and housing demand should increase.  One 

model suggests that household formation could increase to 1-1/2 million or more per 

year.  If, as seems likely, however, many of these new households rent rather than buy 

their homes, the effect on rental housing could be stronger than for owner-occupied 

homes, and applications for mortgages to purchase homes might recover only slowly. 

Evidence to date of an increase in home purchases by owner-occupiers--as 

opposed to investors--is scarce.  The most discouraging evidence comes from purchase 

mortgage originations.  Data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 

(HMDA) indicate that in 2011, purchase mortgage originations hit their lowest level 

since the early 1990s.  According to Federal Reserve staff estimates, purchase 

originations remained near these subdued levels in 2012 even as mortgage rates hit 

historic lows. 

The drop in purchase mortgage originations, although widespread, has been most 

pronounced among borrowers with low credit scores.  For example, between 2007 and 

2012, purchase originations fell by about 30 percent for borrowers with credit scores 

above 780, compared with a fall of about 90 percent for borrowers with credit scores
