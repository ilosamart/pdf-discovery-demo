credit has dropped every month since that time and is currently about 15 percent lower 

than it was at the time of the Lehman Brothers Holdings bankruptcy.  Although our 

economy has experienced other long episodes in which revolving credit growth has 

slowed, we have never seen such a prolonged period of outright decline.   

As overall consumer spending weakened significantly over the course of the 

recession and the early stages of the recovery, a proportionate decline in revolving credit 

used to finance purchases might actually have been expected.  However, the decrease in 

revolving credit appeared to outpace the contemporaneous decline in spending during the 

recession, and, so far in the recovery, revolving credit has continued to decrease even as 

spending has turned up.  This suggests that there are factors at work other than cyclical 

spending weakness.  Within this context, it is helpful to consider the three main reasons 

that net borrowing--that is, the change in credit outstanding--can decrease:  First, 

households can charge less on their revolving accounts; second, households can pay off a 

larger share of their balances each month; or third, households can default on (or lenders 

can charge off) their existing balances.   

Taking the three factors in reverse order, consider first the role of cardholder 

defaults.  As the economy weakened in 2008 and 2009, an increasing number of 

households found it difficult to pay their credit card bills on time.  With nearly 10 percent 

of the workforce unemployed and many more underemployed, a significant number of 

households experienced sharply reduced incomes.  Weakness in the housing market also 

contributed to financial strains, as many households could no longer easily tap into home
