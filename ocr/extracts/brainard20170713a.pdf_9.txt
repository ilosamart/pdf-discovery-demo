that benefit is likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects of a tightening of domestic 

monetary policy when domestic conditions would not otherwise call for it.  Such 

considerations may have played a role in the market dynamics experienced by China as 

discussions about initiating rate hikes progressed in the United States in the second half 

of 2015 and early 2016.8     

Next let’s explore alternative approaches to policy normalization by countries 

facing a similar need to tighten.  This question is timely; with synchronous expansions 

now underway, we may be approaching a turning point before too long.  In particular, 

let’s consider the case when two large countries, which are assumed identical for the sake 

of simplicity, experience the same positive shock to domestic demand.  Under these 

assumptions, if both economies were to choose the same normalization strategy--putting 

primary reliance on either the balance sheet or short-term interest rates--the implications 

for the exchange rate and net exports are the same:  In both cases, the exchange rate 

between the two countries does not change, and neither do net exports between the 

countries.  Each central bank would adjust interest rates by the same amount--enough to 

offset the stimulus from the demand shock--and with interest differentials unchanged, 

there would be no pressure on the exchange rate between them to move.9  Of course, if 

there are other economies in the rest of the world that do not experience the same shock, 

the choice of normalization strategy does matter, similar to the analysis of spillovers from 

                                                 
8 See Brainard (2015a).  A number of recent studies have considered financial spillovers to EMEs, 
including Rey (2014) and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2015).  The analysis of Hofmann, Shim, and 
Shin (2016) suggests that EMEs may be hurt more if their banks or nonfinancial corporations have 
relatively large dollar liabilities, as the larger dollar appreciation associated with the policy rate tool would 
precipitate greater EME balance sheet deterioration in this case. 
9 In this simple example, in which the two countries are hit by identical shocks, the offset in spillovers 
between the two economies will be complete.  If one country faces a larger aggregate demand shock than 
the other, then the situation becomes more like the one-country case we examined before, the policy 
adjustments lead to spillovers of different magnitudes, and the offset will be partial.
