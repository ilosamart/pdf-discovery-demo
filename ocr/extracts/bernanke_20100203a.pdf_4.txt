Americaâ€™s central bank, without compromising our ability to conduct policy in the public 

interest.   

 These are just some of the challenges that we will all face in the coming months and 

years.  I thank you for the many expressions of support I received during the confirmation 

process, for your hard work and dedication, and for your service to your country.  I look forward 

to continuing to work with all of you to strengthen our economy and to make the Federal 

Reserve as effective as it can possibly be in advancing the economic wellbeing of all Americans.  

Thank you.
