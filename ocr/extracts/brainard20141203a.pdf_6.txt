institutions to build substantial loss-absorbing buffers and to internalize the costs of 

undertaking activities that pose risks to the system.  This framework represents a 

substantial improvement on structural resilience relative to the pre-crisis framework 

across a number of dimensions:  It is forward looking in assessing risks under severely 

stressed conditions, and it is explicitly macroprudential in design so that bank 

management internalizes risks not only to the safety and soundness of their own 

institution, but also to the system as a whole. 

Reforms undertaken in recent years help ensure that institutions that are large, 

internationally active, and interconnected face significantly higher capital and liquidity 

charges when undertaking risky activities.  The core of the framework is the requirement 

of a very substantial stack of common equity to absorb shocks and to provide incentives 

against excessive risk-taking.  The new framework imposes “belts and suspenders” on the 

capital cushion by requiring a simple, non-risk-adjusted ceiling on leverage as well as 

requiring the largest banking firms to satisfy two sets of risk-based capital requirements:  

one derived from internal models and a second based on standardized supervisory risk 

weights.  Beyond that, the largest, most complex firms will face an additional common 

equity requirement that reflects the risk they pose to the system and an additional layer of 

loss absorbency on top of that to provide adequate support to operating subsidiaries in 

resolution.  Large financial institutions are also required to maintain substantial buffers of 

high-quality liquid assets calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in 

stressed conditions.  Similar to the equity cushions, the liquidity buffers are calibrated to 

affect disproportionately those financial institutions that pose the greatest risks.
