It is a pleasure to be at Brookings today for this forum on the industrial 

organization (IO) of the financial industry.  As I have suggested previously, when one 

considers the significance of issues concerning industry structure for the design of an 

effective and efficient regulatory system to contain systemic risk, it is surprising that 

relatively little research has been undertaken in this area, even in the aftermath of the 

financial crisis.1   

Of course, good empirical research takes time, and I welcome this opportunity to 

contribute to a discussion of an agenda for research on industry structure.  I will begin by 

briefly explaining why this agenda is both important and challenging.  Then I will 

address one issue of particular significance--that of scale and scope economies, especially 

as they relate to policy proposals directed at the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem in 

financial markets. 

The Promise and Challenge of an IO Research Agenda for the Financial Industry 

The value of an IO research agenda for shaping a regulatory system to protect 

financial stability lies both in ascertaining costs that may result from specific regulatory 

measures and in revealing industry dynamics that may suggest how regulatory measures 

may be more effective. 

The importance of understanding the costs of various regulatory measures is self-

evident.  As I will discuss shortly, IO can help determine the circumstances in which firm 

size or industry concentration is associated with economies of scope and scale that carry

(2012) working paper, which shows that about 30 large and highly interconnected “central dealers” provide 
valuable forms of liquidity to hundreds of smaller periphery dealers while simultaneously offering more 
immediate, but more expensive, execution to investors relative to those offered to periphery firms.  Dan Li
