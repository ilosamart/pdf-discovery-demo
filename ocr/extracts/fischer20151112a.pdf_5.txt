appreciation shown by the thin red line in figure 2, which indicates that real imports rise 

only about 3-3/4 percent after three years.7   

Figure 3 uses these results to gauge how a 10 percent dollar appreciation would 

reduce U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) through the net export channels we have just 

discussed.  The staff’s model indicates that the direct effects on GDP through net exports 

are large, with GDP falling over 1-1/2 percent below baseline after three years.  

Moreover, the effects materialize quite gradually, with over half of the adverse effects on 

GDP occurring at a horizon of more than a year.   

In interpreting these estimated effects on GDP, it is important to underscore that 

the estimates do not take account of any offset due to monetary policy easing--a key 

consideration that I will discuss shortly.  Even so, recalling that the dollar’s actual 

appreciation has been about 15 percent, the model estimates suggest that the cumulative 

reduction in U.S. aggregate demand from the dollar’s appreciation is likely to total almost 

2-1/2 percent of GDP after three years--in the absence of policy action to boost private 

demand or government spending.  Given these perhaps surprisingly large effects, an 

obvious question is, how well has the model done so far in accounting for the actual 

behavior of U.S. real net exports?  While trade flows are affected by many factors that are 

difficult to capture in models--such as the labor disputes at major ports that occurred 

earlier this year--the drag from net exports over the past year does appear to be relatively 

close to the estimated effect implied by the staff’s econometric trade model, with net 

                                                   
7 In the staff’s trade model, imports are specified to depend on GDP in addition to the exchange rate.  The 
estimates shown in figure 2 simply show the effects arising through the latter channel.  Similarly for 
exports, the staff’s model also controls for changes in a trade-weighted aggregate of foreign GDP, with the 
estimates in figure 2 showing only the effects from a change in the value of the dollar.
