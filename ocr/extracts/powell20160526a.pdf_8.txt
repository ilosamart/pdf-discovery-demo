these factors are roughly offsetting.  Of course, estimates of the natural rate are highly 

uncertain.10     

Trends in labor force participation add another element of uncertainty.  

Participation has been declining since about 2000 and is estimated to have a trend rate of 

decline of 20 to 30 basis points per year, driven by population aging and other longer-

term trends such as the decline in participation by prime-age males.  But the participation 

rate fell sharply after the crisis, faster than its apparent trend.  It has been important to 

understand how much of the post-crisis decline is cyclical, and thus amenable to repair by 

supportive policies, and how much is secular, due either to longer-run trends or to 

irreversible crisis-related damage.  It has been a relief to see the participation rate 

improve over the past two years relative to estimates of its trend; indeed, participation is 

now close to some such estimates.11  Still, despite this relative improvement, the 

performance of the U.S. economy on this dimension has been poor relative to that of 

most OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.  For 

example, in the prime-age group of 25 to 54, the United States experienced a 2 

                                                 
10 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification and uncertainty about the parameter 
estimates given the model.  The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 95 percent 
confidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate.  See Douglas Staiger, 
James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and 
Strategy (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).

rate, while the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate is above the current rate.  See Stephanie Aaronson,
