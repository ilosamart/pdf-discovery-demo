I would like to talk today about how one might explicitly incorporate financial 

stability considerations into a monetary policy framework.1  Doing so involves tackling 

two questions--one that is relatively easy and one that is much harder.  The easier 

question is, should financial stability concerns, in principle, influence monetary policy 

decisions?  To be specific, are there cases in which one might tolerate a larger forecast 

shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its full-employment level than one 

would otherwise, because of a concern that a more accommodative policy might entail a 

heightened risk of some sort of adverse financial market outcome?  This question is about 

theory, not empirical magnitudes, and, in my view, the theoretical answer is a clear “yes.”  

I will say a bit more about why shortly, but let me stress that I am not breaking any new 

conceptual ground here; the basic argument has been laid out by a number of others, 

including Woodford and Kocherlakota.2  

The second question is, how does one operationalize the theory?  What sorts of 

data should one look to, and what sorts of empirical methods should one use, to calibrate 

by how much the stance of monetary policy should be altered relative to the case in which 

financial stability considerations are completely set aside?  This question is very difficult.  

In the interests of advancing the conversation, I will venture some tentative thoughts on 

one possible approach, which is somewhat different than what I have seen in other recent 

work on this topic.  While I hope to convince you that this path is worth exploring, I 

cannot say that I know yet exactly where it will lead--and, in particular, whether it will 

ultimately deliver monetary policy prescriptions that differ in a quantitatively meaningful
