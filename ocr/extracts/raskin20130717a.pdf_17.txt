fundamentals and more by speculation and weak underwriting. Ultimately, this drove 

house prices to unsustainably high levels. Regulatory intervention was much too late.  

The U.S. regulatory system is fragmented, and, hence, it takes time to choose and 

implement policies and calibrate them appropriately. It takes time to cooperate, 

coordinate, and harmonize responses. But such is today’s imperative. We must complete 

in a timely fashion the post-Basel III and Dodd-Frank requirements. It is particularly 

important to increase the amount, and improve the quality, of required minimum capital; 

to continue stress testing and capital planning; and to reduce overreliance on unstable 

short-term wholesale funding. These reforms will build resilience to whatever shocks 

may come, and will reduce the potential for asset bubbles and excessive credit growth, 

leverage, maturity transformation, reliance on unstable short-term wholesale funding, 

and, thus, the potential for future financial crises. 

Still, if regulators become fixated on the tools at the expense of compliance and 

enforcement, the tools themselves will be meaningless. Only when such tools--be they 

capital-focused, liquidity-focused, margin--and haircut-focused, or underwriting-focused-

-are fully embedded into a comprehensive system of prudential regulation will they reach 

their potential in mitigating the growth of asset bubbles and providing resiliency against 

the awful consequences attendant to their destruction.  

Thank you for your time today. I’m interested in your comments and questions.
