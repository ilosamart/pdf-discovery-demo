confronted by the potential failure of a large bank, which is to intervene to save the bank 

and some of its noninsured creditors.24  In the words of Governor Tarullo, “… no matter 

what its general economic policy principles, a government faced with the possibility of a 

cascading financial crisis that could bring down its national economy tends to err on the 

side of intervention.”25   

I will start by discussing some of the main steps in the links between TBTF and 

the crisis, and between the financial sector reform program and TBTF.  We begin with 

the link between TBTF and government intervention: Once investors believe that 

governments will intervene to prevent large banks from becoming bankrupt, they become 

willing to lend to these banks at lower rates than they would lend without the implicit 

guarantee.  This could lead to such banks becoming larger than optimal and to 

encouraging them to take more risks than they would absent expected government 

intervention to reduce the likelihood of their becoming bankrupt.   

A great deal of empirical work has attempted to measure the premium--in terms 

of a lower cost of financing--that the large banks typically receive.  The results vary, but 

a representative set of estimates--that of the International Monetary Fund in its April 

2014 issue of the Global Financial Stability Report--reports that in 2013 their estimates 

of the premium were approximately 15 basis points in the United States, 25-60 basis 

points in Japan, 20-60 basis points in the United Kingdom, and 60-90 basis points in the
