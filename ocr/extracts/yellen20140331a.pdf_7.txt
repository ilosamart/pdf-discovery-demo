I have described the experiences of Dorine, Jermaine, and Vicki because they tell 

us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot.  First, they are a reminder 

that there are real people behind the statistics, struggling to get by and eager for the 

opportunity to build better lives.  Second, their experiences show some of the uniquely 

challenging and lasting effects of the Great Recession.  Recognizing and trying to 

understand these effects helps provide a clearer picture of the progress we have made in 

the recovery, as well as a view of just how far we still have to go.   

And based on the evidence available, it is clear to me that the U.S. economy is 

still considerably short of the two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.  

The first of those goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of 

employment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate.  Most of my 

colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I estimate that the unemployment 

rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and 

5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in February.   

The other goal assigned by the Congress is stable prices, which means keeping 

inflation under control.  In the past, there have been times when these two goals 

conflicted--fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the 

unemployment rate.  But that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below 

2 percent, the Fedâ€™s longer-term goal.  

The Federal Reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously.  One reason why I 

believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to 

the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see
