The Great Recession Generation and Economic Mobility 

Today’s young people are the fulcrum of the economic mobility agenda.  Those 

who have come of age in the shadow of the Great Recession have experienced substantial 

risks and faced daunting challenges in establishing themselves independently in their 

work lives and their home lives.  By studying these effects and the actions that can 

support the resilience of the Great Recession generation, we will strengthen not only 

today’s recovery, but also the opportunities facing tomorrow’s children. 

So it is particularly heartening that, despite the challenges of coming of age in the 

Great Recession, today’s young adults--including minorities--remain optimistic about 

their future.30  The challenge for practitioners and the research community is to deliver 

on this youthful optimism through policies and opportunities that promote strong and 

equitable economic growth. 

The Federal Open Market Committee has been playing an important role by 

pursuing policies aimed at achieving maximum employment in the context of price 

stability.  Monetary policy has remained accommodative over an extended period, which 

has supported labor market recovery--with significant improvement in overall 

unemployment, increases in job openings, and recent declines in underemployment--

while inflation has remained below its target.  In addition, the Federal Reserve System, 

through its research and analysis of economic data, provides important insights on the 

dynamics of the labor market, investments in education, and the housing sector.
