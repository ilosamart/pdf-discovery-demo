them.  It would be worthwhile to consider amendments to these statutory provisions to carve out 

their applicability to community banks. 

I have previously suggested two candidates for consideration: the Volcker rule and the 

incentive compensation requirements in section 956 of Dodd-Frank.15  The risks addressed by 

these statutory provisions are far more significant at larger institutions than they are at 

community banks.16  Moreover, in the unlikely event that a community bank engages in practices 

in either of these areas that raise heightened concerns, we would be able to address these 

concerns as part of the normal safety-and-soundness supervisory process.  While the banking 

agencies have used the other method of tiering and tried to tailor the Volcker rule (as we will do 

with section 956), I believe that both community banks and supervisors would benefit from not 

having to focus on formal compliance with regulation of matters that are unlikely to pose 

problems at smaller banks. 

Today I would like to add a third candidate for consideration—a statutory amendment 

that would permit the Federal Reserve Board to raise the size of banks covered by our Small 

Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.17  As background, the Board originally issued the 

policy statement in 1980 to facilitate the transfer of ownership of small community banks.  The 

Board generally discourages the use of debt by bank holding companies to finance acquisitions, 

                                                 
15 The Volcker rule applies to all banking entities that engage in prohibited activities, irrespective of size, and the 

Dodd-Frank incentive compensation requirements apply to all banks and holding companies with total assets of 

$1 billion or more. 
16 As indicated in guidance for community banks that was issued with the final Volcker rule, in practice the agencies 

believe that the vast majority of community banks do not engage in prohibited activities.  Because they are not 

expressly exempted from the Volcker rule provisions, however, if community bankers have any questions about 

whether their bank engages in prohibited activities, they may feel obliged to conduct due diligence on a very 

complex rule.  Given the limited de facto applicability to community banks, I would suggest that exempting them 

from Volcker compliance and resolving issues through the supervisory process would be a more effective use of 

bank and supervisory resources.  See Board of Governors, FDIC, and OCC (2013), “The Volcker Rule: Community 

Bank Applicability,” December 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20131210a4.pdf.
