extent to which these difficulties are a function of essentially firm-specific factors or a harbinger 

of market-wide funding stress.    

A revised version of the NSFR has recently been released by the Basel Committee.12  It 

complements the LCR by looking beyond a 30-day period to achieve a stable funding profile for 

firms more generally.  In this regard, it is important to recall that the deterioration of funding 

markets began well before the financial crisis reached its acute stages.  In the summer of 2007, 

responding to signs of trouble in the subprime mortgage markets, creditors reduced the maturities 

of funding they were willing to provide to financial intermediaries that had been creating and 

holding securities backed by subprime--and eventually other--mortgages.13  This process left 

those intermediaries in increasingly fragile funding positions, and by the time Lehman Brothers 

collapsed in September 2008, the system was primed for a devastating run.  Given the possibility 

of this type of sustained erosion of firm funding structures over an extended period, simply 

requiring firms to hold a liquidity buffer against 30-day outflows, as required by the LCR, would 

be insufficient. 

 While there is thus a need for a longer-term structural standard such as the NSFR, the 

conceptual challenges in crafting it were greater than in designing the LCR.  Simply extending 

the LCR to one-year--that is, requiring firms to hold enough liquidity to survive a one-year 

funding market freeze--seemed the kind of excessive self-insurance that would lead to 

undesirably reduced maturity transformation and financial intermediation.  So a different set of 

standards needed to be developed, which themselves occasioned considerable discussion about 

the effects and incentives they would create.  Also, one could argue that the NSFR should have
