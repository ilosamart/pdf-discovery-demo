lending through the discount window.  At the same time, however, banks became extremely 

reluctant to borrow from the Federal Reserve for fear that their borrowing would become known 

and thus cast doubt on their financial condition.  Importantly, the crisis also involved major 

disruptions of important funding markets for other institutions.  Commercial paper markets no 

longer channeled funds to lenders or to nonfinancial businesses, investment banks encountered 

difficulties borrowing even on a short-term and secured basis as lenders began to have doubts 

about some of the underlying collateral, banks overseas could not rely on the foreign currency 

swap market to fund their dollar assets beyond the very shortest terms, investors pulled out from 

money market mutual funds, and most securitization markets shut down.  These disruptions to 

financing markets posed the same threats to the availability of credit to households and 

businesses that runs on banks created in the more bank-centric financial system of the 1800s and 

most of the 1900s.  As a result, intermediaries unable to fund themselves were forced to sell 

assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the crisis; moreover, they were unwilling to assume 

the risks necessary to make markets in the debt and securitization instruments that were critical 

channels supporting household and business borrowing--and households and businesses unable 

to borrow were thus unable to spend, thereby deepening the recession. 

These liquidity pressures were evident in nearly every major country, and every central 

bank had to adapt its liquidity facilities to some degree in addressing these strains.  At the 

Federal Reserve, we had to adapt somewhat more than most, partly because the scope of our 

activities prior to the crisis was fairly narrow--particularly relative to the expanding scope of 

intermediation outside the banking sector--and partly because the effect of the crisis was heaviest 

on dollar funding markets.  Initially, to make credit more available to banks, we reduced the 

spread of the discount rate over the target federal funds rate, lengthened the maximum maturity
