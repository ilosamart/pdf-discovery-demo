facilitate the flow of credit to small businesses--for instance, by identifying specific credit 

gaps, clarifying examiner expectations and procedures, improving coordination of small 

business support services, and ensuring the availability of technical assistance for loan 

applications.  Thus we can help ensure that small businesses are able to participate in and 

contribute to the recovery.  The findings from the entire series of meetings sponsored by 

the Federal Reserve will be presented at a culminating conference at the Board of 

Governors in Washington later this summer. 

Learning from people engaged with small businesses and small business credit, 

like those here today, is vital if we are to make progress.  I look forward to hearing your 

ideas and concerns, and thank you again for joining us.
