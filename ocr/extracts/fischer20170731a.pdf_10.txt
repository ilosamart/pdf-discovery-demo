forces acting on U.S. interest rates as the “global saving glut,” with particular reference to 

emerging market economies that were running persistent current account surpluses, 

sometimes as a result of specific policy decisions regarding exchange rates, reserve 

accumulation, and fiscal policy.14  The global saving glut was also a factor in the 

“Greenspan conundrum,” or the observation that a series of Federal Reserve rate hikes 

over the period from 2004 to 2006 seemed to have little effect on longer-term interest 

rates in the United States.  As shown in figure 5, the deterioration of the U.S. deficit in 

the early 2000s was matched by growing surpluses in the emerging markets, particularly 

in emerging Asia and China as well as OPEC.  The explosive growth of the U.S. current 

account deficit from 2001 to 2006, coincident with falling interest rates both in the 

United States and globally, supports the notion that higher foreign saving relative to 

foreign investment was likely holding down U.S. interest rates at the time.   

What can the distribution of global current accounts tell us about international 

spillovers in the post-crisis era?  As shown in figure 6, the most notable development has 

been the almost exact reversal of the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit 

observed during the time of the global saving glut.  Has the global saving glut of the mid-

2000s faded away?  Falling interest rates over the period that the U.S. deficit narrowed 

suggest not.15  If a shrinking supply of foreign saving, the reversal of the global saving 

glut, was behind the narrowing of the U.S. deficit, then the tendency would have been for 

equilibrium real interest rates to have increased.16  Rather, falling equilibrium rates

15 While it is unsurprising that interest rates fell sharply during the recession that followed the financial 
crisis, it is less apparent that equilibrium rates should have fallen so sharply or remain so low almost a 
decade later following the cyclical recovery in the United States and many other countries.
