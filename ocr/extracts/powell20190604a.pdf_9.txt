traditional interest rate tool.  In any case, we have a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate 

what mix of these tools is likely to work best when the next ELB episode arrives.  

Perhaps it is time to retire the term “unconventional” when referring to tools that 

were used in the crisis.  We know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some 

form in future ELB spells, which we hope will be rare.  We now have a significant body 

of evidence regarding the effectiveness, costs, and risks of these tools, including those 

used by the FOMC and others tried elsewhere.  Our plans must take advantage of this 

growing understanding as assessments are refined.  

The third question concerns improving communication, which I discussed earlier 

from the standpoint of governance and accountability.  But transparency also plays a 

central role in policy effectiveness through its effects on the expectations of households 

and businesses.  Of course, this was the major insight behind the transparency revolution 

in central banking over the past few decades.  Today, central banks publicly share a large 

and ever-increasing amount of information about policy.  But policymakers and 

commentators inside and outside central banks sometimes question whether all of the 

transparency adds up to effective communication.14   

The FOMC’s famous dot plot is one example.  A focus on the median forecast 

amounts to emphasizing what the typical FOMC participant would do if things go as 

expected.  But we have been living in times characterized by large, frequent, unexpected 

changes in the underlying structure of the economy.15  In this environment, the most 

                                                 
14 A 2016 Brookings conference titled “Understanding Fedspeak” (see 
https://www.brookings.edu/events/understanding-fedspeak) raised several aspects of this issue.  For 
example, Olson and Wessel (2016a) presented results of a survey of those who follow the Fed closely; in an 
op-ed (2016b), they noted that “Some 73 percent of academics said Fed communications helps the markets; 
only 44 percent of private-sector Fed watchers agreed.”
