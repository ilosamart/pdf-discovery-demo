Fast forwarding, a host of Depression-era reforms helped avoid, for the next 

three-quarters of a century, a systemic financial crisis and the associated severe economic 

dislocation--the longest such period in American history.  Those decades saw many 

advances in monetary policy and in bank regulatory policy, but the appropriate role for 

government in managing threats to the broader financial system remained unresolved.  

Periodic bouts of financial stress during this period--such as the Latin American debt 

crisis, the savings and loan crisis, and the Russian debt default--were met with 

improvised responses.  Policymakers conjured fixes from a mixture of private-sector 

rescues, emergency liquidity, occasional implicit or explicit bailouts, and monetary 

accommodation.  Outside of these crisis responses, however, systemic issues were not a 

central focus of policy.  

The Global Financial Crisis demonstrated, in the clearest way, the limits of this 

approach.  Highly inventive and courageous improvisation amid scenes of great drama 

helped avoid another Great Depression, but failed to prevent the most severe recession in 

75 years.  The crisis made clear that there can be no macroeconomic stability without 

financial stability, and that systemic stability risks often take root and blossom in good 

times.3  Thus, as the emergency phase of the crisis subsided, Congress, the Fed, and the 

other financial regulators began developing a fundamentally different approach to 

financial stability.  Instead of relying on improvised responses after crises strike, 

policymakers now constantly monitor vulnerabilities and require firms to plan in advance
