fiscal and monetary--could be relied on to help keep the economy at full 

employment with a reasonable growth rate. 

Recently, Larry Summers has forcefully restated the secular stagnation 

hypothesis, and argued that it accounts for the current slowness of economic 

growth in the United States and the rest of the industrialized world.  The 

theoretical case for secular stagnation in the sense of a shortage of demand is 

tied to the question of the level of the interest rate that would be needed to 

generate a situation of full employment.  If the equilibrium interest rate is 

negative, or very small, the economy is likely to find itself growing slowly, 

and frequently encountering the zero lower bound on the interest rate.    

Research has shown a declining trend in estimates of the equilibrium interest 

rate.  That finding has become more firmly established since the start of the 

Great Recession and the global financial crisis.11  Moreover, the level of the 

equilibrium interest rate seems likely to rise only gradually to a longer-run 

level that would still be quite low by historical standards.   

What factors determine the equilibrium interest rate?  Fundamentally, the 

balance of saving and investment demands.  Several trends have been cited as 

possible factors contributing to a decline in the long-run equilibrium real rate.  

One likely factor is persistent weakness in aggregate demand.  Among the 

many reasons for that, as Larry Summers has noted, is that the amount of

extensions of the original Laubach and Williams (2003) framework.  An international perspective on 
medium-to-long-run real interest rates is provided by U.S. Executive Office of the President (2015).  
Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Hall (2014) discuss the long-lived effects of financial crises on economic 
performance.  See also Hamilton and others (2015).  I have, in addition, drawn on Fischer (forthcoming).
