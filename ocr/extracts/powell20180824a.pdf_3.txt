that, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today I will step back from 

these. 

In keeping with the spirit of this year’s symposium topic--the changing structures 

of the economy--I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number of 

longer-term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary 

policy.  For example, real wages, particularly for medium- and low-income workers, have 

grown quite slowly in recent decades.  Economic mobility in the United States has 

declined and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2  Addressing the 

federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes 

increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires.  Finally, it is difficult to 

say when or whether the economy will break out of its low-productivity mode of the past 

decade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise meaningfully over time.   

My FOMC colleagues and I believe that we can best support progress on these 

longer-term issues by pursuing the Federal Reserve’s mandate and supporting continued 

economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent.  The topic of 

managing uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient.  I will focus today on 

one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium--uncertainty 

around the location of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of 

unemployment.  A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise 

in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:
