least according to these forecasts) to around 3 percent at the end of 2014.  The forecasts 

in chart 4 imply a total increase of between 200 and 300 basis points in long-term yields 

between now and 2017.  

Of course, the forecasts in chart 4 are just forecasts, and reality might well turn 

out to be different.  Chart 5 provides three complementary approaches to summarizing 

the uncertainty surrounding forecasts of long-term rates.  The dark gray bars in the chart 

are based on the range of forecasts reported in the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, the blue 

bars are based on the historical uncertainty regarding long-term interest rates as reflected 

in the Board staffâ€™s FRB/US model of the U.S. economy, and the orange bars give a 

market-based measure of uncertainty derived from swaptions.  These three different 

measures give a broadly similar picture about the upside and downside risks to the 

forecasts of long-term rates.  Rates 100 basis points higher than the expected paths in 

chart 4 by 2014 are certainly plausible outcomes as judged by each of the three measures, 

and this uncertainty grows to as much as 175 basis points by 2017.  Note, though, that 

while the risk of an unexpected rise in interest rates has drawn much attention, the level 

of long-term interest rates also could prove to be lower than forecast.  Indeed, by the 

measures shown in chart 5, the upside and downside risks to the level of rates are roughly 

symmetric as of 2017.  

We also have some historical experience with increases in rates during tightening 

cycles to consider.  For example, in 1994, 10-year Treasury yields rose about 220 basis 

points over the course of a year, reflecting an unexpected quickening in the pace of 

economic growth and signs of building inflation pressures.  This increase in long-term 

rates appears to have reflected a mix of a pronounced rise in the expected path of the
