world have significant cross-border operations exacerbated the shortcomings.  While banks were 

growing in size, integrating traditional lending and capital markets in ever more complicated 

ways and relying increasingly on vulnerable short-term wholesale funding models, many 

regulators around the world were at best failing to keep up with these changes.  At worst, they 

removed older prudential limitations without substituting new measures designed to address the 

new realities of banking.  The Basel Committee spent most of the decade before the crisis 

dominantly focused on the Basel II framework, which was intended to reduce somewhat 

effective regulatory capital levels for large banks in return for their transition to an internal-

models-based approach to capital requirements.  This was a choice made by national regulators, 

led by those in the United States, and not a byproduct of the structure of the Basel Committee 

itself.  

Adding the lessons of the 2007–09 financial crisis to those of earlier episodes of financial 

stress, I think we can infer some guidelines on host and home responsibilities to help shape 

expectations for practice.  For host countries, the overarching guideline is that each jurisdiction 

should take responsibility for protecting the financial stability of its own markets as its 

contribution to achieving global financial stability.  The extent of this responsibility obviously 

increases with the size and significance of the jurisdiction’s financial markets.  Thus the United 

States and the United Kingdom--which currently have the greatest concentrations of capital 

markets activities--have a particular obligation to oversee the local activities of both domestic 

and foreign banks that could pose particular risks to financial stability and are likely to be 

especially difficult to observe for a home country supervisor less familiar with those markets. 

A corollary of this general guideline is that the scope of host country regulation might 

sensibly vary with the size and systemic importance of foreign banks.  This notion is consistent
