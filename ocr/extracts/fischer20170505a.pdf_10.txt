In addition, and as I have suggested, policymakers might also encounter 

unexpected or unusual events, or both, or they might perceive changes in the structure of 

the economy.  A committee process is conducive to assessing the appropriate policy 

response to these developments.  A case in point is the decline, as I mentioned, in 

estimates of the neutral interest rate.  The concept of the neutral interest rate is a way of 

summarizing the various forces, many of them unobservable, that shift the relationship 

between monetary policy and economic activity.  Bringing to the table diverse 

perspectives is a pragmatic way of confronting such deep sources of uncertainty and 

deciding how to deal with them.  A committee discussion can flesh out the factors behind 

changes in the neutral rate, and a committee would likely be able to identify such changes 

more promptly than would a statistical exercise, because of the wider set of information 

from around the country that the committee is able to process. 

The decisionmaking environment that I have described involves more flexibility 

for FOMC members than they would have if they simply followed a policy rule.  But 

transparency and accountability must figure heavily in this more flexible environment.  

The FOMC’s policy communications include its postmeeting statement, the minutes of its 

meetings, the Chair’s quarterly press conference, the Chair’s semiannual monetary policy 

testimony to the Congress, and other public remarks by individual FOMC members.  In 

this framework, policymakers articulate the reasoning behind each decision and, in 

particular, explain how the policy decision contributes to the achievement of the 

Committee’s statutory mandate. 

There remains a deeper question about committee decisionmaking:  Why have 

almost all countries decided that monetary policy decisions should be made by a
