harder time than others finding jobs during the recovery and their wages have continued 

to stagnate.  In my view, the large and increasing amount of inequality in income and

have helped market participants negotiate past some recent hurdles, including the 

challenges in forming a governing coalition in Italy and the severe banking difficulties in 

Cyprus.  If policymakers in Europe can follow through on their commitments to financial 

integration and structural reforms, among other things, financial stress in Europe should
