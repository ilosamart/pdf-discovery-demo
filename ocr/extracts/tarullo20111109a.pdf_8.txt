fashioning these substitutes.  We should soon be able to draft a proposed regulation for the rest 

of Basel 2.5.  Work on the Basel III rule has had to compete for staff time with all the other 

rulemakings currently underway at the banking agencies, but I would expect a proposed 

regulation in the first quarter of 2012. 

The second issue pertains to the six-year transition period for Basel III, which by its 

terms phases in the requirements for both the improved quality and increased quantity of capital 

in somewhat backloaded stages beginning in January 2013.  Questions have arisen as to 

supervisory expectations for capital levels during this rather lengthy period.  Specifically, there 

has been some uncertainty as to whether supervisors intend to “pull forward” the various 

transition points outlined in Basel III.  While the Federal Reserve intends to ensure that firms are 

on a steady path to full Basel III compliance, we do not intend to require firms to raise external 

capital or to reduce their risk-weighted assets in order to meet any new requirement earlier than 

at the time specified in the Basel III transition schedule.  However, because this issue is 

complicated somewhat both by certain expectations stated in Basel III and by the relationship of 

Basel III implementation to the Federal Reserve’s requirement for annual capital planning by 

certain large bank holding companies, it may be useful to provide some further details on our 

expectations.   

In the first place, the Federal Reserve will require bank holding companies that are 

subject to our proposed capital plan rule (generally companies with $50 billion or more in total 

assets) to take affirmative steps to improve capital ratios, such as external capital raises, when 

those steps would be needed to meet each Basel III transition target on time. 

 Next, it is important to note a statement made by the Governors and Heads of Supervision 

(GHOS)--the oversight body of the Basel Committee--in announcing agreement on Basel III in
