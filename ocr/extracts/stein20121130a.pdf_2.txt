Given that the conference theme is macro-finance linkages, I thought I would try 

to lay out a corporate finance perspective on large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs).  I have 

found this perspective helpful in thinking both about the general efficacy of LSAPs going 

forward, and about the differential effects of buying Treasury securities as opposed to 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  But before I get started, please note the usual 

disclaimer:  The thoughts that follow are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views 

of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  I should also 

mention that these comments echo some that I made in a speech at Brookings last 

month.

  As I noted in that speech, I support the Committee’s decision to purchase 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a rate of $40 billion per month, in tandem with the 

ongoing maturity extension program in Treasury securities, and its plan to continue with 

asset purchases if the Committee does not observe a substantial improvement in the 

outlook for the labor market. 

I will start with the case of Treasury LSAPs, and then go on to discuss the 

differences that arise when the Fed purchases MBS instead.  One thing that seems clear in 

the data is that if you buy a lot of long-term Treasury securities, this exerts significant 

downward pressure on their yields and term premiums.  Indeed, the Fed’s past actions are 

likely one important reason why Treasury term premiums are now near historic lows, on 

the order of minus 80 basis points, according to a model used by the Board staff.

Moreover, while this is not entirely uncontroversial, my own reading of the evidence is
