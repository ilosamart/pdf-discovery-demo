     Note: The table displays basis point changes from close of business on the day before the announcement to close of business on  
the day of the announcement.  Changes in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield are computed using a smoothed yield curve estimated by 
staff from off-the-run Treasury coupon securities.  Changes in the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are 
computed by staff using a smoothed inflation-indexed yield curve.  Changes in the yield on 30-year mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
are computed using Bloomberg data on securities issued by Fannie Mae.  Changes in the yield on 10-year BBB corporate bonds are 
computed using a smoothed yield curve estimated by staff using Merrill Lynch data.
