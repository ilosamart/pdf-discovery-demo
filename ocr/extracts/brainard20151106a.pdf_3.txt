rates significantly below zero, central banks have looked to unconventional policy, such 

as asset purchases.  

The evidence suggests that unconventional monetary policy can be effective at 

overcoming the limitations on policy at the zero lower bound by operating through 

channels broadly similar to conventional monetary policy.  A number of studies have 

suggested that the forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases conducted by the 

Federal Reserve boosted the levels of employment and inflation at a time when the level 

of short-term interest rates was constrained by the zero lower bound.  For example, 

Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider estimate that the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance 

and asset purchase programs may have lowered the unemployment rate by as much as 

1-1/4 percentage points and increased the level of inflation by 50 basis points.2 

While conventional policy operates directly on the current and expected future 

path of overnight interest rates, and thereby indirectly influences longer-term interest 

rates, asset purchases are directly targeted at lowering yields on longer-term securities, 

which continue to have positive interest rates.  In the so-called portfolio balance effect, 

the asset purchases reduce the supply of long-term Treasury and agency securities 

available in the market, which leads investors to bid up the price of remaining securities, 

thus lowering yields across a range of financial assets.  Despite this difference, the 

channels through which asset purchases affect the economy appear similar to those of 

conventional monetary policy.  The resulting reduction in interest rates spurs investment
