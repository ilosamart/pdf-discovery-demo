Thank you for this invitation to speak here today.  I will begin by taking stock of 

the progress of the U.S. economy.  I will then discuss longer-term challenges for the 

economy and wrap up with a discussion of monetary policy.  As usual, my comments 

reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC). 

The Current State of the Economy 

The Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable prices and 

maximum employment--the dual mandate.  The FOMC has set a longer-term price 

stability objective of 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) price index.1  This is a symmetric objective, meaning that the 

Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 

percent.  Until early last year, inflation was running substantially below our 2 percent 

objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices during late 2014 and early 2015.  

However, because prices of energy and food commodities are often volatile, a core 

measure that excludes these components provides a better indication of where overall 

inflation is headed.  While core inflation has also run consistently below 2 percent in 

recent years, it has been gradually rising, with the most recent 12-month reading at 1.7 

percent, three-tenths higher than a year ago (the black line in figure 1).  Market-based 

measures of inflation compensation have moved well above their lows of mid-2016 but 

remain below pre-crisis levels, and survey measures have stayed relatively well anchored.  

Overall, inflation seems to be on track to reach the 2 percent objective over the next
