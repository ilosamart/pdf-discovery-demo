that period have concluded that it likely responded to deviations from target of both 

expected inflation and output growth.11  I do not regard the Fed’s dual mandate, which 

gives it both an inflation and an employment goal, as causing significant difficulties for 

Fed decisionmakers, and note that if the Fed had only an inflation target and found itself 

in the situation we find ourselves today, it would face precisely the same difficulty we 

currently face--how to get the inflation rate up to meet the inflation target.  

The Fed Today 

The Federal Reserve System’s current mandate of maximum employment, stable 

prices, and moderate long-term interest rates was established by an amendment to the 

Federal Reserve Act in 1977.  The Congress, in effect, recognized the principle of 

instrument independence by requiring that the Federal Reserve Board report 

semiannually directly to the Congress about the Board’s and the FOMC’s plans to meet 

these objectives and by exempting monetary policy from Government Accountability 

Office (GAO) review as part of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.   

By passing these two pieces of legislation, the Congress put in place a mechanism 

for holding the Fed accountable for meeting its statutory mandate.  A key venue for 

reviewing the Fed’s approach to pursuing its mandated goals remains the semiannual 

testimony of the Chair, along with the associated Monetary Policy Report.  In general, the 

provision of such an accountability structure is important, since, as previously noted, 

accountability to elected officials and the public is an essential complement to central 

bank independence.12   

                                                 
11 See Gerberding, Worms, and Seitz (2004); and Clarida and Gertler (1997). 
12 Not only do the principles of democracy demand such accountability, but economic theory also points to 
accountability as one way of addressing an inflationary bias that might otherwise take hold.  I have in mind 
here the principal-agent model of Walsh (1995).
