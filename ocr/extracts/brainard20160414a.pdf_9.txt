At the other end of the spectrum, there appear to be some markets or segments 

where clearing practices are relatively cumbersome and outmoded, and the network 

hurdles to the adoption of new technologies are lower.  Improvements in smaller markets 

would also provide an opportunity for market participants to gain operational and 

business experience with distributed ledger technologies that could help inform and 

strengthen the case for broader applications over time. 

A middle case would involve the application of distributed ledger technologies to 

bilateral clearing even where improvements have already been made since the financial 

crisis.  A threshold issue will be the design and safety of new technologies and whether 

firms will want to share a distributed ledger to manage transactions with their different 

counterparties and customers.  No doubt much will depend not only on cost but also on a 

host of business, technical, security, and other issues.  Even so, change might hold 

promise for improving bilateral clearing, and might also help us think about the long-run 

trade-offs between bilateral and central clearing.       

An assessment of the longer-term potential for deployment of distributed ledger 

technology naturally raises questions about whether it might ultimately impact the 

organizational structure for clearing and settlement.  As multilateral clearing 

organizations have strengthened and spread across many of the major asset classes traded 

in the markets, they have enabled coordinated action on governance, rules, technology, 

and risk management.  It is possible that new technologies could substantially change the 

way these functions are pursued, but it would be surprising if they would obviate the need 

for multilateral clearing in the major markets.  Governance, in particular, is a core 

function that is inescapably necessary if multilateral activity, even activity dealing with
