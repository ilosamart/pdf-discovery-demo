workers would be strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the 

board.  Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we 

would expect to see wage pressures developing in those regions and industries where 

labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries 

and parts of the country.4  Indeed, as I indicated earlier, the consensus among my 

colleagues on the FOMC is that the unemployment rate is still well above its longer-run 

sustainable level, perhaps by 2 to 2-1/2 percentage points or so.5   

A critical question, then, is why significant slack in the job market remains three 

years after the recovery began.  A likely explanation, which I will discuss further, is that 

the economy has been faced with a variety of headwinds that have hindered what 

otherwise might have been a stronger cyclical rebound.  If so, we may take some 

encouragement from the likelihood that there are potentially two sources of faster GDP 

growth in the future.  First, the effects of the crisis on potential output should fade as the 

economy continues to heal.6  And second, if the headwinds begin to dissipate, as I expect, 

                                                 
4 In addition, while the changing relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--the shift in the 
Beveridge curve--probably does point to some greater difficulty matching jobs with workers, factors other 
than mismatch likely explain some of that shift.  For example, evidence suggests that firms tend to become 
more selective in hiring when their hiring needs are not urgent.  For further discussion of these labor market 
issues, see Bernanke, “Recent Developments,” in note 3 and the references cited therein.  See also Edward 
P. Lazear and James R. Spletzer (2012), “The United States Labor Market:  Status Quo or a New Normal?” 
paper delivered at “The Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1,

5 In the September 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the central tendency of FOMC 
participants’ estimates of the long-run normal rate of unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent.  The 
SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, September 12-13, 2012,” press release, 
October 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121004a.htm.  
6 For example, mismatch problems in the labor market should fade as the economy strengthens, a further 
rise in business investment would contribute to faster growth in the capital stock, and an improving 
economy should cause investors to become less risk averse.
