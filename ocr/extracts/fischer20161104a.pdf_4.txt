strengthened the case for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.2  The 

markets put a probability of above 70 percent on the rate being increased in December. 

 So far I’ve been discussing our near-term economic prospects.  But the more 

interesting and important questions relate to the next few years rather than the next few 

months.  They relate in large part to the secular stagnation arguments that were laid out 

yesterday in Larry Summers’ Mundell-Fleming lecture--in particular the behavior of the 

rate of productivity growth.  The statement that the problem we face is largely one of 

demand--and we do face that problem--seems to imply either that productivity growth is 

called forth by aggregate demand, or a Say’s Law of productivity growth, namely that 

productivity growth produces its own demand.   

 That is not an issue that can be answered purely by theorizing.  Rather, it will be 

answered by the behavior of output and inflation as we approach and perhaps to some 

extent exceed our employment and inflation targets.
