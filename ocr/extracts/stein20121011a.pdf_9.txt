the expected future path of short-term rates, but because of a change in the term 

premium?  As noted earlier, many macro models--like the Fed’s FRB/US model--treat 

the two sorts of shocks as having similar effects.  But is there any reason to believe that, 

in reality, the response to the two might differ? 

A basic corporate-finance analysis suggests the answer may be yes.  To see why, 

consider the following example.  A risk-neutral firm faces a rate on its 10-year bonds of 

2 percent.  At the same time, it expects that the sequence of rolled-over short-term rates 

over the next 10 years will average 3 percent.  Hence, there is a term premium of minus 

1 percent.  What should the firm do?  Clearly, it should take advantage of the cheap 

long-term debt by issuing bonds.  But it is less obvious that the bargain 2 percent rate on 

these bonds should exert any influence on its capital spending plans.  After all, it can take 

the proceeds of the bond issue and use these to pay down short-term debt, repurchase 

stock, or buy short-term securities.  These capital-structure adjustments all yield an 

effective return of 3 percent.  As a result, the hurdle rate for new investment should 

remain pinned at 3 percent.  In other words, the negative term premium matters a lot for 

financing behavior, but in this stylized world, investment spending is decoupled from the 

term premium and is determined instead by the expected future path of short rates.10   

This reasoning suggests why one might expect future rounds of LSAPs to have 

diminishing returns.  As noted earlier, the data make clear that past rounds of LSAPs 

have pushed down interest rates and term premiums.  But the further the term premium is 

driven into negative territory, the more the previous logic comes into play, and hence the 

                                                 
10 See Kiley (2012) for a recent model that predicts a differential reaction of spending to changes in term 
premiums versus changes in the future path of short rates.  A similar set of issues arises in thinking about 
how firms should respond to “nonfundamental” movements in their stock prices--movements that are not 
driven by changes in expected future cash flows.  See, for example, Baker, Stein, and Wurgler (2003).
