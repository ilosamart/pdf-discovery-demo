inflation makes some relationships clearer by removing a good deal of variability due to 

food and energy prices, variability that is not primarily driven by labor market conditions 

or monetary policy.   

There is a dramatic difference in the unemployment-inflation relationship across 

these two periods.  During the Great Inflation, unemployment fluctuated between roughly 

4 percent and 10 percent, and inflation moved over a similar range.  In the recent period, 

the unemployment rate also fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, but 

inflation has been relatively tame, averaging 1.7 percent and never declining below 

1 percent or rising to 2.5 percent.  Even during the financial crisis, core inflation barely 

budged.  As a thought experiment, look at the right panel and imagine that you could see 

only the red line (inflation), and not the blue line (unemployment).  Nothing in the red 

line hints at a major economic event, let alone the immense upheaval around the time of 

the global financial crisis.  

Notice that, in each period, there is only one episode in which unemployment 

drops below 4 percent.  In the late 1960s, unemployment remained at or below 4 percent 

for four years, and during that time inflation rose steadily from under 2 percent to almost 

5 percent.  By contrast, the late 1990s episode of below-4-percent unemployment was 

quite brief, and during the episode and surrounding quarters inflation was reasonably 

stable and remained below 2 percent.   

To explore the Phillips curve relationship in these two periods more closely, we 

need to bring in the concept of the natural rate of unemployment.  In standard economic 

thinking, an unemployment rate above the natural rate indicates slack in the labor market 

and tends to be associated with downward pressure on inflation; unemployment below
