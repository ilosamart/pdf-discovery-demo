The Natural Rate of Interest on Capital and 

Rate of Interest on Loans

“At any moment … there is a certain level of the average rate of interest 

which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move 

either upwards or downwards.  This we call the normal rate of interest.  

Its magnitude is determined by the current level of the natural capital rate, 

and rises and falls with it.

If, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and 

maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap, prices 

will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in process of falling, 

they will fall more slowly and eventually begin to rise.

If, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter how little 

above the current level of the natural rate, prices will fall continuously and 

without limit.” (p.120)
