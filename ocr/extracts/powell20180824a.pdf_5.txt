normal values for the growth rate of GDP, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds 

rate.   

These fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more 

familiar names such as the “natural rate of unemployment” and “potential output 

growth.”  The longer-run federal funds rate minus long-run inflation is the “neutral real 

interest rate.”  At the Fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that 

they have acquired shorthand names.  For example, u* (pronounced “u star”) is the 

natural rate of unemployment, r* (“r star”) is the neutral real rate of interest, and π* (“pi 

star”) is the inflation objective.  According to the conventional thinking, policymakers 

should navigate by these stars.3  In that sense, they are very much akin to celestial stars.     

For example, the famous Taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based 

on where inflation and unemployment stand in relation to the stars.4  If inflation is higher 

than π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r*.  The higher real interest rate will, 

through various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households, 

which will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off.  In 

contrast, if the unemployment rate is above u*, lower the real federal funds rate relative 

to r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment.     

Navigating by the stars can sound straightforward.  Guiding policy by the stars in 

practice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the 

location of the stars have been changing significantly.   

                                                 
3 In this talk, I will sidestep the issue of navigating by short-run versus long-run versions of the stars.  The 

challenges that I will highlight are, in my view, made more difficult, and the case for a careful risk-

management approach made stronger, by the need to consider both short-run and long-run versions of the 

stars.   
4 The original Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993) uses output relative to potential in place of unemployment relative 

to its natural rate.  Both forms are now known as Taylor rules.
