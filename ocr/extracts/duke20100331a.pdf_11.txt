Importantly, at the Federal Reserve we have complemented these issuances with 

training programs for examiners and outreach to the banking industry to underscore the 

importance of sound lending practices.  In January, Federal Reserve staff instituted a 

System-wide examiner training initiative that will reach Federal Reserve and state 

examiners all across the United States.  Additionally, an interagency training program has 

been developed specifically for examiners reviewing CRE loans as part of the 

interagency Shared National Credit Program, which includes the largest commercial real 

estate loans in the nation.   

 We are working hard to track the progress and effectiveness of this guidance.  

Before issuing the guidance, Federal Reserve staff surveyed examiners to gain a better 

understanding of the banksâ€™ workout practices.  Going forward, the information that we 

collected will serve as a baseline for assessing the impact of the supervisory guidance.  

We also are asking examiners to capture, where possible, information on troubled debt 

restructurings and other types of loan workouts and dispositions as part of the ongoing 

examination process.  In addition, we are exploring the feasibility of more formal 

statistical approaches for measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of the October 2009 

interagency CRE workout and restructuring policy statement.  We continue to receive 

and evaluate comments and feedback from supervised banks and I can assure you we will 

consider the need for adjustments if feedback suggests they are needed.

community banks are an important source of credit for small businesses, their challenges
