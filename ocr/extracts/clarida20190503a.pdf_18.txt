Note:  Calculated from the final Summary of Economic Projections in each calendar year (November for 2011; December for other years).  
The value shown is the median of the individual Federal Open Market Committee participant projections for the fourth quarter of each calendar 
year.  (For 2014, the value is the midpoint of the central tendency, as the median is not publicly available.)
