Encouraging international trade can also help countries capture the benefits of 

scale.  For many emerging market economies, domestic markets are not large enough to 

support the amount of production needed to achieve efficiency gains.  Access to global 

markets has enabled production to expand to levels where economies of scale could be 

more fully exploited.  Additional efficiencies can sometimes be gained when countries 

specialize in particular stages of a good’s production.  They import parts and components 

from other countries and use them to produce new products, which themselves may be 

further processed or assembled in still other countries.  At each stage, the production is 

for the world market rather than for domestic producers or consumers alone.  Many Asian 

economies are interlinked through a network of vertical supply chains; China is often 

referred to as the endpoint in the global supply chain because the assembly of so many 

goods is completed there before being shipped to consumers around the world. 

The existence of economies of scale may, in some circumstances, also create a 

rationale for targeted government interventions in the economy--in other words, 

industrial policy.  The premise of industrial policy is that large-scale industries may not 

be able to get off the ground without government support or protection, given the 

substantial start-up costs and the existence of more-efficient competitors in other 

countries.  Indeed, government support for certain industries does seem to have played a 

role in several of the best-performing emerging market economies, including China and
