residential mortgages, even for those extended to borrowers in the prime market.3  One 

sign of this tight credit is the higher credit scores on recent mortgage originations.  For 

example, the median credit score on a prime mortgage originated to purchase a home rose 

from around 740 in the 2005-07 period to around 780 since mid-2010.  Part of this rise 

may reflect borrower characteristics--perhaps demand for housing has fallen more among 

borrowers with lower credit scores--but tighter terms and standards undoubtedly play a 

significant role.  These tight standards indicate that some households that might like to 

purchase a home simply can’t obtain the credit to do so. 

 Under these circumstances, it’s not surprising that the demand for housing 

remains weak.  Builders of new homes overwhelmingly report “low to very low” traffic 

of prospective buyers, as well as expectations of “poor” sales in the months ahead.  

Similarly, about one-third of the respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

noted weaker demand for mortgages in the first quarter of 2011.  Demand is low, in part, 

because households remain uncertain about the durability of the economic recovery and 

therefore do not want to commit to such a large investment--especially an investment that 

may decline further in price. 

 Although economists may disagree about which of these factors is playing the 

largest role in the ongoing fall in house prices, all agree that the collapse has left deep 

scars on many American families and their financial well-being.  The drop in house 

prices is a major factor in the sharp declines in household net worth during the recession.  

Newly released data from the Federal Reserve Board’s 2007-09 Survey of Consumer 

Finances panel, for example, indicate that the typical homeowner saw a drop in his or her
