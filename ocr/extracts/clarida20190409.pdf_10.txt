The next question the review will consider is, “Are the existing monetary policy 

tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or 

should the toolkit be expanded?  And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary means of 

changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal 

funds rate.  In the fall of 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to 

financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.  Because the U.S. economy 

required additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC 

deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis:  balance sheet policies and 

forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.21 

The FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet through a 

sequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension 

program, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.  

With regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made “calendar based” statements, 

and, later on, it issued “outcome based” guidance.  Overall, the empirical evidence 

suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by 

strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent.  That said, 

estimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely.22 

                                                 
21 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial 
Crisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed 
setting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017).  In addition 
to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other 
measures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more 
generally support the economic recovery.  These supplementary measures included the setting up of several 
credit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.
