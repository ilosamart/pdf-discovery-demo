normalization of credit markets that is essential to a healthy economy.  Obviously,  

risk-taking can go too far.  Low interest rates may induce investors to take on too much 

leverage and reach too aggressively for yield.  I donâ€™t see pervasive evidence of rapid 

credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset bubbles that would 

threaten financial stability.  But there are signs that some parties are reaching for yield, 

and the Federal Reserve continues to carefully monitor this situation.   

However, I think most central bankers view monetary policy as a blunt tool for 

addressing financial stability concerns and many probably share my own strong 

preference to rely on micro- and macroprudential supervision and regulation as the main 

line of defense.  The Federal Reserve has been working with a number of federal 

agencies and international bodies since the crisis to implement a broad range of reforms 

to enhance our monitoring, mitigate systemic risk, and generally improve the resilience of 

the financial system.  Significant work will be needed to implement these reforms, and 

vulnerabilities still remain.  Thus, we are prepared to use any of our many instruments as 

appropriate to address any stability concerns.   

Let me conclude by noting that I have touched on only some of the important 

dimensions of monetary policy targets and instruments that have arisen in recent years.  I 

look forward to a discussion that I expect will explore these issues and perhaps raise 

others.
