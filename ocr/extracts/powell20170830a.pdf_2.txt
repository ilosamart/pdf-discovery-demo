Good morning.  Thank you to President Evans for inviting me to speak here today about 

the role of boards of directors of large banking firms.1  Ten years ago this month, the world 

witnessed the first tremors of what we now think of as the Global Financial Crisis and the 

subsequent Great Recession.  For the United States and many other countries, this would turn out 

to be the most painful economic period since the Great Depression.  

In the wake of the crisis, governments around the world instituted a wide range of 

reforms that were designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of a recurrence.  In the United 

States, the core elements of those reforms included significantly higher capital standards; new 

liquidity requirements; forward-looking stress tests; and resolution planning.  Our largest 

banking firms are without question much stronger than before the crisis.  We are nearing 

completion of the major parts of this reform program, and are undertaking a thorough review to 

help assure that the reforms we put in place are both effective and efficient.2   

During the crisis, some large banking firms incurred massive losses. Some of these losses 

were from products – such as super-senior collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or structured 

investment vehicles (SIVs) – whose risks were not even on the radar screen of the firm’s board 

of directors.  After the crisis, the Federal Reserve significantly raised our expectations for the 

boards of directors of large banking firms.  Taking risk in service of clients is an essential part of 

the business of banking, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and various forms of operational 

risk.  Our reforms were designed to assure that boards of directors understand and approve the

System.
