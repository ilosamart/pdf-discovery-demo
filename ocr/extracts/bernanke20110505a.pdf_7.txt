prudential regulations for banking, insurance, and securities among EU member states.2  

In the United Kingdom, the government plans to move its microprudential regulatory 

authority back into the Bank of England and create a new Financial Policy Committee to 

implement macroprudential policies.  (Former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman 

Donald Kohn has been tapped to serve on the Financial Policy Committee, which must 

make him one of the few people to have served as a top financial regulator in two 

different countries.)  The U.K. committee is expected to identify and monitor systemic 

risks and take actions to remove or reduce them.  And it will operate a new resolution 

regime for failing financial firms.  

 The monitoring efforts of the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the United 

States are already well under way.  Staff members from the member agencies have 

established working groups with responsibility for specific sectors or aspects of the 

financial system and are making regular presentations to the council.  This work will also 

be reflected in the councilâ€™s required annual report to the Congress on financial stability, 

which is expected to be released in the summer. 

 Of course, the identification of threats to financial stability must be followed by 

appropriate remedies.  The powers of the council itself are relatively limited in this 

regard, at least under most circumstances.  Perhaps its most important responsibility is 

the designation of certain nonbank financial firms and financial market utilities as 

systemically important and thereby subject to additional regulation and oversight by the 

Federal Reserve and other member agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  To make those

Authority, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority.
