Treasury securities.  This situation could occur if some banks eventually find that they 

are holding fewer reserves than desired at a given constellation of interest rates and, in 

response, begin to bid for more federal funds while selling Treasury securities or other 

assets.  Interest rates will adjust up until banks are indifferent with regard to holding the 

relatively smaller volume of reserves available in the banking system. 

Overall, we will be monitoring to make sure that the level of reserves the Fed 

supplies to the banking sector, which influences the composition of assets and liabilities 

on banks’ balance sheets as well as market interest rates, provides the desired stance of 

monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.  

Of course, we will need to be very careful to understand the precise factors that underlie 

any significant movements in these areas, because factors that are unrelated to the Fed’s 

balance sheet policies might also cause such adjustments.   

Conclusion 

To conclude, I would like to reemphasize that I have touched on some highly 

uncertain issues today--issues that, I would like to stress again, have not been decided by 

the FOMC.  One such issue that closely relates to my remarks today, and one I believe 

the upcoming panel will likely address, is which policy implementation framework the 

Fed should use in the long run.  That is, broadly speaking, should the Fed continue to use 

an operational framework that is characterized by having relatively abundant reserves and 

operate in what is termed a “floor regime,” or should it use one in which the supply of 

reserves is managed so that it is much closer to banks’ underlying demand for reserves as 

in a “corridor regime”?
