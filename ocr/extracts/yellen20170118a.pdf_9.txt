growth--helps explain why we don’t think dramatic interest rate increases are required to 

move our federal funds rate target back to neutral.  Labor productivity--that is, the output 

of goods and services per hour of work--has increased by only about 1/2 percent a year, 

on average, over the past six years or so and only 1-1/4 percent a year over the past 

decade.  That contrasts with the previous 30 years when productivity grew a bit more 

than 2 percent a year.  This productivity slowdown matters enormously because 

Americans’ standard of living depends on productivity growth.  With productivity growth 

of 2 percent a year, the average standard of living will double roughly every 35 years.  

That means our children can reasonably hope to be better off economically than we are 

now.  But productivity growth of 1 percent a year means the average standard of living 

will double only every 70 years.  

Economists do not fully understand the causes of the productivity slowdown.  

Some emphasize that technological progress and its diffusion throughout the economy 

seem to be slower over the past decade or so.  Others look at college graduation rates, 

which have flattened out after rising rapidly in previous generations.  And still others 

focus on a dramatic slowing in the creation of new businesses, which are often more 

innovative than established firms.  While each of these factors has likely played a role in 

slowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open 

question.2 

Why does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest 

rate?  First, it implies that the economy’s usual rate of output growth, when employment 

                                                 
2 Other factors depressing the neutral rate include housing construction and lackluster exports.  Housing 
still hasn’t fully recovered from the financial crisis, in part because mortgage-qualification standards 
remain tight.  Weak growth abroad in Europe, China, and elsewhere, some of which is related to their own 
productivity challenges, has hurt sales of U.S. goods.
