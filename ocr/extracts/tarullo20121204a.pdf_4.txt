of systemic risk in financial-sector intermediation adds an important consideration not 

normally present in IO analysis of other industries.  Thus, as noted earlier, too-big-to-fail 

problems can affect the analysis.  Also, prudential regulation can create opportunities for 

arbitrage both among products and practices in the regulated sector and between the 

regulated and unregulated sectors.   

Although the characteristics of the financial sector may limit the relevance of 

conclusions from IO research in other sectors, they do not limit the relevance of the 

questions about industry structure and relationships asked by IO economists.  They argue, 

instead, for combining the IO approach with the specialized learning of finance, a part of 

economics that has grown so important precisely because of the manifold ways in which 

the financial sector differs from other industries.   

Scale and Scope Economies in the Financial Sector 

There are few topics within IO more familiar than that of scale and scope 

economies.3  And there are few reform proposals that have been put forward more 

regularly since the start of the financial crisis than those to limit in some manner the scale 

and scope of financial firms.  Notwithstanding the coincidence of these two facts, there is 

relatively little recent academic research on scale and scope economies in the financial 

sector and almost none pertinent to the operations of large financial conglomerates.   

The sources of scale and scope economies in the financial sector are generally 

similar to those found in other industries.  Cost-reducing scale economies are available in 

areas where fixed costs are reasonably high, such as in information technology and other 

infrastructure systems.  Network-effect economies are seen in the large distribution 

                                                 
3 Scale economies exist where average costs decline as a product or service is provided in larger quantities.  
Scope economies exist where average costs for a product or service are lower if it is produced jointly with 
another product or service.
