failure.  Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that even more modest capital market 

disruptions may have consequences that are large enough to warrant consideration when 

formulating monetary policy.  If so, the indicated directional adjustment would be to be 

less aggressive in providing monetary accommodation in the face of above-target 

unemployment, all else being equal, when risk premiums are abnormally low. 

Of course, there are many caveats.  Foremost among them is the fact that the 

ability of increases in the EBP to predict future economic activity may not reflect a causal 

link from the former to the latter.  Perhaps there are economic slowdowns that are caused 

entirely by nonfinancial factors, and, when investors see one on the horizon, they get 

skittish, causing the EBP to rise.  If so, it would be wrong to conclude that easy monetary 

policy--even if it does, in fact, cause lower risk premiums--has any causal effect on the 

probability of a future slowdown.  So at this point, the evidence that I have reviewed can 

only be thought of as suggestive.   

Making progress on these difficult issues of causality will likely require a clearer 

articulation of the underlying mechanism that leads to such pronounced asymmetries in 

the relationship between credit spreads and economic activity.  If a causal link is, indeed, 

present, what is there about it that leads increases in spreads to have a much stronger 

effect on the economy than decreases?  I suspect that the answer has to do with 

something that mimics the effect of leveraged losses to financial intermediaries--and the 

attendant effect on credit supply.  For example, GZ document that their EBP measure is 

closely correlated with the credit default swap spreads of broker-dealer firms.  The reason 

could be that losses on their inventories of risky bonds erode the capital positions of these 

firms, which might in turn compromise their ability to provide valuable intermediation
