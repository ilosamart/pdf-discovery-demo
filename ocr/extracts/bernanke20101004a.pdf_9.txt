fiscal responsibility by constraining decisions about spending and taxes.  For example, 

fiscal rules may impose constraints on key budget aggregates, such as total government 

expenditures, deficits, or debt.  In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss the use of 

fiscal rules to address longer-term budget problems, beginning with a review of the U.S. 

and foreign experience. 

The United States has seen several attempts to apply fiscal rules, with mixed 

results.  In 1985, the Congress enacted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law which, among 

other things, specified a target path for the federal deficit, including the elimination of the 

deficit by 1991.  However, the target path proved to be unattainable, and eventually the 

entire structure was abandoned.  One problem with this approach was that its primary 

focus and measure of success was the current budget deficit.  Although the emphasis on 

the current deficit was understandable, the approach ran aground of the fact that the 

budget deficit is driven not only by the choices of the Congress, but also by the 

performance of the economy.  If the economy is strong, for example, the deficit is almost 

bound to improve, as tax revenues increase and spending on the social safety net 

decreases; conversely, if the economy weakens, the deficit is likely to rise, 

notwithstanding prior efforts by the Congress to better manage government spending and 

taxes.   

With fiscal concerns still prominent, in 1990 the Congress and the President 

adopted a new approach, with two key elements.  First, this alternative approach capped 

the level of discretionary federal spending--that is, the spending subject to annual 

appropriations, including defense and nondefense purchases of goods and services.  

Second, it imposed a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rule on tax revenues and mandatory
