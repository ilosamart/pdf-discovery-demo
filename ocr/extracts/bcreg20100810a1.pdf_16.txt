underlying exposures are not always available for investing banking organizations.  
Nevertheless, the agencies could develop a simplified version of the SFA that 
could be applied by all banking organizations. Depending upon the parameters 
used in the SFA, this approach could increase risk sensitivity, as well as potentially 
increasing transparency in the securitization market.   

Question 7: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches for  
calculating risk-based capital requirements for securitization exposures?  How can the 
agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  Which parameters or 
measures of subordination and structure should the agencies consider?  What are the 
implications or potential for unintended consequences?  How can the agencies ensure that 
an alternative approach meets the criteria for a credit-worthiness standard?  What other 
approaches or specific financial and structural parameters that would be appropriate 
standards of credit-worthiness for securitization exposures?  Commenters are asked to 
provide quantitative as well as qualitative support and/or analysis for proposed alternative 
methods. 

vi. Guarantees and Collateral 

The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules generally limit the recognition of 
third-party guarantees to those provided by central governments, U.S. government 
agencies, banks, state and local governments of OECD countries, qualifying securities 
firms, and multilateral lending institutions and regional development banks.  The general 
risk-based capital rules recognize collateral in the form of cash, securities issued or 
guaranteed by OECD central governments, securities issued by U.S. government 
agencies or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, and securities issued by multilateral 
lending institutions and regional development banks.33   

Under the Basel standardized approach, guarantor eligibility is based on the credit 
rating of the guarantor’s unsecured long-term debt security without credit enhancement 
that has a long-term external credit rating.34  In addition, financial collateral includes, 
among other things, long-term debt securities that have an external credit rating of one 
category below investment grade or higher and short-term debt securities that have an 
external credit rating of at least investment grade.35   

The advanced approaches rules recognize the risk reducing effects of financial 
collateral and guarantees.36  Eligible financial collateral includes long-term debt 
securities that have a credit rating of one category below investment grade or higher and 
short-term debt securities that have a credit rating of at least investment grade.37
