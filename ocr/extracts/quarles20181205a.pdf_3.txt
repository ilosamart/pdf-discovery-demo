banks continue to be able to serve this purpose.  So it is my plan today to talk about the economy 

of the West and link the recent and future performance of the western economy to the central and 

supportive role banks play as vital infrastructure in their communities. 

Defining the West 

Let’s start by defining our terms. What do we mean by the West?  Before this audience, I 

approach this question with respect and a little caution, because I know that in a broad sense, it is 

what the Center for the American West has been addressing since its founding.  That aside, it 

makes sense to use a definition, as the center often does, that includes parts of states in the 

middle of the country whose economies, heavily dependent on natural resources, ranching, and 

farming, more closely resemble Montana and New Mexico than they do states on the Eastern 

seaboard.   

Nevertheless, for the purposes of these remarks, I am going to use a less expansive 

definition comprising the 13 westernmost states.  I do so partly because this is a common 

definition of the West, and because it is the one used by the U.S. Census Bureau in dividing the 

country into four regions and this has helped me gather data for this speech more readily. (Figure 

1) 

The first thing to mention that distinguishes the West from the rest of the country is 

apparent on this map--land area.  The West is large and would appear even larger of course, if it 

weren’t necessary to shrink the vastness of Alaska to fit on one page.  Even using my more 

modest definition, the West still represents half of the land area of the United States.  This is 

important in this context because of one theme I will be exploring today, which is the economy 

of the rural West and the banking services available there.
