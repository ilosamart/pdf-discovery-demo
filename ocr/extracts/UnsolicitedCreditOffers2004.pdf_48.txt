prescreened solicitations do not appear to raise substantial privacy problems for a number 
of reasons, and for those especially concerned with privacy, opting out seems easy 
enough, as discussed previously, and provides an effective means for consumers to act on 
their concerns. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act itself contains several provisions designed, at least in part, 
to address privacy concerns related to prescreened solicitations. Most important, under 
the FCRA, consumers have the right to opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations if 
they do not want their consumer report information to be used for prescreening purposes. 
And, under the FCRA, creditors and insurers must inform consumers of this opt-out right 
in each prescreened solicitation they send out. 

For consumers who do not opt out, creditors and insurers have only limited access to 
information in CRA files at the prescreening phase: (1) the name and address of the 
consumer, (2) an identifier that is not unique to the consumer and that is used by the 
person solely for the purpose of verifying the identity of the consumer (such as a partial 
social security number), and (3) other information about the consumer that does not 
identify the relationship or experience of the consumer with a particular creditor or other 
entity. Also, the creditor or insurer would know that each consumer on the list at least 
meets the credit criteria used to generate the prescreened list but would not receive a 
consumer’s specific credit information, such as a credit score, from the CRA as part of 
the prescreening process. 

Creditors or insurers may use the limited information that they receive from the CRAs (as 
described above) for the purpose of providing a “firm” offer of credit or insurance to the 
consumer and verifying information provided by the consumer if the consumer responds 
to the prescreened solicitation. The creditor or insurer generally may not use that 
information for other marketing purposes. 

Creditors or insurers generally do not share information received from CRAs with parties 
that are not affiliated with the creditors or insurers. If they shared this information with 
such nonaffiliated third parties, they would run the risk of becoming a “consumer 
reporting agency” under the FCRA, and most creditors and insurers do not want to be 
regulated as CRAs. Also, creditors or insurers may share consumer report information 
about a consumer received from CRAs with companies that are affiliated with the 
creditors or insurers, but they may do so only if the creditors or insurers provide the 
consumer an opportunity to opt out of the sharing and then only if the consumer does not 
opt out. Again, creditors and insurers provide this opt out before sharing such 
information to avoid the risk of becoming CRAs. 

DEBT BURDEN 

Finally, some observers suggest that prescreening can lead to overburdening of 
consumers with debt. As with any advertising campaign, the goal of credit solicitation is
