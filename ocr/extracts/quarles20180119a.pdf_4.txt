examination procedures for bank supervisors, or less intrusive examinations for well managed 

firms.  In our approach to assessing post-crisis regulation, we should consider all of these ways 

of improving efficiency.  

Transparency is an objective that ought to particularly resonate with this audience.  As 

lawyers, we were all trained to view transparency as a necessary precondition to the core 

democratic ideal of government accountability--the governed have a right to know the rules 

imposed on them by the government.  In addition, as any good lawyer also recognizes, there are 

valuable, practical benefits to transparency around rulemaking; even good ideas can improve as a 

result of exposure to a variety of perspectives.  

Finally, simplicity of regulation is a principle that promotes public understanding of 

regulation, promotes meaningful compliance by the industry with regulation, and reduces 

unexpected negative synergies among regulations.  Confusion that results from overly complex 

regulation does not advance the goal of a safe system.   

Common Ground Areas of Improvement    

When I arrived at the Federal Reserve, the early stages of reflection on how to improve 

the cost-benefit balance of post-crisis regulation had already begun, mainly in a few narrow areas 

of focus.  These were areas of low-hanging fruit in which relatively broad consensus was reached 

that efficiency enhancements were available with no material cost to the resiliency or 

resolvability of the banking system.  My colleague and Chairman-nominee Jay Powell spoke 

about five of these areas last summer when he served as the Boardâ€™s oversight governor for 

supervision and regulation: small bank capital simplification, burden reduction in resolution 

planning, enhancements to stress testing, leverage ratio recalibration, and Volcker rule
