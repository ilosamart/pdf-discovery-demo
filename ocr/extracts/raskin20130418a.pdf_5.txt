the income distribution increased less than 20 percent.1  Over these years, the share of 

pretax income accruing to the top 1 percent of households also doubled, from 10 percent 

to 20 percent, while the share accruing to the bottom 40 percent fell from 13 percent to 

10 percent.  These growing disparities of total income are largely due to the increasing 

concentration of labor income, which, on average, accounted for more than 70 percent of 

all income over this period.  In addition, the distribution of other sources of total 

income--such as profits from small businesses, capital gains and dividend income, rental 

income, and the like--also became more concentrated over this period.   

Many have argued that these disparities in income are hindering economic growth 

through their effects on consumption.  Intuitively, one might assume that the growing 

concentration of income at the top could lead to less consumer spending and aggregate 

demand, as wealthier households tend to save more of their additional income than 

others.  However, there is no definitive research indicating that these income disparities 

show mixed results on the question of whether there are stable differences in the marginal 

propensity to consume across households with different incomes.2  More generally, the 

evidence is equivocal as to whether there is an empirical relationship between higher 

income inequality and reduced aggregate demand.  In my view, understanding the links 

between greater concentrations of income, variation in spending patterns throughout the

2 The survey article by Attanasio and Weber (2010) describes several conditions that raise a household’s 
propensity to consume additional income, such as temporary income shocks, borrowing constraints, and 
low liquidity.  However, existing studies do not provide clear evidence that people with permanently low 
income have a high marginal propensity to consume.  See Orazio P. Attanasio and Guglielmo Weber

Policy,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 48 (September), pp. 693-751.
