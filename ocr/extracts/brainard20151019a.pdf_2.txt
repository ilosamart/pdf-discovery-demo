On behalf of the Federal Reserve Board, I want to thank everyone for 

participating in the fifth outreach meeting held as part of the Economic Growth and 

Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process.  I also want to thank 

President Charles Evans for hosting today. 

Under EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint 

review of our regulations every 10 years.  At the Federal Reserve, we view the current 

review as a timely opportunity to step back and look for ways to reduce regulatory 

burden, particularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the system.  

Our ultimate goal is to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations 

and to take action to address those burdens.   

I was pleased to participate, along with colleagues from the other banking 

agencies, in the launch meeting held last November in Los Angeles.  Since that time, staff 

across the Federal Reserve System, including here in Chicago, have been hard at work 

evaluating comments and identifying actions that will meaningfully reduce burden.  In 

some cases, where we have authority and the benefit is straightforward, we have taken 

action.  In other cases, which may require interagency agreement and changes to rules, 

the process will take longer.  In still other cases, we may need to look to Congress to take 

action.  I want to spend the rest of my time this morning highlighting those areas that 

hold the greatest promise to reduce undue regulatory burden, especially for our 

community banks.1
