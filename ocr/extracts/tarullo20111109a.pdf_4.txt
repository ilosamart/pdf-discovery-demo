traded assets--were often not reflected in capital calculations for some time.  Though already 

well-known before the crisis, this phenomenon was particularly problematic as asset values 

declined rapidly, causing both markets and supervisors alike to regard regulatory capital ratios as 

providing only limited information about a firm's current financial condition.   

In addition, minimum capital levels had simply been set too low, in general and with 

respect to particular assets.  One of the most obvious examples was the capital requirement for 

asset-backed securities in the trading books of banks.  The requirement was based on returns 

over a 10-day holding period, used a one-year observation period that had been characterized by 

unusually low price volatility, and did not adequately account for the credit risks inherent in 

these traded instruments. 

Furthermore, at least some of the instruments that qualified as "Tier 1 capital" for 

regulatory purposes were not reliable buffers against losses, at least not on a going concern basis.  

It is instructive that during the height of the crisis, counterparties and other market actors looked 

almost exclusively to the amount of tangible common equity held by financial institutions in 

evaluating the creditworthiness and overall stability of those institutions.  They essentially 

ignored the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios in regulatory requirements.  In the fall of 

2008, there was widespread doubt in markets that the common equity of some of our largest 

institutions was sufficient to withstand the losses that those firms appeared to be facing.  This 

doubt made investors and counterparties increasingly reluctant to deal with those firms, 

contributing to the severe liquidity strains that characterized financial markets at the time.  

Finally, the crisis validated the concerns expressed by some academics and by policy 

staff at the Bank for International Settlements that the effectiveness of capital regulation was 

limited by its exclusively microprudential focus.  Capital requirements had been set with
