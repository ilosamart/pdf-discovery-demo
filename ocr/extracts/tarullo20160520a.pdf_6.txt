appropriate for a range of non-bank financial intermediaries.  Consider, for example, the risks 

associated with bank holding companies containing large broker-dealer operations.  Unlike 

traditional commercial banks whose activities are funded with retail deposits, these bank holding 

companies are typically heavily reliant on repurchase agreements (or repos) and other types of 

short-term wholesale funding.  The events of 2007 to 2008 reminded us that, while this type of 

funding may be very stable during normal times, it can disappear overnight in periods of stress.  

Runs by providers of short-term wholesale funding may not only precipitate the failure of an 

individual firm by depleting that firm’s capital and liquidity buffers, but also precipitate 

contagion that can imperil the rest of the financial system. 

As a result of this very dynamic during the financial crisis, the five large, formerly 

freestanding broker-dealers have mostly been absorbed by, or converted into, bank holding 

companies.  In our post-crisis development of liquidity requirements and stress testing, and in 

reforming capital requirements, we needed to pay particular heed to these critical funding 

differences between traditional commercial banks and broker-dealers.  Similarly, in building out 

our regulation and supervision of insurance companies, we are paying particular attention to how 

their funding patterns differ from other forms of financial intermediaries. 

Here, though, the major relevant difference is that the funding structures of traditional 

insurers are generally much more stable than the funding structures of commercial banks, much 

less broker-dealers.  A traditional insurance company’s liabilities are largely composed of 

contingent claims based on the occurrence of specified events, such as the death of an insured 

person or the destruction of property.  Because these claims generally cannot be accelerated, 

companies engaged in traditional insurance activities are less vulnerable to runs and, 

accordingly, to short-term pressures to sell assets into declining markets.  This insulation from
