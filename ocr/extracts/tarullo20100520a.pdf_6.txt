Treasury yields moved back up slightly and equity prices rebounded, but these moves were 

subsequently reversed and the dollar rose further against the euro.    

These effects on U.S. markets underscore the high degree of integration of the U.S. and 

European economies and highlight the risks to the United States of renewed financial stresses in 

Europe.  One avenue through which financial turmoil in Europe might affect the U.S. economy is 

by weakening the asset quality and capital positions of U.S. financial institutions.  There are, to be 

sure, good reasons to believe that these institutions can withstand some fallout from European 

financial difficulties.  In the past year, the Federal Reserve has pressed the largest financial 

institutions to raise substantial additional capital.  Moreover, the direct effect on U.S. banks of 

losses on exposure to one or more sovereigns in peripheral Europe--which, in the current context 

of sovereign debt concerns, is generally understood to mean Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and 

Italy--would be small.  According to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, 

almost all U.S. exposure to peripheral European sovereigns is held by 10 large U.S. bank holding 

companies, whose balance sheet exposure of $60 billion represents only 9 percent of their Tier 1 

capital.1

 In addition to imposing direct losses on U.S. institutions, a heightening of financial stresses 

in Europe could be transmitted to financial markets globally.  Increases in uncertainty and risk 

  However, if sovereign problems in peripheral Europe were to spill over to cause 

difficulties more broadly throughout Europe, U.S. banks would face larger losses on their 

considerable overall credit exposures, as the value of traded assets declined and loan delinquencies 

mounted.  U.S. money market mutual funds and other institutions, which hold a large amount of 

commercial paper and certificates of deposit issued by European banks, would likely also be 

affected.
