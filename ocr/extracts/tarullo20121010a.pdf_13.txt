and systemically important institutions.  This is particularly noteworthy, as there is clearly some 

potential for enhanced capital, liquidity, and other prudential requirements for bank holding 

companies to cause more activity to migrate to the shadow banking system. 

With this background, I turn now to a closer look at a few instances of the challenges 

both in elaborating the financial stability standards of Dodd-Frank with respect to systemically 

important institutions and in addressing the shadow banking system.  

Evaluating Financial Stability Concerns Associated with Large Institutions 
  

As a prelude to this discussion, let me acknowledge that this is hardly the first time 

Congress has enacted intentionally protean statutory standards in response to a serious economic 

problem, and then relied on some combination of administrative regulation, law enforcement, 

and the courts to develop and adapt those standards as learning and experience grow.  The 

antitrust laws provide a good example.  The clause “contract, combination, or conspiracy in 

restraint of trade”25 that is so familiar to us today posed its own major challenge of interpretation 

immediately after passage of the Sherman Act in 1890.  Indeed, in the first cases brought under 

Section 1, both the Justice Department and the Supreme Court came close to reasoning that a 

very broad range of contracts by definition restrained some trade and thus might be illegal.26  

These interpretations were soon abandoned, but they stand as an admonition that early decisions 

under a new law can, in retrospect, look to have been somewhat makeshift.  

 Systemic Risk Capital Surcharges 

My first example is drawn from the Federal Reserve Board's experience in developing 

enhanced capital standards for bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, as 

required by Section 165 of Dodd-Frank.  As I noted a few moments ago, this is one of the Dodd-

Frank provisions that establishes financial stability as its aim, but not as a direct statutory
