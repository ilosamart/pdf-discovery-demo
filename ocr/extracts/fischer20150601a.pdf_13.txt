the financial crisis.  This is a hard position to accept for anyone who has looked closely at 

the behavior of the financial system in the middle of the last decade.   

We need to remind ourselves that the principle underlying Basel II was that the 

private sector would manage risk efficiently and effectively, since the last thing a bank 

would want would be to fail.  That did not work out as predicted.  A possible reason is 

that incentives are misaligned.  One sees massive fines being imposed on banks.  One 

does not see the individuals who were responsible for some of the worst aspects of bank 

behavior, for example in the Libor and foreign exchange scandals, being punished 

severely.  Individuals should be punished for any misconduct they personally engaged in.   

One reason we should worry about future crises is that successful reforms can breed 

complacency about risks.  To the extent that the new regulatory and supervisory 

framework succeeds in making the financial system more stable, participants in the 

system will begin to believe that the world is more stable, that we suffered a once in a 

century crisis, and that the problems that led to it have been solved.  And that will cause 

them to take more risks, to exercise less caution, and eventually, to forget the seriousness 

of the problems we are confronting today and will confront in the future. 

This is a process that will one day lead to an unhappy result.  You, the regulated, and 

we, the regulators, will have to work very hard, for a very long time, and then keep on 

working hard, to reduce the frequency and magnitude of those future crises.   


Thank you.
