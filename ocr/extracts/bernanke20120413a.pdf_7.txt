insufficient capacity by many large firms to track firmwide risk exposures, such as off-

balance-sheet exposures.   

This lack of capacity by major financial institutions to track firmwide risk 

exposures led in turn to inadequate risk diversification, so that losses--rather than being 

dispersed broadly--proved in some cases to be heavily concentrated among relatively 

few, highly leveraged companies.  Here, I think, is the principal explanation of why the 

busts in dot-com stock prices and in the housing and mortgage markets had such 

markedly different effects.  In the case of dot-com stocks, losses were spread relatively 

widely across many types of investors.  In contrast, following the housing and mortgage 

bust, losses were felt disproportionately at key nodes of the financial system, notably 

highly leveraged banks, broker-dealers, and securitization vehicles.  Some of these 

entities were forced to engage in rapid asset sales at fire-sale prices, which undermined 

confidence in counterparties exposed to these assets, led to sharp withdrawals of funding, 

and disrupted financial intermediation, with severe consequences for the economy. 

Private-sector risk management also failed to keep up with financial innovation in 

many cases.  An important example is the extension of the traditional originate-to-

distribute business model to encompass increasingly complex securitized credit products, 

with wholesale market funding playing a key role.  In general, the originate-to-distribute 

model breaks down the process of credit extension into components or stages--from 

origination to financing and to the postfinancing monitoring of the borrowerâ€™s ability to 

repay--in a manner reminiscent of how manufacturers distribute the stages of production 

across firms and locations.  This general approach has been used in various forms for 

many years and can produce significant benefits, including lower credit costs and
