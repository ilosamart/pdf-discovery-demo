 Good morning.  I am pleased to be here with the Greater Washington chapter of the 

Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Finance to kick off Financial Literacy Month 2010.  And I 

would like to take this opportunity to applaud each of you here today for your commitment to 

revitalizing the Washington chapter.   

 The coalition is a national leader among organizations that work to improve financial 

education for students from kindergarten through college.  Its programs provide students with the 

knowledge and skills they need to make informed decisions that will have a positive impact on 

their economic well-being.  With a new leadership team and renewed enthusiasm, the Greater 

Washington, D.C., chapter of the coalition has joined forces with more than 100 individuals, 

businesses, and not-for-profit educational and government organizations--including the Federal 

Reserve Board--to increase knowledge about personal finance among students in our region.   

 The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors here in Washington 

and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks with branches across the country.  Throughout the 

Federal Reserve System, we work with the Jump$tart Coalition--locally with the Washington, 

D.C., chapter and through alliances between the Reserve Banks and other state chapters of the 

coalition--to achieve our shared goals. The partnership between the Federal Reserve and the 

Jump$tart Coalition is a natural one.  Jump$tart’s mission to develop a more financially literate 

population supports the Federal Reserve’s goal of a stable and growing economy.  In 

collaboration with partners like you, Jump$tart enables students to make economically sound 

financial decisions in their personal and business lives.  As students individually form 

households or start businesses, their collective decisions will shape the economy of our future.   

 I am especially pleased to be able to represent the Federal Reserve in this effort as my 

personal commitment to financial literacy has spanned more than 30 years.  I have been involved
