help the recovery along by using both asset purchases and our threshold-based approach 

to forward guidance.  

How should the pace of purchases evolve going forward?  The Chairman laid out 

a framework for winding down purchases in his June press conference.

  Within that 

framework, I would have been comfortable with the FOMC’s beginning to taper its asset 

purchases at the September meeting.  But whether we start in September or a bit later is 

not in itself the key issue--the difference in the overall amount of securities we buy will 

be modest.  What is much more important is doing everything we can to ensure that this 

difficult transition is implemented in as transparent and predictable a manner as 

possible.  On this front, I think it is safe to say that there may be room for improvement. 

Achieving the desired transparency and predictability doesn’t require that the 

wind-down happen in a way that is independent of incoming data.  But I do think that, at 

this stage of the asset purchase program, there would be a great deal of merit in trying to 

find a way to make the link to observable data as mechanical as possible.  For this reason, 

my personal preference would be to make future step-downs a completely deterministic 

function of a labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate or cumulative payroll 

growth over some period. For example, one could cut monthly purchases by a set amount 

for each further 10 basis point decline in the unemployment rate.

  Obviously the 

unemployment rate is not a perfect summary statistic for our labor market objectives, but 

I believe that this approach would help to reduce uncertainty about our reaction function 

and the attendant market volatility.  Moreover, we would still retain the flexibility to

 To be clear, I am sketching out a broad concept, and many details would need to be filled in to make it 

operational--such as, what to do if the unemployment rate falls in one month and then later rises.
