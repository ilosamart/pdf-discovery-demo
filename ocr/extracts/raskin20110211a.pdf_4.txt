need to revive our housing sector and restore the communities that were shaken by its 

collapse.    

  So what needs to happen now?  To begin with, we should start at the ground 

level and work with troubled borrowers to prevent additional foreclosures that will 

further weaken the market.  We need to make certain that foreclosures take place only 

when there is no option available that would be preferable to both the borrower and the 

investor.  It is critical for servicers to review all options on any given delinquent loan 

before deciding that foreclosure is the best course of action.  Certainly foreclosure cannot 

be avoided in every case.  However, servicers must identify those instances where both 

the borrower and the investor would be better off modifying the loan than foreclosing on 

it.  Some distressed borrowers should be able to qualify for a modification through 

Treasury’s Home Affordable Mortgage Program (HAMP).   If the HAMP evaluation has 

been properly done and the borrower still does not qualify, the servicer should consider 

all other reasonable alternatives, ranging from proprietary modifications to short sales to 

deeds-in-lieu-of-foreclosure, before filing for foreclosure.  And, for homeowners whose 

financial distress is the result of job loss, something as simple as payment forbearance 

while the homeowner is unemployed could prevent the loan from going to foreclosure.    

Servicing shops need to be diligent in pursuing these options, and investors need 

to be supportive of efforts to find net-positive alternatives to foreclosure.  These actions 

will have a far-reaching positive impact:  A lower inventory of distressed properties for 

sale results in higher house prices, which leads to a healthier pace of recovery in the 

housing market and the broader economy.  I can’t emphasize enough how important it is
