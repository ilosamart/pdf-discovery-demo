And here comes the essence of Samuelsonâ€™s evaluation of his great 

predecessor: 

Because Wicksell read the works of his predecessors and 

contemporaries, and acknowledged the fact; because he was 

eclectic; because he regarded all his own ideas as merely 

tentative hypotheses; because he happened to come to economics 

after Jevons, Menger, Walras, Bohm-Bawerk, Marshall and J.B. 

Clark--for all these reasons Wicksell is sometimes regarded as 

not having been a truly original and creative economist.  I am 

convinced this appraisal is quite wrong. 


While Wicksell may have lacked the broad judgment of Marshall 

and one-track concentration of Clark, to savor his genius you 

have merely to read his works on capital and general equilibrium 

(vide Joan Robinson); on marginal productivity (vide Solow); on 

the impact of technological change (vide Hicks); on marginal 

cost pricing and imperfect competition (vide Hotelling and 

Chamberlin); on business cycle rhythms generated by uneven 

exogenous trends and random shocks of innovation, which 

impinge on an endogenous system geared to produce quasi-

regular rhythms whose periods depend on its internal structure 

(vide Frisch and Tinbergen); on the proper role of government 

expenditure in an affluent and less-than-affluent society (vide 

Lindahl and Musgrave); [and] on the relationship between 

interest rates set by central banks and cumulative trends of 

inflation or deflation.  (p.1688) 

What Samuelson saw in 1962 had gradually become the accepted 

view of Wicksell in the English-speaking world after the translation of both 

Interest and Prices and the two volumes of his Lectures on Political 

Economy6 in the 1930s.
