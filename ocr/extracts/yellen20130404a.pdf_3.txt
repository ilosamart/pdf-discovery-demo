widened and won’t be affected by whether drivers knew about the project years in 

advance.   

At the heart of everything I’ll be explaining today is the fact that monetary policy 

is different.  The effects of monetary policy depend critically on the public getting the 

message about what policy will do months or years in the future.2   

To develop this idea, I will take you on a tour of past FOMC communication, the 

present, and what I foresee for the future.  Until fairly recently, most central banks 

actively avoided communicating about monetary policy.  Montagu Norman, governor of 

the Bank of England in the early 20th century, reputedly lived by the motto “never 

explain, never excuse,” and that approach was still firmly in place at the Federal Reserve 

when I went to work there as a staff economist in 1977.   

I’ll begin by discussing how a growing understanding of the importance of 

transparency shaped FOMC communication in the years before the financial crisis.  Next, 

I’ll relate how the financial crisis brought unprecedented challenges for monetary policy 

that required the use of unconventional policy tools, including some barely contemplated 

before the crisis.  Communication was a centerpiece of these efforts. Finally, I’ll look 

ahead.  I am encouraged by recent signs that the economy is improving and healing from 

the trauma of the crisis, and I expect that, at some point, the FOMC will return to a more 

normal approach to monetary policy.  At the conclusion of my remarks, I’ll discuss the 

communication challenges the FOMC will face when it comes time to make that 

transition.  

                                                 
2 Like almost every government policy action, this hypothetical road project could affect expectations--it 
might influence decisions about where people live or commercial development, for example.  The crucial 
difference is that these are not the primary and stated aim of this policy action, which is to reduce traffic 
congestion.  As these remarks go on to explain, unlike most government policy actions, monetary policy is 
primarily concerned with affecting expectations of the future.
