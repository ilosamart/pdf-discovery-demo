I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event on the distributional consequences of 

the business cycle and monetary policy.  The Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute 

at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is a natural venue for discussing this topic in 

the context of the broad review of our monetary policy framework that we are 

undertaking this year.1  In our review, we are examining the policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) uses to 

pursue the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.  I will

open minds to it and are seeking perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals 

and groups, such as the panel of researchers we heard from this afternoon and the 

community leaders we will hear from tomorrow.  To us, it simply seems like good 

institutional practice to engage broadly with the public in this review as part of a 

comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2

2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy 
framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes to its framework.
