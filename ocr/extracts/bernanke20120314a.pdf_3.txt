estate.  That said, I know that community banks are continuing to look for ways to 

prudently diversify their revenue sources.   

Like larger banks, community banks are also being affected by the state of the 

national economy.  Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been 

frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending.  And, as I will 

discuss momentarily, actual and prospective changes in the regulatory landscape have 

also raised concerns among community bankers. 

The good news is that, for the most part, community banks appear to be meeting 

their challenges.  Profits of smaller banks were considerably higher in 2011 than in the 

previous year, nonperforming assets were lower, provisions for loan losses fell 

appreciably, and capital ratios improved. 

Outreach and Communication with Community Banks 

As I noted, together with economic conditions, regulation and supervision are 

among the top concerns for community banks.  In that regard, I think we would all agree 

that two-way communication between regulators and community banks is critical.  Banks 

need to understand supervisors’ policies and expectations, but supervisors must also 

listen to and understand banks’ concerns. 

At the Federal Reserve, we pursue our dialogue with community bankers through 

many channels.  One important channel is the recently established Community 

Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC).

  The council’s membership is 

drawn from smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations.  Each of the 

12 Reserve Banks around the country has a local advisory council, and one representative
