develop and implement significantly tougher rules and oversight that serve to reduce the 

risks that large, complex firms present to the financial system.  Events of the past several 

years clearly demonstrate that all large, complex financial institutions, not just bank 

holding companies, must be subject to strong regulation and consolidated supervision.  

Moreover, the crisis has shown that supervisors must take account of potential risks to the 

financial system as a whole, and not just those to individual firms in isolation.  

Implementing supervision in a way that seeks to identify systemic risks as well as risks to 

individual institutions is a difficult challenge, but the fact is that the traditional approach 

of focusing narrowly on individual firms did not succeed in preventing this crisis and 

likely would not succeed in the future.  Consequently, we at the Federal Reserve have 

been working with international colleagues to require that the most systemically critical 

firms increase their holdings of capital and liquidity and improve their risk management; 

and we are overhauling our supervisory framework for the largest institutions, both to 

improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate in our oversight 

a more comprehensive, systemic perspective.   

The second component of the strategy to end too-big-to-fail is to increase the 

resilience of the financial system itself, to reduce the potential damage from a systemic 

event like the failure of a major firm.  For example, the Federal Reserve has been leading 

collaborative efforts to improve the clearing and settlement of credit default swaps and 

other derivatives and to enhance the stability of markets for repurchase agreements.  

Limiting the fallout from the failure of a major firm is not only directly beneficial in a 

crisis, it also helps to reduce the too-big-to-fail problem, because the government has
