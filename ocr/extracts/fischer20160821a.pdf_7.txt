especially in innovative sectors like high tech.8  Both phenomena are closely related to 

the declining trend in new business creation.9 

Are we doomed to slow productivity growth for the foreseeable future?  We don’t 

know.10  On the encouraging side, the technological frontier appears to be advancing 

rapidly in some sectors, and there are hints that the firm start-up rate is improving.11  On 

the more discouraging side, investment continues to disappoint--and so the current capital 

stock is smaller and embodies fewer frontier technologies than might otherwise be the 

case--and the productivity slowdown is a global phenomenon, suggesting that it may not 

be easily or quickly remedied. 

Let me conclude by mentioning briefly one aspect of the low interest rate and low 

productivity growth problems--the fact that the Fed has been close to being “the only 

game in town,” as Mohamed El-Erian and others have described it.12  At least one part of

10 There is no shortage of views on this issue among economists, but the views to some extent appear to 
depend on whether the economist making the prediction is an optimist or a pessimist.  For the record, I note 
(a) that looking ahead, I expect GDP growth to pick up in coming quarters, as investment recovers from a 
surprisingly weak patch and the drag from past dollar appreciation diminishes, and (b) that I am an 
optimist.

    David Mericle and Avisha Thakkar (2016) recently noted that, in the seven years since the Great 
Recession and Global Financial Crisis, U.S. monetary policy was somewhat more supportive--and fiscal 
policy less supportive--compared with the average policy response in previous large advanced-economy 
financial crises (see “The Crisis and Its Aftermath:  Back to the Future,” Goldman Sachs, Economics 
Research, U.S. Economics Analyst, August 12).
