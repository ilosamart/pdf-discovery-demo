money.  By contrast, to the extent that they are highly liquid, they do make suitable 

collateral for very short-term repo financing.  In other words, equities can be used to back 

some amount of shadow bank money.   

It should be noted that the model admits either interior outcomes or corner 

solutions, depending on the asset-specific values of zi and φi.  So it is consistent with the 

possibility that some assets (say, highly illiquid loans) will be held only by banks, some 

(say, Treasury securities) will be owned predominantly but not exclusively by shadow 

banks, and some (say, agency MBS, CMBS, and CMOs) will be owned in significant 

quantities by each type of intermediary, with an equilibrium fire-sale discount that just 

balances the tradeoff between the two organizational forms.  In this view of the world, 

loans are seen as being on a continuum with less-liquid securities, and they are held by 

banks because of their relative illiquidity and susceptibility to fire-sale discounts, not 

solely because of a need for monitoring. 

Further Evidence 

One way to draw out some further implications of the model is to focus on the 
key comparative static, dμi/di < 0--namely, that banks have a bigger market share in 

more-illiquid assets.  Now, of course in the real world, there are many different kinds of 

financial intermediaries, not just two as in our simple model.  But a rough generalization 

of our theory would be to say that across intermediary types, we should expect those with 

relatively more-stable liabilities to hold more-illiquid assets. 

To implement a test of this proposition, we use flow of funds data on eight classes 

of financial intermediaries:  banks, broker-dealers, money market funds, real estate 

investment trusts, government-sponsored enterprises, property and casualty insurers, life
