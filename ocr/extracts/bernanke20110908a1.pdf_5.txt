improved competitiveness of U.S. goods and services.  Business investment in equipment 

and software has also continued to expand.  Corporate balance sheets are healthy, and 

although corporate bond markets have tightened somewhat of late, companies with access 

to the bond markets have generally had little difficulty obtaining credit on favorable 

terms.  But problems are evident in the business sector as well:  Business investment in 

nonresidential structures, such as office buildings, factories, and shopping malls, has 

remained at a low level, held back by elevated vacancy rates at existing properties and 

difficulties, in some cases, in obtaining construction loans.  Also, some business surveys, 

including those conducted by the Federal Reserve System, point to weaker conditions 

recently, with businesses reporting slower growth in production, new orders, and 

employment. 

Why has this recovery been so slow and erratic?  Historically, recessions have 

tended to sow the seeds of their own recoveries as reduced spending on investment, 

housing, and consumer durables generates pent-up demand.  As the business cycle 

bottoms out and confidence returns, this pent-up demand, often augmented by the effects 

of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, is met through increased production and 

hiring.  Increased production in turn boosts business revenues and increased hiring raises 

household incomes--providing further impetus to business and household spending.  

Improving income prospects and balance sheets also make households and businesses 

more creditworthy, and financial institutions become more willing to lend.  Normally, 

these developments create a virtuous circle of rising incomes and profits, more-

supportive financial and credit conditions, and lower uncertainty, allowing the process of 

recovery to develop momentum.
