so-called tail risks; by design, stress tests help ensure that banks will have enough capital 

to keep lending even under highly adverse circumstances.  Second, as applied by the 

Federal Reserve, the stress tests look horizontally across banks rather than at a single 

bank in isolation.  This comparative approach promotes more-consistent supervisory 

standards.  It also provides valuable systemic information by revealing how significant 

economic or financial shocks would affect the largest banks collectively as well as 

individually.  Third, the disclosures of stress test results promote transparency by 

providing the public consistent and comparable information about banks’ financial 

conditions.   

 The basic methodology of our stress testing has also not changed materially since 

the SCAP.  We continue to take a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on a wide range of 

staff expertise.  To begin the process, our economists create a hypothetical 

macroeconomic scenario that incorporates an assumed sharp deterioration in economic 

and financial conditions.  Supervisors estimate each bank’s expected losses and revenues 

and we use these estimates to project post-stress capital levels and ratios under that 

hypothetical scenario.  The estimated capital ratios are then compared with regulatory 

benchmarks. We use a common scenario for all firms; for the firms with the largest 

trading activities, we supplement the basic scenario with a market-shock scenario that 

incorporates market turbulence of severity similar to that of the latter half of 2008.     

 Although the basic goals and approach of stress testing have remained largely 

unchanged since the SCAP, the implementation has evolved and improved from year to 

year.  For example, we have continued to refine the formulation of the hypothetical 

scenarios that form the basis of the stress tests.  As explained in a statement we released
