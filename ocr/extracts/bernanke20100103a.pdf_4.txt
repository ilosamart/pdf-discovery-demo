of Iraq in March 2003, as well as a series of corporate scandals in 2002, further clouded 

the economic situation in the early part of the decade. 

 Slide 1 shows the path, from the year 2000 to the present, of one key indicator of 

monetary policy, the target for the overnight federal funds rate set by the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC).  The Federal Reserve manages the federal funds rate, the 

interest rate at which banks lend to each other, to influence broader financial conditions 

and thus the course of the economy.  As you can see, the target federal funds rate was 

lowered quickly in response to the 2001 recession, from 6.5 percent in late 2000 to 

1.75 percent in December 2001 and to 1 percent in June 2003.  After reaching the then-

record low of 1 percent, the target rate remained at that level for a year.  In June 2004, the 

FOMC began to raise the target rate, reaching 5.25 percent in June 2006 before pausing.  

(More recently, as you know, and as the rightward portion of the slide indicates, rates 

have been cut sharply once again.)  The low policy rates during the 2002-06 period were 

accompanied at various times by “forward guidance” on policy from the Committee.  For 

example, beginning in August 2003, the FOMC noted in four post-meeting statements 

that policy was likely to remain accommodative for a “considerable period.”2 

The aggressive monetary policy response in 2002 and 2003 was motivated by two 

principal factors.  First, although the recession technically ended in late 2001, the 

recovery remained quite weak and “jobless” into the latter part of 2003.  Real gross 

domestic product (GDP), which normally grows above trend in the early stages of an 

economic expansion, rose at an average pace just above 2 percent in 2002 and the first 

                                                       
2 In January 2004, the Committee expressed an intention to be “patient” regarding the removal of monetary 
policy accommodation.  In May 2004, a month before the Committee began to increase its target for the 
federal funds rate, it said that accommodation was likely to be removed at a pace that would be 
“measured.”  For discussions of the potential benefits of such communication, particularly in the face of 
possible deflationary risks, see Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Woodford (2007).
