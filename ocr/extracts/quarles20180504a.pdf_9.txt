reducing reserve balances.  So far, after the first seven months of the program, the Fed 

has shed about $120 billion of its securities holdings, which is a fairly modest amount 

when compared with the remaining size of its balance sheet.  Consequently, the level of 

reserves in the banking system is still quite abundant.    

So, how many more reserve balances can be drained, and how small will the 

Fed’s balance sheet get?  Let me emphasize that this question is highly 

speculative--policymakers have not decided the desired long-run size of the Fed’s 

balance sheet, nor, as I noted earlier, do we have a definitive handle on banks’ long-run 

demand for reserve balances.  Indeed, the FOMC has said that it “expects to learn more 

about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet 

normalization.”10  Nonetheless, let me spend a little time reflecting on this challenging 

question. 

How banks respond to the Fed’s reduction in reserve balances could, in theory, 

take a few different forms.  One could envision that as the Fed reduces its securities 

holdings, a large share of which consists of Treasury securities, banks would easily 

replace any reduction in reserve balances with Treasury holdings, thereby keeping their 

LCRs roughly unchanged.  According to this line of thought, because central bank 

reserve balances and Treasury securities are treated identically by the LCR, banks should 

be largely indifferent to holding either asset to meet the regulation.  In that case, the 

reduction in reserves and corresponding increase in Treasury holdings might occur with 

relatively little adjustment in their relative rates of return.  Alternatively, one could argue 

that banks may have particular preferences about the composition of their liquid assets.
