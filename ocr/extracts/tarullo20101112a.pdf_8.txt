an adverse scenario and asked that they hold capital sufficient to absorb those losses and still be 

above common equity levels that would maintain the firms as viable intermediaries. 

There is no direct way to calculate how much equity is needed to assure markets that a 

banking organization is viable.  In our internal analysis at the Federal Reserve in preparation for 

the Basel Committee deliberations, we analyzed distributions of actual losses suffered by larger 

institutions over the last several decades, on the assumption that an institution that could 

withstand such losses at a high confidence level would be regarded as a viable going concern.  

For the conservation buffer, we looked at actual pre-SCAP losses incurred by large banking 

firms during the recent stress period and SCAP estimates of additional losses associated with the 

recent stress period.  Both these determinations required considerable judgment, and thus we 

developed ranges, rather than point estimates, for the levels we thought reasonable.  In particular, 

government capital injections and debt guarantees in the fall of 2008 complicated the estimation 

of losses that might have been incurred in the absence of too-big-to-fail support.  The ratios 

agreed to in Basel were at the lower end of, though still within, the ranges we had calculated.   

The practical effect of the two-level approach is that banks under stress may let their 

common equity ratio drop below the 7% level that is the sum of the minimum and buffer 

requirements.  However, restrictions on capital distributions will result, which will become 

progressively more stringent as the common equity ratio drops closer to the 4.5% minimum.   

The buffer is thus designed to forestall banks from continuing to pay dividends even as they 

come under stress, a practice observed in some institutions during the financial crisis.  

Realistically, both regulators and markets will expect firms generally to maintain their common 

equity ratios above 7%.
