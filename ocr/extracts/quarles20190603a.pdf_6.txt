interest rate variables that drive projections of net interest income under stress are the 

yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the yield on 3-month Treasury bills, and the 10-year 

triple-B corporate yield.3  That is, the supervisory projections of net interest income are 

primarily based on models that implicitly assume that other rates such as LIBOR or 

SOFR move passively with short-term Treasury rates.  Given these mechanics, choosing 

to lend at SOFR rather than LIBOR will not result in lower projections of net interest 

income under stress in the stress-test calculations of the Federal Reserve. 

I hope I have been able to provide you with some further clarity today.  I am sure 

that the rest of the roundtable will do so as well.  I want to applaud the members of the 

ARRC who are working hard to make sure this threat to financial stability is avoided.
