our knowledge in recent years, significant gaps remain in our understanding of what 

factors help and hinder economic mobility. 

I will conclude by discussing diversity in the economics profession.  Our 

profession currently is not very diverse, but it needs to be.  Only about one-fourth of 

tenured and tenure-track faculty members in U.S. academic economics departments are 

women, and only around 5 percent are African American or Hispanic.  Yet research 

conducted by economists as well as other social scientists suggests that a diversity of 

perspectives and ideas lead to better decisions and increased productivity.7  In my own 

experience, economic policy decisions are better when informed by a wide range of 

views and experiences.  You all here today are crucial to the future of our profession.   

Indeed, I hope that by obtaining your degrees and working on economic 

problems, you will help change the field of economics itself.  As in many other fields, 

economics undergoes continual redesign by its practitioners.  We need--and by that I 

mean society as a whole needs--a more diverse set of practitioners in economics, 

practitioners who may perceive different questions to be important and different answers 

to be more persuasive.  And so, by joining the profession you can acquire the power to 

change not only the field, but also the broad set of societal institutions that are influenced 

by the work of economists. 

Economists tend to respond to the results of research.  And the research shows the 

importance of diversity in decisionmaking.  As a result, many organizations are working 

very seriously to become more diverse.  At the Federal Reserve Board, these efforts 

include developing connections with the Economics Department here at Howard.  Our
