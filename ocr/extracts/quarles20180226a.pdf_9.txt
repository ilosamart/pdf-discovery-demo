How about the other factors that have been holding back growth?  Looking at the 

data, I see encouraging signs that some drags may be lessening--for example, the recent 

pickup in investment--but less promising indicators elsewhere, especially productivity 

growth.  In the end, I think it is too early to call a turning point, but it is a possibility that 

bears consideration and one that I will be watching for closely.  Here are some of things I 

will be following:    

Labor force participation.  Given long-standing demographic trends, it would 

seem a heavy lift to expect labor force growth to contribute much to a pickup in GDP 

growth.  However, it is encouraging that the downward movement in labor force 

participation has recently been on hiatus, a development that could possibly be prolonged 

by the recent tax legislation--which could, for example, give some workers an incentive 

to remain in or enter the workforce.  

Capital investment.  As I mentioned, the recent data on investment have been 

encouraging, with a noticeable pickup in capital equipment spending.  As businesses 

become more confident in the sustainability of the upturn, investment could be further 

boosted.  While the tax act is multifaceted and complex, lower corporate tax rates and 

other incentives will also likely boost investment and increase the capital stock. 

Productivity.  Though the quarterly numbers are volatile and should be treated 

cautiously, the nearly 1 percent decline in labor productivity recorded in the fourth 

quarter of 2017 would imply that a productivity turnaround is not yet upon us.  Moreover, 

for 2017 as a whole, productivity increased only 3/4 percent, about the same as the 

average annual pace since 2011.  That said, with no consensus on what has caused the 

productivity slowdown, a turnaround could come suddenly.
