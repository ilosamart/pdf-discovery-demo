concentrated reliance on an industry that experiences decline due to trade or technology 

or the byproduct of lack of connectivity-whether by highways or broadband.  

Technological change, globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to 

the U.S. economy, but there are troubling signs that less diversified or more isolated 

localities have diminished ability to recover.  And there is increasing evidence that such 

concentrated economic shocks can also lead to severe labor market stress, as well as 

broader consequences for health and mortality.46  Over the past 30 years, the convergence 

in income across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.47   

Even so, some localities fare better than others in establishing new paths to 

opportunity and inclusive growth, and their successes provide actionable lessons.  The 

Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge undertook an in depth study of 25 medium-sized 

cities nationwide that had experienced a post-industrial decline and identified 10 that 

experienced an economic resurgence.  The critical determinant of success was the ability 

of leaders in those cities to collaborate across sectors around a long-term vision for 

revitalization.  To encourage such collaboration in other cities, the Boston Fed facilitated 

competitions that reward effective public-private collaboration in developing plans to 

reach community-wide goals.  For example, Holyoke, Massachusetts, proposed a plan to 

simplify the city’s permitting and licensing systems in order to raise the presence of 

Latino-owned businesses.  On economic revitalization, as in other areas of community 

development, effective solutions start with the community setting its own goals, are 

powered by broad collaboration, and rely on evidence to drive results.
