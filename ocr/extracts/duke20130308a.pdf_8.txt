between 620 and 680.  Originations are virtually nonexistent for borrowers with credit 

scores below 620. 

Whether this pattern stems from tight supply or from weak demand among 

borrowers with lower credit scores, it has disturbing implications for potential new 

households.  Younger individuals--who have seen the greatest drop in household 

formation--have, on average, credit scores that are more than 50 points lower than those 

of older individuals, a difference that existed even before the recession.   

Staff analysis comparing first-time homebuying in recent years with historical 

levels underscores the contraction in credit supply.  From late 2009 to late 2011, the 

fraction of individuals under 40 years of age getting a mortgage for the first time was 

about half of what it was in the early 2000s.10  The drop was especially pronounced for 

individuals with low credit scores and remained large even after controlling for local 

unemployment rates and for measures of the individualâ€™s demand for credit--a result 

indicating that tight credit supply is an important factor. 

As I noted earlier, household formation has been particularly weak among young 

individuals, who are also a large part of the potential first-time homebuyer population.  

Many of these young individuals have relatively weak credit records and are more likely 

to have had a recent spell of unemployment.  Our staff analysis highlights how tight 

credit conditions are for such individuals in the current environment.  In the early 2000s, 

about one-third of first-time homebuyers under the age of 40 had credit scores below 620, 

and another one-fourth had scores between 620 and 680.  Today, many of these 

individuals would have a difficult time obtaining mortgage credit.
