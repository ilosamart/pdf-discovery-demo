is authorized to initiate a payment.  New approaches to authentication increasingly offer 

greater assurance and protection.  Given the current technologies that we have at our 

disposal, we should assess the continued use of signatures as a means of authenticating 

card transactions.   

It is important to layer security tools and procedures.  Methods to devalue 

payment data, like tokenization and encryption for data at rest, in use, and in transit, 

mitigate the effect of a data breach.  Analytics can identify and prevent fraudulent 

transactions.  Firewalls and segmentation of technology supporting critical functions can 

protect networks from outside attacks. 

Also, remember that people inside your organization and organizations that you 

work with can pose a significant risk.  One study found that more than 20 percent of 

security incidents could be attributed to insiders.4 Segregation of duties, background 

checks, and monitoring for anomalies help reduce the risk of insider threats.  Strong 

vendor-management programs can reduce risks from an institution’s partners and service 

providers.   

3. Planning 

As crucial as they are, we should keep in mind that these prevention tools cannot 

stand alone.  Even with stronger authentication methods, robust network security, and 

other approaches in place, preventive measures aren’t sufficient to manage security risks.  

Such measures are designed to protect against known risks.  But those looking to exploit 

the system will continue to devise new methods of attack.  In some of the recent high-

profile data breaches, companies have scrambled to deal with the aftermath.  This brings
