to pay an unexpected $400 expense (figure 5).10  Drilling down further indicates that 

while 6 percent of middle-income adults said they would not be able to pay the expense 

using any means, 27 percent would borrow or sell something to pay the expense.   

The reliance on credit to meet unexpected expenses is pronounced among those 

already carrying a balance on their credit cards.  Nearly 3 in 10 middle-income adults 

carry a balance on their credit card most or all of the time, and the same households are 

five times as likely to borrow if faced with a $400 expense as those who never carry a 

balance.  

Borrowing money is not the only way that middle-income households cope with 

unexpected expenses.  In 2018, one-fourth of middle-income adults said they skipped 

some kind of medical care because of its cost, suggesting insufficient savings can have 

implications for physical health as well as financial health.  Thus, low levels of savings 

can create a challenging cycle when material disruptions in income, or even smaller 

unexpected expenses, spiral into a broader financial setback.  

Financial security in retirement 

A key component of middle-class financial security is the cushion of savings to 

cover retirement.  Here, the DFAs suggest some progress.  One of the innovations of the 

DFAs is that they include defined benefit plans from the Financial Accounts in addition 

to defined contribution plans, whereas measures of household pension wealth in the SCF 

are confined to the latter.  The balances in defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, in 

which retirement savings accumulate in an account, are typically simpler to measure.  By 

                                                 
10 This statistic and the rest in this subsection are from the 2018 SHED and are only for middle-income 
adults.  The SHED collects ranges of family income, not a dollar amount.  Middle income is defined as the 
ranges of family income from $40,000 to $99,000, which is roughly the 40th to 70th percentiles.
