Recognizing these benefits, our society has taken steps to encourage 

homeownership.  Tax incentives, mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing 

Administration, and other government policies all contributed to a long rise in the U.S. 

homeownership rate--from 45 percent in 1940 to a peak of 69 percent in 2004.  But, as 

recent events have demonstrated, homeownership is only good for families and 

communities if it can be sustained.  Home purchases that are very highly leveraged or 

unaffordable subject the borrower and lender to a great deal of risk.  Moreover, even in a 

strong economy, unforeseen life events and risks in local real estate markets make highly 

leveraged borrowers vulnerable. 

It was ultimately very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious 

underwriting practices and mortgage products inappropriate for many borrowers became 

more common.  In time, these practices and products contributed to problems in the 

broader financial services industry and helped spark a foreclosure crisis marked by a 

tremendous upheaval in housing markets.  Now, more than 20 percent of borrowers owe 

more than their home is worth and an additional 33 percent have equity cushions of 10 

percent or less, putting them at risk should house prices decline much further.  With 

housing markets still weak, high levels of mortgage distress may well persist for some 

time to come.  

In response to the fallout from the financial crisis, the Fed has helped stabilize the 

mortgage market and improve financial conditions more broadly, thus promoting 

economic recovery.  What may be less well known, however, is what the Fed has been 

doing at the local level.  As the foreclosure crisis has intensified, Federal Reserve staff in 

our research, community development, and supervision and regulation divisions have
