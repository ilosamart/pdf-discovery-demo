As Slide 9 shows, the relationship between the stance of monetary policy and 

house price appreciation across countries is quite weak.  For example, 11 of the 20 

countries in the sample had both tighter monetary policies, relative to the standard 

Taylor-rule prescriptions, and greater house price appreciation than the United States.  

The overall relationship between house prices and monetary policy, shown by the solid 

line, has the expected slope (tighter policy is associated with somewhat slower house 

price appreciation).  However, the relationship is statistically insignificant and 

economically weak; moreover, monetary policy differences explain only about 5 percent 

of the variability in house price appreciation across countries. 

What does explain the variability in house price appreciation across countries?  In 

previous remarks I have pointed out that capital inflows from emerging markets to 

industrial countries can help to explain asset price appreciation and low long-term real 

interest rates in the countries receiving the funds--the so-called global savings glut 

hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005, 2007).  Today is not the appropriate time to revisit that 

hypothesis in any detail, but I would like to take a moment to show that accounting for 

capital inflows is likely to prove fruitful for explaining cross-country differences.  Slide 

10, which is analogous to Slide 9, shows the relationship between capital inflows and 

house price appreciation for the same set of countries as in the previous slide.  Also as in 

the previous slide, house price appreciation is shown on the vertical axis of the figure.  

The horizontal axis shows the increase in the current account (equivalently, the increase 

in capital inflows) for each country, measured as a percentage of GDP.  The downward 

                                                                                                                                                                 
Slide 9 could potentially overstate the causal relationship between monetary policy and house price 
appreciation.  For the group of euro-zone countries included in Slide 9, the slope of the relationship 
between house prices and monetary policy accommodation is economically more consequential but not 
statistically significant (t = -1.55, R2 = 0.23).
