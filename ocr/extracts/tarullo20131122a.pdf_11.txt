either securities inventory or a back-to-back SFT loan to another financial firm (SFT matched 

book).   

 The financial stability risks associated with a dealer’s use of short-term SFT funding to 

finance its inventory are relatively straightforward.  If a broker-dealer loses access to financing 

and is forced to sell securities at a depressed price, fire sale externalities may result because other 

market participants may be less able to borrow against the same securities.  And if the broker-

dealer fails due to runs by short-term SFT lenders, post-default fire sales by the firm’s creditors 

or contagious runs on other financial intermediaries may ensue.  Because broker-dealers 

generally do not internalize the externalities that arise in these cases, they may use more than the 

economically efficient level of short-term funding.   

 The financial stability risks associated with SFT matched books are somewhat less 

obvious.  Even if the outflows and inflows associated with a dealer’s SFT positions are perfectly 

maturity-matched, reputational considerations may inhibit a dealer from reducing the amount of 

SFT credit that it provides its customers, exposing the dealer to considerable liquidity stress.  If 

the dealer does reduce the amount of credit that it provides to its customers, those customers may 

be forced to engage in asset fire sales of their own.  Particularly in situations in which the 

customers are highly leveraged, maturity-transforming entities that lack access to a liquidity 

provider of last resort may pose a significant risk of contagion. 

 Post-crisis financial regulatory reform has taken some steps to address the financial 

stability risks associated with a dealer’s use of short-term SFT funding to finance inventory.  For 

example, the liquidity coverage ratio requires firms to hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets 

when they use SFT liabilities that mature in less than 30 days to fund many types of securities.  

New risk-based capital rules have substantially increased the amount of capital that dealers are
