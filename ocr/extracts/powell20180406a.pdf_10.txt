 As shown in figure 12, labor productivity growth can be broken down into the 

contributions from business investment (or capital deepening), changes in the skills and 

work experience of the workforce, and a residual component that is attributed to other 

factors such as technological change and efficiency gains (usually lumped together under 

the term total factor or multifactor productivity).   

In the United States and in many other countries, some of the slowdown in labor 

productivity growth can be traced to weak investment after the crisis.  Investment has 

picked up recently in the United States, however, which suggests that capital deepening 

may pick up as well.  The other big contributor to the slowdown has been in total factor 

productivity growth.  The outlook for this dimension of productivity is considerably more 

uncertain.  Total factor productivity growth is notoriously difficult to predict, and there 

are sharply different views on where it might be heading.  Some argue that the 

productivity gains from the information technology revolution are largely behind us, and 

that more-recent technological innovations have less potential to boost productivity.8  

Others argue that a well-documented decline in measures of business dynamism--such as 

the number of start-ups, the closure of less-productive businesses, and the rates at which 

workers quit their jobs and move around the country to take a new job--has held back 

productivity growth, in part by slowing the movement of capital and labor toward their 

most productive uses.9
