zero--its effective lower bound--thus limiting our ability to provide appropriate monetary 

accommodation.   

In addition, after careful planning and public communication, last October the 

FOMC began to gradually and predictably reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.  

Reducing our securities holdings is another way to move the stance of monetary policy 

toward neutral.  The balance sheet reduction process is going smoothly and is expected to 

contribute over time to a gradual tightening of financial conditions.  Over the next few 

years, the size of our balance sheet is expected to shrink significantly. 

At our meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds 

rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.  This decision marked 

another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy 

accommodation.  The FOMC’s patient approach has paid dividends and contributed to 

the strong economy we have today. 

Over the next few years, we will continue to aim for 2 percent inflation and for a 

sustained economic expansion with a strong labor market.  As I mentioned, my FOMC  

colleagues and I believe that, as long as the economy continues broadly on its current 

path, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.  It 

remains the case that raising rates too slowly would make it necessary for monetary 

policy to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic 

expansion.  But raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would 

remain persistently below our 2 percent objective.  Our path of gradual rate increases is 

intended to balance these two risks.
