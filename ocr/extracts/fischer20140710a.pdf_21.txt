would reduce the likelihood of SIFI failure--but could not be relied upon to prevent all 

failures.   

Would breaking up the largest banks end the need for future bailouts?  That is not 

clear, for Lehman Brothers, although a large financial institution, was not one of the 

giants--except that it was connected with a very large number of other banks and 

financial institutions.  Similarly, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s was 

not a TBTF crisis but rather a failure involving many small firms that were behaving 

unwisely, and in some cases illegally.  This case is consistent with the phrase, “too many 

to fail.”  Financial panics can be caused by herding and by contagion, as well as by big 

banks getting into trouble. 

In short, actively breaking up the largest banks would be a very complex task, 

with uncertain payoff. 

The Bottom Lines 

The United States is making significant progress in strengthening the financial 

system and reducing the probability of future financial crises.  In particular 

• By raising capital and liquidity ratios for SIFIs, and through the active use of 

stress tests, regulators and supervisors have strengthened bank holding companies 

and thus reduced the probability of future bank failures.  

• Work on the use of the resolution mechanisms set out in the Dodd-Frank Act, 

based on the principle of a single point of entry, holds out the promise of making 

it possible to resolve banks in difficulty at no direct cost to the taxpayer--and in 

any event at a lower cost than was hitherto possible.  However, work in this area 

is less advanced than the work on raising capital and liquidity ratios.
