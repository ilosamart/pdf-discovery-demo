any perception of a cap on what, in many cases, could be prudent, secured lending. 

Accounting standards 

 One factor that contributes to regulatory uncertainty is the intersection of Generally 

Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and regulatory requirements.  Nowhere is this more 

evident than in the accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).  The current 

accounting standard requires provisions only to cover losses that have already been incurred.  

Conflicting views of the range of likely losses sometimes leads to a perception that the 

regulatory evaluation of the adequacy of ALLL levels involves something of a “black box.”  To 

further complicate things, the accounting standard generally requires estimation, using statistical 

analysis, of a bank’s unique past loss patterns, but most community banks have neither the rich 

data nor the capability to perform such analysis.  Federal Reserve staff is currently investigating 

whether there is any way to use available supervisory data to publish loss rate ranges that could 

be used as a starting point for any bank to calculate allowance amounts in a way that is simple to 

understand and not inconsistent with GAAP.  Even if development of such a tool does not turn 

out to be feasible, staff is still working to amend its approach to clarify expectations, improve 

transparency, and heighten consistency. 

 Along the same lines, I hear enough feedback about troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) to 

lead me to believe that it could be helpful to issue guidance clarifying the regulatory and 

accounting treatment of TDRs, non-performing assets, and classified loans.  Even though these 

designations have different definitions, time frames, and regulatory consequences, they often 

seem to be used interchangeably.  Reportedly, some bankers are reluctant to offer modifications 

that would help struggling borrowers and enhance the potential for ultimate repayment because
