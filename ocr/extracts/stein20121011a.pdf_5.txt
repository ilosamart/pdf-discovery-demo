a signaling or confidence channel.  Another important tool in the Committee’s arsenal 

these days is its use of forward guidance about the expected path of the federal funds rate.  

And a change in this guidance was a key part of the September FOMC statement, with 

the Committee stating that “a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will 

remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.”  I 

believe that the LSAP component of the statement helped bolster the credibility of the 

forward guidance component by pairing a declaration about future intentions with an 

immediate and concrete set of actions.  And I suspect that this complementarity helps 

explain the strong positive reaction of the stock market to the release of the statement.   

   In addition to this signaling channel, LSAPs of course also have a variety of 

direct effects on the economy, as I just noted.  To understand these effects, it is useful to 

compare them with those that make monetary policy work in normal times.  Away from 

the zero lower bound, conventional monetary policy is thought to work via an 

expectations channel; when the Fed cuts the federal funds rate, long-term rates also fall, 

primarily because expectations regarding future short-term rates shift down.  By contrast, 

a principal motive for doing LSAPs is to influence interest rates not just through 

expectations, but via supply-and-demand effects in the long-term bond market.  As the 

Fed buys more long-term bonds, their price goes up, and their yield falls, even if 

expectations of future short rates are unchanged.  Said differently, the so-called term 

premium on long-term bonds declines, which means that post-LSAP, long-term bonds are 

expected to perform less well as an investment relative to short-term bills.
