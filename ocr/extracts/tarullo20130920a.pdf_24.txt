and maturity-transforming financial firms as well, and, therefore, may then have to 

engage in fire sales themselves.  The direct and indirect contagion risks are high. 

The dangers thus arise in the tail and apply to the entire financial market when 

normally safe, short-term lending contracts dramatically in the face of sudden and 

significant uncertainty about asset values and the condition of counterparties.  A 

macroprudential regulatory measure should force some internalization by market actors 

of the systemic costs of this intermediation.  As I have argued elsewhere, one or more 

such measures should be the highest priority in filling out reform agendas directed both at 

the largest institutions and at systemic risk more generally.

One reason I place a high priority on initiatives to address the vulnerability 

created by short-term wholesale funding is that the development of these and other 

structural measures does not depend so heavily on identifying when credit growth or 

asset prices in one or more sectors of the economy have become unsustainable.  Instead, 

an externality analysis can help identify the points of vulnerability and guide the 

fashioning of appropriate regulations.  Indeed, what I described as structural policies may 

be better suited to containing certain kinds of risks than would policies requiring regular 

adjustment.  Obviously, judgment will still be needed to determine the degree of 

constraint to be imposed on relevant activities of large banking organizations.  But unlike 

real-time measures – where time will presumably be of the essence if those measures are 

to be effective – the adoption of structural constraints can proceed with the full 

opportunity for debate and public notice-and-comment that attends the rulemaking 

process.
