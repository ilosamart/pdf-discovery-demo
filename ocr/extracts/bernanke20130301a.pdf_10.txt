the likely path of policy, in general, and interest rates, in particular, can increase the 

effectiveness of policy.  In the present context, I would add that transparency may 

mitigate risks emanating from unexpected rate movements.  Thus, let me turn to 

prospects for long-term rates, starting with the expected path of rates and then turning to 

deviations from the expected path that may arise. 

If, as the FOMC anticipates, the economic recovery continues at a moderate pace, 

with unemployment slowly declining and inflation expectations remaining near 2 percent, 

then long-term interest rates would be expected to rise gradually toward more normal 

levels over the next several years.  This rise would occur as the marketâ€™s view of the 

expected date at which the Federal Reserve will begin the removal of policy 

accommodation draws nearer and then as accommodation is removed.  Some 

normalization of the term premium might also contribute to a rise in long-term rates.  

To illustrate possible paths, chart 4 displays four different forecasts of the 

evolution of the 10-year Treasury yield over coming years.  The black line is the forecast 

reported in the December 2012 Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey.  The green line 

gives the Congressional Budget Office forecast published in February, and the blue line 

presents the median from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, as reported in the first 

quarter of this year.  Finally, the purple line shows a forecast based on the term structure 

model used for the decomposition of the 10-year yield in chart 2.

  While these forecasts 

embody a wide range of underlying models and assumptions, the basic message is clear--

long-term interest rates are expected to rise gradually over the next few years, rising (at

 This projection assumes that two key components of the 10-year Treasury yield shown in chart 2--the 

expected average real short-rate and the term premium--revert to their respective mean levels over the 

period 2000 to 2006 during the next 5 years; the expected average inflation component is assumed to 

remain constant near the 2 percent level prevailing at the end of 2012.
