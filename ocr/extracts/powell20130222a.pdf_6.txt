expect that level to be substantially above one identified based on the experience of 

smaller euro-zone nations.      

The argument also has a serious timing problem.  The Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet likely will be normalized by late this decade, before the federal debt-to-GDP ratio 

even increases materially from today’s level.  Under the reasonable projection mentioned 

above, the debt-to-GDP ratio will remain roughly stable until 2020 before rising 

significantly in the next decade.8  That’s not a favorable longer-term forecast, all the 

more so because it is importantly the result of demographic changes that have been 

expected for decades.  But the forecast doesn’t support the authors’ claim that fears of 

fiscal dominance could materialize in the United States within the next five to seven 

years, during the period when the Fed is normalizing its balance sheet.   

No current market signal suggests that the United States is near the point of losing 

the market’s confidence.  In my view, nothing in the Congressional Budget Office debt 

forecasts or the authors’ empirical findings provides grounds for such an event during 

this decade.  The market has every reason to believe--and apparently still does believe--

that the United States will continue the difficult task of fiscal consolidation until the job 

is done. 

 Terribly difficult fiscal adjustments lie ahead.  Although there is still time to make 

them, delay will sharply increase the pain of adjustment.  The time to act is now.  In my 

view, the problem is not principally one of economics or fiscal policy; it is one of 

governance.  The real threat to the fiscal standing of the United States is that of inaction 

caused by a long period of political polarization and dysfunction.  That would be a self-
