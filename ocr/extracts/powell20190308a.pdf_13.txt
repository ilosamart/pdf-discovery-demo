when policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis, they had major 

questions about whether a central bankâ€™s promise of good times to come would have 

moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public.  Part of the problem is that when 

the time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular--

what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14   

Experience in the United States and around the world suggests that more frequent 

ELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future.  My FOMC colleagues and I believe 

that we have a responsibility to the American people to consider policies that might 

promote significantly better economic outcomes.  Makeup strategies are probably the 

most prominent idea and deserve serious attention.  They are largely untried, however, 

and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice.  Before they could 

be successfully implemented, there would have to be widespread societal understanding 

and acceptance--as I suggested, a high bar for any fundamental change.  In this review, 

we seek to start a discussion about makeup strategies and other policies that might 

broadly benefit the American people.   

Conclusion   

Tonight I have focused on policy normalization and our efforts to engage the 

public in what may come after.  Before concluding, I will say a few words on current 

conditions and the outlook.   

                                                 
14 Transcripts of FOMC discussions (see, for example, 2011 transcripts, available at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm) reveal that some policymakers 
were dubious about whether it would be appropriate or even feasible for a current FOMC to bind a future 
FOMC to a policy that it might find objectionable, which contributed to more general doubts over whether 
the policy would be credible.
