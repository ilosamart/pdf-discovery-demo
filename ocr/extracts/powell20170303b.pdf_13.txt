Advanced cryptography could reduce vulnerability to cyber attacks but make it 

easier to hide illegal activity.  To the extent we relax strong cryptography to make 

it easier for authorities to monitor illegal activity, we could simultaneously weaken 

security.  Growing computer power over time could be used to increase security 

but could also increase threats.  

Second, privacy issues must be seriously considered.  Central banks would 

have to maintain records of digital currency issuance and might need to maintain 

records of individual transactions in order to authenticate those transactions and to 

combat cyber risks and illegal activity.  In todayâ€™s environment, commercial banks 

maintain extensive records for individual debit and credit card transactions and 

increasingly monitor patterns of behavior for fraud.  Such records in the hands of a 

central bank or government entity, however, could raise serious privacy concerns 

by users and might limit public appeal.  Again, there may be important trade-offs 

between privacy and risk.   

Any central bank actively considering issuing its own digital currency would 

need to carefully consider the full range of the payments system and other policy 

issues, which do seem substantial, as well as the potential societal benefits.  To my 

mind, they should also consider whether the private sector can substantially meet 

the same needs.
