economic costs all complicate the undertaking.  So too, disentangling real economies from the 

funding advantages associated with moral hazard, or the supra-competitive profits associated 

with a concentrated industry structure, may not be easy.  Perhaps, then, in the short term, the 

research community and regulators may benefit from case studies that inform the direction of 

future research.   

Cooperation and Competition among Financial Institutions 

The second topic I want to address today is the impact on financial stability of 

simultaneous competition and cooperation among large financial institutions.  The IO literature 

gives us examples in which limited cooperation between otherwise competing firms can increase 

social welfare.  In these models, cooperation can overcome resource constraints, limited 

information, or externalities, and thereby induce welfare-enhancing investments that would not 

have been undertaken by firms acting individually.

  Large financial institutions have come 

together to provide infrastructure services such as exchanges, clearinghouses, and even 

information providers such as Markit Partners.  Other forms of cooperation among moderate-

sized institutions, such as syndicated lending and underwriting partnerships, serve to reduce 

information costs, overcome resource constraints, and diversify risk.  In antitrust terms, the 

practices I have in mind here would be subject to a rule of reason analysis that assesses both the 

potential for increased social welfare from limited cooperation and the negative direct or 

spillover effects on competition. 

The industrial organization literature has shown that enduring cooperation is most likely  

when firms interact repeatedly and can observe each others’ behavior.  In order to model 

cooperation among large financial firms, however, an additional factor needs to be incorporated.
