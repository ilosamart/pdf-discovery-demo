very good prudential reasons for these constraints upon acquisitions of, and by, banking 

organizations.  But, by screening out transactions that would result in unacceptable increases in 

risk, either to an institution or to the financial system as a whole, these provisions may in some 

cases unintentionally limit the salutary disciplining effect on boards and management of the 

market for corporate control. 

 The third way in which the nature of financial activities and regulation affect the 

operation of key mechanisms of corporate governance is that the risks associated with financial 

intermediaries--especially those that are significantly leveraged and that engage in substantial 

maturity transformation--pose a particular challenge for corporate governance.  All firms bear 

the risk that problems may unexpectedly arise because of, say, product flaws that were unknown 

to boards of directors and perhaps even senior management.  But in the case of financial 

intermediaries, these problems can be incredibly fast-moving, including runs on funding that can 

quickly place the very survival of the firm in doubt.  These risks have increased during the past 

25 years, as many institutions have combined traditional lending activities with capital markets 

businesses that rely on other funding models.  Accordingly, judgments about risk appetite and 

control systems to manage risk must be effectively executed by senior management and overseen 

by the board.  This imperative, in turn, means that the information and monitoring processes and 

systems established for, or available to, boards of financial institutions may need to be more 

extensive than those in large, nonfinancial firms.   

Financial Regulation and Corporate Governance 

 In the wake of the financial crisis, the public interest in regulation of banks and other 

financial firms is, I think it fair to say, both self-evident and substantial.  A full discussion of the
