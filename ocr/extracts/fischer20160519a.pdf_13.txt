III Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices (2003) 

Now we come to modern times, to Michael Woodford’s 2003 magnum opus, 

Interest and Prices.  Many of the results that appear in the book were developed and 

published earlier, for Michael has been a creative and insightful researcher from the start 

of his career.  But in the interests of time, I will start with the book.  And since the book 

is massive and comprehensive, I will focus on just a few topics of interest selected from 

it.  I also add discussion of Michael’s views on quantitative easing and forward guidance-

-topics that would have received far more attention in MWIP if it had been written a 

decade later than it was.  And let me note explicitly that Michael has continued to be 

remarkably productive, and that the topics I focus on below are among those best known 

by modern macroeconomists, but that there is far more to be learned from reading 

Michael’s work than I am able to discuss today. 

1. The Structure of MWIP.  Interest and Prices (MWIP) is divided into two 

parts.  Part I, Analytic Framework, is essentially an advanced textbook on 

modern macro models and some of their monetary policy implications, which 

introduces the reader to both useful techniques of analysis and recurrent and 

important issues in the field.  Its chapter headings are: Price-Level 

Determination under Interest Rate Rules; Optimizing Models with Nominal 

Rigidities; A Neo-Wicksellian Framework for the Analysis of Monetary 

Policy; and Dynamics of the Response to Monetary Policy.  Part II, Optimal 

Policy, is more directly policy-focused, with chapter headings: Inflation 

Stabilization and Welfare; Gains from Commitment to a Policy Rule; and 

finally, Optimal Monetary Policy Rules.
