taking as given the market’s expectations for Fed behavior.  As such, it would probably 

not make sense, in the short run, for the Committee to deviate from this approach--with 

an unprepared market, the result might well be an undesirable degree of market 

turbulence, with attendant negative effects on the real economy.  

On the other hand, there is clearly a time-consistency problem lurking here; the 

world we are in need not be the best of all possible worlds.  In particular, it is interesting 

to think about an alternative long-run equilibrium in which the Fed has somehow 

developed a reputation for worrying less about the immediate bond-market effect of its 

actions and is known to react more aggressively to changes in economic conditions.

  In 

this alternative equilibrium, the market would expect the Fed to behave in a less 

gradualist fashion, so any given move in the funds rate would have a smaller multiplier 

effect on long rates.  Thus, it is possible that in this alternative world, market volatility 

would be no higher than it is in our world, but the Fed would nevertheless be able to 

adjust policy more nimbly when it needed to.   

Of course, even if this alternative world is a better place, it may be difficult as an 

institutional matter to get from here to there.  And I do not have any particularly helpful 

insights on how one would make the transition.  Nevertheless, I do think there is a useful 

message to be borne in mind when thinking about communications strategy more 

generally.  There is always a temptation for the central bank to speak in a whisper,

 There is a close connection between this time-consistency problem and the well-known one that central 

banks face in trading off inflation and unemployment.  With respect to the latter, Kenneth Rogoff has 

argued that one can achieve a better outcome with a “conservative” central banker who places a higher 

weight on controlling inflation than does society as a whole.  In the current context, the analogy would be 

that one may be able to achieve a better outcome with a central banker who places a lower weight on the 

intermediate objective of not roiling the bond market.  See Kenneth Rogoff (1985), “The Optimal Degree 

of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 100 

(November), pp. 1169-89.
