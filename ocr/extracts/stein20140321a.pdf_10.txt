delivers an R-squared in excess of 40 percent.14  Analogously, Greenwood and Hanson 

show that the returns on junk bonds relative to Treasury securities over two- to three-year 

horizons can also be forecast with R-squared values in the ballpark of 30 to 40 percent, in 

this case by using two intuitively appealing forecasting variables:  credit spreads and the 

high-yield share, which is the fraction of total bond issuance that comes from the high-

yield category.15  Figure 1 illustrates the time-series variation in estimates of both of 

these risk premiums. 

Again, these sorts of findings are largely undisputed.  Where there is more 

controversy is over the interpretation of these patterns, with some arguing that they 

reflect waves of irrational investor sentiment and others taking the view that they come 

from more rational factors, such as time variation in either the risks facing investors or 

their tolerance for bearing such risks.  Here is where one can get into hard-to-resolve 

debates about bubble spotting and about whether one can expect the Federal Reserve to 

be smarter than other market participants.  However, at least for some purposes, these 

debates are beside the point.  In particular, the implications for monetary policy that I 

have in mind do not seem to depend critically on the difficult question of why there is so 

much time variation in expected bond market returns; they only require that this variation 

exists, as we know it does.  In other words, there may be scope to make considerable 

practical progress while remaining largely agnostic about the whole metaphysical are-

there-bubbles question.16

16 This statement admittedly sweeps some important subtleties under the rug.  More precisely, I suspect 
that, if one takes the Federal Reserve’s legal mandate as given--and, more specifically, takes as given an 
objective function such as minimizing the expected value of (U – U*)2--then one can remain agnostic about 
the source of variation in risk premiums and still reach the kinds of conclusions that I do in what follows.  
However, if one asks whether such a mandate is itself normatively optimal in a fully micro-founded model,
