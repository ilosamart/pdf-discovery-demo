Notwithstanding these more positive developments, however, it is clear that the 

recovery from the crisis has been much less robust than we had hoped.  From the latest 

comprehensive revisions to the national accounts as well as the most recent estimates of 

growth in the first half of this year, we have learned that the recession was even deeper 

and the recovery even weaker than we had thought; indeed, aggregate output in the 

United States still has not returned to the level that it attained before the crisis.  

Importantly, economic growth has for the most part been at rates insufficient to achieve 

sustained reductions in unemployment, which has recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 

percent.  Temporary factors, including the effects of the run-up in commodity prices on 

consumer and business budgets and the effect of the Japanese disaster on global supply 

chains and production, were part of the reason for the weak performance of the economy 

in the first half of 2011; accordingly, growth in the second half looks likely to improve as 

their influence recedes.  However, the incoming data suggest that other, more persistent 

factors also have been at work. 

Why has the recovery from the crisis been so slow and erratic?  Historically, 

recessions have typically sowed the seeds of their own recoveries as reduced spending on 

investment, housing, and consumer durables generates pent-up demand.  As the business 

cycle bottoms out and confidence returns, this pent-up demand, often augmented by the 

effects of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, is met through increased production 

and hiring.  Increased production in turn boosts business revenues and household 

incomes and provides further impetus to business and household spending.  Improving 

income prospects and balance sheets also make households and businesses more 

creditworthy, and financial institutions become more willing to lend.  Normally, these
