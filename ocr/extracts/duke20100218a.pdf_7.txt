the situation that prevailed in late 2007.  But because banks were very reluctant to use the 

window, that key tool was broken.  To offset the stigma effect, the Fed took a number of 

steps.  We reduced the spread--the difference between the primary credit rate and the 

federal funds target rate-- ultimately from 100 basis points to 25 basis points.  And we 

increased the maximum term from overnight to 90 days.  But banks’ concerns about 

stigma still more than offset the attractiveness of the lower rate.   

In December 2007, the Fed went further, launching the Term Auction Facility, or 

TAF, which provided term loans to banks through regular competitive auctions.  The 

competitive nature of the auction and the three-day deferred settlement of the TAF likely 

signaled that participants did not face an immediate shortage of funds.  Thus, TAF loans 

did not carry the same stigma as primary credit.  Finally, banks began to increase their 

usage of both primary credit and the TAF, perhaps due to lower spreads, longer terms, 

and reduced stigma, but no doubt in large part because market funding had become much 

less available.   

Unlocking Nonbank Markets 

 As the crisis unfolded, it became clear that the normal tools of the Federal 

Reserve--lower interest rates and loans to banks--were not going to be enough to 

maintain the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.  In today’s world, much of the 

credit that acts as the lifeblood of the economy is no longer funded on banks’ balance 

sheets.  To sustain credit markets in the system outside the banks, the so-called shadow 

banking system, we employed the seldom-used emergency lending authority in section 

13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  Congress originally approved the 13(3) authority in 

response to business lending problems during the Depression.  It allows the Fed broad
