What About Credit Growth?

• Replicate prior evidence that sustained growth in bank credit predicts 
future economic downturns- “credit booms go bust.”
Schularick & Taylor (2012); Jorda, Schularick & Taylor (2013)

• In a horse race, credit-market sentiment drives out bank credit growth.

• Implications:
• Not necessarily a different story.
• Bond market variables may be a better proxy for sentiment.
• Though suggestive of disruptions not just in bank loan supply, but also in 

wider supply of credit.
