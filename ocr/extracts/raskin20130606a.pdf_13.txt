believe that effective supervisory assessments of risk and capital adequacy as part of the 

community bank examination process are absolutely critical.  

Conclusion 

In sum, let me conclude by saying that time is of the essence here in moving forward with 

the Basel III final rules.  The proposed rules were not perfect and I expect there to be meaningful 

modifications.  At the same time, while we attempt to craft a risk-based system that makes sense 

from the perspective of safety and soundness, we have to resist the temptation to believe we can 

create a perfectly sensitive risk-based regime that gives the illusion of safety.  Such a regime 

would not be a meaningful surrogate for effective on-site supervision, and the effort to try to 

create an ever-more refined system would distract us from some of the important policy 

questions that lie ahead for our financial system.  Finally, there are costs to complexity that 

should not be ignored.  We shouldnâ€™t be lulled into thinking that these unnecessary costs should 

be allocated to community banks, which are a segment of our financial system that provides 

meaningful benefits to many Americans. 

Thank you very much for your time this morning.
