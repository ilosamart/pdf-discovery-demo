credibility of the exercise and creates accountability both for firms and supervisors.  That said, 

too much transparency can also have potentially negative consequences, an idea to which I will 

turn shortly. 

With the benefit of five years of experience, the Fed is continuing to assess its stress 

testing program, and to make appropriate changes.  Examples of such changes to date include the 

assumption of default by each firm’s largest counterparty and the assumption that firms would 

not curtail lending to consumers and businesses, even under severely adverse conditions.  As part 

of that assessment process, we are also currently seeking feedback from the industry, market 

analysts, and academics about the program.   

Supervisory stress testing is not a static exercise and must adapt to a changing economic 

and financial environment and must incorporate innovations in modeling technology.  Work is 

currently underway on adapting the stress testing framework to accommodate firms that have not 

traditionally been subject to these tests.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to conduct stress 

tests on non-bank financial institutions that have been designated as systemically important by 

the FSOC--the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Three of the currently designated financial 

institutions are global insurance companies.  While distress at these firms poses risks to financial 

stability, particularly during a stressful period, certain sources of risk to these firms are distinct 

from the risks banking organizations face.  A key aspect of this ongoing work includes adapting 

our current stress testing framework and scenarios to ensure that the tests for non-bank SIFIs--

systemically important financial institutions--are appropriate.  

Another area where work continues--and will likely always continue--is the Fed’s 

ongoing research aimed at improving our ability to estimate losses and revenues under stress.  

Supervisors have both to develop new approaches that push the state of the art in stress testing
