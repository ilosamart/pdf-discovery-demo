The Taylor rule prescription is juxtaposed with the actual path of the policy rate taken 

from Slide 1, again shown in blue. 

The comparison displayed in Slide 3 provides the most commonly cited evidence 

that monetary policy was too easy during the period from 2002 to 2006, as the actual 

federal funds rate is below the values implied by the Taylor rule--by about 200 basis 

points on average over this five-year period (Taylor, 2007). 

Of course, the validity of that conclusion depends on whether the specific 

assumptions and measurements used to construct the Taylor rule’s policy prescription are 

appropriate.  Room for disagreement exists.  For example, some empirical and simulation 

evidence suggests that the responsiveness of policy to the output gap, given by the 

parameter b in the Taylor rule equation, should be higher than the value of 0.5 originally 

chosen by Taylor.6  Higher values of b lead the Taylor rule to recommend somewhat 

lower policy rates during recessions and their aftermaths. 

 The prescriptions of the Taylor rule may also depend sensitively on how inflation 

and the output gap are measured.  The difficulties in measuring the output gap, 

particularly in real time, are well known.  The choice of inflation measure may also be 

consequential.  In his original 1993 paper, Taylor chose to measure inflation using the 

GDP deflator.  As noted, the Taylor rule policy prescription shown in Slide 3 is based on 

the familiar CPI measure of inflation.  For its part, during the past decade, the FOMC has 

typically focused on inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE), because that measure is less dominated than is the CPI by the 

imputed rent of owner-occupied housing, and for other technical reasons.  As it happens,
