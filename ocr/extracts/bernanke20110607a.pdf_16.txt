requires that the Federal Reserve be vigilant in preserving its hard-won credibility for 

maintaining price stability.  As I have explained, most FOMC participants currently see 

the recent increase in inflation as transitory and expect inflation to remain subdued in the 

medium term.  Should that forecast prove wrong, however, and particularly if signs were 

to emerge that inflation was becoming more broadly based or that longer-term inflation 

expectations were becoming less well anchored, the Committee would respond as 

necessary.  Under all circumstances, our policy actions will be guided by the objectives 

of supporting the recovery in output and employment while helping ensure that inflation, 

over time, is at levels consistent with the Federal Reserveâ€™s mandate.
