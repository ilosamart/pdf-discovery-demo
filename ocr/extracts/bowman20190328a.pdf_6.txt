equipment and technology to meet this rising demand.  And, in a troubling echo of the 

1980s, farm incomes have now been cut roughly in half.   

That said, there are some important differences between the 1980s and today.  

With current inflation low and stable, interest rates are substantially lower than in the 

1980s, and overall leverage has been less pronounced.  And in contrast to the 1980s, 

farmland values have declined only modestly in recent years.  The combination of 

relatively low interest rates and modest debt levels has resulted in more-manageable debt 

service requirements for many agricultural borrowers.5   

Some farm operations have faced significant financial stress, and it is important to 

recognize that there are still risks.  Farmland prices are quite high, and working capital 

continues to decline.  However, returns at banks with a concentration in agriculture have 

generally remained healthy, as most producers have continued to make loan payments 

despite weakening revenue streams.  

Let me shift focus now to the role of banks, particularly community banks, in the 

U.S. farm economy.  Community banks foster strong long-term relationships with 

farmers, ranchers, and others involved in the local business of agriculture.  Often, these 

relationships are cultivated through community bankers’ service on local civic and 

business organizations or by participation with local farmers and their families in 

activities to support the local community and economy.  Agricultural community banks 

and agricultural borrowers share a common goal of serving and strengthening their local 

communities.  They are also responsible for providing jobs that maintain the viability of
