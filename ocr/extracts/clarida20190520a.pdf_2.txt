I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing the New York perspective 

for the Federal Reserve’s review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices.1  We are bringing open minds to our review and are seeking a 

broad range of perspectives.  To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to 

engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive 

approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 

Motivation for the Review 

The Congress charged the Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate—

maximum employment and price stability—and this review will take this mandate as 

given.  We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for 

personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-

stability mandate.  While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and 

communications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate 

ways they might be improved. 

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and 

price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review.  The 

unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent 

objective.  We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming 

years.  In addition, we will evaluate the new policy tools and enhanced communication 

practices the Federal Reserve deployed in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the

2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy 
framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes.
