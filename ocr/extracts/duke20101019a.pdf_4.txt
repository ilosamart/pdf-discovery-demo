After the Chairman calls the meeting to order, the manager of the System Open Market 

Account (SOMA) describes developments in the financial markets since the last meeting.  The 

SOMA, which is managed by the New York Fed, is the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of securities 

used to implement monetary policy.  

In many two-day meetings, the manager’s report is followed by the discussion of a 

special topic, such as inflation measurements or the use of unconventional monetary policy tools.  

After any special topics or briefings, the discussion turns to the economy.  The director of the 

Division of Research and Statistics and the director of the Division of International Finance at 

the Board give a tag-team presentation on the status and outlook for the domestic and 

international economies.  In the four meetings a year when we make formal economic 

projections, there also is a presentation that summarizes the projections of the FOMC 

participants and how they have changed since the previous projections.  Following a question-

and-answer period, it is time for each FOMC participant to give his or her input on the economy 

in what is referred to as the “economic go-round.” 

The speaking order of FOMC participants changes a bit each time, but generally the 

Reserve Bank presidents go first, followed by the members of the Board.  Each participant has 

his or her own style.  Everyone talks about his or her views on current and expected national and 

international economic conditions.  The presidents’ remarks usually include comments about 

conditions in their districts, while the contributions of the Board members tend to reflect their 

individual backgrounds.  Chairman Bernanke concludes the economic go-round with a summary 

of what all the other policymakers said about the economy, then makes his own comments.  I 

always marvel at his ability to quickly and coherently summarize a diverse set of observations 

into a cohesive narrative and use it to transition the discussion to appropriate policy.
