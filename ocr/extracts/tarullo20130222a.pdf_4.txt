 The period of relative legal and industry stability that had followed the New Deal thus 

gave way in the 1970s to a nearly 30-year period during which many prevailing restrictions on 

banks were relaxed.  A good number were loosened through administrative action by the banking 

agencies, but important statutory measures headed in the same direction.  This legislative trend 

culminated in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which consolidated and extended the 

administrative changes that had allowed more extensive affiliations of commercial banks with 

investment banks, broker-dealers, private equity firms, and other financial entities.  But in 

sweeping away the remnants of one key element of the New Deal regulatory system, neither 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley nor financial regulators substituted new regulatory mechanisms to match 

the wholesale changes in the structure of the financial services industry and the dramatic growth 

of novel financial instruments. 

 In fact, I would generalize this last observation to say that the need to address the 

consequences of the progressive integration of traditional lending, trading activities, and capital 

markets lies at the heart of three post-crisis challenges to the policy foundations of the Federal 

Reserve and, to a greater or lesser degree, many other central banks. 

Microprudential Regulation.  The first challenge posed by the crisis was to traditional, 

microprudential regulation, which focuses on the safety and soundness of each prudentially 

regulated firm.   Not all central banks have microprudential regulatory authority, of course, 

and--as in the United States--those that do sometimes share it with other agencies.  But the 

shortcomings of pre-crisis regulatory regimes have been of concern to all central banks.  Most 

notably, capital requirements for banking organizations, particularly the large ones that might be 

regarded as too-big-to-fail, simply were not strong enough.  Risk-weights were too low for 

certain traded assets that had proliferated as credit and capital markets integrated more
