right standard when contemplating the well-being of a CCP in isolation.  But it seems worth 

considering whether this standard is adequate when hypothesizing stress throughout the financial 

system, since the default of two large counterparties would almost surely be accompanied by 

significant market disruption.  At the least, it is important to ensure a consistent, robust 

implementation of the cover 2 standard that has already been agreed. 

While the question of what constitutes the optimal default fund standard needs more 

analysis and debate, I think there is little question that more attention must be paid to 

strengthening stress testing, recovery strategies, and resolution plans for significant CCPs.  The 

typical CCP recovery strategy does not take a system-wide perspective and is premised on 

imposing losses on, or drawing liquidity from, CCP members during what may be a period of 

systemic stress.  Many of these members are themselves systemically important firms, which 

will likely be suffering losses and facing liquidity demands of their own in anything but an 

idiosyncratic stress scenario at a CCP.  Moreover, in at least some cases, uncertainty is increased 

by the difficulty of estimating with any precision the extent of potential liability of members to 

the CCP, thereby complicating both their recovery planning and efforts by the official sector to 

assess system-wide capital and liquidity availability in adverse scenarios.  

These and other questions will be discussed in the coming months at the CPMI, the FSB, 

and other international fora, as well as among U.S. regulators.  Researchers with a 

macroprudential perspective can contribute to these discussions with analyses of system-wide 

liquidity demands and knock-on effects of defaults by CCP members, as well as policy 

suggestions to address vulnerabilities that emerge from these analyses.
