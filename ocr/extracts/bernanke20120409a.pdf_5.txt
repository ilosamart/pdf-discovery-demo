banks’ individual risk profiles, it also has helped us better evaluate the potential effects of 

financial disruptions in Europe on credit flows and economic activity in the United 

States.  

Macroprudential considerations are being incorporated into the development of 

new regulations as well as into supervision.  For example, in December, the Federal 

Reserve issued a package of proposed rules to implement sections 165 and 166 of the 

Dodd-Frank Act.  The rules would establish prudential standards for the largest bank 

holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms, standards that 

become more stringent as the systemic footprint of the firm increases.  We are also 

collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and foreign 

authorities to help implement the FDIC’s new resolution authority for systemically 

critical firms.  In particular, last fall we issued a joint rule with the FDIC that requires 

each of these firms to produce a credible plan--known as a living will--for an orderly 

resolution in the event of its failure. 

In the international arena, we strongly supported the Basel Committee’s adoption 

in the summer of 2009 of tougher regulatory capital standards for trading activities and 

securitization exposures.  We have also worked closely with international partners to help 

develop the Basel III framework, which requires globally active banks to hold more and 

higher-quality capital and larger liquidity buffers, and which now incorporates a 

provision to impose capital surcharges based on firms’ global systemic importance.  

These surcharges are intended to reduce the risk of failure of systemic firms and also to 

force these firms, in their decisions regarding their size and complexity, to internalize the 

possible costs that those decisions might impose on the broader economic and financial
