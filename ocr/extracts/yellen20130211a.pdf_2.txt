efforts to strengthen the recovery and pursue a goal that it shares with the labor 

movement:  maximum employment.1 

As an objective of public policy, maximum employment doesn’t appear in the 

U.S. Constitution, in any presidential decree, or even in the mission statement of the 

Labor Department.  A law passed in 1946 made it a general goal for the U.S. government, 

but so far the Federal Reserve is the only agency assigned the job of pursuing maximum 

employment.  The 1977 law spelling out that responsibility also assigned the goal of 

stable prices, and we call this combination of objectives the Federal Reserve’s dual 

mandate.2  

With so many people today unable to find work, it might seem odd to highlight 

such an ambitious and distant goal for employment.  I do so because the gulf between 

maximum employment and the very difficult conditions workers face today helps explain 

the urgency behind the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the recovery.  My 

colleagues and I are acutely aware of how much workers have lost in the past five years.  

In response, we have taken, and are continuing to take, forceful action to increase the 

pace of economic growth and job creation.

System.  I am indebted to members of the Board staff--John Maggs, Karen Pence, Jeremy Rudd, and 
William Wascher--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks, and to Board staff members Sejla 
Karalic and Christopher Nekarda for assistance with the exhibits.

prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”  See section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 
§ 225a as added by act of Nov. 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1387) and amended by acts of Oct. 27, 1978 (92 Stat. 
1897); Aug. 23, 1988 (102 Stat. 1375); and Dec. 27, 2000 (114 Stat. 3028)).
