insurance backing on non-amortizing lines of credit secured by homes.  The United States 

and the European Union required issuers of securities to retain some of the credit risk in 

them to better align incentives among participants (although in the United States, MBS 

issued by Fannie and Freddie are currently exempt from this requirement).  And post-

crisis, many countries are more actively pursuing macroprudential policies, particularly 

those targeted at the housing sector.25  New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark instituted 

tighter LTV limits or guidelines for areas that had overheating housing markets.  

Globally, the introduction of new capital and liquidity regulations has increased the 

resilience of the banking system.  

But memories fade.  Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Housing Administration are 

now the dominant providers of mortgage funding, and the FHLBs have expanded their 

balance sheets notably.  House prices are now high and rising in several countries, 

perhaps as a result of extended periods of low interest rates.   

What should be done as we move ahead?   

First, macroprudential policies can help reduce the incidence and severity of 

housing crises.  While some policies focus on the cost of mortgage credit, others attempt 

directly to restrict householdsâ€™ ability to borrow.  Each policy has its own merits and 

working out their respective advantages is important.  

Second, government involvement can promote the social benefits of 

homeownership, but those benefits come at a cost, both directly, for example through the 

beneficial tax treatment of homeownership, and indirectly through government 

assumption of risk.  To that extent, government support, where present, should be explicit
