reference solely to the balance sheet of a specific firm.  The risk weights assigned to the firm's 

assets were calculated with reference to ordinary times, whether through a supervisory 

determination or a combination of supervisory formulas and a firm's own modeling.  This 

microprudential focus did not take into account the potential impact of a shock to the value of 

widely-held assets--whether exogenous, caused by the distress sales of such assets by a large 

firm suffering particularly severe problems, or, as in the financial crisis, a lethal interaction 

between these two factors.   

The limits of the microprudential approach were particularly evident with respect to very 

large, interconnected firms.  There would be very substantial negative externalities associated 

with the disorderly failure of any such firm, distinct from the costs incurred by the firm and its 

stakeholders.  The failure of one large firm, especially in a period of stress, significantly 

increases the chances that other financial firms will fail, for two reasons.  First, direct 

counterparty impacts can lead to a classic domino effect.  Second, because losses in a tail event 

are much more likely to be correlated for firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, 

and other capital market instruments, all such firms are vulnerable to accelerating losses as 

troubled firms sell their assets into a declining market. 

Reform of Capital Regulation in the Post-Crisis Period 

It is obvious that the post-crisis regulatory system will not be as dependent on capital 

requirements as the pre-crisis regime.  Dodd-Frank itself is testimony to this fact, as are a 

number of changes already made by the bank regulatory agencies.  There is now increased 

emphasis on market discipline, liquidity regulation, activities restrictions, and more effective 

supervision, in addition to capital requirements.  Reforms for money market funds and the 

triparty repo market, as well as more general attention to wholesale funding models for financial
