research on key indicators of building imbalances.3 Instead of attempting to forecast 

particular adverse shocks that could buffet the economy, the focus is on vulnerabilities--

that is, on features of the financial system that amplify bad shocks, spreading damage to 

households and businesses.  Each quarter, Federal Reserve Board staff assess a set of 

vulnerabilities relevant for financial stability:  asset valuations and risk appetite, 

borrowing by the nonfinancial sector (households and nonfinancial businesses), liquidity 

risks and maturity transformation by the financial system, and leverage in the financial 

system.

It may be illuminating to briefly describe our current assessment in each of these 

areas.  Valuations in a broad set of markets appear elevated relative to historical norms, 

even after taking into account recent movements. Estimates of risk premiums and 

spreads in a range of markets remain narrow by historical standards. Corporate bond 

yields remain low by historical comparison, and spreads of yields on junk bonds above

those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities are near the lower-end of their 

historical range. Spreads on leveraged loans and securitized products backed by those 

loans remain narrow. Prices of multifamily residential and industrial commercial real 

estate (CRE) have risen, and capitalization rates--the ratios of operating income relative 

to the sale price of commercial properties--for these segments have reached historical 

lows. However, measures of credit conditions suggest that lenders are, to an extent, 

taking into account the potential for a reversion of valuations.

3 In addition to cyclical vulnerabilities, structural vulnerabilities, such as those that arise from the 
complexity and interconnectedness of large financial institutions, also remain potential sources of risk to 
the financial system. The Federal Reserve assesses structural vulnerabilities in support of its financial 
stability and supervision and regulation responsibilities.  For instance, cybersecurity is the subject of
ongoing monitoring and policy efforts.
