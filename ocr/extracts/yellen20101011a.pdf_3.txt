of financial regulation and supervision--one capable of identifying and managing 

excesses before they lead to crises.  We must find a way to contain these threats without 

putting a straitjacket on financial innovation and risk-taking.  I don’t claim this is an easy 

task, but it is an essential one. 

Lessons from the Crisis  

It is now clear that our system of regulation and supervision was fatally flawed.  

Despite volumes of research on financial market metrics and weighty position papers on 

financial stability, the fact is that we simply didn’t understand some of the most 

dangerous systemic threats.  Looking back, I believe the regulatory community was lulled 

into complacency by a combination of a Panglossian worldview and benign experience.  

The notion that financial markets should be as free as possible from regulatory fetters had 

evolved into the conviction that those markets could, to a very considerable extent, police 

themselves.  Meanwhile, things went along so well for so long that the common belief 

came to be that nothing could go disastrously wrong.  Over a period of decades, the 

financial system was tested repeatedly--the Latin American debt crisis, the savings and 

loan crisis, the Asian crisis, the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, and the stock 

market crashes of the late 1980s and early 2000s.  With each crisis, policymakers rolled 

up their sleeves and beat back the systemic threat.  The levees held.  Despite these 

financial market ups and downs, economies in the United States and other parts of the 

world performed very well.  We appeared to have entered a new era of stability.  We 

even gave it a name:  the Great Moderation.  We were left with the mirage of a system 

that we thought was invulnerable to shock, a financial Maginot Line that we believed 

couldn’t be breached.  We now know that this sense of invincibility was mere hubris.
