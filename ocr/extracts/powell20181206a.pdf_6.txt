roundtable discussions in communities across the country will also allow us to hear 

suggestions for improving CRA from local stakeholders, including many people from 

rural communities.  These perspectives will inform our deliberations on this critical 

regulation, and we will make a summary of our discussions available to the public. 

In closing, while the economy is strong overall, we recognize that some 

communities have yet to feel the full benefits of the ongoing expansion.  We are 

conducting research, collaborating with communities, and assessing financial regulations 

so that our nation’s current prosperity will benefit small towns and cities alike.  The work 

being done by tonight’s award recipients and by each of you in this room is critical to 

making progress toward that goal.  Thank you for being our partners in this work, and 

enjoy the conference.
