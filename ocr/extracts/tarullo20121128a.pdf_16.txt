intrusiveness into the consolidated supervision of foreign banks by their home-country regulators 

without the ultimate ability to evaluate those banks comprehensively or to direct changes in a 

parent bankâ€™s practices necessary to mitigate risks in the United States.  Although the Federal 

Reserve will continue to cooperate with its foreign counterparts in overseeing large, 

multinational banking operations, that supervisory tool cannot provide complete protection 

against risks engendered by U.S operations as extensive as those of many large U.S. institutions. 

It is also important to note that while the reforms I have described today contain some 

elements that are more territorial than our current approach, including requiring some additional 

capital and liquidity buffers to be held in the United States, they do not represent a complete 

departure from prior practice.  This enhanced approach would allow foreign banks to continue to 

operate branches in the United States and would generally allow branches to meet comparable 

capital requirements at the consolidated level.  Similarly, this approach would not impose a cap 

on intra-group flows, thereby allowing foreign banks in sound financial condition to continue to 

obtain U.S. dollar funding for their global operations through their U.S. entities.  It would instead 

provide an incentive to term out at least some of this funding in a way that reduces the risk of 

runs.  

 Requiring additional local capital and liquidity buffers, like any prudential regulation, 

may incrementally increase cost and reduce flexibility of internationally active banks that 

manage their capital and liquidity on a centralized basis.  However, managing liquidity and 

capital on a local basis can have benefits not just for financial stability generally, but also for 

firms themselves.  During the crisis, the more decentralized global banks relied somewhat less on 

cross-currency funding and were less exposed to disruptions in international wholesale funding
