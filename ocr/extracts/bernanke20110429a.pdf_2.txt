 As always, I’m pleased to join you at the Federal Reserve’s biennial Community 

Affairs Research Conference.  This meeting brings together researchers, community 

development professionals, and public-sector officials to explore how best to strengthen 

struggling communities.  Needless to say, that endeavor is more crucial than ever.  The 

past few years have been very difficult.  Weak economic conditions at the national level 

have translated into hardships in many communities at the same time that communities 

have fewer resources available for stabilization and revitalization.  Considerable good 

work is going on nonetheless, and I will offer a few examples of that today.

the labor market has been gradually improving and the unemployment rate has declined 

somewhat.  But unemployment remains quite high, particularly among minorities, the

historically high levels.  Nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for six 

months or more.  The housing market is also holding back the recovery.  The foreclosure 

rate remains very high, and many homeowners who have avoided foreclosure find 

themselves “under water,” meaning their mortgage debt exceeds the value of their homes.

their mortgage payments. 

The Challenges to Communities 

 As families have struggled, so have their communities.  In some areas, for 

example, high foreclosure rates have produced significant numbers of vacant properties, 

depressing surrounding home prices, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for
