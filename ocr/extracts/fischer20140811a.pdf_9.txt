decrease in the labor force participation rate since 2000.  Although this reduction in labor 

supply largely reflects demographic factors--such as the aging of the population--

participation has fallen more than many observers expected and the interpretation of these 

movements remains subject to considerable uncertainty.  For instance, there are good 

reasons to believe that some of the surprising weakness in labor force participation 

reflects still poor cyclical conditions.  Many of those who dropped out of the labor force 

may be discouraged workers.  Further strengthening of the economy will likely pull some 

of these workers back into the labor market, although skills and networks may have 

depreciated some over the past years.  

Another factor that may be contributing to a slowdown in longer-run output 

growth is a decline in the rate of investment.  As is typical in a downturn, movements in 

investment were important to the cyclical swings in the economy during the Great 

Recession.  And, as would be expected given the depth of the downturn, investment 

declines were especially large in this episode.  However, in the United States, and in 

many other countries as well, the growth rate of the capital stock has yet to bounce back 

appreciably--despite historically low interest rates, access to borrowing for most firms, 

and ample profits and cash--causing concerns over the long-run prospects for the 

recovery of investment. 

Turning next to productivity growth, Solow’s famous result over fifty years ago 

was that over eighty percent of growth in output per hour in the period 1909-1949 came 

from technical change.8  Between 1964 and 2003 total factor productivity growth in the 

United States averaged around 1-1/2 percent, contributing to a 2 percent expansion per
