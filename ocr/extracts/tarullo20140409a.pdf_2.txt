In the more than five years that I have been a member of the Board of Governors 

of the Federal Reserve System, it has been hard not to concentrate on near-term economic 

prospects.  The severe decline in the economy precipitated by the financial crisis and the 

magnitude of job and production loss in the Great Recession that followed have made a 

focus on recovery both understandable and imperative.  But as I have prepared for 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings every six to seven weeks by 

examining incoming data and the analyses of our own staff and of outside economists, I 

have been struck by the evidence of longer-term challenges to the American economy 

that poke through shorter-term discussions. 

There is considerable ongoing debate about whether the financial crisis and 

recession amplified changes already afoot in the economy, accelerated them, or simply 

revealed them more clearly.  Whatever one’s view on that question, the confluence of 

some apparently secular trends raises important questions about our nation’s future 

growth potential and our ability to provide opportunity for all of our people.  Indeed, 

these changes reflect serious challenges not only to the functioning of the American 

economy over the coming decades, but also to some of the ideals that undergird the 

nation’s democratic heritage.  This evening I will address in some detail four particularly 

important developments:  

1. Productivity growth has slowed.  As a result, the overall economic pie is 
expanding more slowly than before. 

2. Some indicators further suggest that workers have been claiming a smaller 
share of the overall economic pie during the past decade. 

3. Inequality has continued to increase, meaning that a larger portion of overall 
economic resources is commanded by a smaller segment of the population.
