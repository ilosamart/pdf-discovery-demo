In his article, Ira Goldstein emphasizes the difference between stabilizing neighborhoods 

and impacting individual properties.  He describes a data-based tool developed by the 

Reinvestment Fund to characterize the underlying dynamics of local real estate markets.  Their 

Market Value Analysis is based on a set of indicators drawn from local administrative records 

and third-party data sources.  Indicators include such things as median sales prices, number of 

sales as a percent of housing units, foreclosure filings as a percentage of sales, percentage of 

commercial properties, percentage of tax abated properties or newly constructed properties, 

percentage of owner-occupied properties, and residential vacancy rates.  Data such as these are 

analyzed on a census tract basis, making them small enough to capture slight variations in 

community character but large enough to be reliably aggregated for mapping and statistical 

analysis.     

Using such analysis, communities can more effectively decide where NSP funds will 

have the greatest impact.  For example, using Philadelphia data, Goldstein begins by identifying 

neighborhoods eligible for use of NSP funds.  He further calculates the percentage of 

foreclosures in each neighborhood that could be addressed using NSP funds.  He argues that, 

from the standpoint of neighborhood stabilization, the best use of funds is in neighborhoods 

where there is the intersection of 1) a demonstrated need combined with the ability to impact a 

significant fraction of foreclosures, 2) the absence of other significant barriers to revitalization, 

and 3) the presence of additional strengthening factors, such as the strength of surrounding 

neighborhoods.  Combining indicators-of-need with indicators-of-probable-success within data-

driven analytical tools can help communities strategically invest scarce dollars to build on 

community strengths and remove barriers to community success.  This approach also helps 

communities to leverage other funding in the context of a larger community stabilization plan.
