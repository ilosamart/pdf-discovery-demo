 The recent financial crisis revealed critical gaps and weaknesses in the U.S. 

financial system and the financial regulatory framework.  The Congress and the 

Administration last year provided a roadmap for addressing many of these problems, in 

the form of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-

Legislative reforms in any complex area always face the risk of fighting the last 

war, responding to the causes of the last crisis without sufficient attention to where new 

problems may arise.  To their credit, the authors of the Dodd-Frank Act attempted to 

reduce this risk by building in a number of features aimed at helping our system of 

financial oversight adapt over time to changes in the financial environment.  Notably, a 

central element of the legislation is the requirement that the Federal Reserve and other

approach that supplements traditional supervision and regulation of individual firms or 

markets with explicit consideration of threats to the stability of the financial system as a

membership comprises a diverse group of federal and state financial regulators, to 

coordinate the government’s efforts to identify and respond to systemic risks.

framework for financial oversight represents a major innovation in our thinking about 

financial regulation, one that is taking hold abroad as well as in the United States.  This 

new direction is constructive and necessary, I believe, but it also poses considerable 

conceptual and operational challenges in its implementation.  In my remarks today I will 

briefly discuss the rationale for macroprudential supervision and regulation, describe the
