Conclusion 

 To wrap up, since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, our economy has 

recovered slowly but steadily.  Today, we are reasonably close to achieving full 

employment and our 2 percent inflation objective.  But we face real challenges over the 

medium and longer terms.  Our aging population will mean slower growth, all else held 

equal.  If living standards are to continue to rise, we need policies that will support 

productivity and allow our dynamic economy to generate widespread gains in prosperity.
