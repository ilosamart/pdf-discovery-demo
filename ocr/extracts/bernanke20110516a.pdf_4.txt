financial, labor, and product markets all support innovation, entrepreneurship, and 

growth, as do effective tax, trade, and regulatory policies.  Policies directed at objectives 

such as the protection of intellectual property rights and the promotion of research and 

development, or R&D, promote innovation and technological change more directly. 

In the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on one important component of 

innovation policy--namely, government support for R&D.  As I have already suggested, 

the effective commercial application of new ideas involves much more than just pure 

research.  Many other factors are relevant, including the extent of market competition, the 

intellectual property regime, and the availability of financing for innovative enterprises.  

That said, the tendency of the market to supply too little of certain types of R&D 

provides a rationale for government intervention; and no matter how good the policy 

environment, ultimately, big new ideas are often rooted in well-executed R&D.   

The Rationale for a Government Role in Research and Development 

Governments in many countries directly support scientific and technical research, 

for example, through grant-providing agencies (like the National Science Foundation in 

the United States) or through tax incentives (like the R&D tax credit).  In addition, the 

governments of the United States and many other countries run their own research 

facilities, including facilities focused on nonmilitary applications such as health.  The 

primary economic rationale for a government role in R&D is that, absent such 

intervention, the private market would not adequately supply certain types of research.3  

The argument, which applies particularly strongly to basic or fundamental research, is 

that the full economic value of a scientific advance is unlikely to accrue to its discoverer, 

                                                 
3 For an early version of this argument see Arrow (1962).
