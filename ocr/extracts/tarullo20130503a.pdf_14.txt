thereby, to contain the risks of runs and contagion.  Of course, it also raises many of the 

issues that make settling on a single policy instrument so hard to achieve,

 and the 

decision on calibration would be particularly consequential.  Still, the concept has much 

to be said for it and seems the most promising avenue toward satisfying the principle of 

comprehensiveness.  It is definitely worth pursuing. 

 As you can tell, there is not yet a blueprint for addressing the basic vulnerabilities 

in short-term wholesale funding markets.  Accordingly, the risks of runs and contagion 

remain.  For the present, we can continue to work on discrete aspects of these markets, 

such as through the diminution of reliance on intraday credit in triparty repo markets that 

is being achieved by Federal Reserve supervision of clearing banks and through the 

money market fund reforms that I expect will be pursued by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission.  We might also think about less comprehensive measures affecting SFTs, 

such as limits on rehypothecation, when an institution uses assets that have been posted 

as collateral by its clients for its own purposes.

  But I do not think that the post-crisis 

program of regulatory reform can be judged complete until a more comprehensive set of 

measures to address this problem is in place. 

 Too-Big-to-Fail.  Before discussing policies specifically directed at too-big-to-

fail, let me say a word about the capital regime that should be applicable to all banks, on

 To give just one example:  Securities lending sometimes involves an exchange of securities for securities 

and sometimes involves an exchange of cash for securities.  Determining whether and/or how to apply a 

universal margining requirement to securities lending transactions of both varieties would be challenging.

 Rehypothecation of fully paid customer securities held by broker-dealers not only permits a kind of 

money creation by broker-dealers, it also can put the securities of the customer at risk, as was seen after the 

Lehman failure, when some clients found that their securities had been reused by the firmâ€™s London office 

in a way that made them difficult to reclaim.  In the United States, the Securities and Exchange 

Commission has long limited, though not prohibited, rehypothecation of customer securities.  Other 

countries may try to limit the practice informally, but have no formal rules.  Given the combined 

macroprudential and investor protection concerns raised by rehypothecation, a review of current U.S. 

limits, and the adoption of rules by other relevant countries, seems a logical and, relative to some other 

proposals, feasible step.
