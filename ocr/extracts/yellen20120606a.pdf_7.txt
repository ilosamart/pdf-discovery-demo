Turning to inflation, figure 3 summarizes private and FOMC forecasts.  Overall 

consumer price inflation has fluctuated quite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements 

in prices for oil and other commodities.  In early 2011 and again earlier this year, prices of crude 

oil, and thus of gasoline, rose noticeably.  Smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) averaged near 2 

percent over the past two years.  In recent weeks, however, oil and gasoline prices have 

moderated and are now showing through to the headline inflation figures.  Looking ahead, most 

FOMC participants at the time of our April meeting expected inflation to be at, or a bit below, 

our long-run objective of 2 percent through 2014; private forecasters on average also expect 

inflation to be close to 2 percent.  As with unemployment, uncertainty around the inflation 

projection is substantial. 

In the view of some observers, the stability of inflation in the face of high unemployment 

in recent years constitutes evidence that much of the remaining unemployment is structural and 

not cyclical.  They reason that if there were truly substantial slack in the labor market, simple 

accelerationist “Phillips curve” models would predict more noticeable downward pressure on 

inflation.  However, substantial cross-country evidence suggests that, in low-inflation 

environments, inflation is notably less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack 

than it is when inflation is elevated.  In other words, the short-run Phillips curve may flatten out.5  

One important reason for this non-linearity, in my view, is downward nominal wage rigidity--

that is, the reluctance or inability of many firms to cut nominal wages.   

                                                            
5 The simplest accelerationist version of the Phillips curve relates the change in inflation to the level of labor market 
slack; more-complicated versions also highlight the influence of inflation expectations, changes in marginal 
production costs, and other factors.  Evidence for the United States and other countries that the sensitivity of 
inflation to resource slack may be nonlinear can be found in André Meier (2010), “Still Minding the Gap--Inflation 
Dynamics during Episodes of Persistent Large Output Gaps,” IMF Working Paper WP/10/189 (Washington:  
International Monetary Fund, August), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10189.pdf.
