As currently constituted, the international monetary system has a structural flaw:  

It lacks a mechanism, market based or otherwise, to induce needed adjustments by 

surplus countries, which can result in persistent imbalances.  This problem is not new.  

For example, in the somewhat different context of the gold standard in the period prior to 

the Great Depression, the United States and France ran large current account surpluses, 

accompanied by large inflows of gold.  However, in defiance of the so-called rules of the 

game of the international gold standard, neither country allowed the higher gold reserves 

to feed through to their domestic money supplies and price levels, with the result that the 

real exchange rate in each country remained persistently undervalued.  These policies 

created deflationary pressures in deficit countries that were losing gold, which helped 

bring on the Great Depression.3  The gold standard was meant to ensure economic and 

financial stability, but failures of international coordination undermined these very goals.  

Although the parallels are certainly far from perfect, and I am certainly not predicting a 

new Depression, some of the lessons from that grim period are applicable today.4

Thus, it would be desirable for the global community, over time, to devise an 

international monetary system that more consistently aligns the interests of individual 

  In 

particular, for large, systemically important countries with persistent current account 

surpluses, the pursuit of export-led growth cannot ultimately succeed if the implications 

of that strategy for global growth and stability are not taken into account.
