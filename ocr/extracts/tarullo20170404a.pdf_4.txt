With a few exceptions, the approach we took from the fall of 2009 onward allowed the banks to 

use retained earnings to build their capital.  We also began development of the first quantitative 

liquidity regulations to be used in prudential regulation by the U.S. banking agencies.  This 

initiative was, of course, a direct response to the liquidity squeezes encountered during the crisis 

itself. 

 The capital and liquidity efforts were well underway by the time Congress passed the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in mid-2010.  

And Congress was, of course, aware of these efforts.  So it is perhaps not surprising that the 

provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to capital set some important qualitative standards for 

capital regulation rather than addressing capital levels as such.   

 A law as long and wide-ranging as the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be reduced to a single key 

premise or concern, excepting its general focus on financial stability and systemic risk.1  

However, with respect to the too-big-to-fail problem, I do think it fair to say--on the basis of both 

the text itself and its legislative history--that a pivotal choice was to make tighter the prudential 

regulation of the practices and activities of large banking organizations the presumptive approach 

to taming too-big-to-fail problems.   

The alternative, much discussed at the time and since, would have been a structural 

approach.  One such approach could have been something like the old Glass-Steagall Act 

separation of commercial banking from investment banking, which prohibited rather than simply 

regulated certain activities in different types of firms.  Another structural approach would have 

been outright size limitation resulting in the breakup of some of the largest financial firms.  The
