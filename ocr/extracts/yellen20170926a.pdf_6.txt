of the latest inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants that I showed 

previously.  The pertinent feature of this figure is the blue shaded region around the red 

line, which shows a 70 percent confidence interval around FOMC participants’ median 

outlook.  The width of this region reflects the average accuracy of inflation projections 

made by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years.  As the figure shows, 

based on that history, there is a 30 percent probability that inflation could be greater than 

3 percent or less than 1 percent next year.6   

Most of this uncertainty reflects the influence of unexpected movements in oil 

prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as that of idiosyncratic 

developments unrelated to broader economic conditions.  These factors could easily push 

overall inflation noticeably above or below 2 percent for a time.  But such disturbances 

are not a great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away as long 

as inflation expectations remain anchored.7  For this reason, the FOMC strives to look 

through these transitory inflation effects when setting monetary policy.  Such was the 

case when rising oil prices pushed headline inflation noticeably above 2 percent for 

several years prior to the financial crisis.  Similarly, the Committee substantially 

discounted the reductions in inflation that occurred from 2014 through 2016 as a result of 

the decline in oil prices and the effects of the dollar’s appreciation on import prices. 

A more important issue from a policy standpoint is that some key assumptions 

underlying the baseline outlook could be wrong in ways that imply that inflation will 

remain low for longer than currently projected.  For example, labor market conditions

could have implications for monetary policy.
