  However, more needs to be done on these and other 

subjects.  Indeed, from a policy perspective, the value of some of the scholarship done to date 

may be limited.  For example, if funding-cost advantages in fact derive from market perceptions 

that a very large firm was too-big-to-fail, the phenomenon is really one of competitive advantage 

grounded in moral hazard, not one of true efficiencies.  Similarly, the use of profitability of large 

firms as a surrogate for efficiency--as found in some studies--would be more helpful for 

policymaking if researchers find a way to control for the possibility that higher revenues are 

associated with market power or branding. 

Let me illustrate with two examples how these issues of scale and scope economies relate 

to the increased regulatory emphasis on systemic risk.   

First is the Federal Reserve’s review  of proposed mergers and acquisitions under the 

Bank Holding Company Act.  Of course, economies of scale and scope have always played a 

part in the analysis of the competitive effects of proposed mergers.  But the Dodd-Frank Act now 

requires that we also consider whether a proposed merger would lead to greater or more 

concentrated risks to financial stability.  Consider, for instance, how we would evaluate the 

financial stability effects of a proposed merger of two medium-sized institutions.  Among other 

things, we would need to assess the expansion of the acquiring institution’s systemic footprint.  

Then, we would have to balance the potential increased costs across the system were the 

institution to fail against the potential benefits from either a lesser likelihood of failure or, with 

respect to essential financial functions, a greater capacity to step in and fill the gap if one of the
