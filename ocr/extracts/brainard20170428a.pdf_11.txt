forward to collect consumer data for use by fintech developers without the permission or even 

potentially without the knowledge of the bank.  Instead, data aggregators and fintech developers 

directly ask consumers to give them their online banking logins and passwords.  Then, in a 

process commonly called “screen scraping,” data aggregators log onto banks’ online consumer 

websites, as if they were the actual consumers, and extract information.  Some banks report that 

as much as 20 to 40 percent of online banking logins is attributable to data aggregators.  They 

even assert that they have trouble distinguishing whether a computer system that is logging in 

multiple times a day is a consumer, a data aggregator, or a cyber attack.  

For community banks with limited resources, the necessary investments in API 

technology and in negotiating and overseeing data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and 

third-party providers may be beyond their reach, especially as they usually rely on service 

providers for their core technology.  Some fintech firms argue that screen scraping--which has 

drawn the most complaints about data security--may be the most effective tool for the customers 

of small community banks to access the financial apps they prefer--and thereby necessary to 

remain competitive until more effective broader industry solutions are developed.   

Clearly, getting these connectivity questions right, including the need to manage the 

consumer protection risks, is critically important. It could make the difference between a world 

in which the fintech wave helps community banks become the platforms of the future, on the one 

hand, or, on the other hand, a world in which fintech instead further widens the gulf between 

community banks and the largest banks. 

                                                           
our solutions limit or restrict our ability to access or use such information, we may be required to attempt to obtain 
the information, if at all, through end user-permissioned data scraping or other means that could be more costly and 
time-consuming, and less effective or efficient. . . . The legal environment surrounding data scraping and similar 
means of obtaining access to information on third-party websites is not completely clear and is evolving, and one or 
more third parties could assert claims against us seeking damages or to prevent us from accessing information in that 
manner.”)
