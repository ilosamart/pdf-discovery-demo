By contrast, when the spread between the 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields was at its 

peak in early 2010, this measure of the term premium was close to 100 basis points.10 

Other things being equal, a smaller term premium will make the yield curve flatter 

by lowering the long end of the curve.  With the term premium today very low by 

historical standards, this may temper somewhat the conclusions that we can draw from a 

pattern that we have seen historically in periods with a higher term premium.  With a 

very low term premium, any given amount of monetary policy tightening will lead to an 

inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led to an inversion 

in the past could do so today. 

There are a number of possible explanations of the low level of the term premium.  

The asset purchases of the Federal Reserve and other central banks may be contributing 

factors.  The goal of these policies was to lower longer-term interest rates--and in many 

cases, expressly by lowering term premiums.  A number of studies suggest that these 

polices have indeed been successful in lowering term premiums.11   

A second reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changing 

correlation between stock and bond returns, likely caused by changes in expected 

inflation outcomes.12  While in the 1970s and 1980s stock and bond returns tended to be 

positively correlated, more recently the correlation has tended to be negative.  With an 

inverse correlation, bonds recently have been a good hedge for stocks, and that 

correlation may have contributed to lower bond term premiums by increasing the demand 

for bonds as an instrument for hedging portfolio risks.  This changed correlation between
