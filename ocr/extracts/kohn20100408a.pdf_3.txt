taken in the United States and abroad to stabilize financial markets and end the panic so evident 

in late 2008 and early 2009 helped steady the economy.  In addition, extraordinary monetary and 

fiscal stimulus, both here and around the world, have supported the upturn.  These actions helped 

the financial markets to turn around, and they set the stage for recovery in combination with 

reductions in the inventory overhangs of houses and a broad range of other goods.  Real gross 

domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the second half of last 

year.  The gain was especially large in the last quarter of 2009, although a sizable chunk of that 

increase reflected a marked slowing in the pace of inventory liquidation.  The most recent data 

on spending and production from the first few months of this year have been encouraging and 

suggest that the recovery remains on track.  I expect the expansion to be sustained by continued 

increases in private final demand, even as the temporary boost from inventories passes and the 

contribution of fiscal stimulus to growth likely wanes later this year. 

On the positive side, consumer spending has been expanding at a solid pace, supported by 

low interest rates, improving household wealth, recovering confidence, and fiscal stimulus.  

Business outlays for equipment and software appear to be rebounding appreciably, consistent 

with improved financial conditions and business sentiment. 

Exports are another bright spot.  International trade tends to be highly sensitive to the 

business cycle, and foreign demand for U.S. products fell sharply during the global slump.  But 

with economic conditions improving abroad, export volumes have rebounded since the middle of 

last year.  At the same time, however, a sizable increase in imports has accompanied the upturn 

in our economy, and the effect of exports and imports on GDP growth has been roughly 

offsetting.
