That said, the benefits of a lengthy recovery can only go so far, as the research points to 

some barriers to labor market outcomes for particular groups that appear to be structural.  

After controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these 

factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and 

informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support 

regarding employment opportunities.13   

Federal Reserve Work on Labor Market Disparities 

While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are not well suited to 

addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes, 

understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum 

employment as well as potential growth.  The Federal Reserve is deeply engaged in 

understanding disparities through our data collection, research collaboration, and 

community development work.  One way the Federal Reserve seeks to obtain a clearer 

picture is by collecting data ourselves.  For instance, some of the data I have cited today 

come from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides 

detailed information on income and wealth holdings by demographic groups.  The Survey 

of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, 

employment, housing, and debt; the Survey of Young Workers provides insights into 

younger adults’ employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the 

Enterprising and Informal Work Activities Survey provides information about income
