assessing the potential costs and benefits of various approaches.  With our target for the federal 

funds rate close to zero, the policy decisions are all the more complicated.   

Third Question: How Should We Communicate our Actions?   

Communication is often described as one of the tools of monetary policy.  I think it is one 

of the most powerful aspects of our overall policy.  Let’s examine the communication vehicles 

we use and how they have changed over the years. 

Speeches  

One of the obvious ways FOMC participants communicate with the public is through 

speeches.  With the exception of the Chairman, individual participants speak only for themselves 

and not for the Committee.  Still, the information in participants’ speeches and testimony is 

useful because it offers the public insights into the current discussion under way within the 

Committee and where individuals tend to fall in the debate.  In recent months, as interest in our 

policies has risen in light of the continued slow recovery, some Fed watchers and reporters have 

worked especially hard to piece together individual opinions to try to characterize FOMC 

meeting discussions and the likely outcome of our future deliberations.  While this is a legitimate 

and resourceful way to understand the current state of play in monetary policy, I would caution 

against reading too much into any individual speech, news story, or public appearance.  Instead, I 

would draw your attention to the official communications that are actually approved by an 

FOMC vote:  the post-meeting statement, the minutes that are published three weeks after each 

meeting, and the economic forecasts that accompany the minutes each quarter.  I would focus as 

well on the Chairman’s speeches and testimony, both because he leads the Committee and 

because he has the best sense of the current consensus on the Committee.
