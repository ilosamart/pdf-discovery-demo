clear and effective communication in conjunction with the use of these unconventional 

policy tools.  

Some General Observations  

It is important to recognize at the outset that conventional and unconventional 

monetary policy actions bear many similarities.  Forward guidance concerning the path of 

the federal funds rate, for example, is explicitly intended to influence market expectations 

concerning the future trajectory of shorter-term interest rates and thereby affect longer-

term interest rates.  That said, standard monetary policy actions also typically alter not 

just current short-term rates, but the anticipated path of short-term rates as well, 

influencing longer-term rates through the identical channel.  In fact, central bankers have 

long recognized that this “expectations channel” operates most effectively when the 

public understands how policymakers expect economic conditions and monetary policy 

to evolve over time, and how the central bank would respond to any changes in the 

outlook.   

The transmission channels through which longer-term securities purchases and 

conventional monetary policy affect economic conditions are also quite similar, though 

not identical.  In particular, central bank purchases of longer-term securities work through 

a portfolio balance channel to depress term premiums and longer-term interest rates.  The 

theoretical rationale for the view that longer-term yields should be directly linked to the 

outstanding quantity of longer-term assets in the hands of the public dates back at least to 

the 1950s.2   

                                                 
2 Early examples include Culbertson (1957), Tobin (1958), and Modigliani and Sutch (1966).  More 
recently, Vayanos and Vila (2009) study a preferred-habitat model in which short- and long-term assets are 
imperfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios and the effect of arbitrageurs is limited by their risk aversion 
or other market frictions such as capital constraints.
