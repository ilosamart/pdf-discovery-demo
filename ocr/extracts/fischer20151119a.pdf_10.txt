some time, which seems particularly true for metals, such as copper and steel, used 

heavily in construction and investment.  However, for oil, the implications of a shift from 

investment-led growth to a consumption-led model are less certain.  On a per capita basis, 

China’s consumption of oil remains far below that of advanced economies, in line with 

China’s lower rate of car ownership.  Per capita oil consumption tends to increase with 

wealth, such that further income growth in China has the potential to provide strong 

support for the oil market in the coming years.  

Indeed, more generally, the world stands to benefit from a transition to more 

consumption-led growth in emerging Asia.  Under a successful transition toward more-

balanced growth, emerging Asia can be expected to import a broader array of goods and 

services both from within the region and globally.  Whether a country benefits from or is 

harmed by emerging Asia’s transition is likely to be determined by the flexibility of that 

country’s economy in adapting to shifts in Asian demand away from commodities and 

inputs for assembly into the region’s exports and toward services and goods to meet 

Asian final demand.   

To recap, the transition to slower growth in the emerging Asian economies, as 

well as a shift toward domestic demand and consumption and away from external 

demand and investment in the region, is likely to have profound implications for the 

global economy.  For one, trade growth is unlikely to resume its rapid pace of recent 

decades, and the long climb in commodity prices, which has benefited commodity 

producers, appears to have come to an end.
