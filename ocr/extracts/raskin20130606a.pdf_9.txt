for purposes of regulatory capital.  This not only made intuitive sense, but was also more 

consistent with how banks managed their own balance sheets and measured their risk-based 

performance. 

But the approach of risk-weighting assets by placing them in defined buckets is not 

precise.  While it might have the virtue of providing some capital sensitivity to the quality of 

different asset classes, a granular system of risk-weighting raises issues of its own. 

For example, the riskiness associated with each asset class can be flat-out wrong.  Errors 

are going to occur in part because risks can change over time and in part because no one has 

perfect knowledge about the nature of risks associated with every single asset class.  To note one 

prominent example, risk exposures to the sovereign debt of countries that are members of the 

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development currently receive a zero percent risk 

weight.  That is, for regulatory capital purposes, their debt is considered to be risk-free.  But if 

there is one thing we have learned in recent years, sovereign debt can indeed be risky even if, in 

good times, it appears to be perfectly safe.   

In addition, I believe you can make a case that risk weights for securitization exposures 

understated the risks and losses that were actually incurred in these exposures.  In fairness, losses 

during the financial crisis far exceeded prior historical losses on securitization exposures.  But 

that’s just the point: The risk profile of a particular financial instrument can change significantly 

over time, which can be very difficult to capture in a regulatory capital regime based on crude 

risk buckets that do not evolve over time.  Accordingly, the amount of capital held can be 

inappropriate relative to the actual risk. 

One problem this can lead to is that it can create incentives that skew lending decisions 

and credit allocation more broadly.  To be clear, I don’t want to give the impression that banks’
