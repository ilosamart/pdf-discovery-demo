 Thank you for inviting me to ICBA’s policy summit.  I am pleased to have this 

opportunity to share my views on some of the key issues facing community banks and how I see 

the community banking model fitting into the financial system in the years ahead.  In particular, I 

will discuss steps the Federal Reserve has taken to address the “too-big-to-fail” problem and how 

these steps affect community banks; I will describe how the Fed strives to improve our 

understanding of the unique role that community banks play in the economy; and then I’ll show 

how we are using this knowledge to better tailor our supervisory expectations and approaches to 

community banks. 

 As you may know, before I rejoined the Federal Reserve Board as Vice Chair in 2010, I 

had the privilege of serving for six years as president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve 

Bank of San Francisco.  The 12th district is the largest of the Fed’s districts, covering nine 

western states, and it is home to a significant number of community banks, the majority of which 

are supervised by the San Francisco Fed directly or indirectly through bank holding companies.  

Community bankers helped me, when I served as president, to take the pulse of the local 

economy and also to understand how regulatory and policy decisions in Washington affect 

financial institutions of different sizes and types, sometimes in very different ways.  During the 

financial crisis, I saw firsthand the challenges that community banks faced in a crisis they did 

little to cause, and I have felt strongly ever since that the Fed must do what it can to ensure that 

the actions taken following the crisis do not place undue burdens on your institutions.   

 I believe a healthy financial system relies on institutions of different sizes performing a 

variety of functions and serving different needs.  In some communities, your banks are actually 

situated on Main Street, but all community banks serve Main Street by providing credit to small 

business owners, homebuyers, households, and farmers.
