affected.18  We also learned that the loss of the branch often meant more than the loss of 

access to financial services; it also meant the loss of financial advice, local civic 

leadership, and an institution that brought needed customers to nearby businesses. 

Regulation and supervision need to be carefully tailored to suit the size and 

business model of different types of institutions.  At the Fed, we have renewed our efforts 

to avoid unnecessary regulatory burden on community banks, which provide essential 

credit in their local communities. 

Another means to address the issue of branch closures is the Community 

Reinvestment Act, or CRA, which encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the 

communities they are chartered to serve.  The CRA has been an important tool for 

strengthening local communities.  The trend toward fewer branches and increased use of 

technology to deliver financial services presents a particular challenge to our current 

approach to CRA evaluations.  Specifically, the current regulations use a bank’s branches 

to define its assessment area, the area for which it is evaluated for CRA purposes.  To the 

extent that banks serve much broader areas using online or other non-branch delivery 

systems, or have so many assessment areas that examiners cannot do a thorough 

evaluation in each, the financial needs of many rural communities may be overlooked.  

                                                 
18 These findings are broadly consistent with the literature, which identifies adverse effects of branch 
closures for small business borrowers, in particular, as well as for low-income communities.  See, for

Economic Outcomes,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology Working Paper (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT,
