implemented effectively, could result in better economic performance.4  

For example, policies that increase credit availability for homeowners or 

investors seeking to purchase a home or to refinance an existing mortgage would 

allow more borrowers to access lower interest rates and thus improve the transmission 

of monetary policy to the economy.  Renewed attention to a broad menu of options to 

modify existing mortgages would provide aid to struggling homeowners and would 

help to reduce the flow of foreclosed homes into distressed inventory.  When 

foreclosure cannot be avoided, incentives provided to homeowners that encourage 

short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure can reduce the time and costs of 

foreclosure and minimize negative effects on communities.   

In addition, expanding the options available for holders of foreclosed properties 

to dispose of their inventory responsibly could reduce the number of distressed sales 

and the effect of those sales on home prices.  For example, in many housing markets 

the demand for rental housing is much stronger relative to supply than in the market 

for owner-occupied homes.  Reducing some of the barriers to converting foreclosed 

properties to rental units will help to redeploy the existing stock of houses in a more 

efficient way.  Along the same lines, aggressive neighborhood stabilization efforts, 

including transferring low-value properties to public or nonprofit entities, such as land 

banks, that can manage properties that are not dealt with adequately through the
