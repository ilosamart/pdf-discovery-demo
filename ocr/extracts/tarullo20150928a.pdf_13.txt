kinds of intermediaries.  Property and casualty insurance is somewhat more volatile but that 

volatility is not correlated with the broader economy.  So, while higher capital levels may be 

needed for microprudential purposes, the traditional property-casualty insurance model does not 

appear to raise significant funding, fire sale, or other macroprudential concerns. 

 These traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital requirements than might be 

required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets.  And, as noted earlier, in 

some respects they also argue for a gone-concern approach to capital regulation.  However, a 

second observation is that the liability side of the balance sheets of many large insurance 

companies look quite different from this traditional picture.  Many life insurers, for example, 

now offer wealth and retirement products with account values that can be withdrawn at the 

discretion of the policyholder, sometimes with little or no surrender penalty.  Although these 

products are generally considered medium to long-term liabilities, the option to surrender or 

withdraw funds creates the potential for increased claims that could strain the liquidity of the 

firm.  Recent history suggests that the surrender rates of fixed annuities are directly related to the 

path of interest rate rises.  In the middle part of the last decade, as interest rates rose in the United 

States, the surrender rate for these products increased by about 75 percent in just a few years, 

before dropping precipitously after the rapid decline in rates following the onset of the financial 

crisis. 

 Similarly, the move of some insurance firms into securities lending, repo, over-the-

counter derivatives, and other capital market activities can work significant changes in the 

balance sheets of those firms, creating tighter connections to the rest of the financial system.  As 

with other financial intermediaries, insurers then become subject to demands for posting 

additional collateral or closing out positions as unfavorable market conditions take hold.  In
