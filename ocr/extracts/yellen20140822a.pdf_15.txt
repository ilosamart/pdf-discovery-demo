deflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated 

with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a 

time.  If so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the 

progression toward maximum employment.  As a result, maintaining a high degree of 

monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could, in this case, 

unduly delay the removal of accommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially 

disruptive tightening of policy later on.   

Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years--such as 

depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial 

level of long-term unemployment--may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than 

usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines.  However, some of the resulting 

wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers 

back into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment.19  As a consequence, 

tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in 

this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent 

with the dual mandate. 

Inferring the degree of resource utilization from real-time readings on inflation is 

further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes 

from persistent price pressures.  Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 

2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors.          

These complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation 

pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be
