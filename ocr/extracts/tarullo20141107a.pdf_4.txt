insurance fund.  In other words, the traditional microprudential approach to safety and soundness 

regulation continues to be appropriate for these banks.  To develop that basic answer, I think it 

useful to begin with an understanding of both the business model of community banks—that is, 

how their financial intermediation adds value to the economy—and the ways in which such 

banks are most likely to encounter problems. 

There are roughly 5,700 community banks in the United States, the vast majority of 

which have less than $1 billion in total assets.3  These banks represent 98 percent of insured U.S. 

commercial banks, but collectively hold just under 20 percent of aggregate banking assets.  

Moreover, the business model of most community banks, especially smaller and rural banks, is 

built substantially on relationship banking.  While community banks have over the years found it 

increasingly difficult to compete with larger banks in types of lending that can be efficiently 

scaled through larger volumes and standardized credit models, they maintain a comparative 

advantage relative to larger competitors through knowledge of their local communities and their 

individual borrowers.4  This means that community banks play a unique role in their local 

economies, particularly with regard to lending to small- and medium-sized businesses.  

Numerous studies have documented this advantage and its value to economic 

development.  One recent study found that loans extended by rural community banks to small 

businesses default less frequently than similar loans granted by their urban counterparts, and that 

the performance advantage is greater when the bank and the borrower are located in the same 

                                                 
3 For supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve typically defines community banks as those with $10 billion or less 

in total assets.  In addition, these remarks will refer to both “community banks” and “community banking 

organizations.”  While the former typically refers to depository institutions and the latter refers to banking groups 

more generally, including holding companies, for purposes of my remarks today these are used interchangeably 

unless indicated otherwise. 
4 Of course, larger banks may also devote important parts of their business to relationship lending, but it is 

sometimes suggested that, even so, smaller banks whose management is present in local communities are better 

adapted to relationship lending business models.
