decisions.  A central tenet that underlies this increase in transparency is that monetary 

policy is more effective when the public understands how the central bank will respond to 

changing conditions, and can calibrate expectations accordingly.13  That means that the 

Committee must have a clearly communicated, systematic way of responding to changes 

in economic conditions and the outlook.  In that spirit, the FOMC takes a forward-

looking approach to policymaking, whereby each policy decision the FOMC makes is 

grounded not just in current assessments of the economy but also in expectations for how 

the economy will evolve relative to our goals.  Individual participants develop their own 

forecasts of the economy’s evolution.  The Committee then makes a collective decision, 

embodied in the postmeeting statement, setting monetary policy to achieve those goals.14  

Over time, incoming information and shocks to the economy inevitably alter views of the 

appropriate path for monetary policy.  One way of seeing this is through the SEP 

forecasts of individual FOMC participants.  These forecasts tend to converge over time to 

the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and to each individual’s interpretation of 

maximum employment, because each individual explicitly writes down a path for policy 

that is intended to achieve those outcomes.  Accordingly, revisions to the projections tend
