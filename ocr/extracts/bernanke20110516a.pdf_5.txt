especially if the new knowledge can be replicated or disseminated at low cost.  For 

example, James Watson and Francis Crick received a minute fraction of the economic 

benefits that have flowed from their discovery of the structure of DNA.  If many people 

are able to exploit, or otherwise benefit from, research done by others, then the total or 

social return to research may be higher on average than the private return to those who 

bear the costs and risks of innovation.  As a result, market forces will lead to 

underinvestment in R&D from societyâ€™s perspective, providing a rationale for 

government intervention. 

One possible policy response to the market underprovision problem would be to 

substantially strengthen the intellectual property rights regime, for example, by granting 

the developers of new ideas strong and long-lasting claims to the economic benefits of 

their discoveries--perhaps by extending and expanding patent rights.  This approach has 

significant drawbacks of its own, however, in that strict limitations on the free use of new 

ideas would inhibit both further research and the development of valuable commercial 

applications.  Thus, although patent protections and similar rules remain an important 

part of innovation policy, governments have also turned to direct support of R&D 

activities. 

Of course, the rationale for government support of R&D would be weakened if 

governments had consistently performed poorly in this sphere.  Certainly, there have been 

disappointments; for example, the surge in federal investment in energy technology 

research in the 1970s, a response to the energy crisis of that decade, achieved less than its 

initiators hoped.  In the United States, however, we have seen many examples--in some 

cases extending back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries--of federal research
