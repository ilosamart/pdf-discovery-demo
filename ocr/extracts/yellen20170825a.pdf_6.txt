Despite the forceful policy responses by the Treasury, the Congress, the FDIC, 

and the Federal Reserve as well as authorities abroad, the crisis continued to intensify:  

The vulnerabilities in the U.S. and global economies had grown too large, and the 

subsequent damage was enormous.  From the beginning of 2008 to early 2010, nearly

What the Crisis Revealed and How Policymakers Have Responded 

These painful events renewed efforts to guard against financial instability.  The

and households expected rapid appreciation in house prices.  The long period of

and the buildup of risk was not widely recognized.8  As a result, market and supervisory

madness of crowds--is attributed to Charles Mackay (1841), Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions 

and the Madness of Crowds (London:  Richard Bentley).  A more modern perspective, and one using a
