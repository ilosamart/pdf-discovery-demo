of interest:  When the federal funds rate is below the nominal neutral rate, monetary 

policy is accommodative, and, when it is above the neutral rate, policy is contractionary.  

For this reason, many monetary policy rules, such as the well-known Taylor rule, 

incorporate an estimate of the neutral real interest rate as a critical parameter along with 

the target rate of inflation.4 

Although the neutral rate is a critical benchmark for monetary policy, it changes 

over time in response to important changes in economic conditions, necessitating 

corresponding adjustments in monetary policy in order to restore the economy to full 

employment.  For instance, when there are modest adverse shocks to demand that lead to 

modest reductions in the shorter-run neutral rate, monetary policy can provide enough 

support to keep the economy at full employment simply by reducing the policy rate 

commensurate with the decline in the nominal neutral rate.  However, when the adverse 

shocks to demand are sufficiently severe to push the nominal neutral interest rate 

substantially below zero, as they were during the Great Recession, monetary policy 

confronts the zero-lower-bound constraint, at which point the federal funds rate cannot 

fall low enough to provide the necessary degree of accommodation without becoming 

negative.  This was the case in the United States for several years following the crisis and 

remains true today in a number of advanced foreign economies.  That is why monetary 

policymakers in the United States and several other major economies have been 

compelled to use additional unconventional tools to promote full employment and target 

inflation, such as forward guidance and asset purchases.
