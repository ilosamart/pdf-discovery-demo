example, the frustratingly slow pace of real wage gains seen during the recent expansion 

likely partly reflects the slow growth in productivity.3 

Let me highlight a few topics from the growing volume of research on this topic.  

The first is that the productivity slowdown reflects mismeasurement, because the official 

statistics have failed to capture new and better products or properly account for changes 

in prices over time.4  Given how often we meet new technologies in our daily activities, 

even in classes of products that have been in operation for many years--from driving an 

automobile, to flying, to medicines and medical equipment, to our communications, and 

far more--it is easy to persuade ourselves that technological advances play a major part in 

improving our lives.  However, some of these gains are conceptually outside the scope of 

GDP, and most recent research suggests that mismeasurement of output cannot account 

for much of the productivity slowdown.5 

Another explanation is that business investment has been relatively modest during 

the current expansion, and so increases in capital per worker have been smaller than in 

previous decades.  Part of the modest pace of investment is likely because the effective 

                                                 
3 An alternative explanation is that productivity growth has been slow because wage growth has been slow; 
that is, faced with only tepid rises in labor costs, firms have had less incentive to invest in labor-saving 
technologies.
