The distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening 

more or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced 

countries.1  This trend paused during the Great Recession because of larger wealth losses 

for those at the top of the distribution and because increased safety-net spending helped 

offset some income losses for those below the top.  But widening inequality resumed in 

the recovery, as the stock market rebounded, wage growth and the healing of the labor 

market have been slow, and the increase in home prices has not fully restored the housing 

wealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset.   

The extent of and continuing increase in inequality in the United States greatly 

concern me.  The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality 

since the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the 

Great Depression.  By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their 

highest levels in the past hundred years, much higher than the average during that time 

span and probably higher than for much of American history before then.2  It is no secret 

that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income 

and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority.  I 

think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our
