could be interpreted as a significant drop in market participants’ expectations for the most 

likely outcome for inflation in the longer run.  However, research suggests that the fall in 

TIPS inflation compensation instead primarily reflects a decline in inflation risk 

premiums and differences in the liquidity of nominal and indexed Treasury securities.21  

This research notwithstanding, the notable decline in inflation compensation may be a 

sign that longer-term inflation expectations have slipped recently. 

Misspecified Inflation Dynamics 

Another risk is that our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be 

misspecified in some fundamental way, perhaps because our econometric models 

overlook some factor that will restrain inflation in coming years despite solid labor 

market conditions.  One possibility in this vein is a continuation of the subdued growth in 

health-care prices that we have seen in recent years--a sector-specific factor not 

controlled for in standard models.  Because health care accounts for a large share of total 

consumer spending, this slow growth has restrained overall inflation materially and may 

continue to do so for some time.22  A similar situation occurred during the 1990s, when a 

significant shift in health insurance enrollment away from fee-for-service and toward 

HMO (that is, Health Maintenance Organization) plans reduced cost pressures and held 

                                                 
21 For example, Andreasen and Christensen (2016) show that once TIPS liquidity premiums are taken into 
account, the model-implied one-year inflation expectation becomes more stable and shows a smaller 
decline since 2013.  In addition, quotes on inflation derivatives suggest that most of the decline in inflation 
compensation over this period is associated with investor perceptions of reduced risks of above-target 
inflation outcomes rather than increased risks of below-target inflation outcomes. 
22 Personal consumption expenditures include all medical services, including those paid by Medicare and 
Medicaid; prices for the latter may be viewed as “administered” because they are essentially set by the 
government.  The formulas used to set Medicare prices were adjusted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act and 
additional legislation passed in 2015, resulting in smaller increases in prices for the same increase in costs 
than would have been the case in the prior decade.  In addition, Medicaid prices have probably been 
restrained somewhat by budget pressures on state governments.  Aside from these direct influences of 
government policy on healthcare prices, some research suggests that lower Medicare prices tend to lead to 
lower negotiated prices by private insurers as well (see Clemens, Gottlieb, and Shapiro, 2016).
