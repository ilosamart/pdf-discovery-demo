Financial Stability, Transparency and Accountability  

In a democratic system, any degree of independence brings with it the obligation 

to provide appropriate transparency.  In turn, transparency provides an essential basis for 

accountability and democratic legitimacy by enabling effective legislative oversight and 

keeping the public informed.4  Of course, central banks also need to stick closely to our 

mandates; the case for independence weakens to the extent that central banks stray into 

issues that the legislature has not assigned to us.5 

There is also an important policy effectiveness argument in favor of transparency.  

In the financial stability arena, there is no better example of this than the role that the first 

round of stress tests played during the crisis in restoring confidence in the U.S. banking 

system.6  So in the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just 

about being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help 

restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system. 

The post-crisis regulatory system recognizes the importance of enhanced 

transparency, both about financial institutions themselves and about the processes and 

expectations of regulators and supervisors.  Before the crisis, supervision focused on the 

safety and soundness of individual institutions and was insufficiently attentive to risk in 

the financial system as a whole.  Supervisory judgments about firms were shared with the 

public only in rare and exceptional circumstances.  Financial stability tools were 

deployed after the fact, to address specific events that emerged to threaten stability.  It is 

an understatement to say that this approach proved inadequate in the crisis.
