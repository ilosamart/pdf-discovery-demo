and unemployment, as well as projections of the path of the target federal funds rate 

consistent with each individual’s views of appropriate monetary policy.  These additions 

have better informed the public about participants’ views on both the long-run objectives 

of policy and the path of interest rates most consistent with achieving those objectives.   

We took another important step in January 2012, when the FOMC issued a 

statement laying out its longer-run goals and policy strategy.2  The statement established, 

for the first time, an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent, and it pointed to 

the SEP to provide information about Committee participants’ assessments of the longer-

run normal unemployment rate, currently between 5.2 and 6 percent.  The statement also 

indicated that the Committee would take a balanced approach to its price stability and 

employment objectives.  We adopted additional measures aimed at clarifying the 

rationales for our decisions, including my quarterly postmeeting press conference.  The 

increases in policy transparency that were achieved proved valuable during a very 

difficult period for monetary policy. 

As it happened, during the crisis and its aftermath the Federal Reserve’s 

transparency and accountability proved critical in a quite different sphere--namely, in 

supporting the institution’s democratic legitimacy.  The Federal Reserve, like other 

central banks, wields powerful tools; democratic accountability requires that the public be 

able to see how and for what purposes those tools are being used.  Transparency is 

particularly important in a period like the recent one in which the Federal Reserve has 

been compelled to take unusual and dramatic actions--including the provision of liquidity

testimony before the Congress (see Board of Governors, 2007a, 2007b).
