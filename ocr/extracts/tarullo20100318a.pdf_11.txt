Central to the success of a living will as a supervisory tool is the quality of 

information it would make available in a crisis.  Some of the information would be 

relatively static.  A firm would have to inventory all of its legal entities, along with the 

legal regimes applicable to each one, and map its business lines into legal entities.  A firm 

also would have to document interaffiliate guarantees, funding, hedging, and provision of 

information technology and other key services.  This information would be needed to 

deal with any crisis, no matter what its specific form.  

Once the centrality of accurate, comprehensive information is understood, it 

becomes apparent that a very significant upgrade of management information systems 

(MIS) may be the only way for the firm to satisfy living will requirements, just as we at 

the Federal Reserve found when we led the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program--

popularly known as the bank stress tests--that improved MIS are needed for ongoing risk 

management at the institution.  

Supervisory demands for improved MIS could have another benefit.  Just as a 

homeowner has an incentive to shed belongings to reduce the expense of moving, so a 

financial firm may have a powerful incentive to simplify its organizational structure and 

rationalize relationships among its corporate entities to reduce the cost of developing 

comprehensive MIS that enable an organization to retrieve information in multiple 

formats across jurisdictions, business lines, and legal entities.  Simpler structures can also 

be encouraged by reemphasizing existing supervisory guidance requiring banking 

organizations to measure and manage their risks not only on the global, consolidated 

level, but also on a legal entity basis.  Together, the information requirements of living 

wills and the need to measure and manage risks at the legal entity level can help create
