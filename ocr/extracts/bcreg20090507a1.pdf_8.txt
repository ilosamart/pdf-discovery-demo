adverse scenario. As shown in Figure 1, this loss rate is higher than two-year loss rates observed for U.S. commercial banks from 1920 to 2007/2008. 
In addition to the sharpest two-year drop in residential house prices since then, and a projected further steep decline in the what-if adverse scenario, 
he rise in the unemployment rate in the scenario would be more severe than any U.S. recession since the 1930s.4 [Footnote 4.Another reference for the 
estimated loss rates in the SCAP is where they stand relative to estimates made recently by other analysts. Unfortunately, many of the loss estimates 
are not directly comparable because they are for different time horizons (for example, lifetime losses) or are based on different economic scenarios. 
However, based on assessments that we can make with the available information, the SCAP estimates appear to be about in the middle of the range 
of these other estimates. End footnote 4.]

1921 -2008 
[Graphic. A line chart plots commercial bank two-year loan loss rates from 1921 through 2008. Unit is percent. The 
curve remains below 2 percent for nearly the entire period. The curve reaches a peak between 8 
and 9 percent in the early 1930s. SCAP Total Loan Loss Rates are represented by a horizontal line 
at 9.1 percent.

Table 2 also reports aggregate projections for losses on securities held in the available-for-sale 
(AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) investment portfolios and, for BHCs with trading account assets 
exceeding $100 billion, losses on trading and counterparty credit risk losses. These losses represent a 
significant share of the total. 
To evaluate losses for securities in the AFS and HTM portfolios, supervisors focused on securities 
subject to credit risk. At the end of 2008, the 19 BHCs held $1.5 trillion of securities, more than one-half 
of which were Treasury, agencies, or sovereign securities, or high-grade municipal debt, and so are 
subject to no or limited credit risk. Only about $200 billion was in non-agency mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) and only a portion of these were recent vintage or were backed by riskier nonprime 
mortgages. Remaining material exposures included corporate bonds, mutual funds, and other asset-
backed securities. For securitized assets, supervisors assessed if the security would become impaired 
during its lifetime. If the current level of credit support was considered insufficient to cover expected 
losses, the security was written down to fair value with a corresponding "other than temporary 
impairment" (OTTI) charge, equal to the difference between book and market value. These OTTI 
charges equaled $35 billion in the more adverse scenario, with almost one-half of the estimated losses 
coming from the non-agency MBS.5 

[Footnote 5. 
To recognize losses in the more adverse scenario, supervisors chose a conservative approach. Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-
Than-Temporary Impairments, April 9, 2009, regards debt securities held in the AFS and HTM accounts and 
focuses on whether firms intend to sell an impaired security or whether it is more-likely-than-not that firms will be 
required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. If either of these conditions is met, the firm must 
recognize OTTI. The FASB’s guidance holds that a firm’s determination of its ability to hold a security to recovery 
should consider sources of uncertainty. Supervisors believed it prudent to incorporate the possibility that firms may 
not be able to hold a security to recovery under conditions more stressful than expected. Thus for those securities 
estimated or recommended by supervisors to be other than temporarily impaired, the loss was equal to the 
difference between the investment’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. End footnote 5.]
