number remains in excess of 2 million, three times the historical norm.  Meanwhile, the 

national homeownership rate has slipped nearly 4 percentage points from its 2004 high of 

69 percent, and it now stands at a 15-year low.

  So, although there are good reasons to be 

encouraged by the recent direction of the housing market, we should not be satisfied with 

the progress we have seen so far. 

Lower-income and minority communities are often disproportionately affected by 

problems in the national economy, and the effects of the housing bust have followed that 

unfortunate pattern.  Indeed, as a result of the crisis, most or all of the hard-won gains in 

homeownership made by low-income and minority communities in the past 15 years or 

so have been reversed.  For example, among all income groups, between 2007 and 2010, 

homeownership rates fell the most for households with income of $20,000 or less, 

according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.

  Data from the Census 

Bureau show that, over the period from 2004 to 2012, the homeownership rate fell about 

5 percentage points for African Americans, compared with about 2 percentage points for 

other groups.

Homeownership rates fall when existing homeowners lose or leave their 

properties, when barriers to homeownership increase, or both.  In recent years, both 

factors have been important.  As I mentioned, home loss through foreclosure, though 

down from its peaks, remains an important problem, with lower-income and minority
