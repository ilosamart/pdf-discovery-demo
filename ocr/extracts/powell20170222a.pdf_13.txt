Figure 7 shows the prescriptions of three simple policy rules since 2000.22  While 

the rules often diverged, all of them called for a substantial reduction in the federal funds 

rate around the time of the financial crisis, and all of them prescribed easing well below 

the effective lower bound (ELB).23  Faced with the impossibility of providing more 

accommodation at the ELB through deeply negative policy rates, the Committee turned 

instead to two unconventional monetary policy tools--large-scale securities purchases and 

forward guidance. 

Figure 8 shows the Taylor (1993) rule for different values of r* layered over the 

“dots” from the December 2016 SEP, with a black horizontal line at the median value for 

each year.24  The red solid line shows the rule prescriptions when the intercept is set 

equal to 2 percent, as in Taylor’s original formulation.  If we replace that intercept with 

the median of the longer-run r* from the December 2016 SEP, which is 1 percent (the 

blue dashed line), we see that the rule prescribes policy interest rates lower than the 

unadjusted rule.  However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is 

currently well below its longer-run value.  The language that has appeared in the 

Committee’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “the federal funds rate is 

likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer 

                                                 
22 These are static simulations and do not incorporate feedback from the policy rule to real activity or 
inflation. 
23 Ben Bernanke finds that a “balanced approach” rule estimated using real-time data closely tracks the 
federal funds rate from 1996 through 2008.  See Ben S. Bernanke (2015), “The Taylor Rule:  A Benchmark 
for Monetary Policy?” Ben Bernanke’s Blog, April 28, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-

24 Figure 2 of the SEP provides each individual FOMC participant’s assessment of “appropriate monetary 
policy” in the form of a dot plot.  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that 
each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy 
his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price 
stability.  The policy prescriptions are derived using the median projections for core PCE price inflation, 
the unemployment rate, and the longer-run normal unemployment rate from the December 2016 SEP.
