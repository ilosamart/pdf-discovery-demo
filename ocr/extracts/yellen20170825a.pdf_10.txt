failing systemic firm left policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or 

allowing a destabilizing collapse.  In recognition of this shortcoming, the Congress 

adopted the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to provide an alternative 

resolution mechanism for systemically important firms to be used instead of bankruptcy 

proceedings when necessary to preserve financial stability.  The orderly liquidation 

authority contains a number of tools, including liquidity resources and temporary stays on 

the termination of financial contracts, that would help protect the financial system and 

economy from the severe adverse spillovers that could occur if a systemic firm failed.  

Importantly, any losses incurred by the government in an Orderly Liquidation Authority 

resolution would not be at the expense of taxpayers, since the statute provides that all 

such losses must be borne by other large financial firms through subsequent assessments.  

In addition, the Congress required that the largest banks submit living wills that describe 

how they could be resolved under bankruptcy.12  And the Federal Reserve has mandated 

that systemically important banks meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, which 

require these firms to maintain long-term debt adequate to absorb losses and recapitalize 

the firm in resolution.  These enhancements in resolvability protect financial stability and 

help ensure that the shareholders and creditors of failing firms bear losses.  Moreover, 

these steps promote market discipline, as creditors--knowing full well that they will bear 

                                                 
12 In addition to these steps, the Board issued another proposal to make G-SIBs more resolvable in May of 

last year (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Board Proposes 

Rule to Support U.S. Financial Stability by Enhancing the Resolvability of Very Large and Complex 

Financial Firms,” press release, May 3, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160503b.htm).  This proposed rule would 

impose restrictions on G-SIBs’ qualified financial contracts--including derivatives and repurchase 

agreements (or repos)--to guard against the rapid, mass unwinding of those contracts during the resolution 

of a G-SIB.  The proposed restrictions are a key step toward G-SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding 

these contracts could destabilize the financial system by causing asset fire sales and toppling other firms.
