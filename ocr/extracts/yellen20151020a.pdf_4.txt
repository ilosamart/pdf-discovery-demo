circumstance, the BLS was sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it 

occasionally came under pressure to alter the basis for its data.   

Janet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve and 

flexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that 

eventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative 

price measures.  As commissioner and like her predecessors, Janet helped preserve the 

BLS’s deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the 

design, procedures, and techniques of data collection. 

After government service, Janet had a long and active retirement in which she 

continued her contributions to the economic profession and the science of statistics.  She 

passed away on March 31 of this year.   

To members of her family who are with us today, thank you for her extraordinary 

service to our country.  Janet’s legacy continues in the ongoing work of the exceptional 

agency she helped build, on the foundation laid by Carroll Wright, whom she so 

appropriately joins today in this Hall of Honor.   

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is exceptional, and in that way, I hope it serves as 

an example of how effective, reliable, and trusted government can be.
