aversion could lead to higher funding costs and liquidity shortages for some institutions, and 

forced asset sales and reductions in collateral values that could, in turn, engender further market 

turmoil.  In these conditions, U.S. banks and other institutions might be forced to pull back on 

their lending, as they did during the period of severe financial market dysfunction that followed 

the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.  The timing of such an event in the current instance would be 

unfortunate, as banks generally have only recently ceased tightening lending standards, and have 

yet to unwind from the considerable tightening that has occurred over the past two years.  

Moreover, aggregate bank lending, particularly to businesses, continues to contract.  The result 

would be another source of risk to the U.S. recovery in an environment of still-fragile balance 

sheets and considerable slack.  Although we view such a development as unlikely, the swoon in 

global financial markets earlier this month suggests that it is not out of the question.    

Another means by which an intensification of financial turmoil in Europe could affect U.S. 

growth is by reducing trade.  Collectively, Europe represents one of our most important trading 

partners and accounts for about one-quarter of U.S. merchandise exports.  Accordingly, a 

moderate economic slowdown across Europe would cause U.S. export growth to fall, weighing on 

U.S. economic performance by a discernible, but modest extent.  However, a deeper contraction in 

Europe associated with sharp financial dislocations would have the potential to stall the recovery 

of the entire global economy, and this scenario would have far more serious consequences for U.S. 

trade and economic growth.  A resultant slowdown in the United States and abroad would likely 

also feed back into the health of U.S. financial institutions. 

Federal Reserve Responses to the Crisis 

Notwithstanding the fact that European sovereign debt problems could have negative 

consequences for U.S. and global economic growth, successful resolution of these problems 

ultimately rests predominantly on effective European policy actions.  The Federal Reserve has
