To recap, the housing sector continues to suffer from serious imbalances--a 

marked excess supply for owner-occupied housing accompanied by a stronger rental 

markets.  The narrative of the housing market over the next several years will revolve 

around the resolution of those imbalances.      

Broader Implications of the Problems in the Housing Market  

As homebuilders, you naturally pay close attention to the demand for new homes 

and their prices.  These factors are important for the health of your industry, including its 

ability to create jobs in construction and related activities.  But the problems in housing 

also have important implications outside the construction industry. 

For instance, consider the effects on neighborhoods and communities.  

Foreclosures, particularly when they are geographically concentrated, can diminish the 

values of nearby properties.

  Many foreclosed homes are neglected or abandoned, as 

legal proceedings or other factors delay their resale.  Deteriorating or vacant properties 

can, in turn, directly affect the quality of life in a neighborhood, for example, by leading 

to increases in vandalism or crime.  Moreover, the continuing price declines typical in 

neighborhoods with many foreclosures depress the tax base of the community.  A vicious 

circle can get started:  Increasing vacancies together with decreasing tax revenue and 

consequent cutbacks in services can further depress home prices, putting the goal of 

neighborhood stabilization even further out of reach.
