more from the work presented at this conference.  As I noted at the outset, research about 

the causes and implications of inequality is ongoing, and I hope that this conference helps 

spur further study of economic opportunity and its effects on economic mobility.  Using 

the SCF and other sources, I have tried to offer some observations about how access to 

four specific sources of opportunity may vary across households, but I cannot offer any 

conclusions about how much these factors influence income and wealth inequality.  I do 

believe that these are important questions, and I hope that further research will help 

answer them.
