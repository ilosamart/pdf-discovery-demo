I am delighted to address the National Economists Club, and I am also honored on 

this occasion to be associated with Herb Stein, whose public service and 

scholarship--characterized by careful analysis, clear-eyed pragmatism, and sharp wit--

essentially zero.  Addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge:  how to

progress to date in meeting the second.  Thanks in part to the monetary policy 

accommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisis--especially through enhanced 

forward rate guidance and large-scale asset purchases--the U.S. economy has made great 

strides.  Indeed, with the economy now operating near maximum employment and
