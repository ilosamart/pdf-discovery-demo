understand the issues surrounding loans to small business.  I attended one of the regional 

meetings in June and was pleased to see firsthand the quality of the conversation that 

took place.  Today we have seen evidence that the conversations were equally rich across 

the country.  The information gathered through this kind of outreach is invaluable as we 

consider our policy options, and I hope that you have found it similarly helpful.   

Today’s agenda was organized around the common issues identified in those 

regional meetings.  We looked at small business credit issues from the perspective of the 

private, public, and nonprofit sectors.  We also looked at the implications of data and 

information gaps on our understanding of the dynamics of small business lending.  And, 

perhaps most important, we identified some promising next steps to ensure that 

creditworthy small businesses have the access to capital that they need.       

Today’s meeting has been referred to as a capstone because it summarized the 

information we gathered.  But our conversation today makes it clear that this is just the 

beginning.  There is no single step that can be taken to cure what is ailing the small 

business lending market.  As we have heard, the causes for credit tightening are many 

and complex.  Equally numerous are the challenges facing small businesses and limiting 

their demand for credit.  These issues have evolved over time, and it only makes sense 

that implementing solutions will be equally difficult and will take time.  This has been a 

full day and I want to commend you for your stamina, your insights, and your 

commitment to helping us identify those next steps that all of us--public policymakers, 

small business lenders, nonprofits, and small business owners--can take to facilitate small 

businesses’ access to credit.  I hope we can also count on you to continue the effort, for it
