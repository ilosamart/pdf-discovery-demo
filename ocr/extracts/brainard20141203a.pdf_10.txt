Time-varying lending-side tools 

In the United States, there is a more limited set of authorities the Federal Reserve 

could exercise either on its own or jointly with the other banking agencies to address 

sector-specific risks.  Most commonly, as we have seen with leveraged lending, the 

banking regulators acting together can use the tools of supervisory guidance and intensive 

supervision to discourage banks from taking on additional risk on safety and soundness 

grounds.  Moreover, the annual supervisory stress tests can be tailored to increase the 

severity of losses in specific portfolios of loans or the market shock.  However, these 

authorities fall short of direct restrictions on activities in a particular sector.  Such 

supervisory actions usually flow from microprudential concerns about the safety and 

soundness of individual institutions rather than macroprudential concerns about the 

stability of the entire system. By contrast, section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides 

that the Federal Reserve could restrict the activities of banks with assets greater than $50 

billion or nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) designated by the 

FSOC “to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States,” thus 

providing potential macroprudential authority. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve has authority under the Securities and Exchange 

Act of 1934 to set initial and variation margin requirements for repurchase agreements 

and securities financing transactions, which applies across the financial system.  This 

authority was used to curb perceived excesses in the equity markets through the mid-

1970s with what was seen as limited success, and it has not been used in such a manner 

since.  There is some interest in exploring whether imposing minimum margin 

requirements on additional forms of securities credit could prevent margins from 

compressing during booms and likewise help mitigate destabilizing procyclical margin
