ladder) for children from all groups and from all areas of the country?  By doing so, I 

hope to illustrate the relevance of economics to important, real-life issues. 

The proportion of adults participating in the labor force--that is, either holding 

jobs or actively searching for employment--has declined substantially over the past 

decade.  The decline has reflected, in part, the severe economic recession.  Millions of 

people lost their jobs, and many of them experienced great difficulty finding new 

employment.  Some of these people became discouraged and stopped looking for work.  

In other words, they dropped out of the labor force.  However, much of the decline in 

labor force participation reflects factors that precede the recession.2  Most significantly, 

our population is aging, and older people participate in the labor market at lower rates 

than younger adults.  In addition, the labor force participation of prime-age males--that is, 

individuals aged 25 through 54--has been declining since the mid-1960s, particularly 

among those with only a high school degree or less education, and has continued to 

decline in the years since the last recession. 

Economists are examining a number of reasons why prime-age males are falling 

out of the labor force.  Here there are differences among economists.  Some economists 

have emphasized the role of public assistance programs, such as disability insurance.  

Some evidence suggests that public assistance income has likely played a role.  Other 

economists have put more emphasis on the effects of the reduction over time in the 

demand for lower-skilled labor.3  Indeed, the wages of high school graduates have fallen
