loan growth represented the replacement of estimated loan losses between 2009 and 2010. Reserve 

needs for the vintage and new loan portfolios were determined by assessing potential losses on these 

portfolios in 2011 and assuming reserves sufficient to cover these losses. Loss rates for vintage loans 

were calculated as each firm's 2010 loss rate by loan category, reduced by the anticipated average 

percentage reduction in loan losses in 2011 as calculated from firms that reported this information. For 

newly extended credits, which would likely be underwritten under more prudent lending standards, loss 

rates by loan category from 2007 were used to represent the expected losses in 2011. 
III. C. Accounting Adjustments 

The supervisory team assessing consumer credit losses worked closely with accounting 

specialists in the agencies to ensure that the firms' projections were consistent with accounting 

standards. Additionally, supervisors evaluated the potential impact of the proposed changes to FAS 140 

which are expected to be implemented in January 2010. Based on information provided by the BHCs, 

implementation of the proposed changes to FAS 140 could result in approximately $900 billion in assets 

being brought onto the balance sheets of these institutions. Risk-weighted assets were increased by 

about $700 billion to reflect this projected consolidation. The on-boarding of assets also factored into 

our assessment of ALLL needs, and those assets were treated as new loans. 

A second critical set of adjustments were made to recognize the impact of discounts taken by 

institutions on purchased impaired loan portfolios acquired during mergers, as governed by SOP 03-03. 

Several of the participating BHCs acquired loans at significant discounts as part of mergers. Based on 

the information provided by the BHCs, these discounts totaled more than $90 billion.10 [Footnote 10. The 

reduction in projected losses relating to purchase accounting adjustment for the two scenarios is less than this 

amount. Some portion of the credit losses reflected in this discount may take place after the end of the scenario or 

may reflect market loss assumptions at the time of acquisition that are more severe than those assumed by the 

BHCs and supervisors in the supervisory loss projections. Some of the discount not related to credit losses is 

captured by the BHC in "accretable yield", which is part of pre-provision net revenue (such amounts are amortized 

into income over the estimated life of the loan in accordance with GAAP). End footnote 10.] These discounts 

were considered in assessing possible future losses for these firms under the two scenarios, since such 

discounts make up a large portion, and possibly all, of projected future losses on impaired acquired 

loans in the two scenarios. The approach used in the SCAP was to project losses on the original balances 

of the impaired acquired loans (that is, balances with the discounts added back to bring the impaired 

loan balances back to their contractual principal at the date of acquisition) and then to net these losses 

against the discount that the BHCs took at the time they acquired the loans. 

III. D. Determination of Capital Needs 
As part of the submission process, each BHC reported projections of Tier 1 capital and common 

stockholders' equity for the end of 2009 and 2010. The BHCs' projected evolution of capital over the 

scenarios reflects a combination of credit losses, PPNR to absorb losses, and the need to generate 

appropriate ALLL at the end of the assessment horizon. These estimates served as a useful benchmark 

for the SCAP, but were not necessarily consistent with the final projections of losses and revenue the 

supervisors made for the BHC. 

As a result, supervisors projected pro forma capital for 2010 for each BHC using the revised 

estimates of credit losses and revenue. The basic algorithm began with 2008 Q4 measures of equity 

capital and regulatory capital from Y-9C reports. Pro forma equity capital was estimated by rolling tax-
