the long run, the sharp run-up in involuntary part-time employment during the recession 

and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant.    

Private sector labor market flows provide additional indications of the strength of 

the labor market.  For example, the quits rate has tended to be pro-cyclical, since more 

workers voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to 

find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires.  Indeed, the 

quits rate has picked up with improvements in the labor market over the past year, but it 

still remains somewhat depressed relative to its level before the recession.  A significant 

increase in job openings over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market 

conditions, but the hiring rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the 

recession.  Given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the 

failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the 

prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls.  

Alternatively, subdued hiring could indicate that firms are encountering difficulties in 

finding qualified job applicants.  As is true of the other indicators I have discussed, labor 

market flows tend to reflect not only cyclical but also structural changes in the economy.  

Indeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market dynamism, which 

could prove quite persistent.13  That said, the balance of evidence leads me to conclude

creation and destruction, see Steven J. Davis, R. Jason Faberman, and John Haltiwanger (2012), “Labor 

Market Flows in the Cross Section and over Time,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 59 (January), 

pp. 1-18.  For a review of a range of evidence and possible explanations, see Henry R. Hyatt and James R. 

Spletzer (2013), “The Recent Decline in Employment Dynamics,” IZA Discussion Paper Series 7231 

(Bonn, Germany:  Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), February), http://ftp.iza.org/dp7231.pdf.  These 

authors suggest that much additional work is needed to understand the role of different factors in changes in 

labor market dynamism.  For an analysis that raises the possibility that some of these shifts reflect better 

job matches, see Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith, and Abigail K. Wozniak (2014), “Declining
