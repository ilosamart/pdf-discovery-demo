Introduction 

On behalf of the Board of Governors, I would like to welcome you to our 

conference on emerging financial technologies, or fintech.  I’d like to begin by 

remembering our Federal Reserve colleague Teresa Curran--executive vice president and 

director of Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco--who recently 

passed away after a long illness.  Teresa’s leadership on fintech was one of her many 

extraordinary contributions to the System.  With her characteristic enthusiasm, Teresa 

helped us prioritize this topic early on and had a strong influence in helping shape our 

work program--with an emphasis on assessing the opportunities and challenges of fintech 

in a balanced way.  We already miss her wise counsel here.  I’m sure Teresa would have 

appreciated this conference’s gathering of academics, industry participants, and 

policymakers to exchange information and discuss current research related to financial 

innovation.

technologies and their relevance to our work.1  Fintech has the potential to transform the 

way that financial services are delivered and designed as well as the underlying processes 

of payments, clearing, and settlement.2  The past few years have seen a proliferation of 

new digitally enabled financial products and services, in addition to new processes and 

platforms.  Just as smartphones revolutionized the way in which we interact with one

clearance processes, see the forthcoming Federal Reserve Board Finance and Economics Discussion Series
