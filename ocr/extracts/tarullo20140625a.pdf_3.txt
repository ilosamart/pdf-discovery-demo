attention in the past couple of years--the qualitative assessment of firms’ capital planning 

processes that we conduct in parallel with our quantitative assessment of firms’ capital positions. 

From SCAP to CCAR 

The potential value of comprehensive stress testing had been much discussed among 

academics, analysts, and regulators in the years preceding the financial crisis, but only during the 

crisis was this supervisory tool first used at the same time across the largest firms.  The 

Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) demonstrated in practice, not just in theory, 

the value of simultaneous, forward-looking projections of potential losses and revenues based on 

each bank’s portfolio and circumstances.  The forward-looking feature overcame the limitations 

of static capital ratios.  The simultaneity, along with stress test features such as the use of 

common macroeconomic scenarios, introduced a critical macroprudential dimension that offered 

insights into the condition of the entire financial system, including whether banks were 

sufficiently resilient to continue to lend to households and businesses under such adverse 

conditions. 

The Federal Reserve’s basic approach to stress testing has not changed materially since 

the SCAP.  We continue to take a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on a wide range of staff 

expertise.  We create hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios that incorporate an assumed sharp 

deterioration in economic and financial conditions.  Supervisors estimate each bank’s expected 

losses and revenues and use these estimates to project post-stress capital levels and ratios under 

the hypothetical scenarios.  The estimated capital ratios are then compared with regulatory 

benchmarks.  We use common scenarios for all firms; for the firms with the largest trading 

activities, we add a market-shock scenario that incorporates market turbulence of severity similar 

to that of the latter half of 2008.
