smaller banks, although the risk-weighted capital ratio at large banks has moved down 

somewhat over the past year (figure 4).  In addition, insurers appear generally well 

capitalized; broker-dealers, including those not affiliated with large bank holding 

companies, have reduced their leverage; and the outstanding values of funding vehicles 

that embed significant leverage, such as certain securitized products, are much lower.  In 

contrast, there has been some evidence of rising use of leverage by hedge funds over the 

past year and a half. 

Financial reform has reduced funding risks associated with banks and money 

market funds.  Large banks subject to liquidity regulation rely less on unstable short-term 

wholesale funding and have thicker liquidity buffers.  As a result of money market 

reforms, investors have migrated toward government-only funds, which pose low run 

risk, and away from prime institutional funds, which proved highly susceptible to runs 

during the crisis and required extraordinary government support (figure 5). 

In contrast, we are seeing elevated vulnerabilities in the nonfinancial business 

sector.3  Business borrowing has risen more rapidly than GDP for much of the current 

expansion and now sits near its historical peak (figure 6).  The run-up in corporate debt 

has brought the ratio of debt to assets close to its highest level in two decades on an 

overall basis, and this is also true for speculative-grade and unrated firms (figure 7).  And 

whereas previously, mostly high-earning firms with relatively low leverage were taking 

on additional debt, analysis of detailed balance sheet information indicates that, over the 

past year, firms with high leverage, high interest expense ratios, and low earnings and 

                                                 
3 In addition to the discussion of vulnerabilities presented in the Boardâ€™s Financial Stability Report, the 
increase in risks associated with nonfinancial corporate borrowing is highlighted in the fall 2018 report 
Semiannual Risk Perspective, produced by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  See Office of the 
Comptroller (2018).
