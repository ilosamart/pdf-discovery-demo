The Federal Reserve’s work on financial stability is integral to our dual-mandate 

objectives of price stability and full employment. As the Global Financial Crisis 

demonstrated, when severe financial stress triggers a broad pullback from risk, the 

resulting disruption in financial intermediation can impose deep and lasting damage on 

American families, workers, and businesses.1

The primary focus of financial stability policy is tail risk (outcomes that are

unlikely but severely damaging) as opposed to the modal outlook (the most likely path of 

the economy).  The objective of financial stability policy is to lessen the likelihood and

severity of a financial crisis. Guided by that objective, our financial stability work rests 

on four interdependent pillars:  systematic analysis of financial vulnerabilities; standard 

prudential policies that safeguard the safety and soundness of individual banking 

organizations; additional policies, which I will refer to as “macroprudential,” that build 

resilience in the large, interconnected institutions at the core of the system; and 

countercyclical policies that increase resilience as risks build up cyclically.2 This work 

also recognizes the important connections to our monetary policy objectives. 

Assessment of Financial Vulnerabilities

The foundation for our financial stability work is our assessment of systemic 

financial vulnerabilities.  Our assessment framework is informed by historical episodes of 

financial stress here at home and around the world, as well as by a growing body of
