Assessing Vulnerabilities over the Cycle 

The last several times resource utilization approached levels similar to today, 

signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in accelerating 

inflation.  In contrast to the past, the Federal Reserve now has a systematic forward-

looking approach to identifying increases in financial vulnerabilities.  This monitoring is 

the focus of regular Federal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee 

discussions.  Last week, the Board released its first Financial Stability Report to help 

inform the public and promote transparency and accountability as we carry out our 

financial stability responsibilities.   

While there has been substantial progress on reducing household debt burdens 

and increasing the resilience of the banking system, the Federal Reserveâ€™s assessment

In contrast to the years preceding the crisis, when household borrowing was 

growing at a pace far above that of gross domestic product (GDP), it has since come

The regulated financial sector is also more resilient, owing to far-reaching reforms 

as well as favorable conditions.  Large banks have increased both the size and quality of
