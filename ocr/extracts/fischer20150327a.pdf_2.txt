It is a pleasure to be here.  My subject is the important role the nonbank financial 

sector plays in the United States financial system.  As you know, the euro area financial 

system differs from the U.S. system in terms of the relative size and the role played by 

banks as compared with nonbank financial institutions.  According to a recent report by 

the International Monetary Fund, banks in the euro area accounted for roughly 75 percent 

of total lending by banks and nonbanks that are part of the shadow banking system, 

whereas in the United States, banks accounted for just under half this measure of total 

lending in 2013.1  The relatively large role played by nonbank financial institutions in the 

United States brings with it both economic benefits and risks to financial stability – risks 

that could be seen clearly during the Global Financial Crisis.   

The nonbank sector in the United States was not always so large.  The U.S. 

financial system has changed significantly in recent decades, with nonbanks as a whole 

gaining share and also becoming more interlinked with banks.  This evolution has 

produced material benefits:  increased market liquidity, greater diversity of funding 

sources, and – it is often claimed – a more efficient allocation of risk among investors.  

However, the evolution has also increased threats to the stability of the overall financial 

system, as demonstrated by the recent financial crisis.  To promote financial stability, our 

tools for monitoring, regulation, and crisis management have had to evolve in recent 

years, and they will need to continue to evolve in the years to come.   

1 Note that not all nonbank financial institutions are included in the International Monetary Fund definition 
of shadow banks.  In particular, insurance companies and pension funds are excluded.  See International
