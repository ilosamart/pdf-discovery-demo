risks associated with runs on wholesale funding would, almost by definition, be 

exacerbated if a very large user of that funding were to come under serious stress.  There 

could also be greater negative externalities from a disruption of large, matched SFT 

positions on the books of a major financial firm than if the same total activity were spread 

among a greater number of dealers.  Thus, in keeping with the principle of differential 

and increasingly stringent regulation for large firms, there is a strong case to be made for 

taking steps beyond any generally applicable measures that are eventually applied to 

SFTs or short-term wholesale funding more generally.   

One possibility would be to have progressively greater minimum liquidity 

requirements for larger institutions under the LCR and the still-under-construction Net 

Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).

  There is certainly some appeal to following this route, 

since it would build on all the work done in fashioning these liquidity requirements.  The 

only significant additional task would be calibrating the progressivity structure.  

However, there are at least two disadvantages to this approach.  First, the LCR and, at 

least at this stage of its development, the NSFR, both rest on the implicit presumption 

that a firm with a perfectly matched book is in a fundamentally stable position.  As a 

microprudential matter, this is probably a reasonable assumption.  But under some 

conditions, the disorderly unwind of a single, large SFT book, even one that was quite 

well maturity matched, could set off the kind of unfavorable dynamic described earlier.  

Second, creating liquidity levels substantially higher than those contemplated in the LCR 

and eventual NSFR may not be the most efficient way for some firms to become better
