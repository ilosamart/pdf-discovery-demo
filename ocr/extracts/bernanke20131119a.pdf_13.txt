manageable.13  In deciding to employ LSAPs, the FOMC has accordingly remained 

attentive to the possible costs and risks as well as to the efficacy of this less familiar tool, 

a point the Committee has regularly noted in its post-meeting statements.  Of course, 

elevated unemployment, below-target inflation, lingering economic fragility, and the 

harmful effects of long-term unemployment on our society and economic potential also 

pose significant costs and risks, and the Committee has, thus far, judged that the balance 

favors the use of LSAPs.  

Between November 2008 and June 2012, the FOMC announced or extended a 

series of asset purchase programs, in each case specifying the expected quantities of 

assets to be acquired under the program.  Like the use of date-based forward guidance, 

announcing a program of predetermined size and duration has advantages and 

disadvantages.  On the one hand, a fixed program size is straightforward to communicate; 

on the other hand, a program of fixed size cannot so easily adapt to changes in the 

economic outlook and the consequent changes in the need for policy accommodation.  In 

announcing its fixed-size programs, the FOMC did state a general willingness to do more 

if needed--and, indeed, it has followed through on that promise--but such statements left 

                                                 
13 An additional concern that some have raised about the Federal Reserve’s expanded balance sheet is the 
possibility that financial conditions could evolve in a way that significantly reduces the Fed’s net interest 
income on its portfolio for a time, which in turn could lead to a period during which the Fed is not remitting 
income to the Treasury; see Carpenter and others (2013) for an analysis.  Such a situation, though unlikely, 
could have reputational costs and possibly increase risks to the Federal Reserve’s independence.  Although 
these costs must be taken into account, careful analysis suggests that, in fact, LSAPs almost certainly will 
result in improved government finances:  First, even if a period of no payments to the Treasury occurs, it is 
highly likely that the payments over the period of unconventional monetary policy will be significantly 
higher than they would have been without LSAPs; indeed, since 2009, the Fed has remitted more than $350 
billion to the Treasury, about the same total as it remitted during the 18 years prior to the crisis (1990-2007 
inclusive).  Second, a complete accounting of the fiscal effects of LSAPs should take into account the 
beneficial effects of a stronger economy on tax receipts, interest payments, and government spending; the 
reduction in the budget deficit from these sources will certainly outweigh the effects on the deficit of any 
changes in the pace of Fed payments.  Finally, while fiscal effects are important, the full effect of the 
FOMC’s policies also includes important additional benefits of increased economic growth and 
employment and of greater price stability.
