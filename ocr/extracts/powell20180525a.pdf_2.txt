Thank you for inviting me here to celebrate this important milestone.  Today is a 

special day for all of us, since the founding of the Riksbank 350 years ago marked the

the future may hold, it is worth pausing to note that the three and a half centuries since

continuation of rising prosperity.

accountability of central banks in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public 

institutions in many places around the world.  As you know, the importance of 

transparency and accountability to monetary policymaking was recognized and became

financial stability and monetary policy have become all the more important in light of the

Financial stability policymaking has evolved from managing individual crises as they 

arise to establishing a policy framework that emphasizes prevention.  This framework 

now includes measures to increase the resiliency of the financial system; enhanced
