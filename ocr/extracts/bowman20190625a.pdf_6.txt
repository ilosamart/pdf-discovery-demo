interest-rate risk, capital planning and rules, anti-money-laundering compliance, and 

third-party vendor management.  We want to help MDIs navigate supervisory and 

regulatory requirements.  To do that well, we want to continue to develop an open 

dialogue so we can better understand the challenges you face and how we can best help 

you wherever we have the ability to do so. 

 Personal contact and relationship building are important to community banking 

and, I believe, also to community bank oversight.  We want, and need, to hear your 

questions and concerns.  Last April, we invited the leaders of all Fed-supervised MDIs to 

a Leaders Forum so we could spend a day and a half building relationships and talking 

about the needs of MDIs.  We also encourage staff to reach out to MDIs and ensure that 

you are aware of our outreach meetings and research.  Let’s keep this communication 

going.  We engage is these efforts because your institutions are vital to your communities 

and to the American economy.  On behalf of the Federal Reserve, I’d like to once again 

thank you for the work you do in your communities and welcome you to this year’s 

conference.
