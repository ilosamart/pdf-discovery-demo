Good morning everyone and thank you to President Rosengren and the Boston 

Fed for hosting this conference. 

The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to stress testing as a cornerstone of 

our bank supervisory and financial stability missions.  Stress testing is perhaps the most 

successful supervisory innovation of the post-crisis era.  But if stress tests are to 

continue to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead to 

keep pace with the ever-changing financial system, as they have since the first round of 

tests in 2009.   

Before looking to the future, let me recall a bit of history.  A little more than 

10 years ago, the United States and the world teetered on the brink of economic 

catastrophe.  What was urgently needed was a way to restore confidence in the financial 

system—a daunting challenge.  Neither the banks, nor the regulators, nor the public had a 

reliable sense of the strength and resilience of our major banks.  The announcement of 

forward-looking stress-testing results in May 2009 helped restore confidence and 

stabilize banks by providing a credible and independent picture of their finances.1  These 

original stress tests evolved into the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or 

CCAR, program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and 

supervision by the Fed, as a forward-looking endeavor.
