The Role of Monetary Policy in Restoring Financial Stability 

The Federal Reserve, as we have been reminded by many accounts on the 

occasion of its centennial, was created largely in response to what we would now call 

financial stability concerns, as specifically revealed by the Panic of 1907.  When 

confronted with an even deeper financial panic a hundred years later, the Federal Reserve 

deployed its full range of policy tools-- monetary policy, lender of last resort, and 

supervision--in an effort to stabilize the U.S. financial system.  The Federal Reserve cut 

the federal funds rate to nearly zero by the end of 2008.  It developed an innovative set of 

programs to provide liquidity to financial institutions and to restore confidence in the 

markets.  These tools provided liquidity not only to commercial banks, but also to other 

financial institutions such as investment banks and money market funds, as well as to key 

financial markets such as those for commercial paper and asset-backed securities.1  This 

provision of liquidity was instrumental in helping restore market confidence.  Similarly, 

the development of the first supervisory stress test in 2009 helped to stabilize and restore 

confidence in the financial system as a whole by helping to ensure that the 19 largest 

bank holding companies were sufficiently capitalized so that they could continue serving 

as viable financial intermediaries.  

                                                 
1 Liquidity tools employed by the Federal Reserve that were closely tied to the central bankâ€™s traditional 
role as lender of last resort involved the provision of short-term liquidity to depository and other financial 
institutions and included the traditional discount window; the Term Auction Facility, or TAF; the Primary 
Dealer Credit Facility, or PDCF; and the Term Securities Lending Facility, or TSLF.  A second set of tools 
involved the provision of liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in those credit markets key to 
households and businesses where the expanding crisis threatened to materially impede the availability of 
financing.  The tools that fall into that category are the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market 
Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or AMLF; the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, or CPFF; the Money 
Market Investor Funding Facility, or MIFF; and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.
