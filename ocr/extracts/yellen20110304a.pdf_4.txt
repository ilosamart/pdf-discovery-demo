Other economic crises can similarly be traced to the interaction of weaknesses in 

the global monetary and financial systems.  For example, the Asian financial crisis of the 

late 1990s was rooted in failures to prudently allocate capital to productive investments--

failures of financial intermediation.  But these problems were made worse by 

characteristics of the international monetary system, as heavily managed exchange rates 

encouraged excessive foreign currency borrowing.  The collapse of the Thai baht in mid-

1997, which marked the beginning of the crisis, resulted in substantial balance sheet 

losses--particularly for that countryâ€™s banks--and triggered a widespread reappraisal of 

risk in the entire region.  As investors lost confidence, capital fled these economies, 

precipitating a severe downturn.  As in the recent experience of the United States, better 

management of domestic financial systems in the emerging Asian economies would have 

greatly limited, if not prevented, the financial vulnerabilities that ultimately resulted in 

the crisis, but policies regarding exchange rate regimes and capital flows were also an 

important part of the story. 

The conclusion I draw from these and other financial crises is that we must 

strengthen both the financial system and the monetary system to create a more stable and 

less crisis-prone global economy.  Improving the international financial system requires 

better management of national financial sectors and also enhanced international 

cooperation and coordination, because in a globalized economy with strong, complex, 

cross-border linkages, even domestic financial stresses can have serious international 

repercussions.   

Countries need to work together to ensure that weaknesses in the global financial 

system are recognized and addressed.  I am encouraged by the progress we have made in
