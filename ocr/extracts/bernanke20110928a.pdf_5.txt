Williamson’s original list of recommendations can usefully be divided into three 

categories:  first, steps to increase macroeconomic stability, such as reducing fiscal 

deficits (which had caused high inflation in many countries), broadening the tax base, and 

reallocating government resources to build human and physical capital; second, actions to 

increase the role of markets in the economy, such as privatization of public assets, 

appropriate deregulation, and the liberalization of trade, interest rates, and capital flows; 

and third, efforts to strengthen institutions that promote investment, business formation, 

and growth, particularly by enhancing property rights and the rule of law.  

Aspects of the Washington Consensus have stirred considerable controversy over 

the past two decades.5  Williamson himself viewed the Consensus as an attempt to 

synthesize the conventional wisdom of economists and policymakers of the time, not as a 

roadmap or comprehensive strategy for development.  I have introduced this framework 

here because it is a nice summary of the prevailing views of 20 years ago, a time when 

the most dramatic growth in emerging markets still lay several years in the future.  By 

comparing current views with those described by Williamson in 1990, and accepted by 

many, we may learn something about which ideas have held up and which have been 

modified or refuted by recent events.  I will take in turn the three groups of policies that 

make up the Washington Consensus. 

The first group of recommendations, as I noted, comprised policies aimed at 

increasing macroeconomic stability.  In this case there is little controversy.  Abundant 

evidence has linked fiscal discipline, low inflation, and a stable macroeconomic policy 

                                                            
5 Examples of critiques of the Washington Consensus include Burki and Perry (1998), Rodrik (2006), and 
Birdsall and others (2010).
