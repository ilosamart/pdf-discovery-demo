integration of capital markets and traditional lending, so they did not respond to the 

transformation of foreign banking operations.  Accordingly, just as home countries of 

systemically important banks have been playing catch-up on capital, liquidity, and other 

requirements, so host countries of very large foreign banking operations are playing catch-up in 

dealing with the very different character of many internationally active banks from that of 20 or 

30 years ago.   

The Regulatory Response 

 In a sense, the major strengthening during the past few years of capital and liquidity 

requirements for internationally active banks--including the capital surcharge for banks of global 

systemic importance--has to date been the most important international regulatory response to 

the revealed vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations.  Building capital 

and improving the liquidity positions of banks on a consolidated basis is surely a key step toward 

assuring the stability of major FBOs in host countries. 

 Of course, these agreed changes have not yet been fully implemented.  It is critical not 

just that all jurisdictions adopt appropriate regulations that fully incorporate the new Basel 

standards, but also that we ensure our banks will be substantively, and not just formally, 

compliant as the various transition target dates are reached.  It is also the case that there is more 

to be done in addressing the risks posed by large global banking organizations, including 

additional measures to deal with the run risks associated with short-term wholesale funding and 

ensuring that even the largest firms can be successfully resolved without either creating major 

systemic problems or requiring an infusion of public capital.  I will return to these subjects a bit 

later, in discussing the cooperative agenda that lies ahead for the United States, Europe, and our 

partners throughout the world.
