changes in the real economy, financial innovations, and shifts in asset correlations across firms.  

But I think it fair to say that supervisory stress testing and the CCAR have already made 

important contributions to financial stability and, in the process, have led the way in 

transforming supervision of the nation’s largest financial firms. 

First, they have played a key role in strengthening dramatically the capital position of the 

industry.  The firms participating in CCAR have more than doubled their tier 1 common capital 

since 2009, an increase of $500 billion of additional, high-quality capital in the U.S. financial 

system.  It is noteworthy that supervisors in other countries have themselves been moving toward 

greater use of stress tests as a centerpiece of efforts to build strong capital positions for their 

banks.  Most members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision now use some form of 

stress testing.6  The European Union and the United Kingdom are currently conducting 

supervisory stress tests whose results will be publicly released. 

Second, they have been the leading edge of a movement toward greater supervisory 

transparency.  The Federal Reserve’s decision in spring 2009 to disclose the results of the SCAP 

on a firm-specific basis proved to be an important step in re-establishing market and public 

confidence in the U.S. financial system.  In the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress endorsed the practice 

of disclosing both supervisory and firm stress test results in normal times, as well as in crisis 

periods.  During the past five years we have progressively increased disclosures of firm-specific 

information, the methodologies we use, and the details of the stress test scenarios.  From the 

outset, we have published the broad framework and methodology used in the supervisory stress
