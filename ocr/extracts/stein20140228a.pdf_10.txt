regulation or with monetary policy, it becomes all the more critical to get the case-by-

case analysis right--that is, to really dig into the microeconomic details of the presumed 

market failure and to ask when a regulatory intervention is comparatively more efficient 

than a monetary one, or vice versa.  So while I think it is important to remain heterodox 

and to be open to taking either approach, I would not want to rule out the possibility that 

some of the risks identified by the authors could be mitigated, at least in part, via a 

regulatory approach.  I look forward to seeing more work that helps us sort through these 

challenging issues.
