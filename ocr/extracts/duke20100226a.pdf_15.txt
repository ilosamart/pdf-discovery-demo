Conclusion 

 While financial market conditions have improved in the United States, the overall lending 

environment remains strained, and significant concerns have been raised about the availability of 

credit to small businesses.  The Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the other banking 

agencies, has worked to ensure that the banking system remains safe and sound and is able to 

meet the credit needs of our economy.  We also have aggressively pursued monetary policy 

actions and have provided liquidity to help restore stability to the financial system and support 

the flow of credit to households and businesses. 

 It will take time for the banking industry to fully recover and to serve as a source of 

strength for the real economy.  The Federal Reserve is committed to working with the other 

banking agencies and the Congress to promote the concurrent goals of fostering credit 

availability for creditworthy borrowers and ensuring a safe and sound banking system.  

 Thank you again for your invitation to discuss these important issues at today’s hearing.  

I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
