A failure to address these fiscal challenges would expose the United States to 

serious economic costs and risks.  A high and rising level of government debt relative to 

national income is likely to eventually put upward pressure on interest rates, thereby 

restraining capital formation, productivity, and economic growth.  Indeed, once the 

economy has recovered from its downturn, fiscal deficits will crowd out private spending.  

Large fiscal deficits will also likely put upward pressure on our current account deficits 

with the rest of the world; the associated greater reliance on borrowing from abroad 

means that an increasing share of our future income will be required to make interest 

payments on federal debt held abroad, thereby reducing the amount of income available 

for domestic spending and investment.  A large federal debt will also limit the ability and 

flexibility of policymakers to address future economic stresses and other emergencies, a 

risk that is underscored by the critical fiscal policy actions that were taken to buffer the 

effects of the recent recession and stabilize financial markets in the wake of the crisis.  

And a prolonged failure by policymakers to address America’s fiscal challenges could 

eventually undermine confidence in U.S. economic management.   

I do not underestimate the difficulty of crafting a long-range budget plan that will 

both garner sufficient political support and have sound economic foundations.  The 

reactions to the proposals offered by members of the President’s National Commission on 

Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as to those offered by other prominent groups, 

provide ample evidence of the differences that must be bridged.  Nonetheless, I am 

encouraged that the debate seems to be moving forward and is starting to touch on some 

broad principles that--if followed--would improve economic growth and make achieving 

sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier.  Perhaps the most fundamental
