Under Chair Powell’s leadership, Eric Belsky, Anna Boyd, Federal Reserve Bank of 

Cleveland President Loretta Mester--who chairs the Committee on Research, Public Information, 

and Community Affairs for Reserve Bank presidents--and community development staff across 

the System are continuing to advance this agenda.  Over the past year, all 12 Reserve Banks have 

adopted a common community development strategic plan that seeks to advance the economic 

resilience and mobility of low- and moderate-income households and communities and to 

enhance public awareness of these issues. 

During Chair Yellen’s 16 years as a public servant in the Federal Reserve, her words, 

actions, and research demonstrated a deep commitment to striving for an inclusive economy and 

recognizing the challenges faced by underserved communities.12  From her speeches to her 

policy deliberations, Janet made clear that her duty was to serve Main Street and all Americans.  

The Award for Excellence in Community Development that we are establishing tonight 

memorializes Janet Yellen’s commitment to the people and places that make up our vibrant 

economy, including those who face challenges.  Going forward, we will look to celebrate staff 

within the System like Ariel Cisneros--the first to receive this award in Janet Yellen’s name--

thus honoring those who innovate, trailblaze, and embody the same deep-seated commitment to 

low- and moderate-income communities that Janet Yellen espouses.  With that, it is my great 

pleasure to introduce Chair Janet Yellen.
