With this in mind, the Federal Reserve has in recent years been working 

with a wide range of stakeholders to improve the speed, efficiency, and safety of 

the U.S. payments system.  Significant dialogue and public responses to a 

consultation paper in 2013 indicated that stakeholders would welcome a broad 

initiative to work for change. In response, in 2015, the Federal Reserve launched 

several initiatives including a Faster Payments Task Force and a Secure Payments 

Task Force. 

I spoke about the payments security initiative on another occasion.3  The 

Secure Payments Task Force has been advancing important work, including 

outlining ways for the industry to improve payment identity management practices, 

crafting guidance on standardizing fraud and risk data, and developing a 

framework for protecting sensitive payment data. You can expect to see the results 

of these efforts later this year.     

Today, however, I will focus on the Faster Payments Task Force.  In 

forming the task force, we committed to an inclusive and transparent approach that 

would ensure representation of diverse stakeholder interests.  The group is 

comprised of over 300 representatives from financial institutions, technology
