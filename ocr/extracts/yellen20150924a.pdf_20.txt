than its productive potential.  My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts, 

anticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve 

further as we head into 2016.   

The labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.  

Even so, further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we 

are probably not yet all the way back to full employment.  Although the unemployment 

rate may now be close to its longer-run normal level--which most FOMC participants 

now estimate is around 4.9 percent--this traditional metric of resource utilization almost 

certainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists:  On a cyclically 

adjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying 

trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer 

full-time employment.32  Consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly 

wages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it 

relatively easy to hire and retain employees.   

Reducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in 

the unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the 

longer run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent.  For example, attracting discouraged 

workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful 

employment opportunities and strong hiring.  Similarly, firms may be unwilling to 

restructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater 

difficulty filling part-time positions.  Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in
