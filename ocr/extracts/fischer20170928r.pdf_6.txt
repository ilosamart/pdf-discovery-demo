Fundamentally, however, central bank instrument independence is desirable 

because monetary policy is an esoteric and complicated art or science, involving 

technical judgments that have economy-wide and often long-lasting consequences: A

separate institution is needed to manage and take responsibility for monetary policy.

Central banks have over the years--in some cases over a few centuries--amassed an 

expertise and developed a character that makes them the natural candidates to perform 

the functions expected of such institutions.  As the Governor of the Riksbank has 

observed, the most important skill and reputation that a central bank needs is one of 

reliability.12 That is, both the central government and the general public should be 

confident that their central bank can be relied on to deliver a stable price level and close 

to full employment, along with financial stability.  If such independent institutions did 

not exist, we would have to invent them; if they exist and perform well, the country is 

blessed; and if they exist and perform badly, they need to be reformed--by a change in the 

laws by which they are governed, by changes in their structure, or by changes in 

personnel--and sometimes all of the above.  

Transparency, Accountability, and Communications

In a paper written for the Bank of England’s tercentenary, I considered how an 

instrument-independent central bank might conduct itself.13 My discussion noted that an 

independent central bank should adhere to the “principle of accountability to the public of 

inflation from becoming too high; now, the argument is couched in terms of symmetry of the losses from 
both too-high and too-low inflation.

13 See Fischer (1994, 1995).  Much of my discussion was with particular reference to the United Kingdom, 
and I argued that the Bank of England should receive independence.
