 A second issue involves the effects of the large volume of reserves created as we 

purchased assets.  The Federal Reserve has funded its securities purchases by crediting the 

accounts that banks hold with us.  In explanations of our actions during the crisis, we have 

focused on the effects of our purchases on the prices of the assets that we bought and on the 

spillover to the prices of related assets, as I have just done.  The huge quantity of bank reserves 

that were created has been seen largely as a byproduct of the purchases that would be unlikely to 

have a significant independent effect on financial markets and the economy.  This view, 

however, is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the monetarist tradition 

in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to the money supply to 

economic activity and inflation.  According to these theories, extra reserves should induce banks 

to diversify into additional lending and purchases of securities, reducing the cost of borrowing 

for households and businesses, and so should spark an increase in the money supply and 

spending.  To date, this channel does not seem to have been effective:  Interest rates on bank 

loans relative to the usual benchmarks remain elevated, the quantity of bank loans is still falling, 

and money supply growth has been subdued.  Banksâ€™ behavior appears more consistent with the 

standard Keynesian model of the liquidity trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly 

elastic when short-term interest rates approach zero.  But the portfolio behavior of banks might 

shift as the economy and confidence recover, and we will need to watch and study this channel 

carefully.  

Another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale 

purchases of longer-term assets on inflation expectations.  The more we buy, the more reserves 

we will ultimately need to absorb, and the more assets we will ultimately need to dispose of 

before the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of interbank markets, and the Federal
