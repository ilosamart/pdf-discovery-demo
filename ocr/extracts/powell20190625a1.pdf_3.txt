when the economy turns down, interest rates will more likely fall close to zero—their 

effective lower bound (ELB).  Proximity to the ELB poses new problems to central banks 

and calls for new ideas.  We hope to benefit from the best thinking on these issues.  

At the heart of the review are our Fed Listens events, which include town hall–

style meetings in all 12 Federal Reserve Districts.  These meetings bring together people 

with wide-ranging perspectives, interests, and expertise.  We also want to benefit from 

the insights of leading economic researchers.  We recently held a conference at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that combined research presentations by top scholars

long recovery are now reaching these communities to a degree that has not been felt for
