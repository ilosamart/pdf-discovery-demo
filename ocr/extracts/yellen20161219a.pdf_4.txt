with others.  The drivers of this increasing demand for those with college and graduate 

degrees are likely to continue to be important.   Let me mention two of the most 

important factors.   

First, technology.  For decades, technological advances have increasingly allowed 

simpler, repetitive tasks to be done more cheaply and safely by machines.  This kind of 

work in factories, stores, and offices often required only a high school education.  At the 

same time, technological advances have increased demand for workers with the education 

necessary to perform the ever-growing share of jobs where technology is important.  

More recently, further advances are automating increasingly complex tasks and allowing 

workers with the ability and flexibility to use technology to be more productive.  Higher 

education has also changed in response, and one of the most important things many of 

you learned at the University of Baltimore was how to learn, adapt, and succeed in the 

technology-rich environment of most workplaces.   

The second major development in the job market is globalization, which allows 

goods and services to be produced wherever it is most economical.  Offshoring and trade 

have profoundly affected the U.S. economy.  No one knows which jobs and which 

industries will thrive as globalization continues or how each of you will be affected, but I 

can say that the education you have earned will provide an important advantage.  Like 

technological change, globalization has reinforced the shift away from lower-skilled jobs 

that require less education to higher-skilled jobs that require college and advanced 

degrees.  The jobs that globalization creates in the United States, serving a global 

economy of billions of people, are more likely to be filled by those who, like you, have 

secured the advantage of higher education.
