substantially reduces systemic risk generally and, in particular, the too-big-to-fail 

problem.  In using the Basel II three-pillar metaphor to classify the consensus reform 

agenda, I meant to underscore that this agenda is in many respects a program to build out 

and improve the regulatory approaches that prevailed before the crisis.  The important 

intellectual question is whether the limitations of these approaches that have been 

revealed in the past can be sufficiently overcome, either within each pillar or through 

their combination.   

The fact that support for reforms of the structural variety has been growing during 

the past yearâ€™s policy debate suggests to me that many thoughtful people have given at 

least a tentative negative answer to that question.  Of course, the specifics of a good 

number of these proposals have yet to be formulated, and judgment of the merits must 

await their further development, insofar as the details will determine whether a proposal 

is likely both to be effective and to have manageable unintended consequences.  Speaking 

personally, however, I think that we should not become unrealistically demanding in 

seeking specification of such proposals, particularly when a proposal itself provides for 

ongoing refinement.  For example, my sense is that the provision in the House bill that 

would empower banking regulators to prevent acquisitions that would increase systemic 

risk could be sensibly and effectively elaborated over time.  We should also be thinking 

more seriously about ensuring that safety and soundness requirements for some types of 

activities--residential mortgage lending comes to mind--apply throughout the financial 

system, without regard to the regulated status of the lender. 

Second, having just noted the promise of measures beyond what I have termed the 

consensus agenda, I also want to emphasize the importance of its elements.  Without
