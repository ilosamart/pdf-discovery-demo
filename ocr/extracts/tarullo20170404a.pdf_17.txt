stress on the financial system, such as the possible fire sale of assets by financial firms in need of 

capital or funding, which can further depress asset values of other firms below levels resulting 

from the initial economic or financial shock.10  These effects are harder to model but very 

important for a stress test designed to achieve financial stability objectives.  The Federal Reserve 

has begun a research program to try to develop, over the next few years, sound macroprudential 

elements to incorporate into the stress test alongside some of the countercyclical features that 

have already been added. 

The transition of stress testing from crisis program to a permanent feature of prudential 

oversight is unfinished in both Federal Reserve regulations and supervisory practice.  The de 

facto capital requirements produced by the stress test have not been fully integrated into, and 

reconciled with, other applicable capital rules.  Thus, for example, our stress testing program 

assumes that a firm will continue to make its planned capital distributions during a stress period 

even though the regulatory capital rules now include a capital conservation buffer to limit such 

distributions.  As to supervision--because the failure of a firm to meet Federal Reserve 

expectations with respect to its capital risk-management and planning processes can lead to a 

“qualitative” objection to its capital distribution plans--firms (and, at times, perhaps supervisors) 

have placed more emphasis on these matters than on other issues raised in the supervisory 

process throughout the year.   

It is probably worth noting at this juncture that one of the features of the stress testing 

program that some banks have found most troubling is that it culminates in the annual 

                                                 
asset holdings or adopt correlated hedging strategies that are treated relatively favorably under one particular market 
shock scenario.
