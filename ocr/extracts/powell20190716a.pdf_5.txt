appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its 

symmetric 2 percent objective. 

We will also assess these developments in the context of the broader structural 

changes monetary policymakers have been facing since the Great Recession.  I will focus 

on three tonight:  the changed macroeconomic backdrop, the expanded toolkit, and the 

heightened focus on communication and transparency.   

In the United States, from the mid-1980s to right before the Great Recession, PCE 

inflation averaged 2.6 percent a year, GDP growth 3.4 percent, and the interest rate on a 

10-year Treasury note 6.5 percent.  Since the trough of the Great Recession, average 

inflation and output growth are around 1 percentage point lower, and the 10-year 

Treasury rate has averaged 2.4 percent.  These declines are not unique to the United 

States.  Average inflation rates for the other major advanced economies have declined by 

almost half, while the inflation rates of major emerging market economies are less than 

one-fifth of what they were.  Indeed, with few exceptions, we are all facing lower rates of 

interest, growth, and inflation.  In a number of countries, including the United States, 

these declines have been accompanied by strong labor markets and a much lower 

unemployment rate. 

Such changes in the macroeconomic environment are significant because the 

long-run normal levels of inflation, output, interest rates, and the unemployment rate are 

important structural features by which we guide policy.  Standard estimates of the natural 

rate of unemployment—u*—and the neutral rate of interest—r*—have been declining 

for 2 decades, and particularly since the crisis.
