preservation of financial stability.

  At the time, the standard view of panics was that they 

were triggered when the needs of business and agriculture for liquid funds outstripped the 

available supply--as when seasonal plantings or shipments of crops had to be financed, 

for example--and that panics were further exacerbated by the incentives of banks and 

private individuals to hoard liquidity during such times.

  The new institution was 

intended to relieve such strains by providing an “elastic” currency--that is, by providing 

liquidity as needed to individual member banks through the discount window; 

commercial banks, in turn, would then be able to accommodate their customers.  

Interestingly, although congressional advocates hoped the creation of the Fed would help 

prevent future panics, they did not fully embrace the idea that the Fed should help end 

ongoing panics by serving as lender of last resort, as had been recommended by the 

British economist and writer Walter Bagehot.

  Legislators imposed limits on the Federal 

Reserve’s ability to lend in response to panics, for example, by denying nonmember 

banks access to the discount window and by restricting the types of collateral that the Fed 

could accept.

The framework that the Federal Reserve employed in its early years to promote 

financial stability reflected in large measure the influence of the so-called real bills

 Per a review of the 1929 book Wall Street and Washington in the New York Times, “The Federal Reserve 

System has from the first necessarily been a great experiment, bound to adjust its general policies to the 

requirements of such novel and varying situations as should arise in the course of our financial history and 

which could not possibly be foreseen” (Noyes, 1929).

 Friedman and Schwartz (1963) describe the debate about the elastic currency.  Warburg (1914) discusses 

hoarding and the panic dynamics that the Federal Reserve was established to prevent.

 See Willis (1923, p. 1407), Carlson and Wheelock (2012), and Bordo and Wheelock (2013).  Bagehot 

([1873] 1897) is the source of the classic dictum that a panic should be addressed by the central bank, by 

lending freely at a penalty rate.

 The Monetary Control Act of 1980 gave all depository institutions access to the discount window.  The 

collateral acceptable to be pledged to the discount window has been expanded significantly over time; in 

particular, various pieces of banking legislation in the early 1930s enabled the Federal Reserve to make 

advances to member banks so long as the loans were “secured to the satisfaction” of the Federal Reserve 

Bank extending the loan.
