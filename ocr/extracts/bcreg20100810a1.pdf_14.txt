Question 6: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods?  What are the implications or potential for unintended consequences?  If all 
banking organizations are allowed to calculate their own capital requirements for 
corporate exposures, how can the agencies ensure consistent and transparent 
implementation (for example, where there may be material differences in how financial 
statements are typically presented or differences in chosen financial ratios)?  What 
different approaches or other financial or market criteria would commenters recommend?  
Are there other methods for assessing risk-based capital for corporate exposures in a 
relatively risk sensitive manner that would meet the principles described in section III?  
Commenters are asked to provide quantitative, as well as qualitative, support and/or 
analysis for proposed alternative methods.    

v. Securitization Exposures 

Under the agencies’ general risk-based capital rules, a banking organization may 
use credit ratings to assign risk weights to certain securitization exposures.29  Generally, 
when a banking organization cannot, or chooses not to use the ratings-based approach, it 
must either “gross-up” the exposure or hold dollar-for-dollar capital against the exposure.  
These latter methods are designed to capture the risk of unrated or low rated exposures 
that typically are subordinate in the capital structure of a securitization.  Under the 
advanced approaches rules and the Basel standardized approach, a banking organization 
is required to use a ratings-based approach when available to assign risk weights to 
traditional and synthetic securitization exposures.30  Both the advanced approaches rules 
and the Basel standardized approach also provide alternative approaches for determining 
the capital requirements for exposures that do not qualify for the ratings-based approach.  
The market risk rule and the Basel modified market risk framework also use credit ratings 
for securitization exposures.   

Prior to the implementation of the recourse, direct credit substitutes, residual 
interests and mortgage- and asset-backed securities rule in 2001 (recourse rule),31 the 
agencies’ general risk-based capital rules did not rely on credit ratings to determine risk 
weights for securitization exposures.  In addition to establishing a risk-weighting 
framework based on credit ratings, the recourse rule established an alternative risk-
weighting framework for certain securitization exposures (a gross-up treatment reflecting 
the risk of more subordinated tranches of securitizations).  The agencies could apply the 
risk-based capital rules in effect prior to the implementation of the recourse rule, which 
would eliminate all references to credit ratings.  This would result in all securitization 
exposures receiving the same risk weight regardless of the amount of subordination in the 
securitization structure.  Alternatively, the agencies could:
