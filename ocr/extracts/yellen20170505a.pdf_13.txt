working mothers assume greater childcare responsibilities as adults than sons whose 

mothers did not work.23  

This is not to say that children do not need attention from both parents to develop 

into academically successful and socially well-adjusted adults--they certainly do.  Also, 

as I will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their desire to balance work and 

family.  These findings bear on the question of how best to support women’s work 

through public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family.   

From a macroeconomic perspective, women’s incorporation into the economy 

contributed importantly to the rapid rise in economic output and well-being over the 

20th century.  Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about 

1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic 

product.24  And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in 

women’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted 

their productivity.  In addition, since 1979, women have accounted for a majority of the 

rise in real household income.  In dollar terms, the gains were greatest for households in 

the top third of the earnings distribution, but without the increase in women’s earnings, 

families in the bottom and middle thirds of the distribution would have experienced 

declines.25  

Remaining Challenges and Some Possible Solutions 

I have argued thus far that we, as a country, have reaped great benefits from the 

increasing role that women have played in the economy.  But evidence suggests that
