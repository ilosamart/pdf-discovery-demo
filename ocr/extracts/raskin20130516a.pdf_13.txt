falling further below the rate preferred by the Committee over the longer run.  We will 

continue to calibrate monetary policy--including both the ongoing pace of asset purchases 

and communications about the likely path of the federal funds rate--in light of our 

interpretations of the latest data and the implications of those interpretations for the 

outlook for economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation.   

Conclusion 

In summary, the U.S. economy has continued to recover from the effects of the 

financial crisis and deep recession, though at a pace that has been disappointingly slow.  

The recovery does appear to have picked up steam in some sectors, most notably in 

housing, likely reflecting the easing of some of the headwinds that had been holding back 

the pace of the recovery in earlier years.  However, federal fiscal policy remains an 

important source of restraint.   

In light of these factors, most members of the FOMC project a modest 

improvement in the pace of the recovery this year and next, and, accordingly, a modest 

decline in the unemployment rate.  The Federal Reserve will continue to conduct 

monetary policy so as to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price 

stability.
