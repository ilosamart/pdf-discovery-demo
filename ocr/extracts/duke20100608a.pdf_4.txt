effectively.  If we had been unable or unwilling to do so, I believe that today the economic and 

financial situation would be much worse.1 

Our actions have hardly come without scrutiny or criticism, of course.  While some 

hailed the forceful steps taken by the Federal Reserve in the fall of 2008 to help prevent the 

apocalyptic scenario that we all believed possible, a vocal contingent of critics questioned the 

Federal Reserve’s decisions and the degree to which individual financial institutions benefitted 

from our actions, especially the so-called bailout for insurance company American International 

Group (AIG).  

To help you understand our actions, let me put you into the moment when we decided to 

provide liquidity to AIG.  The government had already put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into 

conservatorship to preserve the mortgage market.  Lehman had just failed, and we were getting 

the initial reports of the fallout, like reports of battlefield casualties, that market after market was 

damaged or frozen.  Panic was so heavy in the markets that it was almost a physical presence.  I 

kept having this image in my head of the panic being like the monster called “the Blob” that I 

saw years ago in an old movie.  Like the Blob, panic attacked one institution after another, and 

with each institution it ate, it grew bigger and stronger.  We had just watched it eat Lehman.  We 

could not stop it there because we are only authorized to lend against collateral, and Lehman did

collapse of AIG.  Our knowledge of the company was limited because we had never supervised 

AIG, but the loan could be secured with collateral.  Based on our assessments of the collateral, 

we believed the risk of the loans to be limited.  And while the risk of making the loan was
