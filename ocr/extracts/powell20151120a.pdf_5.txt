solutions would be to try some of these ideas, at least on a small scale.  Regulators 

are not necessarily well placed to dictate specific trading structures.  I’d much 

rather see changes emerge from a process of experimentation and seeing what 

works.  We should have strong evidence that any change in structure represents an 

improvement before implementing it on a wide scale.    

But we will only be able to evaluate structural innovations if traders actually 

use them.  And the market would need to include both dealers and PTFs.  I’d be 

interested in hearing the panelists’ views on this and whether there are things that 

regulators could do to encourage a cooperative, industry-wide approach.   

Treasury repo markets are also undergoing structural changes, which brings 

me to the third area of consensus at the conference.  The repo panel I moderated 

included an asset manager, a broker dealer and one of the triparty clearing banks.  

There was agreement on the panel that expanded repo clearing would be positive 

for the market.  That said, there was also a consensus that the current private sector 

initiatives in this area face demanding regulatory requirements related to capital 

and liquidity.  We are carefully considering these proposals and are open to 

solutions that would satisfy regulatory requirements while bringing the benefits of 

central clearing.  I’d welcome panelists’ views on proposals for expanded repo 

clearing as well.
