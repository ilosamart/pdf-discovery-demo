3. Leverage ratio 

If a broker-dealer firm faces a binding leverage ratio, this constraint can act as a 

significant tax on two types of SFTs that are largely untouched either by risk-based 

capital requirements or by liquidity regulations.  The first is when the dealer, acting as a 

principal, uses repo to finance its holdings of Treasury securities or agency mortgage-

backed securities, assets that generally have only modest risk weights when held as 

trading positions.  The second is when the dealer acts as an intermediary and has a 

matched repo book.  In both cases, the SFTs blow up the firm’s balance sheet and, hence, 

the denominator of the leverage ratio, even while having little impact on risk-based 

capital or LCR calculations. 

The crucial issue here, however, is whether the leverage ratio does, in fact, bind.  

A traditional view among regulators has been that the leverage ratio should be calibrated 

so as to serve as a meaningful “backstop” for risk-based capital requirements, but that 

under ordinary circumstances it should not actually be the binding constraint on firms. 

For if it were to bind, this would put us in a regime of completely un-risk-weighted 

capital requirements, where the effective capital charge for holding short-term Treasury 

securities would be the same as that for holding, say, risky corporate debt securities or 

loans. 

Recently, U.S. regulators have issued a proposed rulemaking that seeks to raise 

the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio requirement to 5 percent for the largest U.S. 

bank holding companies, and to 6 percent for their affiliated depository institutions.  

While this increase might be considered a parallel shift that preserves the backstop 

philosophy in light of the fact that risk-based requirements have also gone up
