generally.  And a few prescient observers had for many years called for a complementary, 

―macroprudential‖ approach to financial regulation that considers the effects of the financial 

condition of, and actions taken by, individual actors on the financial system as a whole.

  But 

these were far from being dominant features of pre-crisis regulation. 

Since the crisis, both academic work and regulatory reform have given a much more 

prominent place to macroprudential regulation.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) introduced a variety of new policy levers, including 

capital surcharges, resolution plan requirements, consideration of systemic risk effects in 

reviewing and ruling on applications for mergers among financial firms, and even the ability to 

require the reduction in size or scope of large financial conglomerates.   

At a conceptual level, effective implementation of these policy tools requires that we 

incorporate systemic risk into the normative framework of what constitutes a socially efficient 

outcome.  The goal of macroprudential regulation is to require firms to internalize the 

externalities they impose on the stability of the financial system as a whole.  Thus, we need a 

way to incorporate systemic externalities into the models of firm and investor behavior that 

inform regulatory and supervisory policies.  At the same time, we have to evaluate the costs 

associated with systemic events, which by their nature are relatively rare, in light of the basic 

goals of promoting productive efficiency, access to credit, and financial innovation. 

Here--in filling out this analytic framework--is where the perspectives, questions, and 

conclusions of IO literature may usefully be applied.  Many financial markets are far from 

perfectly competitive.  Instead, they are characterized by large firms with significant market

 In 1979, the Bank of England published a report  in which it defined macroprudential regulation as an approach 

concerned with ―problems that bear upon the market as a whole as distinct from an individual bank, and which may 

not be obvious at the micro-prudential level.‖ See ―The Use of Prudential Measures in the International Banking 

Markets,‖ October 24, 1979, pp. 1–2, in BISA 7.18(15)—Papers Lamfalussy, LAM25/F67.  See also BIS Quarterly 

Review, March 2010, pp. 59–67 for more on the early use of the term ―macroprudential.‖
