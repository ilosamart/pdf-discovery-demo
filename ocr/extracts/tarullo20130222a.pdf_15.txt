example, the advanced internal ratings-based approach of Basel II, and thus would provide more 

comparable measures that are also more amenable to international monitoring. 

 Fourth, I would hope to see a requirement proposed for large internationally active 

financial institutions to have minimum amounts of long-term unsecured debt, which would be 

available to absorb losses in the event of insolvency.  As I mentioned earlier, work on resolution 

continues, albeit at different paces in different jurisdictions.  Given the complexities arising from 

the independent, often differing national bankruptcy and insolvency laws, the goal of achieving a 

fully integrated resolution regime for internationally active financial firms may take a good deal 

of time.  But a minimum long-term debt requirement would at least provide national authorities 

with sufficient equity and long-term debt in these firms to bear all losses in the event of 

insolvency, and thereby counteract the moral hazard associated with taxpayer bailouts without 

risking disorderly failure.  This requirement would not break brand new regulatory ground, since 

it would really be a modification of existing Tier 2 gone-concern capital concepts, and would 

complement the requirement for minimum equity levels included in Basel III. 

 As implied in my identification of short-term funding vulnerabilities as a priority area, 

the best way forward here is considerably less easy to specify.  Short-term initiatives on money 

market funds and triparty repo are both possible and desirable.  In truth, though, because money 

market funds are largely American and, to a somewhat lesser extent, European, the United States 

and the European Union together have the ability to address the global run risks associated with 

these products.  I think we also have the responsibility to do so, but not necessarily in identical 

ways.  Accordingly, I would hope that both the United States and the European Union would 

each take effective action to counter the run risk, tailored as appropriate to their regulatory 

environments, and then explain those actions at IOSCO and the FSB, where their efficacy can be
