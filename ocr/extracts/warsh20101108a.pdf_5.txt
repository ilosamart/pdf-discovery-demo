economic diet of fiscal austerity has greater appeal, a kind of penance owed for the excesses of 

the past.  But root-canal economics does not constitute, in my view, optimal economic policy.   

The United States would be better off with a third way:  pro-growth economic policy.  

After all, it is stronger growth that the U.S. and world economies most urgently need. 

The fiscal authorities should begin this exercise by asking two questions:  How big a 

government is desired?  And how is it to be funded?  We can no longer afford the answers to 

each of these questions to be at odds.  But, the conduct of fiscal policy should not stop there.  

The government can fund its endeavors in ways that are growth-friendly or growth-stifling.  We 

can no longer afford to be indifferent to the choice. 

The adoption of pro-growth economic policies would strengthen incentives to invest in 

capital and labor over the horizon.  It would place the countryâ€™s economic potential at the center 

of the policy nexus.  Pro-growth policies would give us the best opportunity to bring 

unemployment rates down dramatically.  Of course, it demands a highly mobile, educated 

workforce, and much work needs to be done there.  But the good news is that the United States 

still has the most dynamic, resilient labor force in the world, and the deepest, most liquid capital 

markets.  It is strong growth that can do more to increase government revenues.  It is strong 

growth that can most effectively defease outsized liabilities.  And it is strong growth that can 

pave the way for robust job creation and higher living standards. 

Pro-growth policies include reform of the tax code to make it simpler and more 

transparent, and more conducive to long-term investment.  The improved regime would reduce 

policy uncertainty over the life of an investment in labor or capital.  And it would provide for far 

more efficient capital allocation.
