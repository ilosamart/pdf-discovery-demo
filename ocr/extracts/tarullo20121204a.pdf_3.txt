social benefits.  Any reduction in such benefits would be an unintended cost of financial 

stability policies.  Conversely, if firm size or industry concentration is found to stem only 

from market power or from funding advantages associated with too-big-to-fail policies or 

perceptions, then some policies aimed at diminishing systemic risk would have the added 

benefit of mitigating market failures.   

Less obvious, perhaps, is the potential for IO research to inform financial stability 

regulation by illuminating industry dynamics that may not be intuitively apparent.  For 

example, unlike firms in most other industries, large financial institutions transact with 

one another on a nearly continuous basis and regularly maintain contractual relationships 

carrying substantial future obligations.  The daily operations of most firms in the 

financial industry depend to a much greater extent on the conditions of their competitors 

than do such operations of firms in other industries.  By extending work on patterns of 

cooperation and competition among firms in other industries to the financial sector, 

IO might help shape regulatory structures that can reduce the potential for contagion 

during periods of financial stress.2  

As important as IO research can be in developing financial regulation, the 

financial sector is in key respects sufficiently different from other industries as to limit 

the relevance of at least some existing research.  In addition to the just-noted contractual 

interconnectedness of competing firms, the combination of correlated asset holdings, 

maturity transformation, and mark-to-market accounting means that distress at one firm 

leading to asset fire sales can create problems at competing firms.  Finally, the presence
