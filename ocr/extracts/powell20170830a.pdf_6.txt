to ensure that directors bring an appropriately diverse range of skills, knowledge, experience, and 

perspective.  Significant events, such as an unexpected loss or compliance failure, should cause 

boards to reflect and reassess their structure, composition, and processes.  An effective board 

takes a preventative approach and engages in probing self-assessments regularly and 

systematically. 

Before I conclude, let me say a few words about an aspect of the proposal that has 

attracted some attention, which is the reversal of a relatively recent practice of directing all 

examination and inspection findings--what we call “matters requiring attention” (MRAs) and 

“matters requiring immediate attention” (MRIAs)--to the board as well as to management.5  The 

practice resulted in boards of directors reviewing and signing off on management’s compliance 

with every MRA and MRIA.  When we began that practice in 2013, our intention was to ensure 

that directors were in a position to hold management accountable in addressing risk management 

shortcomings.  By 2014, we realized that the practice was “almost surely distracting from 

strategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards”.6  For perspective, a large banking 

firm may have one hundred or more MRAs outstanding at a given time, many of which are at a 

                                                           
5 MRIAs are matters of significant importance and urgency that the Federal Reserve requires banking organizations 
to address immediately and include, for example, matters that have the potential to pose significant risk to the safety 
and soundness of the banking organization, matters that represent significant noncompliance with applicable laws or 
regulations and repeat criticisms that have escalated in importance due to insufficient attention or inaction by the 
banking organization. MRAs, on the other hand, are matters that are important and that the Federal Reserve is 
expecting a banking organization to address over a reasonable period of time, but when the timing need not be 
“immediate.” See Supervision and Regulation (SR) letter 13-13/Consumer Affairs letter 13-10, “Supervisory 
Considerations for the Communication of Supervisory Findings,” at 
www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1313.htm. 

6 See “Corporate Governance and Prudential Regulation,” remarks by Governor Daniel J. Tarullo at Association of 
American Law Schools Midyear Meeting, June 9, 2014. (“We should probably be somewhat more selective in 
creating the regulatory checklist for board compliance and regular consideration. One example, drawn from Federal 
Reserve practice, is the recent supervisory guidance requiring that every notice of a “Matter Requiring Attention” 
(MRA) issued by supervisors must be reviewed, and compliance signed off, by the board of directors. There are 
some MRAs that clearly should come to the board’s attention, but the failure to discriminate among them is almost 
surely distracting from strategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards.”)
