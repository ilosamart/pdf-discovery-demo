Historical Perspective on Financial Stability  

The term “financial stability” has a particular meaning in this context.  A stable 

financial system is one that continues to function effectively even in severely adverse 

conditions.  A stable system meets the borrowing and investment needs of households 

and businesses despite economic turbulence.  An unstable system, in contrast, may 

amplify turbulence and prolong economic hardship in the face of stress by failing to 

provide these essential services when they are needed most.  

For Economic Club of New York trivia buffs, I will note that the second ever 

presentation to this club by a Federal Reserve official was about this very topic.  The date 

was March 18, 1929.  Weeks before, the Fed had issued a public statement of concern 

over stock market speculation, and had provided guidance frowning on bank funding of 

such speculation.  William Harding, a former Fed Chair and then president of the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Boston, defended the Fed’s actions in his talk.  He argued that, while the 

Fed should not act as the arbiter of correct asset prices, it did have a primary 

responsibility to protect the banking system’s capacity to meet the credit needs of 

households and businesses.  At the meeting, critics argued that public statements about 

inflated asset prices were “fraught with danger;” that the nation’s banks were so well 

managed that they should not “face public admonition”; and, more generally, that the Fed 

was “out of its sphere.”1  Of course, Harding spoke just a few months before the 1929 

stock market crash, which signaled the onset of the Great Depression.2

reported in “Clash on Policies of Reserve Board” by the New York Times on March 19, 1929, p. 52; and in 
“Reserve Policy Upheld and Hit” by the Wall Street Journal on March 19, 1929, p. 21.  Also see “Wall 
Street News and Comment,” Special Dispatch to the [Daily Boston] Globe, on March 24, 1929, p. A60. 
2 Many factors after the initial crash, including what are now seen as major policy errors, contributed to the 
Great Depression.  See Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the 
United States, 1867-1960 (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press); and Ben S. Bernanke (1983),
