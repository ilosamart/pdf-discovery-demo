delinquencies fall to low levels, and profits rise consistently, all of which could lead to 

lower projected stress losses. Of course, these effects tend to reverse during bad 

economic conditions: Underwriting deficiencies tend to be revealed, delinquencies to 

rise, and profits to fall. Thus, capital requirements based on stress tests alone are unlikely 

to completely compensate for the financial system’s natural pro-cyclicality. 

In part for that reason, we also have a specifically countercyclical capital 

requirement that applies to the largest banks. Countercyclical capital requirements can

lean against a dangerous increase in financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of 

monetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability. The 

reverse is also true. The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is designed to increase the 

resilience of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal 

losses, which often follow periods of rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth that 

are not well supported by underlying economic fundamentals. The CCyB is an additional 

margin of capital that the nation’s largest banks can be asked to build to augment 

resilience at times of rising cyclical pressures and to release as the economy weakens in 

order to allow banks to lend more when it is most needed.

The CCyB framework, which was finalized in September 2016, requires the 

Federal Reserve Board to vote at least once per year on the level of the CCyB.  Put 

simply, the criterion for raising the CCyB above its minimum value of zero is that 

financial risks are assessed to be in the upper one-third of their historical distribution.

Our assessment of financial vulnerabilities is a key input into the Federal Reserve 

Board’s decisions surrounding the setting of the CCyB, along with a variety of other
