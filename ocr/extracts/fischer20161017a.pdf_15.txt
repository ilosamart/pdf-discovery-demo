Taylor (1999) rule--the output gap and the deviation of inflation from target--can be 

thought of as capturing the influence of the drivers of monetary policy at business cycle 

frequencies, with the longer-lasting (lower-frequency) determinants of the level of the 

policy rate being subsumed into movements in r*.3 

Using this definition of r*, we identify several economic disturbances that have 

long-lasting consequences for the savings-investment balance of the U.S. economy.  We 

shock the FRB/US model with each of these disturbances and compute what long-lasting 

(but not necessarily permanent) shift in the intercept of the Taylor (1999) rule is the best 

perturbation to the rule.   

The thought experiment behind the simulations is as follows.  We assume that the 

public views the Taylor (1999) rule as a good approximation of the conduct of monetary 

policy, and, accordingly, they price assets and formulate expenditure decisions on the 

expectation that this policy will prevail.  Then policymakers identify that the economy is 

encountering a shock with durable implications for the savings-investment balance of the 

economy.  At this point, policymakers communicate to the public a long-lasting shift to 

the intercept of the rule.  Private-sector agents are assumed to understand this 

communication, and find it credible, and thus adjust their expectations accordingly. 

2.  The shocks 

All simulations were carried out using the database from the public release of the 

FRB/US model, starting in 2036:Q1, at which time the economy is in steady state.4  

                                                 
3 Williams (2016) defines the natural rate of interest as the short-term real rate “that balances monetary 
policy so that it is neither accommodative nor contractionary in terms of growth and inflation.”  This 
description is close to that of the neutral rate (but not the natural rate) in the main text and in note 2 but 
adds a reference to inflation, which does not appear in definitions of the neutral rate.
