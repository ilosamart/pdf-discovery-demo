inflation expected to rise to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of 

years, the FOMC has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the 

Great Recession.  In no small part because of our authority to pay interest on excess 

reserves, the process of removing policy accommodation is working well. 

After discussing a few issues related to our recent decision to start reducing the 

size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I will address a key question:  What is the 

appropriate future role of the unconventional policy tools that we deployed to address the 

Great Recession?  While I believe that influencing short-term interest rates should 

continue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times, our unconventional 

policy tools will likely be needed again should some future economic downturn drive 

short-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.  Indeed, empirical analysis 

suggests that the neutral federal funds rate--defined as the level of the federal funds rate 

that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its 

potential--is much lower than in previous decades.  Consequently, the probability that 

short-term interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some 

point is uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis.   

I will return to the question about the future of our various policy tools, but first I 

would like to review our experience this decade, which I view as instructive for 

addressing that question.   

Meeting the Challenge of Providing Additional Accommodation 

A substantial body of evidence suggests that the U.S. economy is much stronger 

today than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools 

deployed by the Federal Reserve in response to the Great Recession.  Two key tools were
