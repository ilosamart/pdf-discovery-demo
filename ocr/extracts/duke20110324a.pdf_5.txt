risk have shifted, households might make different decisions about spending, or about saving,

Diversity of Wealth Outcomes in 2009 

The overall pattern of wealth decline, however, masks the stark differences in outcomes 

for individual families.  To put these wealth changes in perspective, it is useful to look at them 

relative to a measure of the scale of families’ circumstances and, thus, to a possible link with 

spending.  Income is one such possible measure, but it can be quite “noisy” because income may 

be affected by a variety of transitory factors.   

In the SCF, we include a measure of the level of income that families consider their usual 

income.2  Taking this measure as a scaling device for wealth changes, we see that 43 percent of 

families saw a wealth decline equal to or more than six months of their usual income (figure 3).  

Almost a third saw a loss greater than an entire year of their usual income (not shown).  

However, more than a fifth of families saw a gain in wealth that was greater than six months of 

their usual income.   

To put these changes in wealth in perspective, it is useful to consider the level of 

household wealth relative to normal income before the crisis.  In 2007, more than one-quarter of 

families had total wealth equal to or less than six months of their usual income, so a change of 

this magnitude would be quite significant for those families (figure 4).  In contrast, for nearly 

one-third of households, their wealth was more than five times their usual income.    

At the level of individual families, changes in wealth appear to have been driven 

primarily by changes in asset valuation, not by changes in ownership (that is, by changes in 

portfolio composition).  Comparisons of patterns of ownership in 2007 and 2009 do show some 

                                                 
2 For all families, median 2007 normal income was $53,000 (mean of $84,000).  Taken over all households, the 
differences in usual and current income average out to a small amount.
