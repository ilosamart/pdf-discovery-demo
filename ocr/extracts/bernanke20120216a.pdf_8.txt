Research by economists throughout the Federal Reserve System is another means 

of gaining a better understanding not only about current conditions in community 

banking, but also about the more fundamental forces that drive their profitability and 

lending.  Our researchers have looked at such topics as the use of credit scoring in small 

business lending, the willingness and ability of community banks to lend to small 

businesses that have lost access to lending from large banks, and the determinants of 

community bank performance both before and during the recent financial crisis--and the 

extent to which these determinants were under the control of bank managers.

  Our hope 

is that this focused research effort not only will hone our understanding of the key role 

that community banks play in the U.S. economy, but also will help us to more effectively 

supervise these banks.  With that, let me shift to some supervisory and regulatory matters 

that are on the minds of both supervisors and bankers. 

The Supervision of Community Banks 

  Unlike most other businesses, banks are subject to rigorous examination and 

supervision to assess their safety and soundness, their ability to withstand risks, and their 

compliance with a variety of laws.

  At community banks, these examinations involve 

off-site analyses and on-site visits by teams of examiners, exit meetings between

 The use of credit scoring in small business lending is discussed in Allen Berger, Adrian Cowan, and Scott 

Frame (2011), “The Surprising Use of Credit Scoring in Small Business Lending by Community Banks and 

the Attendant Effects on Credit Availability, Risk, and Profitability,” Journal of Financial Services 

Research, vol. 39 (April), pp. 1-17; the topic of community banks that lend to small businesses is discussed 

in Jihye Jeon, Judit Montoriol-Garriga, Robert K. Triest, and J. Christina Wang (2010), “Evidence of a 

Credit Crunch?  Results from the 2010 Survey of First District Community Banks,” Federal Reserve Bank 

of Boston, Public Policy Briefs, no. 10-3 (September), www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppb/2010/ppb103.pdf; 

and the determinants of community bank performance are discussed in Dean F. Amel and Robin A. Prager 

(2010), “Performance of Community Banks in Good Times and Bad Times,” unpublished paper, Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, May.

 Examinations typically occur annually but may take place more or less frequently depending on the size 

and condition of the banking organization.  The Federal Reserve maintains a full-time, on-site presence at 

the largest banking organizations.
