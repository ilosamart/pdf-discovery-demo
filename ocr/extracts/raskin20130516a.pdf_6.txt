Turning to the government sector, the legislated reduction in spending by the 

federal government is exerting a clear and continuing drag on economic activity.  Even 

prior to the bulk of the spending cuts associated with sequestration, real purchases by the 

federal government were reported to have dropped at an annual rate of more than 8 

percent in the first quarter of this year, following an even larger drop in the fourth quarter 

of last year.  These cuts in federal spending are likely to be an important influence on the 

near-term prospects for economic growth, and I will say more about this issue in a 

moment.   

In contrast to the federal government, the budget outlook for state and local 

government continues to improve, and the drag on economic activity from this sector’s 

cutbacks in spending has diminished considerably.     

Reflecting some of these mixed influences, as I already noted, real GDP has been 

rising at a very modest rate, and the labor market has shown similarly modest gains over 

the past year, with the unemployment rate coming down about 1/2 percentage point.  To 

more fully understand the experience of the 11.7 million Americans who can’t find work, 

we look to broader measures of labor underutilization, which take into account job 

seekers who have stopped looking for work because they have become discouraged, and 

people working part time but who would prefer to work full time.  Recently, these 

numbers seem to be coming down.  The gains in payroll employment over this period 

have been about in line with the decline in the unemployment rate, although, as is typical, 

the pace of job gains has been somewhat erratic in recent months.  Since the beginning of 

the year, the increases in payroll employment have averaged 196,000 per month, a little 

above the 183,000 average monthly gains observed during 2012.
