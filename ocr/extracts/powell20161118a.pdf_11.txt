heavy export/investment model.  But many other Asian economies’ fortunes are tied to those of 

China, so developments in China will have important implications for growth in these 

economies.  

One natural question is how the rise in domestic content of Chinese exports is affecting 

countries that rely heavily on supplying parts and components to China.  To document this 

reliance, your next slide shows that the share of parts and components in other Asian economies’ 

exports to China (the middle green bars) is much greater than their share in exports to the rest of 

the world (the right blue bars).  Over time, this share has fallen from about 70 percent in 2005 to 

60 percent in 2014, without the share of parts and components in exports to the rest of the world 

increasing.  This evidence, combined with the evidence I presented earlier on trends in Chinese 

processing exports, suggests that other economies in Asia are being adversely affected both by 

less final global demand for Chinese exports and by less use of imported parts and components 

by China in the production of any given amount of final goods exports.  

And the effects of these shifts in supply chains are being offset only very slowly and to 

only a very limited extent by China importing more goods for domestic consumption.16  

Accordingly, it is doubtful that, at least so far, China is fully replacing advanced-economy 

demand as an engine of growth for the rest of emerging Asia.  One way to look more concretely 

at this issue is to estimate an equation for the growth for emerging Asia ex. China that separately 

controls for the effects of Chinese growth and advanced-economy growth.  This approach lets us 


16 The arguments laid out here are consistent with the findings in the chapter on spillovers from China’s transition 
presented in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook (2016b).  This chapter concludes that for many countries the 
effect of China’s transition and rebalancing toward a more sustainable growth model will entail short-run negative 
spillovers, but there will be potential gains to the global economy over the longer term.
