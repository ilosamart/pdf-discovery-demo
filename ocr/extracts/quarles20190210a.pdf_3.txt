increase understanding of it, and to enhance its effectiveness, we must improve our outreach and 

transparency--including to our membership, other global authorities, the public, and key 

stakeholders.  Second, rigor:  as we devote more attention to evaluation of new and evolving

cutting-edge thinking and a disciplined methodology.  And third, analysis:  regulation has 

evolved rapidly in the last decade, and--if we are doing our jobs right--will continue to evolve 

with rapid developments in the financial sector.  An important part of our work must be 

continual, critical analysis of the effects of regulaton with an eye to making useful improvements

businesses around the world.  In the months following the peak of the crisis, the world was 

struggling with financial market turmoil, and the resultant macroeconomic effects were felt by 

people everywhere around the world.  It was clear that the response to this crisis needed to be 

global, and the G7 and G10, without any emerging market representation, were not the right
