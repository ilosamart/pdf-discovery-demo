each have their own merits, but the ultimate stress test for any particular institutional 

structure will, of course, come as these new governance structures face the challenges of 

dealing with financial stress and potential financial crises.   

The structure of the FPC ensures that the Bank of England is nearly fully 

independent with regard to financial stability.26  The Fed does not have that 

independence, even though it has been assigned the responsibility of helping to ensure 

financial stability.   

I have heard foreign central bankers argue, “You can’t be independent in one 

function (monetary policy) and not independent in another (financial stability), without 

the nonindependence with respect to financial stability seeping over to weaken the 

independence of monetary policy.”  I do not believe this is correct--as proof, I think each 

of us feels and is more independent in some of the decisions we make about our lives 

than in others.  Thus, I think the Fed retains its monetary policy independence despite its 

nonindependence with respect to financial stability policy. 

No doubt economists will long debate the appropriate institutional structure for 

financial stability authority.  Because financial markets and political institutions differ 

widely across economies and because historical accident affects the current situation in 

each, it seems unlikely that any single set of arrangements will be optimal in all cases.27  

In any event, as time and future potential crises go by--and may they be few and far 

                                                 
26 The macroprudential tools that the FPC may use were granted to it by specific acts of the U.K. 
Parliament.  In addition, each year, the chancellor remits a letter to the FPC on issues that are of particular 
relevance to the government. 
27 This is an instance of a general point made by Avinash Dixit (1996).
