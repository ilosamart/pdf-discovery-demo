Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns itself ceased to exist as independent entities and were absorbed 

into existing bank holding companies, with some form of government benefit facilitating the 

acquisition.5  And, of course, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac teetered on the brink of failure, 

they were placed into government conservatorship, with accompanying full government 

guarantees of their liabilities.  The absence of an option for orderly resolution was faced head-on 

in the case of Lehman Brothers, whose bankruptcy in September moved the financial crisis to its 

most acute phase.   

Even insured depository institutions such as Wachovia and Washington Mutual, for 

which special resolution procedures were available, were merged into existing banks with, again, 

government benefits to make the absorption of these failing banks worthwhile for the acquiring 

institutions.6  And a number of very large bank holding companies were under grave stress.  

Meanwhile, financial markets of all sorts had either ceased functioning or come dangerously 

close to it.   

Unlike in some bank crises of the past, direct connections among large financial firms 

were only part of the problem.  At the heart of the crisis were contagion effects among firms 

holding similar assets--particularly, tradable assets--and the withdrawal of much of the short-

term wholesale funding on which many large financial firms and the shadow banking system had 

come to rely.  Needless to say, the larger the firm with lots of tradable assets and runnable 

funding, the greater the additional threat to the system.   

                                                           
5 In the case of JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve provided credit to support the 
transaction.  In the case of Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, Bank of America sought an arrangement 
that would ring fence any losses incurred by Merrill so as not to impose those losses on the parent company.  The 
Federal Reserve publicly announced its willingness to negotiate such an arrangement.  Although subsequent 
developments obviated the need for a ring fence arrangement, the public announcement was perceived as benefiting 
Bank of America during the period of extreme market uncertainty in late 2008. 
6 Wells Fargo benefited from a significant tax advantage in the Wachovia acquisition, while the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation agreed to share some losses in the Washington Mutual portfolio in order to facilitate its 
acquisition by JPMorgan.
