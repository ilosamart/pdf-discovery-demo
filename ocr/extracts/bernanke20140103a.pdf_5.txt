to a wide range of financial institutions and markets that did not normally have access to 

the Fed’s discount window--to help stabilize the financial system and the economy. 

What types of transparency are needed to preserve public confidence?  At the 

most basic level, a central bank must be clear and open about its actions and operations, 

particularly when they involve the deployment of public funds.  The Federal Reserve 

routinely makes public extensive information on all aspects of its activities, and since the 

crisis it has greatly increased the quantity and detail of its regular reports to the Congress 

and the public.3  Importantly, contrary to what is sometimes asserted, all of the Fed’s 

financial transactions and operations are subject to regular, intensive audits--by the 

Government Accountability Office, an independent Inspector General, and a private 

accounting firm, as well as by our own internal auditors.4  It is a testament to the 

dedication of the Federal Reserve’s management team that these thorough audits have 

consistently produced assessments of the Fed’s accounting and financial controls that 

most public companies would envy. 

                                                 
3 For example, the Board has regularly published detailed information about the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet and the special liquidity facilities that were introduced during the crisis.  We created a section on our 
website devoted to these issues and initiated a regular public report as well.  (See the webpage “Credit and 
Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet” at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst.htm.) 
4 While the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and 
is free to criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception:  monetary policymaking.  In 
the 1970s, the Congress deliberately excluded monetary policy deliberations, decisions, and actions from 
the scope of GAO reviews.  In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic 
accountability with the benefits that flow from keeping monetary policy free from short-term political 
pressures. 

However, there have been recent proposals (so-called Audit the Fed measures) to expand the 
authority of the GAO over the Federal Reserve to include reviews of monetary policy decisions.  Because 
the GAO is the investigative arm of the Congress and GAO reviews may be initiated at the request of 
members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of individual policy decisions could be 
seen, with good reason, as efforts to bring political pressure to bear on monetary policymakers.  A 
perceived politicization of monetary policy would reduce public confidence in the ability of the Federal 
Reserve to make its policy decisions based strictly on what is good for the economy in the longer 
term.  Balancing the need for accountability against the goal of insulating monetary policy from short-term 
political pressures is very important, and I believe that the Congress had it right in the 1970s when it 
explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from the possibility of politically motivated 
reviews.
