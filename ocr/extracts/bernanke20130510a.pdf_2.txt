We are now more than four years beyond the most intense phase of the financial 

crisis, but its legacy remains.  Our economy has not yet fully regained the jobs lost in the 

recession that accompanied the financial near collapse.  And our financial system--

despite significant healing over the past four years--continues to struggle with the 

economic, legal, and reputational consequences of the events of 2007 to 2009.   

The crisis also engendered major shifts in financial regulatory policy and practice.  

Not since the Great Depression have we seen such extensive changes in financial 

regulation as those codified in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in the United States and, internationally, in the Basel III 

Accord and a range of other initiatives.  This new regulatory framework is still under 

construction, but the Federal Reserve has already made significant changes to how it 

conceptualizes and carries out both its regulatory and supervisory role and its 

responsibility to foster financial stability. 

In my remarks today I will discuss the Federal Reserveâ€™s efforts in an area that 

typically gets less attention than the writing and implementation of new rules--namely, 

our ongoing monitoring of the financial system.  Of course, the Fed has always paid close 

attention to financial markets, for both regulatory and monetary policy purposes.  

However,  in recent years, we have both greatly increased the resources we devote to 

monitoring and taken a more systematic and intensive approach, led by our Office of 

Financial Stability Policy and Research and drawing on substantial resources from across 

the Federal Reserve System.  This monitoring informs the policy decisions of both the 

Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee as well as our work with 

other agencies.
