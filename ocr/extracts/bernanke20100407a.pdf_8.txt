near zero.  In a less conventional operation, we also purchased more than $1.7 trillion of 

Treasury securities and securities issued or guaranteed by the housing-related GSEs.  

These purchases contributed to a marked improvement in credit markets.  In particular, 

they significantly lowered mortgage interest rates, which made housing more affordable 

and allowed millions of Americans to reduce their payments by refinancing.   

Finally, the Federal Reserve also responded to the crisis in its capacity as a bank 

supervisor.  Last spring we led a forward-looking, simultaneous evaluation of the 

financial conditions and capital positions of 19 of the largest bank holding companies in 

the United States, with the Treasury committing to provide public capital as needed.  The 

goal of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program--popularly called the stress test--

was to ensure that these firms held sufficient capital, in both quantity and quality, to 

withstand worse-than-expected economic conditions over the subsequent two years and 

yet remain healthy and capable of lending to creditworthy borrowers.2  This exercise was 

unprecedented in scale and scope, as well as in the range of information we made public 

regarding the projected losses and revenues of the tested firms, which allowed private 

analysts to judge for themselves the credibility of the exercise.  Markets responded 

favorably to the release of the stress test results, and many of the tested banks were able 

to raise substantial amounts of capital from investors and to repay government capital. 

Overall, the policy actions implemented over the past two and a half years by the 

Federal Reserve and other agencies in the United States and abroad have helped stabilize
