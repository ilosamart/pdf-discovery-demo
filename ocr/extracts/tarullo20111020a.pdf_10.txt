5 percent in the two years following the 1975 and 1982 recessions.  Even taking into 

account differences in trends across time, the slower pace of overall economic growth 

following recent recessions is striking. 

Various arguments have been advanced in an effort to rebut the presumption that 

an aggregate demand shortfall accounts for much or most of the increased 

unemployment.  The most common argument is that the deep recession created serious 

difficulties in matching available workers to available jobs, resulting in a big increase in 

structural unemployment.  

The mismatches in question could develop for a number of reasons.  First, some 

have suggested that the traditional willingness of American workers to move from 

weaker labor markets to stronger ones has been impeded by the sharp decline in 

residential property prices and especially by the large number of mortgages that are now 

greater than the values of the properties securing them.  But research to date suggests that 

such “house lock” has probably not had more than a small effect on structural 

unemployment thus far.7  As noted earlier, migration rates have been falling for some 

time.  But the declines during the recession have not been larger for homeowners than for 

renters.  Nor has migration declined more in areas where workers are more likely to have 

underwater mortgages because of particularly large declines in housing prices. 

A second factor, the one most often cited in support of the structural 

unemployment hypothesis, is skills mismatch.  While it is quite plausible that certain 

features of the current labor market reflect some skills mismatch contributing to a rise in
