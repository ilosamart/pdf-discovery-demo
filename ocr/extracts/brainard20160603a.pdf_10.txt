As a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to 

prove persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.8   

One likely explanation for this persistence is the sharp drop-off in potential output 

growth since the Great Recession.  From 1953 to 2003, potential output growth varied 

between 3 and 4-1/2 percent, with one brief exception, according to the Congressional 

Budget Office.  Over the recovery, it has averaged only 1-1/4 percent.  One contributor to 

this decline has been a reduction in the labor force participation rate due to population 

aging.  Another has been a marked slowing in productivity growth.  Over the six years 

from the end of 2009 to the end of 2015, productivity grew only a little over 1/2 percent 

per year, compared with average growth of 2-1/4 percent over the 50 years prior to the 

Great Recession.9   

The reasons for such a dramatic slowing in productivity growth are not clear.  

Possible explanations include the fading of a one-time boost to productivity from 

information technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s; the reduced movement of 

resources from the least productive to the most productive firms, including new 

businesses, perhaps due to greater financial constraints for new and small businesses; and 

a delay between the introduction of new technologies, such as robotics, genetic 

sequencing, and artificial intelligence, and their effect on new production processes and 

products.10   

                                                 
8 See, for example, Laubach and Williams (2015); the estimates from the dynamic stochastic general 

equilibrium models cited in Yellen (2015); the median estimated neutral rate from the Federal Reserve 

Bank of New Yorkâ€™s most recent  Survey of Market Participants (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 

2016); and Johannsen and Mertens (2016).

mismeasurement may be responsible for some of the slowing in productivity growth, see Byrne, Fernald,
