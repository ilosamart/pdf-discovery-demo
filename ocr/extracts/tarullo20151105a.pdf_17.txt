European Central Bank as the supervisor for all larger banks in the euro zone.  The Federal 

Reserve has already established instructive and productive relationships with the experienced 

and committed group of supervisors that have been brought in to lead the SSM. 

The Limits of Shared Responsibility 

It is important to recognize, though, that even with the best of intentions and actions in 

home country regulatory and supervisory regimes, there will be limits to how much 

responsibility can appropriately be shared for international banking activities.  These limits are 

most apparent in the context of the possible insolvency of a major foreign banking 

organization.10  The work of the FSB in promoting effective resolution regimes around the world 

and in seeking an international framework for building the total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) 

of GSIBs are very good examples of cooperative efforts that promote the aim of ensuring that 

even the largest banks can fail without either causing financial disorder or requiring injection of 

public capital.  My expectation is that the FSBâ€™s framework for TLAC will incorporate the 

principle of an extra buffer of loss absorbing capacity at the consolidated level beyond what may 

be required in the aggregate at local levels.11  But the margin may be a little thinner here, 

precisely because of the circumstances in which the loss absorption capacity may be needed. 

With respect to going concern prudential requirements such as capital levels, host 

countries have a continuing opportunity to observe how home country officials are regulating 

and supervising their banks.  Particularly if effective monitoring mechanisms are developed, host 

countries may become comfortable with limited oversight of some or all domestic operations of 

                                                 
10 Indeed, Dirk Schoenmaker developed his notion of the financial trilemma around the conflicts of interest that arise 
in the context of the insolvency of a global bank. 
11 The TLAC proposal of the FSB contemplates that host authorities will set internal TLAC requirements at 75 to 90 
percent of applicable external TLAC requirements.
