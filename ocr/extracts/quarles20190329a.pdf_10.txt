banking sector has only limited direct exposures to such borrowers and, to the extent they 

can be measured, indirect exposures are also limited.  

The notable levels of vulnerability in asset valuation pressures and business 

borrowing must be considered alongside modest vulnerabilities associated with 

household borrowing and the historically low levels of financial-sector leverage and 

funding risk.  Household debt relative to GDP has fallen substantially from the level of a 

decade ago, and the credit quality of household borrowing remains relatively solid, 

despite pockets of weakness evident in some areas of auto lending.  Even more important, 

banks now have substantially higher-quality capital and more of it than in the 2000s, 

owing importantly to the structural reform of capital requirements and stress testing.  In 

fact, under last year’s stress tests, capital levels at the largest U.S. banks after a 

hypothetical severe global recession would have been higher than the actual capital levels 

of large banks in the years before the crisis.  Moreover, around 20 percent of the assets of 

the most systemically important financial institutions are highly liquid assets that can be 

sold quickly in the event of stress.  And, following reforms to money market mutual 

funds and other steps, the volume of short-term uninsured funding, most prone to runs, is 

well below pre-crisis levels.  

Taken as a whole, financial system vulnerabilities strike me as being not outside 

their normal range, which is consistent with a zero CCyB under the Board’s framework 

and is why I supported the Board’s decision to keep the CCyB at zero earlier this month.   

International Experience with the Countercyclical Capital Buffer 

While policymakers in the United States have maintained the CCyB at zero since 

2016, other countries have adjusted their countercyclical buffers in response to
