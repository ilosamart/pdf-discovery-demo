 It is a pleasure to be here today. What better place to discuss digital currencies than in 

San Francisco, home to so many technology innovators working on new ways to disrupt various 

aspects of our daily lives? 1    

Because of the transformative potential of digital currency and distributed ledger 

technologies, the Federal Reserve is actively monitoring digital innovations in the financial 

system.  We have been keenly evaluating developments in fintech and digital currencies through 

a multidisciplinary lens, combining information technology and policy analysis to study their 

potential implications for payments policy, supervision and regulation, financial stability, 

monetary policy, and the provision of financial services. This work draws from expertise 

throughout the Federal Reserve System and benefits from engagement with our colleagues 

internationally.   

Cryptocurrencies      

 The past decade has seen a wave of important new developments in digital technologies 

for payments, clearing, and settlement.  Cryptocurrencies represent the leading edge of this 

digital wave.  And it was the advent a decade ago of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, that first 

gave shape to the vision of a decentralized digital currency.   

At the heart of any cryptocurrency is the creation of a new type of asset--the unit of the 

cryptocurrency itself--that is distinct from any traditional form of money used in routine 

transactions, such as U.S. currency or checking accounts in commercial banks.  A typical 

cryptocurrency would not be a liability of any individual or institution.  There is no trusted 

institution standing behind it.  This is in stark contrast to U.S. currency and reserve balances,
