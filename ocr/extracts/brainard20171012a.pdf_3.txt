The low level of the neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting 

the federal funds rate to offset adverse developments and thereby can be expected to 

increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is constrained by the 

effective lower bound, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.  In this 

environment, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down 

private-sector inflation expectations, which could amplify the degree and persistence of 

shortfalls of inflation, thereby making future lower bound episodes even more 

challenging in terms of output and employment losses.  To the extent it is weighing on 

longer-run inflation expectations, the persistently low level of the neutral federal funds 

rate may be a factor contributing to the persistent shortfall of U.S. inflation from the 

FOMC’s target.5  

Further complicating the ability of central banks to achieve their inflation 

objectives in today’s new normal is the very flat Phillips curve observed in the United 

States and many other advanced economies, which makes the relationship between labor 

market conditions and price inflation more tenuous.  For instance, inflation has remained 

stubbornly below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for the past five years even as 

unemployment has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.2 percent, a level that most experts 

believe is in the vicinity of full employment.6 

Bernanke’s paper provides an excellent review of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to 

operate in this new environment and makes some interesting new proposals.  Reflecting 

on the Fed’s available “policy toolbox,” Bernanke concludes that the available tools are
