can be placed into a resolution process and stabilized, the ability to avoid disruptive creditor 

actions, and the availability of temporary backup liquidity support to continue critical operations.  

  Some have proposed changes to adapt the Bankruptcy Code to the purpose of handling 

the failure of a large financial institution--for example, to allow the government to provide 

debtor in possession (DIP) financing, or to allow a firm’s primary regulator to initiate a 

bankruptcy filing.

  At a minimum, these proposals would further limit the need for OLA to the 

rarest of cases. 

As the development of the single-point-of-entry approach continues, it is important to 

continue to reduce the uncertainties that creditors and other market participants would face in 

connection with their potential treatment in OLA.  Questions remain about how the FDIC will 

apply its broad statutory discretion.  For example: How will the FDIC exercise its discretion to 

dissimilarly treat creditors of the same class?  How will a creditor’s “minimum right of 

recovery” be determined?  And how will the FDIC value the failed firm?   Stability demands that 

market participants have a reasonable degree of certainty about their treatment in OLA ex ante.  

This is an important concern.   

To reduce uncertainty, the FDIC is working to provide market participants as much 

clarity as is feasible regarding its contemplated approach to the failure of a systemic U.S. firm. 

Regulators will always need to maintain some degree of flexibility to manage the evolving 

failure of a systemic financial firm.  But greater clarity would increase the predictability of this 

new process, and thus reduce the likelihood that creditors, counterparties, and customers would 

pull away from even a well-capitalized institution in OLA.  I strongly support these efforts to 

provide more clarity to market participants.
