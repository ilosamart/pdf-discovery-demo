is that similar reforms are being pursued throughout the world, with the full support of 

the United States and with international bodies such as the Basel Committee and the 

Financial Stability Board providing coordination. 

More broadly, the approach to regulation and supervision at the Federal Reserve 

has evolved to include a substantial macroprudential, or systemic, orientation in addition 

to the traditional focus on individual institutions.  For example, the Federal Reserve 

created the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which coordinates System 

efforts to monitor the interaction of financial institutions, financial markets, and 

economic developments to identify emerging vulnerabilities and systemic risks.10  

Enhanced monitoring of this type is especially important as the changes in regulatory 

structure and financial innovation may lead risks to manifest in new ways or to migrate 

outside the perimeter of the current regulatory structure. 

Much progress has been made, but more remains to be done.  In addition to 

completing the efforts I have already mentioned, including the full implementation of 

new rules and supervisory responsibilities, the agenda still includes further domestic and 

international cooperation to ensure the effectiveness of mechanisms to allow the orderly 

resolution of insolvent institutions and thereby increase market discipline on large 

institutions.11  The evaluation of potential macroprudential tools that might be used to 

address emerging financial imbalances is another high priority.  For example, the new 

Basel III regulatory capital framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which 

may help build additional resilience within the financial sector during periods of buoyant 

                                                 
10 This monitoring framework is discussed in, for example, Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013). 
11 The Dodd-Frank Act, under the orderly liquidation authority in Title II, created an alternative resolution 
mechanism for SIFIs that takes into account both the need, for moral hazard reasons, to impose costs on the 
creditors of failing firms and the need to protect financial stability; the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, with the cooperation of the Federal Reserve, has been hard at work fleshing out this authority.
