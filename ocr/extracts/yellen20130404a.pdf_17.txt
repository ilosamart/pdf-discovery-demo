normalization of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is still well in the future, the FOMC is 

committed to clear communication about the likely path of the balance sheet.  

There will come a time when the FOMC begins the process of returning the 

federal funds rate to a more normal level.  In their individual projections submitted for 

the March FOMC meeting, 13 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first increase in the 

target for the federal funds rate as most likely to occur in 2015, and another expected it to 

occur in 2016.  But the course of the economy is uncertain, and the Committee added the 

thresholds for unemployment and inflation, in part, to help guide the public if economic 

developments warrant liftoff sooner or later than expected.  As the time of the first 

increase in the federal funds rate moves closer, in my view it will be increasingly 

important for the Committee to clearly communicate about how the federal funds rate 

target will be adjusted.   

I hope I’ve been able today to convey the vital role that communication plays in 

the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote maximum employment and stable prices.  

Communication became even more significant after the onset of the financial crisis when 

the FOMC turned to unconventional policy tools that relied heavily on communication.  

Better times and a transition away from unconventional policies may make monetary 

policy less reliant on communication.  But I hope and trust that the days of “never 

explain, never excuse” are gone for good, and that the Federal Reserve continues to reap 

the benefits of clearly explaining its actions to the public.  I believe further improvements 

in the FOMC’s communication are possible, and I expect they will continue. 

It has been my privilege to share these thoughts with you.  Thank you for inviting 

me here today.
