This line of research has generated alternative measures of well-being that are 

frequently survey-based and incorporate elements such as psychological wellness, the 

level of education, physical health and safety, community vitality and the strength of 

family and social ties, and time spent in leisure activities.  These measures have begun to 

inform official statistics and have started to be discussed in policy debates.  An 

interesting and unique case is the Kingdom of Bhutan, which abandoned tracking gross 

national product in 1972 in favor of its Gross National Happiness index based on a 

survey that incorporates these types of indicators.  Taking the measurement of well-being 

in a cross-country framework, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 

Development (OECD), as part of its OECD Better Life Initiative, has created a “better 

life index” that allows a side-by-side comparison of countries according to various 

quality-of-life indicators that could, at least in principle, be followed over time.4  Other 

somewhat-more-conventional economic indicators that bear on quality of life, and that 

accordingly might be developed and followed in more detail, include changes in the 

distribution of income, wealth, or consumption; the degree of upward mobility in material 

measures of well-being; indications of job security and confidence about future 

employment prospects; and households’ liquidity buffers or other measures of their 

ability to absorb financial shocks.  All of these indicators could be useful in measuring 

economic progress or setbacks as well as in explaining economic decisionmaking or 

projecting future economic outcomes.
