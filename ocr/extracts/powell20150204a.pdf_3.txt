EGRPRA review is considering the potential burden imposed by our regulations on community 

banks and other small insured depository institutions, so that we may carefully consider whether 

our regulations are appropriately adjusted for smaller institutions.  We think it’s important to 

tailor rules whenever possible to clearly distinguish requirements for different portfolios of 

depository institutions and reduce unnecessary burden on community banks.  Of course, tailoring 

regulations may be more challenging in some areas, such as rules that provide transparency and 

fairness in consumer transactions because those are standards that apply throughout the financial 

system.   

We also recognize that, apart from changes in the regulatory and supervisory landscape, 

the banking industry itself has undergone major changes.  For example, improvements in 

technology and changes in the financial industry’s composition between depository institutions 

and nondepository companies have altered the types of financial products and services that are 

offered by depository institutions, as well as how those services and products are accessed.  We 

welcome your views on how these types of industry changes have impacted the effectiveness of 

our regulations. 

Today I look forward to hearing your views on our agencies’ regulations, especially in 

the categories of banking operations, capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).  For 

the Federal Reserve, these topics include regulations on the availability of funds; the collection 

of checks and other items by the Federal Reserve Banks and fund transfers through Fedwire; 

prompt corrective action procedures; and the disclosure and reporting of CRA-related 

agreements.   

I’d like to conclude by saying that we will consider your comments carefully as the 

agencies coordinate to discuss and consider the appropriate action that is likely to best serve our
