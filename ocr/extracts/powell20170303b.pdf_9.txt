organizations had announced plans to use distributed ledger technology in limited 

ways. 

As we have followed developments over the past year, a few lessons have 

come into better focus.6  First, in contrast to Bitcoin’s open architecture, work by 

the financial industry has focused on the development of “permissioned” systems, 

which establish criteria to determine who is permitted access to particular systems, 

ledgers, functions, or information.  In the near term, this approach seems more 

likely than fully open systems to provide the needed governance and management 

to address operational, security, and financial risks.  Indeed, access is typically 

permissioned in situations that require the protection of systems and information in 

the financial and other industries.  Even in permissioned systems, some key issues 

will remain, including whether finality of settlement is to be determined by a 

central trusted party or by a majority of participants, and whether participants are 

able to view information on other parties’ transactions.  Some argue that movement 

away from open systems undermines the potential efficiency and the spirit of DLT.  

At least for now, in payment, clearing, and settlement, safety and confidence must 

also weigh in the balance.
