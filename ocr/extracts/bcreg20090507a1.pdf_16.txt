event the adverse scenario materializes and, in that way it may help to prevent that adverse event from 

occurring. 

The illustration below shows how the buffer works for a hypothetical BHC needing to augment 

its capital at the end of the SCAP. The left hand side of the exhibit shows the BHCs initial capital level 

upon the completion of the SCAP on May 7 and its capital level after it builds the SCAP buffer over the 

six months from May 7 to November 9. Much like the stress assessment exercise undertaken in the 

SCAP, the right hand side of the exhibit shows what would happen to the BHCs capital under two 

alternative scenarios for the macro economy. In the expected, or baseline, scenario, the BHC would end 

the period with even higher capital levels that are well above regulatory minimums, while in the worse-

than-expected, or more adverse scenario, the BHC would end the period with capital near or slightly 

above appropriate levels. 

The presence of this one-time buffer will give market participants, as well as the firms 

themselves, confidence in the capacity of the major BHCs to perform their vital role in lending even if 

the economy proves weaker than expected.

IV. Calculation of Additional Capital to Build SCAP Buffer 
To calculate the amount of additional capital to build the SCAP buffer, supervisors began with 
estimates of credit and trading losses from PPNR and ALLL to estimate the pre-tax change to retained 
earnings.9 [Footnote 9. If analysis indicated that the ALLL could be lower at Q4 2010 than it was at Q4 2008, 
then the commensurate reserve release was added to pre-provision net revenue as an additional loss-absorbing 
resource. End footnote 9.] Pre-tax changes to retained earnings were allocated to an after-tax portion and a 
tax-related portion using a 35 percent average tax rate. The tax-related portion of any losses was applied to the
