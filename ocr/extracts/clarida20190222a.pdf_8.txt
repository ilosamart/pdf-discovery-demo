otherwise would be the case.14  In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup 

strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and 

thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.15 

The benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms 

believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes--for 

example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 

percent.  As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are 

not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, 

conditions at that time will not warrant doing so.  Because of this time inconsistency, any 

makeup strategy, to be successful, would have to be understood by the public to represent 

a credible commitment.  That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the 

academic literature, in which central bank “commitment devices” are simply assumed to 

exist and be instantly credible on decree.  Thus, one of the most challenging questions is 

whether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are 

possible in models.   

The next question the review will consider is, “Are the existing monetary policy 

tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or 

should the toolkit be expanded?  And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary means of 

changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal 

funds rate.  In the fall of 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to 

                                                 
14 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule 
makes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy 
rate lower than otherwise.  The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 
Monetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018, 
pp. 37-41).

nominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.
