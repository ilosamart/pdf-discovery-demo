vacancies adjust more slowly.  Another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the 

Beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance, which induces 

unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continue 

searching for work.  Or employers may be more selective in hiring when their need for 

workers is not pressing and take more time to fill vacancies in an effort to find especially 

qualified hires.  In any case, the data appear consistent with the shift in the vacancy-

unemployment relationship in recent years having been relatively modest and likely to 

reverse, at least in part, as the economy recovers further.  When historical experience is 

taken into account, these patterns do not support the view that structural factors are a 

major cause of the increase in unemployment during the most recent recession.

Conclusion 

 To sum up:  A wide range of indicators suggests that the job market has been 

improving, which is a welcome development indeed.  Still, conditions remain far from 

normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long-term unemployment and the fact 

that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre-crisis peaks, even without adjusting
