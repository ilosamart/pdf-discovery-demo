still appear to be consistent with declining labor market slack, as do indicators such as 

unemployment insurance claims and job openings, which remain robust. 

My judgment is that there is still room for employment and hours worked to grow 

further, as there are other labor market indicators that suggest slack not captured by the 

unemployment rate.  For example, the labor force participation rate remains low relative 

to its declining pre-crisis trend, and the number of employees who are working less than 

they would like is still elevated relative to pre-crisis standards.  Moreover, on balance, 

aggregate measures of wage growth remain soft and have not significantly strengthened 

in the past year, suggesting there is remaining slack in the labor market.  

In addition, although the unemployment rate is now near levels commonly 

associated with the natural rate of unemployment, there are reasons to think that the 

natural rate may have declined over the past few years such that a gap remains between 

the unemployment rate and its natural rate.  The composition of the labor force, for 

example, looks to be shifting toward groups with relatively low levels of unemployment.4  

In addition, it may be that a reduction in worker bargaining power or perhaps reduced 

levels of labor market churning are putting downward pressure on the natural rate.5
