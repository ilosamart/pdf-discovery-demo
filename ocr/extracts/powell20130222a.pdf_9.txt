around the world that better overall economic performance is achieved when the conduct 

of monetary policy is free from political control.10  Of course, we are accountable to the 

Congress and the American people.  The Congress has given us a job to do, and as long 

as I am a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I will do my utmost to carry out our 

mandate. 

Other Observations 

 The authors note that Federal Reserve asset purchases shorten the duration of debt 

held by the public, by the issuance of reserves to fund purchases of long-term securities.  

And shortening the maturity of the public debt does make any government more 

susceptible, in theory, to fiscal dominance.  There is also a general assumption that under 

fiscal dominance any government has a strong incentive to allow inflation to reduce the 

real value of the debt.  In the case of the United States, there is less to that than one might 

expect.  By shortening the duration of debt held by the public, asset purchases have also 

reduced any benefit to the government of an unexpected inflation.  More fundamentally, 

the liabilities that matter in the long term for the federal budget are those associated with 

health care and pension costs.  These liabilities are not nominal but real, and cannot be 

inflated away.
