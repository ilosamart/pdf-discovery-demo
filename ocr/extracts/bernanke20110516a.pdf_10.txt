Certainly, the characteristics of the research to be supported are important for the 

choice of the policy tool.  Direct government support or conduct of the research may 

make the most sense if the project is highly focused and large-scale, possibly involving 

the need for coordination of the work of many researchers and subject to relatively tight 

time frames.  Examples of large-scale, government-funded research include the space 

program and the construction and operation of “atom-smashing” facilities for 

experiments in high-energy physics.  Outside of such cases, which often are linked to 

national defense, a more decentralized model that relies on the ideas and initiative of 

individual researchers or small research groups may be most effective.  Grants to, or 

contracts with, researchers are the typical vehicle for such an approach. 

Of course, the success of decentralized models for government support depends 

on the quality of execution. Some critics believe that funding agencies have been too 

cautious, focusing on a limited number of low-risk projects and targeting funding to 

more-established scientists at the expense of researchers who are less established or less 

conventional in their approaches.  Supporting multiple approaches to a given problem at 

the same time increases the chance of finding a solution; it also increases opportunities 

for cooperation or constructive competition.17  The challenge to policymakers is to 

encourage experimentation and a greater diversity of approaches while simultaneously 

ensuring that an effective peer-review process is in place to guide funding toward high-

quality science.18  

However it is channeled, government support for innovation and R&D will be 

more effective if it is thought of as a long-run investment.  Gestation lags from basic
