At the September FOMC meeting, we changed our reinvestment policy so that the 

proceeds of maturing agency securities will now be reinvested in new MBS.  Yields on 

longer-duration Treasury securities had trended down appreciably in the late summer in 

response to market demand, safe-haven flows, and diminishing expectations for growth.  

Even though nominal MBS rates had also declined somewhat, spreads to Treasury yields 

had, over the course of the year, widened noticeably.  Since this announced change in 

reinvestment policy, spreads on lower-coupon MBS have narrowed, but they remain 

higher than they were early this year. 

A large-scale MBS purchase program has many of the benefits associated with 

purchases of longer-duration Treasury securities, such as inducing investors to shift to 

other assets, including bonds and equities.  But it could also have more direct effects on 

the housing market.  By increasing demand for MBS, such a program should reduce the 

effective yield on those MBS, which in turn should put downward pressure on mortgage 

rates.  The aggregate demand effect should be felt not just in new home purchases, but 

also in the added purchasing power of existing homeowners who are able to refinance.  

Indeed, homeowners who refinance get the equivalent of a permanent tax cut.13  

Concerns about central banks making sectoral credit allocation decisions are 

understandable in general.  But here we are talking about a widely traded instrument in a 

sector that appears, now more than ever, to be central to the slow pace of recovery. 

Now, I should note that the mortgage market is quite segmented.  One relatively 

small group of borrowers has extremely good credit and funds for sizable down 

                                                 
13 Of course, the income gained by consumers is lost to the holders of the mortgages that are prepaid as 
homeowners refinance.  But there are two reasons to believe that aggregate demand would increase.  First, 
the marginal propensity to consume of the average homeowner is almost surely higher than that of the 
average holder of a mortgage-backed security.  Second, to the extent that MBS are held by central banks or 
foreign investors, the decreased income would not translate into reduced spending.
