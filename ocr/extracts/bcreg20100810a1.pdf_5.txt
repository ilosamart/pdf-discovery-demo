I. BACKGROUND  

 The agencies’ regulations and capital standards include various references to and 
regulatory requirements based on the use of credit ratings issued by NRSROs.1  Section 
939A of the Act requires each Federal agency to review “(1) any regulation issued by 
such agency that requires the use of an assessment of the credit-worthiness of a security 
or money market instrument; and (2) any references to or requirements in such 
regulations regarding credit ratings.” 2  Each Federal agency must then “modify any such 
regulations identified by the review … to remove any reference to or requirement of 
reliance on credit ratings and to substitute in such regulations such standard of credit-
worthiness as each respective agency shall determine as appropriate for such 
regulations.”  In developing substitute standards of credit-worthiness, an agency “shall 
seek to establish, to the extent feasible, uniform standards of credit-worthiness” for use 
by the agency, taking into account the entities it regulates that would be subject to such 
standards.3   

 Through this advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), the agencies are 
seeking to gather information as they begin to work toward revising their regulations and 
capital standards to comply with the Act.  This ANPR describes the areas in the agencies’ 
general risk-based capital rules,4 market risk rules,5 and advanced approaches rules6 
(collectively, the risk-based capital standards) where the agencies rely on credit ratings, 
as well as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) recent 
amendments to the Basel Accord.7  The ANPR requests comment on potential 

                                                 
1A nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) is an entity registered with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an NRSRO under section 15E of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934.  See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7, as implemented by 17 CFR 240.17g-1.  On September 29, 2006, the 
President signed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (“Reform Act”) (Pub. L. 109-291) into law.  
The Reform Act requires a credit rating agency that wants to represent itself as an NRSRO to register with 
the SEC. 
 
2 Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, section 939A (July 21, 2010).  Although the agencies have 
conducted a broad review of their risk-based capital regulations to identify all references to credit ratings 
and consider alternatives, the agencies note that section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act limits the required          
review of agency regulations to those pertaining to a credit-worthiness assessment of a security or money 
market instrument.
