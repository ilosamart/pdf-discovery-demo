critical in fostering vibrant communities and a fair and transparent consumer financial services 

marketplace. For all state member banks, we enforce the Fair Housing Act, and for banks of $10

vast majority of our institutions comply with the fair lending laws, we are committed to 

identifying and remedying violations when they occur.  Pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity 

Act, if we determine that a bank has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination, we refer
