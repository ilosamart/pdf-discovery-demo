$25 trillion (more than 140 percent of annual U.S. GDP), reflecting the leading role of 

U.S. capital markets in cross-border finance.  Total foreign investment in the United 

States is even larger, at more than $30 trillion.  U.S. Treasury securities are a key 

component of these external liabilities:  As the world’s favorite safe asset, they are the 

preferred form of collateral for a range of financial contracts, and they also account for 

more than half of other countries’ foreign reserves. 

In a progressively integrating world economy and financial system, a central bank 

cannot ignore developments beyond its country’s borders, and the Fed is no exception.  

This is true even though the Fed’s statutory objectives are defined as specific goals for 

the U.S. economy.  In particular, the Federal Reserve’s objectives are given by its dual 

mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and our policy 

decisions are targeted to achieve these dual objectives.2  Hence, at first blush, it may 

seem that there is little need for Fed policymakers to pay attention to developments 

outside the United States.   

But such an inference would be incorrect. The state of the U.S. economy is 

significantly affected by the state of the world economy.  A wide range of foreign shocks 

affect U.S. domestic spending, production, prices, and financial conditions.  To anticipate 

how these shocks affect the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve devotes significant 

resources to monitoring developments in foreign economies, including emerging market 

economies (EMEs), which account for an increasingly important share of global growth.  

2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has judged that 2 percent inflation in the price of personal 
consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory 
mandate.  For more information, see Federal Open Market Committee (2014).  The Fed also has separate 
responsibilities for promoting financial stability (some of which are spelled out in the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010) that are, in many respects, complementary to the dual 
mandate.  See Yellen (2014) for further discussion.
