Economic Conditions  

Ultimately, the most important step policymakers can take to improve credit availability 

to businesses and households is to achieve a sustainable economic recovery.  Over the past two 

years, the Federal Reserve has acted forcefully on multiple fronts by instituting accommodative 

monetary policy, expanding existing liquidity programs for depository institutions, and 

establishing new liquidity facilities to support market functioning.   

In light of the improved economic outlook, fewer lenders are tightening loan standards.  

And business spending for equipment and software continues to improve, which should 

ultimately lead to more demand for bank credit.  As economic activity picks up and importantly, 

the economic outlook brightens, I would expect both the supply of credit and the demand for 

credit to improve.   

However, a note of caution is in order.  Staff at the Federal Reserve has been studying 

how credit growth typically resumes after an economic downturn.  While it is still early in this 

recovery period,6 the resumption of credit growth following the recession has lagged that of all 

other cycles of the past 40 years with the exception of the 1990â€“91 recession.  That cycle, as you 

will recall, was also accompanied by a banking crisis and was followed by significant regulatory 

change.  Just to give you an idea of how long it could take for credit volumes to recover, 

adjusting for inflation and measuring the time it took to return to the level of credit at the trough 

of the cycle in the first quarter of 1991, it took 3 years for consumer credit to return, 4-1/2 years 

for home mortgages, 5-1/4 years for nonfinancial business credit, and a full 8-3/4 years for 

                                                 
6 The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research has not estimated when the 
recession officially ended.
