A key initiative developed under the leadership of Federal Reserve Bank of 

Chicago President Charles Evans has been the Mortgage Outreach and Research Effort, 

known as MORE.  MORE involves all 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of 

Governors in a collaboration that pools resources and combines expertise to inform and 

engage policymakers, community organizations, financial institutions, and the public at 

large.

empirical research on mortgage- and foreclosure-related topics, and are reaching out to 

industry experts as well.  We are focusing on the hardest-hit cities and regions of the 

country. 

A new publication released this week offers details about the MORE effort.  

Copies are available here today, and it is available online at the website of the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Chicago.1

“mega events” that have served thousands of troubled borrowers.  Moreover, we’ve

mitigate the foreclosure crisis, and I’d like to share some highlights of that work.
