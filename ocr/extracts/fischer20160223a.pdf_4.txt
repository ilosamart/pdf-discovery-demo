policy.  In particular, to raise the federal funds rate we increased the interest rate we pay 

on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve.  We also 

employed an overnight reverse repurchase facility, through which we interact with a 

broad range of firms to help provide a soft floor for the federal funds rate consistent with 

our target range.3  These new tools have worked well, and the federal funds rate and other 

short-term interest rates have increased as expected.  We will continue to monitor these 

markets closely, and we can make adjustments to our tools if necessary to maintain 

control over money market rates.  

The economic data that have come in since our December interest rate decision 

suggest that the labor market has continued to improve.  Although job gains slowed some 

last month, over the most recent three months payrolls have increased 230,000 jobs per 

month on average, as the unemployment rate declined.  Moreover, the spending 

indicators that we have in hand for January point to a pickup in economic growth this 

quarter.  Further, the 12-month change in average hourly earnings has moved up in recent 

months and stood at 2-1/2 percent in January.  In addition, the rate of core consumer price 

index inflation over the past 12 months exceeded 2 percent, though this was not true of 

the core price index of personal consumption expenditures that the Fed monitors closely.  

However--and there is frequently a “however” in our business--further declines in oil 

prices suggest that total inflation will likely remain low for somewhat longer than had 

been previously expected before moving back to 2 percent.   

In addition, global financial markets have been unusually volatile since the turn of 

the year.  For instance, the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX) rose markedly in early
