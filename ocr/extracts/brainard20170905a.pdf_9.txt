The key question in my mind is how to achieve an improvement in longer-run inflation 

expectations to a level that will allow us to achieve our inflation objective.  The persistent 

failure to meet our inflation objective should push us to think broadly about diagnoses 

and solutions.   

The academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for 

preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation 

expectations.11  One feature that is common to many proposals is that the persistence of 

the shortfall in inflation from our objective should be one of the considerations in setting 

monetary policy.  Most immediately, we should assess inflation developments closely 

before making a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate.   

Monetary Policy 

This brings me to the implications for monetary policy.  A key upcoming decision 

for the Committee is when to commence balance sheet normalization.  I consider 

normalization of the federal funds rate to be well under way, the criterion for 

commencing balance sheet normalization.  The approaching change to our reinvestment 

policy has been clearly communicated and is well anticipated.   

In principle, the FOMC could use both the balance sheet and the federal funds 

rate as active tools for setting monetary policy.  However, I view the federal funds rate as 

the preferred active tool, because its effect on financial conditions and the economy has 

been more extensively tested and therefore is better understood than changes to the 

balance sheet.  As a result, once we set in motion the change in balance sheet policy, as 

long as the economy evolves broadly as expected, we should allow the balance sheet to
