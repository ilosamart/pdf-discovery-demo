inclined than that of the firms.  Second, Federal Reserve modeling generally avoids the 

assumption that loss experience during a period of high stress can be extrapolated from 

experience in more normal times, whereas at least some firm modeling uses roll rates and other 

such extrapolations that may not be as useful for measuring losses in tail events.  A third, and 

related point, is that for some loan types the Federal Reserve model incorporates nonlinear 

effects of the macroeconomic scenario.  For example, a 20 percent decline in national house 

prices would mean that prices would decline substantially more in some markets and less in 

others, and losses in areas where house prices decline more would be disproportionately greater 

than losses in areas where house prices decline by less.  The result would be higher overall losses 

than if prices had declined by a uniform 20 percent everywhere.  Fourth, supervisors had the 

advantage of seeing the modeling practices of all 19 of the firms and were able in some instances 

to identify outliers in terms of assumptions and practices. 

Our disclosures -- both of our methodology and of the results -- seem to have struck 

about the right balance between providing useful information to investors, counterparties, and the 

public, on the one hand, and protecting proprietary information whose release might result in   

competitive harm to firms, on the other.  However, as with all aspects of the stress test and 

CCAR, we welcome any suggestions for improvement here as well.  

As to procedure, we have already decided on several changes for next year.  First, the 

timing of the CCAR will change, so that the decisions on objection or non-objection will apply 

to capital actions beginning in the second quarter of 2013.  That is a shift from the first two 

CCARs, in which the supervisory responses covered first quarter capital plans, but those 

responses were not delivered until late in that quarter.  Second, now that the regulatory reporting 

mechanisms for data collection are in place, we will be able to begin the analysis earlier, thereby
