proved to be empirically unstable, and there was often only a very loose connection 

between the growth rate of the monetary base—which the central bank could control—

and the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates, which are more tightly linked to 

economic activity.  Moreover, the macroeconomic priority in the 1980s in the United 

States, the United Kingdom, and other major countries was to do “whatever it takes” to 

break the back of inflation and to restore the credibility squandered by central banks that 

had been unable or unwilling to provide a nominal anchor after the collapse of the 

Bretton Woods system. 

By the early 1990s, the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul 

Volcker), conditions for price stability had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan), 

and the time was right for something to fill the vacuum in central bank practice left by the 

realization that monetary aggregate targeting was not, in practice, a workable monetary 

policy framework.  Although it was mostly unspoken, there was a growing sense at the 

time that a simple, systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to ensure 

that the hard-won gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by 

short-sighted, discretionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed, such as had 

been the case in the 1970s. 

Policy Rate Rules 

That vacuum, of course, was filled by John Taylor in his classic 1993 paper, 

“Discretion vs. Policy Rules in Practice.”  Again, for this audience, I will not need to 

remind you of the enormous impact this single paper had not only on the field of 

                                                 
ultimate objectives for the output gap and inflation figured as criteria for policy decisions.  See, for 
example, Taylor (1995, 1999), Clarida (1999), and Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000).  In addition, Poole 
(1970) and Woodford (2003) are key references on the theoretical criticisms of monetary targeting.
