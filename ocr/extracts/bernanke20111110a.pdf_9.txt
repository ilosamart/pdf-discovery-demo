the largest in the world, with a highly diverse mix of industries and a degree of 

international competitiveness that, if anything, has improved in recent years.  The United 

States continues to be a great place to do business, with a strong system of laws, an 

entrepreneurial tradition, and flexible capital and labor markets.  And our country 

remains a technological leader, with many of the world’s leading research universities 

and the highest spending on research and development of any nation. 

Ultimately, these strengths will reassert themselves if our country takes the steps 

that are necessary to prepare for the future--for example, by putting the federal budget on 

a sustainable path and improving our primary and secondary education system.  The 

Federal Reserve will certainly do its part to help restore high rates of growth and 

employment in a context of price stability. 

 Let me end by again expressing my deep gratitude to all of you here for your 

service to our country.  I am happy to respond to your questions.
