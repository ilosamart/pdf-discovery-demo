Perhaps the work that best exemplifies our commitment to understanding the complex 

dynamics of this city is the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Persistent Poverty Study.  The 

goal of this research initiative is to further understand the barriers and incentives that individuals

The Federal Reserve is deeply committed to the Community Reinvestment Act’s goal of 

encouraging banks to meet their affirmative obligation to serve their entire community, and in
