Of course, other developments may be affecting liquidity in financial markets.  

For example, market participants have indicated that changes in participantsâ€™ risk-

management practices may be contributing to reduced market liquidity.  In particular, the 

experience of the financial crisis may have led many participants to reevaluate the risk of 

their market-making activities and either reduce their exposure to that risk, become more 

selective, or charge more for it, thereby reducing liquidity.4   

It is also worth noting the increased role of asset managers on the buy side of the 

fixed income markets.  During normal market conditions, the demand for liquidity from 

this group of bond holders is likely relatively small, since asset managers acting on behalf 

of retail investors generally buy bonds to hold them for some period.  Moreover, 

managers of open-end funds hold liquidity buffers that enable them to respond smoothly 

to normal redemption demands.  However, because the large increase in bond fund 

holdings is relatively recent, little is known about how these funds will react to periods of 

market stress or to abrupt changes in financial conditions and the adequacy of their 

liquidity buffers for such situations.  Because funds potentially allow daily redemptions 

even against illiquid assets, it is possible that redemptions could be magnified in stressed 

conditions as individuals try to redeem early, which in turn could lead to liquidations of 

relatively less liquid assets, thereby amplifying price volatility and reducing market 

liquidity.   

If in fact liquidity resilience has declined recently, it may be a transitional 

development that will be corrected going forward as participants adjust their risk 

                                                 
4 Another potentially important change in markets has been the increased prevalence of dark pools or 
proprietary trading sites housed inside broker-dealers, which provide no information to the public about the 
volume or prices of trades.  It is possible this activity might be changing price discovery, although there is 
debate over the net effect.
