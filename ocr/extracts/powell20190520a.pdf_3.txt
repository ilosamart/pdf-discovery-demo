of the borrowing is financed opaquely, outside the banking system.  Many are asking 

whether these developments pose a new threat to financial stability.  

At the Federal Reserve, we take this possibility seriously.  The Fed and other 

regulators are using our supervisory tools and closely monitoring risks from the buildup 

of risky business debt.  Business debt has clearly reached a level that should give 

businesses and investors reason to pause and reflect.  If financial and economic 

conditions were to deteriorate, overly indebted firms could well face severe strains.  

However, the parallels to the mortgage boom that led to the Global Financial Crisis are 

not fully convincing.  Most importantly, the financial system today appears strong 

enough to handle potential business-sector losses, which was manifestly not the case a 

decade ago with subprime mortgages.  And there are other differences:  Increases in 

business borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion, in contrast to the 

mortgage boom; business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble, as 

mortgage debt was; and CLO structures are much sounder than the structures that were in 

use during the mortgage credit bubble. 

Could the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than 

currently appreciated?  My colleagues and I continually ask ourselves that question.  We 

are also taking multiple steps to better understand and address the potential risks.  In 

conjunction with other U.S. regulatory agencies, both domestically through the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and internationally through the Financial Stability 

Board (FSB), we are monitoring developments, assessing unknowns, and working to 

develop a clearer picture.  We are also using our supervisory tools to hold the banks we
