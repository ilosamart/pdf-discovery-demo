standards for systemically important insurance companies will be considered by the Board in the 

coming weeks.  Of course, we look forward to public comment on these standards, once 

proposed.  

Capital Requirements for Insurance Companies Supervised by the Federal Reserve 

In formulating capital standards for the insurance companies we supervise, our goals 

should track our overall goals in financial regulation, as I described them a few moments ago.  

Thus we should aim, first, to protect depository institutions and, second, to promote financial 

stability in a manner that takes account of both the unique form of financial intermediation 

reflected in the traditional insurance business and the activities by a few firms that are much 

more closely connected to short-term financial markets and the rest of the financial system.  As 

with some of the other measures I have mentioned, these factors argue for different approaches 

to capital requirements for the systemically important insurance companies, on the one hand, and 

for the rest of the insurance companies we supervise, on the other.  That is, indeed, the direction 

in which I believe we are headed. 

There are, as all of you know, a lot of ideas out there as to how we should construct the 

capital requirements we will apply to insurance companies.  Some, such as variations on the 

Solvency II approach used in the European Union, strike us as unpromising.  The valuation 

frameworks for insurance liabilities adopted in Solvency II differ starkly from U.S. GAAP and 

may introduce excessive volatility.  Such an approach would also be inconsistent with our strong 

preference for building a predominantly standardized risk-based capital rule that enables 

comparisons across firms without excessive reliance on internal models.  Finally, it appears that 

Solvency II could be quite pro-cyclical.
