to be taken into account in administering general regulatory authorities.  As I have explained 

elsewhere,6 this systemic or “macroprudential” regulatory aim does not apply equally to all 

holding companies or banks.  Indeed, with respect to community banks, for example, it does not 

really apply at all.  It is important that financial regulation be tiered so as to regulate for the kinds 

of risks various groups of financial institutions actually pose, rather than to regulate in a 

monolithic fashion. 

Fourth, for all the broadening of our statutory mandate, one feature of the financial 

regulatory system that the Dodd-Frank Act preserved was the functional regulation of holding 

company affiliates based on the kind of financial intermediation in which they are engaged.  

Thus, even though we do apply consolidated capital and liquidity requirements at the holding 

company level, we do not specifically apply them to broker-dealer, commodities merchant, or 

investment company affiliates.  Nor do we have any role in the investor protection and market 

functioning mandates in the regulatory regimes administered by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Similarly, we have no 

role in regulating the types of insurance offered by affiliates of the holding companies we 

supervise or the manner in which the insurance is provided.  These matters are the province of 

state insurance regulators.  In fact, because of the overall structure of insurance regulation as 

specified by Congress in the McCarran-Ferguson Act and elsewhere, the line here is arguably 

brighter than in other areas. 

In pursuing what might be termed its dual regulatory mandate of protecting the safety and 

soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies and promoting financial 

stability, the Federal Reserve must develop regulatory and supervisory measures that are
