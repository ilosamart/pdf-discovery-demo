are likely to conduct more thorough due diligence on their counterparties and exercise more care 

in considering the types of collateral that they will lend against than was the case before the 

crisis.3  

The second example involves the implicit support provided by bank sponsors of certain 

securitization SPEs.  Before the crisis, the interplay between bank capital requirements and 

accounting rules created a significant incentive for banks to shift assets off-balance sheet through 

the use of various SPEs.  Under the capital requirements that applied at the time, a bank that sold 

assets to a conduit or other SPE it sponsored was required to hold capital only against its 

contractual exposure to the SPE.  Yet because a bank that failed to support SPEs it sponsored 

might irreparably damage the value of its franchise, banks often provided credit and liquidity 

support in excess of contractually obligated amounts to asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 

programs, credit card securitizations, and other structured finance vehicles.  Recognizing this 

incentive, pre-crisis lenders were willing to hold commercial paper and other liabilities issued by 

bank-sponsored SPEs at yields only slightly higher than those on liabilities issued directly by the 

bank.  In effect, the bank was able to hold less capital and reduce its funding costs without 

decreasing its economic exposure.  

Post-crisis reforms have reduced the opportunity for banks to exploit this regulatory 

arbitrage.  In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) adopted FAS 166 and 167 

to modify the accounting treatment of structured finance transactions involving certain SPEs.  

Under the new accounting guidance, a company is required to consolidate those SPEs for which 

the company has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the entity as well as 

the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits.  Securitization sponsors have
