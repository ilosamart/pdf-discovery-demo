more closely at the differences, we will gain a better understanding of these markets and of the 

policies or program solutions that will address their vacancy issues most effectively. 

One measure that is frequently cited when describing recent improvements in the national 

housing market is the inventory of vacant homes for sale.  This measure had fallen to 1.6 million 

units in the second quarter of 2012, substantially below its peak of about 2 million units in 2010 

and the first half of 2011.5  However, many vacant homes are not on the market at all.  These 

vacant units include properties that are in the foreclosure process, bank-owned properties that are 

not yet for sale, as well as properties for which the cause of vacancy has no connection to the 

foreclosure process.  Indeed, the stock of non-seasonal homes held off market is nearly two and a 

half times as large as the for-sale vacant stock. 6  But unlike the inventory of vacant homes for 

sale, this stock remains stubbornly elevated relative to pre-crisis numbers, and has not gone 

down at all over the past year.    

Moreover, vacant units are not evenly distributed throughout the United States.  Some 

neighborhoods suffer disproportionate numbers of them.  Specifically, one-tenth of all census 

tracts account for nearly 40 percent of the entire vacant housing stock.  By comparison, the 

overall housing market is only half as concentrated with only 20 percent of the aggregate 

housing stock found in the 10 percent of census tracts with the largest total number of housing 

units.7  

Problems Posed by Vacant Properties 

Why focus on vacant homes?  Vacant homes can be more than just an eye sore; they can 

have substantial negative impacts on the surrounding community, impacts that are felt most
