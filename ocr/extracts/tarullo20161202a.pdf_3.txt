estimates of potential output are significantly below levels expected prior to the Great Recession. 

This may be due to the declines in investment, business dynamism, and labor force attachment 

brought about by the shortfall in aggregate demand through hysteresis effects.4   

 As evidenced by a continuing stream of scholarship, many factors contributed to the 

unsustainability and fragility of the pre-crisis financial system.  But the inadequacy of regulation 

and supervision was clearly among them.  Large banking firms had insufficient levels of high-

quality capital; excessive amounts of short-term, wholesale funding; too few high-quality, liquid 

assets; and inadequate risk measurement and management systems.  Systemically important 

nonbank financial firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the financial system were 

effectively outside the regulatory perimeter.  Governments did not have resolution regimes that 

could provide for an orderly resolution of a systemically important financial firm.  Shadow 

banking--which was funding long-term assets with short-term wholesale liabilities--exposed the 

financial system to a systemwide liquidity run. 

Although we all lived through the fall of 2008, let me dwell for a moment on that 

frightening period.  Six months had passed since the demise of Bear Stearns in March.  Over that 

summer, it may have appeared as though the fallout from this episode had been contained.  But 

by the fall, it became clear that other large, non-prudentially regulated financial firms threatened 

financial stability.  American International Group (AIG) received direct government support.  

Two large freestanding investment banks converted themselves into bank holding companies to 

gain market confidence from the imprimatur of regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve.
