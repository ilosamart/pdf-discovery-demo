target, the Federal Reserve wants to add monetary accommodation.  Suppose further that 

doing so lowers the credit risk premium to 200 basis points temporarily but also increases 

the odds that this risk premium will, at some point in the next couple of years, revert 

sharply, moving back in the direction of 400 basis points.  What is the downside here?  

Given a desire for accommodation, is it not better to have credit risk premiums pushed 

down to a lower on-average level, even if that potentially involves a more volatile down-

then-up path?  Again, the answer depends critically on whether there is some kind of 

asymmetry, whereby the eventual increase in spreads either is more abrupt, or has a 

larger effect on the real economy, than the initial compression. 

In table 1 and figure 2, I present some new evidence that bears on this asymmetry.  

To do so, I build directly on recent work by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (hereafter, GZ).19  

GZ show that changes in credit risk premiums have substantial predictive power for 

measures of economic activity like GDP and unemployment.  More specifically, GZ 

construct a variable called the excess bond premium (EBP).  The EBP at any point in 

time is, roughly speaking, a measure of marketwide credit spreads minus an estimate of 

the expected default losses on bonds.  Hence, it can be thought of as a proxy for the 

excess return that bondholders can expect to earn, net of defaults, on a going-forward 

basis--very much in the spirit of the risk premium concept to which I have been referring.  

Not surprisingly, the EBP exhibits considerable time-series variation, reaching a peak in 

the wake of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.  Moreover, in simple forecasting 

regressions, changes in the EBP are associated with significant movements in GDP and 

unemployment one year later.  In other words, an increase in the EBP--that is, a widening
