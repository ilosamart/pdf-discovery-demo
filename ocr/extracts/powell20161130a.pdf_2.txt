Thanks to David Wessel and the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy 

at the Brookings Institution for putting together this event.1  Today I will share my own 

views on the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) public communications, which 

are designed to serve three important purposes.  The first is to provide the transparency 

that enables the Congress and the public to hold the Committee accountable for its 

decisions on monetary policy.  The second is to enhance the effectiveness of monetary 

policy.  If the public understands the central bank’s views on the economy and monetary 

policy, then households and businesses will take those views into account in making their 

spending and investment plans; policy will be more effective as a result.  And the third is 

to show the full range of FOMC participants’ views, even if doing so may sometimes 

make it difficult for the public to identify a consensus view.  In my view, 

acknowledgment of this diversity of views is important in sustaining the public’s support 

over time for the Federal Reserve as an institution--what Jon Faust refers to in his paper 

as our “democratic legitimacy.”2  In my comments, I will also react to Jon’s thought-

provoking and well-reasoned paper. 

The Modern Era 

I will start with a brief tour of the modern era of FOMC communications, 

beginning with the issuance of the first postmeeting statement in February 1994.3  That

Times,” paper prepared for “Understanding Fedspeak,” an event cosponsored by the Hutchins Center on

Hopkins University, held at the Brookings Institution, Washington, November 30.
