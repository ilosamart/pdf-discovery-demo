disclosure of our models for that reason.  However, I believe that the disclosure we have 

provided does not go far enough to provide visibility into the supervisory models that often 

deliver a firmâ€™s binding capital constraint.  It is important in any proposal to receive comments, 

and I can say that I and my colleagues on the Board will be paying particularly close attention to 

your comments on how we might improve this current proposal. 

Concluding Remarks 

 To conclude, I hope that these remarks give you a sense of our approach to analyzing and 

improving post-crisis regulation.  As I mentioned earlier, the areas of core reform--capital, 

liquidity, stress testing, and resolution--have produced a stronger and more resilient system and 

should be preserved.  We have made great progress, but there is further work to do.  Some clear 

improvements are in the offing in the relatively near future.  Other areas will benefit from longer 

term discussion.  I look forward to engaging with you and the public more broadly as I help to 

chart a course for the important work ahead.
