credit risk but also investors’ faith in the markets where it is traded.  We need 

investors to have full faith in the structure and functioning of Treasury markets 

themselves.  Treasury markets need to be as safe as the securities that trade on 

them.  Episodes such as October 15, in which Treasury prices fluctuated wildly 

with no obvious reason, threaten to erode investor confidence.  The growing list of 

similar events in equity and other markets underscores this concern.  

Confidence in Treasury markets helps to support demand for Treasury 

securities and keep our government’s financing costs low.  Households and firms 

and even foreign governments hold Treasury securities as a key form of savings in 

no small part because of their trust in their safety and liquidity.     

Financial firms have particular reasons to care about these markets.  Many 

types of financial firms are represented here today, with diverse roles within 

Treasury markets.  Since before the financial crisis, one of the driving narratives 

within financial markets has been the growing demand for safe assets.  Many have 

argued that this demand helped to engender the crisis, as a variety of assets came to 

be accepted as risk-free when in fact they were anything but that.  Treasury bills 

and bonds are about the only freely tradeable dollar-denominated assets that really 

can be called safe.  We have a shared interest in guarding against an outcome 

where the Treasury market becomes a source of stress, rather than a safe haven in 

times of stress.
