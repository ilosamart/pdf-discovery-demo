federal debt limit to avoid any possibility of a catastrophic default on the nationâ€™s 

Treasury securities and other obligations.  As you will recall, the threat of default in the 

summer of 2011 fueled economic uncertainty and badly damaged confidence, even 

though an agreement ultimately was reached.  A failure to reach a timely agreement this 

time around could impose even heavier economic and financial costs. 

As fiscal policymakers face these critical decisions, they should keep two 

objectives in mind.  First, as I think is widely appreciated by now, the federal budget is 

on an unsustainable path.  The budget deficit, which peaked at about 10 percent of GDP 

in 2009 and now stands at about 7 percent of GDP, is expected to narrow further in the 

coming years as the economy continues to recover.  However, the CBO projects that, 

under a plausible set of policy assumptions, the budget deficit would still be greater than 

4 percent of GDP in 2018, assuming the economy has returned to its potential by then.  

Moreover, under the CBO projection, the deficit and the ratio of federal debt to GDP 

would subsequently return to an upward trend.9  Of course, we should all understand that 

long-term projections of ever-increasing deficits will never actually come to pass, 

because the willingness of lenders to continue to fund the government can only be 

sustained by responsible fiscal plans and actions.  A credible framework to set federal 

fiscal policy on a stable path--for example, one on which the ratio of federal debt to GDP 

eventually stabilizes or declines--is thus urgently needed to ensure longer-term economic 

growth and stability.
