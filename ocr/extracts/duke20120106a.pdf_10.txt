is typically quite responsive.  Moreover, spillovers from increased housing demand--

such as wealth effects from higher house prices, purchases of complementary goods 

such as furniture and appliances, as well as strengthening bank balance sheets--have, 

in the past, provided a powerful additional impetus to the recovery. 

 Thus far, however, the housing sector has not contributed to the recovery.  In 

addition to the lack of any meaningful improvement in residential construction, the 

expansion has also been hindered by the steep descent of house prices.  To date, house 

prices have fallen by nearly one-third from their peak (chart 23), pushing home equity 

as a share of personal income to its lowest level on record (chart 24) and wiping out $7 

trillion of housing equity.  Further, this decline in housing wealth--and the associated 

hit to consumer confidence--has not only been a meaningful and persistent drag on 

overall consumer spending, it has also been enough to push nearly 12 million 

homeowners underwater on their mortgages, that is their houses are now worth less 

than their mortgage balances (chart 25).  Without equity in their homes, many 

households who have suffered hardships such as unemployment or unexpected illness 

have been unable to resolve mortgage payment problems through refinancing their 

mortgages or selling their homes.  The resulting mortgage delinquencies have ended in 

all too many cases in foreclosure, dislocation, and personal hardship.  Neighborhoods 

and communities have also suffered profoundly from the onslaught of foreclosures, as 

the neglect and deterioration that frequently accompany vacant properties makes 

neighborhoods less desirable places to live and may put further downward pressure on 

house prices.2
