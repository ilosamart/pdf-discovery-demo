Although the FDIC has authority to provide temporary liquidity to a failed firm, any costs 

incurred by the FDIC in resolving the firm must be recovered completely from either the assets 

of the firm or assessments on the financial industry.  The failed firm’s investors, and, if 

necessary, other large financial firms, will bear any costs. That is “bail-in,” not “bailout.” 

 Another strand of criticism argues that reforms do not go far enough and calls for more 

activity limits on banking firms, for limiting their size or systemic footprint, or for simply 

breaking them up.   

Activity Limits  

Some have urged the resurrection of the 1930s-era Glass-Steagall prohibitions--that is, 

preventing the affiliation of commercial banks with investment banks.  This proposal seems 

neither directly related to the causes of the financial crisis, nor likely to help end too big to fail.  

The systemic run that led to the financial crisis began with traditional investment banks, such as 

Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  The activities of these firms were, of course, not affected by 

the repeal of Glass-Steagall.  Commercial banking firms now engage in activities traditionally 

associated with investment banking, such as securities underwriting.  The combination of these 

activities under a single corporate umbrella did not contribute meaningfully to the financial 

crisis.  In my view, losses at the commercial banks were more importantly a consequence of bad 

credit underwriting and the failure of risk management systems to keep up with innovation and 

the explosive growth in securitization--developments that were not fundamentally driven by the 

repeal of Glass-Steagall.  

Size Limits 

There are also calls to further limit the size or systemic footprint of financial firms.  

Limits of this nature require, and deserve, careful analysis.
