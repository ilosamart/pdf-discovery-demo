Kohn noted that policy rule prescriptions served two functions:  as a “benchmark 

for the stance of policy” and “to structure thinking about the implications of incoming 

information for the direction of policy action.”9  These two functions continue to be 

important:  Policy rule prescriptions provide a useful starting point for FOMC 

deliberations and a convenient way of organizing alternative arguments about the 

appropriate policy decision.  Policy rule prescriptions, particularly prescriptions that are 

obtained from a dynamic model simulation, also help policymakers take to heart a key 

message of the literature on policy rules--namely, that monetary policy decisions should 

concern the appropriate path for the policy instrument and not merely the current setting 

of that instrument. 

Kohn also observed, however, that “in truth, only a few members look at this or 

similar information regularly, and the number does not seem to be growing.”  That state 

of affairs has probably changed in the two decades since Kohn wrote.  It is clear from 

transcripts in the public record that rule prescriptions have frequently been cited at 

FOMC meetings.10  The prominence that interest rate rules have achieved in Federal 

Reserve policymakers’ analysis of monetary policy was underscored by Chair Yellen in 

her speech at Stanford University earlier this year.11 

Further, as is clear from Taylor’s econometric derivation of his 1993 rule, actual 

monetary policy decisions may--and probably should--exhibit systematic patterns that 

can be described as a rule.  In fact, as I have already noted, one attraction of the 1993

highlighted.  In Fischer (1994, p. 289), when considering McCallum’s (1988) proposed rule for monetary 
base growth, I described it as “a useful benchmark against which to judge policy.”
