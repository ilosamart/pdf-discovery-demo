Federal Reserve last year in June.5  This survey provides qualitative information on credit terms 

and availability of various forms of dealer-intermediated financing--including for securities 

positions--and OTC derivatives. 

The available qualitative and quantitative indicators suggest that dealer-intermediated 

leverage has risen modestly since its post-crisis nadir in 2009.  For example, responses to several 

consecutive SCOOSs point to an easing of price and nonprice credit terms applicable to a range 

of counterparties (including hedge funds, private equity firms, and other private pools of capital, 

shown in figure 5) since early 2010.  In addition, dealers have consistently reported an increase 

in demand for funding across various collateral types.  Furthermore, special questions included 

in the March 2011 SCOOS suggest an increase in the use of leverage by some traditionally 

unlevered investors (such as pension funds and insurance companies) as well as hedge funds 

during the previous six months.     

In spite of this increase, many indicators suggest that the overall use of financial leverage 

remains markedly below levels prevailing before the crisis and has increased only modestly over 

the past year.  For example, as shown in figure 6, activity in the triparty repo market has in fact 

changed little, on balance, over the past year, and haircuts on the most important types of 

collateral have been steady over this period.6  Of note, increases in the utilization of leverage 

have been driven by the financing of relatively liquid asset types (such as equities) through 

comparatively transparent transactions.  Moreover, issuance of structured products that embed 

leverage, which were originated in large volumes prior to the crisis, has not resumed on any 

significant scale.  More broadly, the appetite of most market participants for additional leverage
