Two other major additions to the Fed’s toolkit were large-scale asset purchases 

and increasingly explicit forward guidance.11  Both were used to provide additional 

monetary policy accommodation after short-term interest rates fell close to zero.  Our 

purchases of Treasury and mortgage-related securities in the open market pushed down 

longer-term borrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses.  Extended 

forward rate guidance--announcing that we intended to keep short-term interest rates 

lower for longer than might have otherwise been expected--also put significant 

downward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates, as did guidance regarding the size 

and scope of our asset purchases.  

In light of the slowness of the economic recovery, some have questioned the 

effectiveness of asset purchases and extended forward rate guidance.  But this criticism 

fails to consider the unusual headwinds the economy faced after the crisis.  Those 

headwinds included substantial household and business deleveraging, unfavorable 

demand shocks from abroad, a period of contractionary fiscal policy, and unusually tight 

credit, especially for housing.  Studies have found that our asset purchases and extended 

forward rate guidance put appreciable downward pressure on long-term interest rates and, 

as a result, helped spur growth in demand for goods and services, lower the 

unemployment rate, and prevent inflation from falling further below our 2 percent 

objective.12  

                                                 
11 Prior to the crisis, the Fed occasionally used forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of 

interest rates, but that guidance was usually confined to a relatively short time frame.
