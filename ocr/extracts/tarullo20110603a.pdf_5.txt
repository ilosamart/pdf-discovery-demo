additional capital requirements could help offset any funding advantage derived from the 

perceived status of such institutions as too-big-to-fail.   

Of course, if a SIFI could be resolved in an orderly fashion, negative externalities could 

be greatly reduced.  The special resolution regime in Dodd-Frank aims at just such an outcome.  

The FDIC is investing considerable time and talent into making that outcome more likely, and 

thus bringing a greater measure of market discipline to large financial firms more generally.  

Together with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve will be reviewing the resolution plans required of 

larger institutions by Dodd-Frank and, where necessary, seeking changes to facilitate the orderly 

resolution of those firms.   

Still, we must acknowledge that we are some distance from achieving this goal.  The 

legal and practical complexities implicated by the insolvency of a SIFI with substantial assets in 

many countries will make its orderly resolution a daunting task, at least for the foreseeable 

future.ii  Similarly, were several SIFIs to come under severe stress, as in the fall of 2008, even 

the best-prepared team of officials would be hard-pressed to manage multiple resolutions 

simultaneously.   

For these reasons, the special resolution mechanism of Dodd-Frank and the enhanced 

capital requirements called for by that same law should be regarded as complementary rather 

than as substitutes.  Indeed, additional capital requirements would relieve some pressure on the 

insolvency regime.  That regime, in turn, could over time induce additional market discipline so 

as to make more likely the chances that failure of a very large institution would be a manageable 

event.
