employment.  Today, the economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for 

many years (figure 5).

remain at low levels for some time, which could draw more workers into the workforce,

risk of lower inflation and the upside risk of labor market overheating.

performance of the labor market might warrant a faster pace of tightening, inflation has 

been below target for five years and has moved up only slowly toward 2 percent, which 

argues for continued patience, especially if that progress slows or stalls.  If the economy 

performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise 

rates.  I would also see it as appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the
