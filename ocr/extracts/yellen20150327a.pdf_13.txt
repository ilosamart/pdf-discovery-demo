Are There Special Risks and Other Considerations That Policymakers Should Take 

into Account in the Current Environment? 

As I noted, my FOMC colleagues and I generally anticipate that a rather gradual 

rise in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over the next few years, conditional on 

our baseline forecasts for real activity, inflation, and other aspects of the economyâ€™s 

performance.  So far in my remarks, I have emphasized one key rationale for such a 

judgment--namely, that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is at present well below its 

historical average and is anticipated to rise only gradually over time as the various 

headwinds that have restrained the economic recovery continue to abate.  If incoming 

data support such a forecast, the federal funds rate should be normalized, but at a gradual 

pace. 

Several additional factors reinforce this conclusion, and that brings me to my third 

question:  Are there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take 

into account in the current environment?  Keeping in mind that the actual course of 

monetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, I see three 

additional considerations that are relevant.9   

The first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding 

back growth are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the 

equilibrium real federal funds rate may not, in fact, recover as much or as quickly as I 

9 In principle, the three considerations--uncertainty about the value of the equilibrium real federal funds 
rate, the asymmetric risks associated with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and the potential 
benefits of allowing the unemployment rate to temporarily undershoot its sustainable longer-run rate--
should influence both the timing of the onset of policy normalization and the subsequent pace at which that 
normalization proceeds.  And in fact, I view all three considerations as helping to explain why the FOMC 
has held the federal funds rate near zero for so long.  I also view such considerations as consistent with a 
likely increase in the target federal funds rate later this year, because such an increase would be part of a 
broader strategy for only gradually reducing accommodation over time (subject, of course, to adjustments 
in response to incoming information on real activity, inflation, and other factors).
