But economic inclusion also implies a kind of belonging and membership in the 

economy that goes beyond employment.  In the financial and regulatory world, 

“economic inclusion” refers to efforts to expand public access to, and participation in, 

mainstream financial services.  This effective inclusion in the financial marketplace 

depends upon a strong regulatory framework, active market participation, and an 

expansion in public financial literacy.  For the sake of clarity, I will call this meaning 

“financial inclusion,” and proceed on the assumption that it is indispensably important to 

effective navigation of the twists and turns of life in the American economy.  Imagine 

what it would be like, even with a job, if you had no access to banking or credit; if you 

did not understand how mortgages or credit cards work; or if you had no way to save a 

portion of your earnings.  Sadly, there are millions of Americans lingering in these 

margins.  

In my remarks today, I will share my perspective on why broad inclusion matters 

to our economic recovery, the challenges that current economic conditions present to the 

efforts of lower-income Americans to participate in the economy, and the risks we face as 

a country if we understate or misunderstand these challenges.  

Who is Being Excluded? 

Let’s first try to scope who is at risk of being economically excluded.  We start 

with the unemployed.  The latest employment report issued by the Bureau of Labor 

Statistics was bleak.1  U.S. employers in May added only 54,000 non-farm jobs, down 

from 232,000 jobs added in April.  The headline unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in 

May, representing about 13.9 million Americans out of work.
