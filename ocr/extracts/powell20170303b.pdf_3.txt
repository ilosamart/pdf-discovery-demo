 The Federal Reserve and other central banks have adopted broad public 

policy objectives to guide the development and oversight of the payments system.  

At the Fed, we have identified efficiency and safety as our most fundamental 

objectives, as set forth in our Policy on Payment System Risk.1   

An efficient payments system provides the infrastructure needed to transfer 

money in low-cost and convenient ways.  Efficient systems are innovative in 

improving the quality of services in response to changing technology and changing 

demand.  Efficient systems are also broadly accessible through means that are 

convenient for consumers, businesses, and financial institutions around the 

country.  Safe payment systems are built from proven technology and operate 

reliably and with integrity.  Safe systems address a range of well-known risks, 

including legal, operational, security, and financial risks. Information security and 

privacy have become particularly important in recent years.  Overall, the payments 

system must be innovative, while also addressing risks, supporting financial 

stability and maintaining public confidence.
