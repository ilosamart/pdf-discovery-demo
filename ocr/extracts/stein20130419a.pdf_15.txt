Perhaps just as important, a safety valve might also help to protect the integrity of 

the regulation itself, by harmonizing costs across countries and thereby reducing the 

temptation of those most hard-hit by the rules to try to chip away at them.  Without such 

a safety valve, it is possible that some countries--those with relatively small supplies of 

domestic HQLA--will find the regulation considerably more costly than others.  If so, it 

would be natural for them to lobby to dilute the rules--for example, by arguing for an 

expansion in the type of assets that can count as HQLA.  Taken too far, this sort of 

dilution would undermine the efficacy of the regulation as both a mitigator and a tax.  In 

this scenario, holding the line with what amounts to a proportional tax on liquidity 

provision would be a better outcome.17 

One situation where liquid assets can become unusually scarce is during a 

financial crisis.  Consequently, even if CLFs were not counted toward the LCR in normal 

times, it might be appropriate to count them during a crisis.  Indeed, while the LCR 

requires banks to hold sufficient liquid assets in good times to meet their outflows in a 

given stress scenario, it implicitly recognizes that if things turn out even worse than that 

scenario, central bank liquidity support will be needed.  Allowing CLFs to count toward 

the LCR in such circumstances would acknowledge the importance of access to the 

central bank, and this access could be priced accordingly. 

Finally, a price-based mechanism might also help promote a willingness of banks 

to draw down their supply of HQLA in a stress scenario.  As I noted at the outset, one 

important concern about a pure quantity-based system of regulation is that if a bank is 

held to an LCR standard of 100 percent in normal times, it may be reluctant to allow its 

                                                 
17 To be sure, it is possible that the rules could be diluted in the context of a price-based CLF mechanism as 
well, for example, through the administration of collateral-eligibility criteria or haircut requirements.
