Conclusion 

 I hope this discussion has helped you to understand what we do, how we do it, and how 

you can best follow our actions.  I urge you to pay close attention to our official 

communications, and I pledge to you that we will continue to strive to communicate as clearly as 

possible.  I would like to close with a quote from the original “Come with Me to the FOMC” 

speech by Edward Wayne: “This is your central bank.  This is your Federal Open Market 

Committee.  This is your country.  May we all hope that a kind providence will give us the 

wisdom, the judgment, the patience, the tact, the diplomacy, and the courage to do what seems 

right and best day by day.”
