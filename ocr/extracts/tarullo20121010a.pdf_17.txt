other desirable aims.  This conclusion is reinforced by other parts of Dodd-Frank, such as the 

earlier-mentioned provision permitting extraordinary measures to be imposed on a firm, but only 

if it is found to pose a grave threat to financial stability.  

Another salient point of difference is that Hart-Scott-Rodino was not enacted until 1976, 

following more than 60 years of merger analysis by the antitrust agencies and merger 

jurisprudence by the courts.  Indeed, the agencies had already published a set of merger 

guidelines in 1968.  While the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could, and 

did, begin pre-merger reviews with a well-developed analytic framework, there is no legacy of 

administrative or judicial analysis of the financial stability effects of mergers.  We literally have 

had to start from scratch.  Let me describe just a few of the conceptual and practical issues that 

have already arisen in discussions at the Board on some hypothetical situations that might arise 

in implementing the required consideration of financial stability.33 

One important issue is raised by the possibility that an acquisition may decrease the 

chances of material distress at a financial firm while simultaneously increasing the potential 

negative externality on the financial system as a whole should the firm nonetheless become 

seriously compromised.  To borrow credit risk terminology, the probability of default (PD) may 

be reduced, but the loss given default (LGD) may increase.  You can imagine this circumstance 

where, for example, an acquisition would demonstrably reduce a firm’s dependence on short-

term wholesale funding by providing more deposits or other reliable funding sources, but where 

the firm's increased size and market connections would compound the damage to counterparties, 

intermediation, and asset markets in the event of unmanageable stress.  In such a case, are risks 

to financial stability increased, unaffected on balance, or actually decreased?
