I strongly supported the Federal Reserveâ€™s recent action because I believe it will 

be helpful in strengthening the recovery.  But it is hardly a panacea.  Thus, a fiscal 

program that combines a focus on pro-growth policies in the near term with concrete 

steps to reduce longer-term budget deficits could be a valuable complement to our efforts.  

Indeed, some budget experts are exploring the idea of explicitly coupling fiscal stimulus 

in the near term, when unemployment is high and resource utilization is low, with 

specific deficit-reducing actions that take effect at scheduled future times, when output 

and employment are expected to have moved closer to their potential.  Although a plan of 

this type might be challenging to develop and implement, it could provide an effective 

means to support economic activity in the short run while moving toward fiscal 

sustainability over time. 

International Implications of U.S. Policy Choices 

Because the focus of this conference is on fiscal adjustments and the global 

economy, let me now try to place this discussion of U.S. fiscal and monetary policies into 

the current international context.  The process of long-run fiscal consolidation in the 

United States would likely entail higher national saving relative to investment, which 

should have the direct effect of restraining U.S. imports and shrinking the U.S. trade 

deficit.  More generally, by lowering interest rates, fiscal consolidation should diminish 

net capital inflows into the United States, thereby reducing the current account deficit in 

this country and current account surpluses elsewhere.  The resulting pattern of 

international debt accumulation and capital flows would be more balanced than at 

present, promoting a more sustainable pattern of growth in the global economy.  Indeed,
