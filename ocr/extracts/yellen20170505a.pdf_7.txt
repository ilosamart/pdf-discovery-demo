a well-regarded reference work.  But, while her husband progressed from instructor to 

professor at Wisconsin, Betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis.  During World 

War II, while he worked for the government in Washington and New York, Betty stayed 

in Madison, teaching math to servicemen.  When he took a job teaching in California 

after the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a given a position as 

assistant professor. 

As time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment 

prospects did change.  As women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly 

saw that they could balance work and family.  A new model of the two-income family 

emerged.10  Some women began to attend college and graduate school with the 

expectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did 

Rita Schorr-Germain, an immigrant who survived Auschwitz, graduated from Pembroke 

in 1953, and went on to teach European history while her husband also had a successful 

academic career.  In her oral history, Rita says she was encouraged by many Brown 

professors and never considered the possibility that her gender would stand in the way of 

an academic career, a shift in outlook that was becoming increasingly common in the 

1950s.  As did most women’s colleges at the time, Pembroke continued to produce 

nurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they 

married and had children.  But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated 

writers, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and, 

                                                 
10 For instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of 
the war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had 
learned that they could combine work and family were ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early 
1950s female labor force participation resumed its war-time high (Kessler-Harris, 1982, pp. 302-03).  
Moreover, evidence suggests that sons whose mothers increased their labor force participation in the wake 
of World War II had wives who were more likely to work (Fernández, Fogli, and Olivette, 2004).
