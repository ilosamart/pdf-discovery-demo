continue to come in on the low side in coming years.4  Some of the recent decline in 

inflation, although not all, reflects idiosyncratic shifts in the prices of some items, such as 

the large decline in telecommunication service prices seen earlier in the year, that are 

unlikely to be repeated.  As the green dashed line in figure 4 illustrates, if the average 

change in consumer prices each month is calculated excluding items whose price changes 

are outliers on both the high and low side, the resulting “trimmed mean” measure of 

inflation shows less of a slowdown this year.5   

Based on analyses of this sort, my colleagues and I currently think that this year’s 

low inflation is probably temporary, so we continue to anticipate that inflation is likely to 

stabilize around 2 percent over the next few years.  But our understanding of the forces 

driving inflation is imperfect, and we recognize that something more persistent may be 

responsible for the current undershooting of our longer-run objective.  Accordingly, we 

will monitor incoming data closely and stand ready to modify our views based on what 

we learn.  

Uncertainty about the Inflation Outlook 

Although we judge that inflation will most likely stabilize around 2 percent over 

the next few years, the odds that it could turn out to be noticeably different are 

considerable.  This point is illustrated by figure 5.  Here the red line indicates the median 

                                                 
4 In the simple model, inflation depends in part on lagged inflation.  As a result, an unexplained movement 
in inflation is predicted to influence inflation beyond the current quarter, but to a degree that fades over 
time.  On average, the model predicts that roughly 85 percent of any unexplained movement will have 
disappeared after four quarters. 
5 In general, price changes measured over a few months tend to be noisy, even when measured on a core or 
trimmed-mean basis.  For this reason, the FOMC usually focuses on the growth rate of PCE prices over the 
previous 12 months, which smooths through the volatility in the monthly price data.  This approach also 
sidesteps distortions in the monthly data associated with residual seasonality; these distortions are likely to 
hold down month-to-month changes in prices over the balance of the year (see Peneva, 2014).  That said, 
12-month rates of inflation will continue to be held down through early 2018 by the unusually weak 
monthly readings on price changes recorded in early 2017.
