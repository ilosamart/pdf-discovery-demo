and mathematics.  Taken together, these trends suggest that more could be done to 

increase the number of U.S. students entering scientific and engineering professions.  

At least when viewed from the perspective of a single nation, immigration is 

another path for increasing the supply of highly skilled scientists and researchers.  The 

technological leadership of the United States was and continues to be built in substantial 

part on the contributions of foreign-born scientists and engineers, both permanent 

immigrants and those staying in the country only for a time.  And, contrary to the notion 

that highly trained and talented immigrants displace native-born workers in the labor 

market, scientists and other highly trained professionals who come to the United States 

tend to enhance the productivity and employment opportunities of those already here, 

reflecting gains from interaction and cooperation and from the development of critical 

masses of researchers in technical areas.  More generally, technological progress and 

innovation around the world would be enhanced by lowering national barriers to 

international scientific cooperation and collaboration.  

Conclusion 

In the abstract, economists have identified some persuasive justifications for 

government policies to promote R&D activities, especially those related to basic 

research.  In practice, we know less than we would like about which policies work best.  

A reasonable strategy for now may be to continue to use a mix of policies to support 

R&D while taking pains to encourage diverse and even competing approaches by the 

scientists and engineers receiving support. 

We should also keep in mind that funding R&D activity is only part of what the 

government can do to foster innovation.  As I noted, ensuring a sufficient supply of
