potential.17  The median assessment of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate declined 

from 4.25 percent in 2012 to 2.90 percent in September of this year, with 60 basis points 

of that shift occurring just since September 2015 (figure 5).  The persistence of low 

inflation despite faster-than-expected reductions in unemployment has also led 

participants to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate; the 

median estimate has declined from 5.60 percent in January 2012 to 4.85 percent in 

September 2016 (figure 6). 

Taken together, these revisions explain a good part of the downward movement of 

the dots.  One way to see that is through the application of a policy rule, such as a Taylor 

rule.18  Simple policy rules, as they are sometimes called, incorporate key factors for 

monetary policy, including the natural rate of unemployment, the neutral rate of interest, 

and deviations of inflation and unemployment from their long-run values.  As they 

prepare for FOMC meetings, FOMC participants routinely see policy recommendations 

from a variety of rules, including several Taylor rule variations.  While these rules are 

useful as benchmarks, in my view they should not be excessively relied on for policy 

decisions.19

substantially higher unemployment and lower inflation than was actually realized.  For more information
