central counterparties.  Before discussing these specifics, I will begin with some brief 

observations on macroprudential tools and, in particular, the special difficulties associated with 

time-varying macroprudential policies. 

The Varieties of Macroprudential Tools  

 In mapping out the range of macroprudential policies, analysts have developed various 

taxonomies.  Common to most is the distinction between tools designed to prevent systemic risk 

from building by “leaning against the wind” and tools designed to increase the resiliency of the 

financial system should systemic risk nonetheless build and lead to broad-based stress.  While 

some tools may straddle this distinction, it seems useful as a starting point for evaluating the 

utility of different measures.  As I have explained elsewhere, I think a distinction of equal--if not 

greater--importance is between structural or “through the cycle” tools, on the one hand, and time-

varying tools, on the other.1  Structural macroprudential tools are put in place as a part of the 

ongoing regulatory structure, but they are designed specifically from a systemic, as opposed to a 

firm- or asset-specific, perspective. 

 Many proponents of macroprudential policy seem particularly attracted to time-varying 

measures for both resiliency and lean-against-wind measures.  The aim is to regulate in an 

explicitly countercyclical fashion through measures that attempt to restrain rapid, unsustainable 

increases in credit extension or asset prices--either directly or through shifts in incentives--and to 

relax those measures as economic conditions deteriorate.  One can readily understand the 

conceptual appeal of this approach, but it raises a fair number of significant issues--analytic, 

practical, institutional, and legal.  These include the reliability of measures of excess or systemic 

risk, the appropriate officials to be making macroprudential decisions, the speed with which
