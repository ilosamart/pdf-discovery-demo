innovation centers across the country to help establish channels of communication, 

including with nonbank participants with whom we may not otherwise have regular 

contact. 

 The Federal Reserve also engages in ongoing communication with other 

regulators to promote, to the greatest extent possible, consistency in approaches and 

alignment of supervisory requirements.  Exchanging ideas and discussing fintech 

innovations with other regulators is critical to understanding and vetting risks and, where 

appropriate, reaching consistent views regarding the application of laws, regulations, or 

guidance.  

Finally, we recognize the value of technical expertise.  With fintech, as with any 

other emerging financial product or service, the Federal Reserve is learning as much as 

we can to ensure that we have a robust understanding of the technologies and activities in 

which banks and other financial firms are engaging, and to inform the development of 

our policy and supervisory approaches.  To that end, the Federal Reserve Board has 

established a multidisciplinary working group that is engaged in a 360-degree analysis of 

fintech innovation.  We are bringing together the best thinking across the Federal Reserve 

System, spanning key areas of responsibility--from supervision to community 

development, from financial stability to payments--to assess the impact of technological 

development on the Federal Reserveâ€™s responsibilities.  As part of this effort, Federal 

Reserve senior officials and staff have been closely watching developments in fintech, 

evaluating its impact on financial services delivery, and assessing the policy and 

supervisory implications in this arena.
