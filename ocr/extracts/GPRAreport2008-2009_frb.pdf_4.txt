The System was created by passage of the Federal

Reserve Act (the act), which President Woodrow Wil-

son signed into law on December 23, 1913. The act

stated that the System was created “to provide for the

establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an

elastic currency, to a�ord means of rediscounting com-

mercial paper, to establish a more e�ective supervision

of banking in the United States, and for other pur-

poses.”

Soon after the creation of the Federal Reserve, it

became clear that the act had broader implications for

national economic and �nancial policy. As time has

passed, further legislation has clari�ed and supple-

mented the System’s original purposes. Key laws a�ect-

ing the Federal Reserve include the Bank Holding

Company Act of 1956 and its amendments; the Finan-

cial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement

Act of 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-

tion Improvement Act of 1991; the Gramm-Leach-

Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999; and the Check Clearing for

the 21st Century Act of 2004. In a 1977 amendment to

the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress de�ned the pri-

mary objectives of national economic policy. These

objectives include economic growth in line with the

economy’s potential to expand; a high level of employ-

ment; stable prices (that is, stability in the purchasing

power of the dollar); and moderate long-term interest

rates. Major �nancial services reform legislation, incor-

porated in the GLBA, re�ects changes in the nature of

the industry and in the economy generally. GLBA and

the changes it ushered in for the United States �nancial

services industry continues to a�ect signi�cantly the

operations and workload of the Federal Reserve.

Since the late 1960s, several federal laws were created

that were designed to protect consumers when secur-

ing credit or in making other �nancial transactions has

grown. The Congress has assigned to the Federal

Reserve the duty of implementing the provisions of

these laws to ensure that consumers receive comprehen-

sive information and fair treatment from �nancial insti-

tutions when they engage in these transactions. Con-

sumer protection laws such as the 1968 Truth in

Lending Act, the Community Reinvestment Act of

1977 (CRA), the Expedited Funds Availability Act of

1987, the Truth in Savings Act of 1991, and the Fair

and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 have

given the Federal Reserve rule-writing, compliance, and

consumer education responsibilities. As a result of the

recent �nancial crisis, the federal government is consid-

ering additional legislation designed to update the

�nancial regulatory system and increase consumer pro-

tection. Although the outcome of current legislative

e�orts is still uncertain, several of the proposals could

signi�cantly impact the Board’s organization, opera-

tions, and resource requirements.

System Role in the Government

The Federal Reserve System is considered to be an

independent central bank because its decisions do not

have to be rati�ed by the President or anyone else in the

executive branch of government. The System is, how-

ever, subject to oversight by the U.S. Congress. The

Federal Reserve must work within the framework of

the overall objectives of economic and �nancial policy

established by the government; therefore, the descrip-

tion of the System as “independent within the govern-

ment” is more accurate.

Structure of the System

Congress designed the structure of the Federal Reserve

System to give it a broad perspective on the economy

and on economic activity in all parts of the nation. It is

a federal system, composed of a central, governmental

agency—the Board of Governors—in Washington,

D.C., and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The

Board and the Reserve Banks share responsibility for

supervising and regulating certain �nancial institutions

and activities, for providing banking services to deposi-

tory institutions and the federal government, and for

ensuring that consumers receive adequate information

and fair treatment in their business with the banking

system.

A major component of the System is the Federal

Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is made up

of the members of the Board of Governors, the presi-

dent of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and

presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks, who

serve on a rotating basis. The FOMC oversees open

market operations, which is the main tool used by the

Federal Reserve to in�uence overall monetary and

credit conditions.

Board of Governors

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-

tem is a federal government agency. The Board is com-

posed of seven members, who are appointed by the

President of the United States and con�rmed by the

U.S. Senate. The full term of a Board member is 14

years, and the appointments are staggered so that one
