mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion each month, and we have maintained 

that pace of asset purchases so far this year.  In considering changes to the pace of asset 

purchases in the future, we take into account judgments about both the efficacy and 

potential costs of these purchases, including potential risks to inflation and financial 

stability, as well as the extent of progress toward our economic objectives.   

At its December meeting, the FOMC also recast its forward guidance to clarify 

how the target for the federal funds rate is expected to depend on future economic 

developments.  Specifically, we said that we anticipate that an exceptionally low funds 

rate is likely to be warranted at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 

6-1/2 percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to 

be no more than 1/2 percentage point above 2 percent, and longer-term inflation 

expectations remain well anchored.  These thresholds are intended to make monetary 

policy more transparent and predictable to the public by making more explicit our 

intention to maintain policy accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger 

recovery in the context of price stability.

actions, available research suggests that our previous asset purchases have eased financial 

conditions and provided meaningful support to the economic recovery.5

have naturally sought to lower interest rates as a means of strengthening aggregate 

demand, promoting the pace of recovery in the labor market, and keeping inflation from
