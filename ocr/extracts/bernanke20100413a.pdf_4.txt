Bryant, founder of Operation Hope; the late Jack Kemp, who served as Secretary of 

Housing and Urban Development and as congressman of western New York; and 

Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas.  It is wonderful to see so many individuals 

and organizations working toward the common goal of helping Americans make the best 

choices for their financial futures. 

Thank you again.
