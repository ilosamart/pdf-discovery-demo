And the references by Samuelson to the many topics on which 

Wicksell made important contributions should remind us that Wicksell’s 

Interest and Prices was but one of his major contributions, and that Volume II 

of his Lectures on Political Economy is about money, banking and credit. 

9. Wicksell and Inside Money.  In both his Interest and Prices and Volume II of 

his Lectures, Wicksell discusses the possibility of a pure inside money 

economy.  His conclusion is stated with his usual clarity: 

Only by completely divorcing the value of money from … its 

commodity function, by abolishing all free minting, and by 

making the minted coin or banknotes proper, or more generally 

the unit employed in the accounts of the credit institutions, both 

the medium of exchange and the measure of value, only in this 

way can the contradiction be overcome and the imperfection be 

remedied.  It is only in this way that a logically coherent credit 

system, combining both economy of monetary media and 

stability in the standard of value, becomes in any way 

conceivable.   

II. Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices (first edition, 1956; second edition, 1965)7 

In discussing Patinkin’s work, I need to mention that I was his research assistant 

when he visited MIT in about 1967-8, and that I was an admirer of his work and of his 

reputation as the founder of modern Israeli economics, and that later I became his friend, 

albeit a junior among friends.  Now I turn to his major work. 

1. The goal of MIP.  The subtitle of MIP is An Integration of Monetary and 

Value Theory.  Its goal was thus more theoretical than the goals of either of 

the Interest and Prices volumes.  The need for such an integration was based

the second edition in 1965 by Harper & Row (New York).
