requirements are complementary.  In some particulars, though, CCAR sits a bit uneasily 

alongside the ongoing capital requirements.  The most notable example is that CCAR assumes 

that a firm will continue to make its planned capital distributions during a stress period even 

though the regulatory capital rules now include a capital conservation buffer to limit such 

distributions.  Another is that, to this point, CCAR has not reflected the firm-specific capital 

surcharge we have adopted for global systemically important banks (GSIBs). 

Our second key topic was the macroprudential dimension of the stress testing and CCAR 

regimes.  One of the most important lessons of the financial crisis was that prudential regulation, 

including capital regulation, had been dominantly microprudential in nature, even for the largest 

firms.  That is, the regulation was designed and applied with a view mostly to the idiosyncratic 

risks faced by a bank in isolation, without regard to the interaction of the bank and the financial 

system as a whole.  Thus, for example, capital regulation did not take account of fire sale effects-

-the reduction in portfolio values for one bank by other banks selling certain types of assets in 

order to enhance their own solvency or to counter a reduction in funding availability.  Similarly, 

microprudential capital regulation allows a bank to meet its capital ratios by reducing lending--

that is, by reducing the denominator of its ratio--as well as by increasing capital.  If many banks 

were to follow this strategy, even creditworthy borrowers would be adversely affected, thereby 

exacerbating an economic downturn.  

Our stress testing and CCAR regimes do have some macroprudential elements, which 

have been modestly enhanced over the past few years.  By conducting the stress tests for all large 

banks at the same time under common scenarios, we can evaluate the collective losses that may 

be borne by a major part of the industry in the stress scenario.  We vary scenario design to take
