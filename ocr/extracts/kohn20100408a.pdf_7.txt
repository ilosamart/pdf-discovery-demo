housing affordability is quite favorable, in part reflecting low mortgage rates, and house prices 

appear to be stabilizing.  Still, problems persist in housing, and I anticipate a relatively subdued 

pickup in housing starts over the coming year.   

Third, households need to continue rebuilding wealth.  They became too indebted and too 

dependent on housing wealth to finance current purchases and provide for future events like the 

education of their children and their retirement.  Now they need to repay debt and save more out 

of current income.  In addition, restraints on consumer credit continue to hold down spending, 

and high unemployment and uncertainty have weighed on consumer confidence.   

Again, these constraints will fade as consumers adjust to the shocks they have been dealt.  

Indeed, the effects on spending of past reductions in wealth are receding, and household net 

worth is rising again.  And as employment continues to pick up, income will rise more rapidly 

and households will presumably become more confident about the future--and thus more willing 

to spend.  But they are unlikely to return to the spending patterns of old, and we cannot expect 

outsized gains in consumer outlays to provide an extra push to the economic expansion.     

Last, business investment spending has been depressed by a weak and uncertain sales 

outlook, tight credit conditions, and significant unused capacity.  However, signs are growing 

that confidence is returning as the outlook for sales brightens and bond spreads narrow.  

Moreover, spending on equipment and software is likely getting a boost from replacement 

demand.  Gross investment in equipment and software has fallen so low that it is not even 

covering estimated depreciation, meaning that further spending increases are needed just to 

prevent the capital stock from continuing to shrink, let alone to foster a modest expansion of the 

capital stock as the recovery proceeds.  So this sector has the potential to be a source of strength 

for the economy.
