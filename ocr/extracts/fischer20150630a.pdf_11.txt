markets and the economy in which it operates.  And it is likely that the monetary policy 

framework will change over time as the domestic economy and the international financial 

system develop. 

The exchange rate regime is a key consideration.  In recent decades, developing 

economies have experienced increasing capital mobility and financial integration into the 

global economy.  Over the longer term, this is a welcome development that will help 

meet the substantial financing needs of the private and public sectors, but greater 

financial integration and financial flows also complicate monetary policy in an 

environment in which exchange rate considerations are important--and they are generally 

very important.  These are small open economies in which external shocks are often 

large, and the excessive volatility inherent in free-floating exchange rates can be costly.  

As a consequence, many developing and emerging market countries both intervene in the 

foreign exchange markets and impose restrictions on capital inflows and outflows. 

Why not simply peg the exchange rate?  According to the impossible triad, or the 

more sophisticated version developed by Hélène Rey, the impossible duo, a pegged rate, 

combined with capital mobility, makes it difficult for monetary policy to be used 

independently to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and price stability.6  Nonetheless, 

some economies have successfully implemented pegged exchange rates.  Hong Kong and 

Francophone Africa are leading examples.   

Properly managed, some flexibility of exchange rates can help economies absorb 

external shocks, including swings in prices of commodities to which these economies are 

still heavily exposed.  Accordingly, there has been a shift toward flexible, but managed,
