On the other hand, financial stability risks are not limited to entities or activities that 

seem to replicate the kind of lending conventionally associated with commercial banks.  This is 

where the potential under-inclusiveness of the shadow banking category arises.  Here again, 

though, it is important not to leap to the conclusion that where some risks do exist, they should 

be addressed in a uniform manner.  For example, some classes of asset managers, such as bond 

funds that hold relatively illiquid assets while offering their investors the right to withdraw funds 

on very short notice, may pose redemption risks.  But intermediaries such as many conventional 

mutual funds do not pose bank-like risks, since they generally are not leveraged.  So, if further 

analysis supports the conclusion that redemption risks are real, the optimal regulatory response 

would surely not be one that treats all asset managers as quasi-banks that need to have capital 

and similar bank regulatory constraints.2 

An emphasis on actual risks can lead to the conclusion that some nonbank financial 

entities or activities do not pose material threats to financial stability at all.  Pension funds, for 

example, are surely an important form of intermediation.  If, over time, they do not have assets 

sufficient to meet their promises to plan participants, whether because they have been 

underfunded in the traditional sense or because they have lost money through ill-considered 

investments, hardship will undoubtedly follow.  If enough pension plans fell short of 

expectations, there might be macroeconomic consequences.  And if they provide short-term 

funding in order to increase returns on the assets they need to keep liquid, they might contribute 

to the risks assumed by other kinds of intermediaries.  But, in themselves, they are unlikely to 

pose financial stability risks.  Similar reasoning would apply to traditional insurance activities. 

                                                 
2 Some mutual funds may in fact use a form of synthetic leveraging that could complicate an assessment of financial 
stability implications.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 62279 (October 15, 2015), footnote 35.
