However, the benefits of this strong economy and sound financial system have not 

reached all Americans.  The aggregate statistics tend to mask important disparities by income, 

race, and geography. 

Moreover, the economy faces a number of longer-term challenges.3  While there have 

been gains in the pace of wage growth recently, wages for lower-income workers have grown 

quite slowly over the past few decades.  Productivity has picked up in recent months after several 

years of very slow growth, but it is not clear whether this is a trend that will be sustained.  An 

aging population is limiting growth in labor supply, which in turn limits potential growth.  And a 

decades-long decline in economic mobility in the United States reflects the difficulty faced by 

lower-income Americans in moving up the economic ladder.4  

The Fed’s community development function plays a key role in helping us carry out our 

broad responsibilities.  Information gathered by the community development staff ensures that 

the perspectives of individuals and communities inform the Fed’s research, policy, and actions.  

Soliciting diverse views on issues affecting the economy and financial markets improves the 

quality of our research, the fairness of our policies, and the transparency of our actions.  Raising 

awareness of emerging economic trends and risks makes regulation and supervision more 

responsive to evolving consumer financial services markets and technologies.  The Fed’s 

community development function also advances our Community Reinvestment Act
