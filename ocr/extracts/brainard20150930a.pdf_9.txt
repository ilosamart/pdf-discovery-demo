information from a wide range of sources that are not typically involved in bank 

underwriting of loans.  For example, aggregated information for small business 

underwriting may include data on online banking, accounting, bookkeeping, credit card, 

shipping, supplier, and social media.  So, while traditional banks often focus on personal 

credit scores for underwriting consumer loans and the majority of small dollar, small 

business loans, online alternative lenders may analyze a broader variety of data to 

develop different metrics to measure and price loan risk.  Currently, the largest platforms 

typically offer online or mobile applications that allow consumers and small business 

owners to easily submit information and aggregate vast amounts of data to complete loan 

applications. 

Although rates vary by platform and borrower characteristics, when taking into 

account origination fees and repayment periods, the average annual cost of borrowing,   

or APR, associated with loans and credit products offered by online alternative small 

business lenders tend to be higher than those associated with traditional bank products.14  

Reports suggest that some borrowers are willing to pay a higher price in exchange for an 

easy application process, a quick decision, and rapid availability of funds.15   

While some see online alternative lenders as a disruptive threat to traditional 

lenders, banks increasingly are finding ways to partner with online alternative lenders, 

including through loan purchases and referral agreements.  Loan purchases by 

community banks of loans originated by online alternative lenders have been focused on 

                                                 
14 For example, Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 44) note that many alternative lending platforms charge 

yields ranging from 30 to 120 percent of the loan value, depending on the size, term duration, and risk 

profile of the loan.  Several alternative online lenders advertise lower rates, but industry sources note that 

lending is rarely done at those rates.   
15  For example, see Clark (2014), Cortese (2014), Crowley (2015), and Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 46).
