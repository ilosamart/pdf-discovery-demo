The U.S. economy will need to be less driven by consumption and housing and will need 

to rely less on debt to finance spending on consumption and housing.  And exports and capital 

investment will need to play a larger role in the economy.  To some degree, this rebalancing is 

already happening.  The U.S. current account deficit fell to 3 percent of GDP last year, about half 

the size of its previous peak.  Part of this narrowing reflected a rise in household saving relative 

to disposable income.  This higher saving rate should prove reasonably durable as households 

seek to pay down debt and rebuild wealth, and no longer count on house price appreciation as a 

substitute for saving out of current income.  In contrast, the pickup in business investment as the 

economic recovery strengthens could well outpace any increase in business profits and saving, 

and part of the narrowing in the current account deficit could be reversed, absent other 

developments.    

One of the steps to achieve rebalancing must be placing U.S. fiscal policy on a more 

sustainable path.  At present, measured on a NIPA (national income and product accounts) basis, 

gross dissaving by the government sector represents about 6-3/4 percent of U.S. GDP.  While 

much of this spending in excess of tax collections represents the transitory effect of the economic 

downturn, the aging of our population will pose severe challenges in the decades to come.  And 

as we design fiscal reforms, we should look for opportunities to improve incentives for private 

saving.   

So creating the sustained growth required to address the needs of future retirees will 

almost certainly involve increases in national saving.  In a world in which the United States is no 

longer spending much more than it produces, countries that have become accustomed to running 

large current account surpluses must learn to rely less on external demand and more on their own 

domestic demand.  For these economies, the policy recommendations I discussed earlier continue
