In reviewing these experiences, it seems clear that monetary policymakers have 

perceived significant hurdles to using sizable adjustments in monetary policy to contain 

financial stability risks.  Some proponents of a larger monetary policy response to 

financial stability concerns might argue that these perceived hurdles have been 

overblown and that financial stability concerns should be elevated significantly in 

monetary policy discussions.  A more balanced assessment, in my view, would be that 

increased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions, 

but the potential cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to be 

too great to give financial stability risks a central role in monetary policy decisions, at 

least most of the time. 

If monetary policy is not to play a central role in addressing financial stability 

issues, this task must rely on macroprudential policies.  In this regard, I would note that 

here, too, policymakers abroad have made important strides, and not just those in the 

advanced economies.  Emerging market economies have in many ways been leaders in 

applying macroprudential policy tools, employing in recent years a variety of restrictions 

on real estate lending or other activities that were perceived to create vulnerabilities.10  

Although it is probably too soon to draw clear conclusions, these experiences will help 

inform our understanding of these policies and their efficacy. 

Promoting Financial Stability through a Macroprudential Approach 

If macroprudential tools are to play the primary role in the pursuit of financial 

stability, questions remain on which macroprudential tools are likely to be most effective,
