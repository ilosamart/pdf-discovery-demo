Monetary Policy Communications 
 

In recent years the FOMC has taken a number of significant steps to enhance the 

clarity of our communications about our longer-run objectives, our medium-term outlook, 

and our policy strategy.  Transparency is an essential aspect of conducting monetary 

policy in a democratic society:  The central bank is accountable to the public and hence 

needs to strive to explain its decisions as clearly as possible.  Indeed, I believe that the 

Federal Reserve qualifies as one of the most transparent central banks in the world.    

Moreover, clear communications play an integral role in facilitating the 

effectiveness of monetary policy actions.  Expectations play a critical role in the 

decisions of forward-looking households and businesses about how much to spend, work, 

hire, and invest, and their decisions are more likely to be consistent with the objectives of 

the central bank if they are based on a solid understanding of the shocks affecting the 

economy and the likely monetary policy response.  When financial market participants 

understand how a central bank is likely to react to incoming information, asset prices 

should adjust in ways that anticipate the central bank’s expected policy actions, 

enhancing the monetary policy transmission mechanism and thereby supporting the 

central bank’s attainment of its objectives.  Finally, good communication can help anchor 

the public’s long-term inflation expectations, which can, in turn, greatly improve the 

scope for monetary policy to counteract departures of resource utilization from its 

sustainable level.
