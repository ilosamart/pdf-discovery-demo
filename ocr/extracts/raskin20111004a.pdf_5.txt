promissory note, for example, lays out the terms under which the borrower will repay the 

loan, while the mortgage reflects the lender’s security interest in the property.  But there 

are also contracts between the borrower and third parties and between the lender and third 

parties.  For example, the borrower likely will enter agreements for title, flood, or private 

mortgage insurance, while the lender may enter an agreement with another institution to 

service the loan.  Add mortgage securitization to the mix, and the number of contractual 

relationships snowballs.  For a private-label securitization, a crucial contract is the 

pooling and servicing agreement, or PSA, which specifies matters such as the 

characteristics of the mortgages in the pool, how these mortgages will be serviced, and 

how the money generated from the loans will be distributed to investors.  At nearly every 

linkage of our mortgage finance system there is a contractual relationship, and at nearly 

every contractual linkage there has been legal challenge and litigation.   

For example, let’s just zero in on one such contractual relationship and examine 

how the legal structure set forth in this relationship has held up.  First, let’s look at the 

provisions that govern mortgage servicing, and second, the provisions that lay out the 

representations and warranties about the features and underwriting quality of the loans 

included in the securitization.  Both sets of provisions exist in the contract that governs 

the securitization, the PSA.  

Mortgage Servicing 

The problems in mortgage servicing have been well documented.  For example,  

the federal banking regulators found significant problems when we looked at mortgage 

servicing and foreclosure processing at 14 federally regulated mortgage servicers, which 

collectively represent more than two-thirds of all servicing volume nationally.  These
