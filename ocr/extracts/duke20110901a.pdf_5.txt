advantage of the lower rates because they have little or no equity in their homes or face 

other obstacles.   

To facilitate refinancing for borrowers who are current on their mortgages but 

whose equity has eroded as home prices have fallen, the Administrationâ€™s Home 

Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, provides streamlined refinancing for low- or 

no-equity mortgages if the borrowers meet certain qualifications and if their existing 

mortgages are already guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  So far, more than 

800,000 borrowers have refinanced their mortgages through HARP. 

One question, however, is why more borrowers have not benefited from this 

program.  We estimate that 4 million borrowers appear to meet the basic eligibility for 

HARP refinancing.1  Of course, some of these borrowers may be ineligible for reasons 

that we cannot observe, and others may be uninterested in refinancing.  However, given 

the potential savings to households, the relatively low take-up on this program warrants 

another look at the frictions that may be impeding these refinancing transactions. 

Responses to our inquiries regarding impediments to HARP refinancing have 

revealed four possible frictions: 

1. Loan-level pricing adjustments (LLPAs).  LLPAs are upfront fees that are 

added to the refinancing costs of loans that are judged to have higher risk 

characteristics, such as high loan-to-value ratios.  The fees can increase the 

cost of refinancing by thousands of dollars and thus discourage borrowers 

                                                 
1 This estimate is for borrowers who have mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that were 
originated no earlier than 2003 and no later than May 31, 2009.  The mortgages carry an interest rate on the 
first lien that is more than 75 basis points higher than the current level of mortgage rates and have loan-to-
value ratios on the first-lien mortgage that are between 80 and 125 percent.  The borrowers are current on 
their loans and have missed either no payments in the past year if guaranteed by Freddie or a maximum of 
one payment in the past year if guaranteed by Fannie.
