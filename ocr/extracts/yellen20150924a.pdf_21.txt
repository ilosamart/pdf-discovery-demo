the unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time would, by increasing resource 

utilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation.  Finally, 

albeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse some of the significant 

supply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving 

Americans’ standard of living. 33  

Consistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the 

projections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation 

gradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in 

unemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the 

longer run.  These projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected 

relationship between real activity and interest rates.  First, the real federal funds rate is 

currently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in 

line with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall 

in the absence of some tightening.  Second, participants implicitly expect that the various 

headwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby 

boosting the economy’s underlying strength.  Combined, these two judgments imply that 

the real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in 

the medium run should rise gradually over time.  This expectation, coupled with inherent 

lags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, are the 

key reasons that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate 

to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue
