intended to serve as a mechanism for limiting the build up of leverage at the security level, and 

could mitigate the risk of procyclical margin calls.   

 In August, the FSB released a proposal that would represent a first step in the direction of 

such a framework.  However the FSB’s proposal has some significant limitations.  First, with 

respect to counterparty scope, the FSB’s proposal would apply only to SFTs in which regulated 

entities provide financing to unregulated entities; the proposal would not cover SFTs between a 

regulated lender and a regulated borrower, between an unregulated lender and a regulated 

borrower, or between an unregulated lender and an unregulated borrower.  Second, the proposal 

would apply only to lending against collateral other than sovereign obligations.  And finally, 

with respect to calibration, the FSB’s proposed numerical floors are set at relatively low levels--

levels that are, for example, significantly below the haircuts that currently prevail in the tri-party 

repo market.   

 An alternative to the FSB’s proposal would be to apply a system of numerical floors to 

SFTs regardless of the identity of the parties to the transaction.  Such an approach would at least 

partially offset the incentive that will otherwise exist to move more securities financing activity 

completely into the shadows.  Regarding calibration, there are at least three conceptually 

plausible bases for setting the level of the numerical floors above the low backstop levels 

contemplated in the current FSB proposal.   

One approach would be to base the calibration of the numerical floors on current repo 

market haircuts.  These haircuts have increased significantly compared to pre-crisis levels.  

Establishing numerical floors at around current levels could prevent the return of a less prudent 

set of practices as memories of the crisis fade.  A second approach would be to set haircuts for a 

given asset class based on asset price volatility or haircut levels observed during times of stress
