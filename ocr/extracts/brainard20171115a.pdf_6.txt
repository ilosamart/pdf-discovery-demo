overall strength of Boston’s economy.4  Findings like this remind us that not all communities are 

well positioned to access the opportunities available in the economy, even those in their own 

backyard. 

Our research suggests there are things that can be done to improve the likelihood that an 

area will be a community of opportunity.  Some localities have fared better than others in this 

respect, and their successes can provide us with actionable lessons. For instance, the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Boston undertook an in-depth study of 25 medium-sized cities nationwide that 

had experienced a post-industrial decline and identified 10 that experienced an economic 

resurgence.  The study found that the critical determinant of success was the ability of leaders in 

those cities to collaborate across sectors around a long-term vision for revitalization.5  To 

encourage such collaboration, the Boston Fed has facilitated Working Cities Challenges in 

Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut that reward effective public–private collaboration 

to reach communitywide goals.  For instance, one of the winning cities, Lawrence, 

Massachusetts, set goals of increasing the income of parents with children in the Lawrence 

Public School system by 15 percent, dramatically increasing parental engagement in the schools 

and tracking the impact of these efforts on student achievement.  A cross-section of partners 

from the public, private, nonprofit, and philanthropic sectors sought to achieve this, in part, by 

embedding Family Resource Centers within the Lawrence Public Schools.  To-date, these efforts
