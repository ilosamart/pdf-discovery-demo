expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and Survey of 

Professional Forecasters, and market-based measures of inflation compensation.   

Starting with time-series models, one model that has been used by a variety of 

researchers suggests that underlying trend inflation may have moved down by perhaps as 

much as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.4 Market-based measures of inflation 

compensation provide another read on inflation expectations.  Comparing the three-year 

period ending in the second quarter of this year with the three-year period ended just 

before the financial crisis, 10-year-ahead inflation compensation based on TIPS 

(Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) yields is 3/4 percentage point lower.5  Survey-

based measures of inflation expectations are also lower.  The Michigan survey measure 

of median household expectations of inflation over the next five to 10 years suggests a 

1/4 percentage point downward shift over the most recent three-year period compared 

with the pre-crisis years, similar to the five-year, five-year forward forecast for the 

consumer price index from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.   

Why might underlying inflation expectations have moved down since the 

financial crisis?  One simple explanation may be the experience of persistently low 

inflation:  Households and firms have experienced a prolonged period of inflation below 

our objective, and that may be affecting their perception of underlying inflation.  A 

related explanation may be the greater proximity of the federal funds rate to its effective 

lower bound due to a lower neutral rate of interest.6  By constraining the amount of 

                                                 
4 Stock and Watson (2007) introduced an estimate of trend inflation that assumed time-varying volatility.  
Cecchetti and others (2017) provided a recent update of that model; their estimate of trend inflation for core 
PCE prices has been about 1-1/2 percent in the past few years, compared with readings above 2 percent in 
the 2006-08 period (see figure 4.1, p. 23). 
5 Of course, inflation compensation isnâ€™t a straight read on inflation expectations, as liquidity and term 
premiums can affect it.  Still, inflation suggests a notable downward shift in expectations.
