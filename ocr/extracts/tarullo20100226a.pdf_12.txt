better capital requirements, a horizontal approach to supervising the largest financial 

institutions, and a sophisticated macroprudential complement to traditional bank and 

bank holding company supervision, the regulatory system is unlikely to deliver on a 

promise of greater financial stability.  Similarly, legislative proposals to make a workable 

resolution mechanism and prudential regulation applicable to all systemically important 

firms are necessary to achieving the same goal.  Indeed, the resolution mechanism is 

critical to strengthening market discipline sufficiently so that it can truly take its place 

alongside rules and supervisory oversight as a strong third pillar of the financial 

regulatory system.  

Third, having made the case for extensive change, I want to add a cautionary note.  

Even as we improve and reorient regulation, we must not lose sight of the ultimate goal.  

Today we are all mindful of the economic devastation that can ensue when a financial 

system goes badly awry.  But financial stability alone is not the aim of financial 

regulation.  It is instead a stable financial system within which capital is efficiently 

directed to creditworthy consumers and businesses who need it, as well as a system that 

offers good savings and investment vehicles for individuals and organizations.   

The implications of this caution are several.  I will mention two.  One, which we 

regulators have already taken to heart, is that the effect of new capital and liquidity 

requirements on lending, and thus on economic recovery and growth, must be carefully 

taken into account.  This is why we urged--successfully, I am pleased to say--that the 

Basel Committee analyze the whole package of capital changes under consideration from 

a macroeconomic, as well as a microprudential, perspective before those changes are 

finalized.  Another implication is that it will be unnecessary to apply some regulatory
