This year’s program includes presentations by the authors of a number of excellent 

academic research papers, the unveiling of the results of a new survey of community banks 

conducted on behalf of the conference organizers, reactions by community bankers to the 

research and survey findings, and several compelling speeches.     

The primary focus of today’s agenda is research.  The response to the conference’s call 

for papers was quite impressive, and the conference research committee faced the challenging 

task of selecting the most relevant, interesting, and high-quality papers to be included in the 

program.  The authors of these papers include academics and policymakers, with backgrounds in 

law, economics, and finance.  The topics covered clearly demonstrate a desire, on the part of the 

researchers, to promote a deeper understanding of what makes community banks tick and of how 

a wide range of government policies affects the activities, profitability, and viability of 

community banks. 

The first session considers factors underlying community bank formation, behavior, and 

performance.  The first paper looks at characteristics of newly chartered banks--where they form, 

and how they fare over time.  The second paper also focuses on newly chartered banks, 

considering possible explanations for the near absence of new bank charters over the past few 

years.  Those of us at the Fed pay a great deal of attention to this type of bank formation, because 

it is the primary source of new competition in the markets in which community banks compete.  

The third paper in this session looks at how rivalry among banks affects their decisions to adopt 

new technology, and the fourth seeks to explain the persistence of low net-interest income 

among community banks in recent years.  

The second session addresses the effects, both intended and unintended, of specific 

government policies on community bank behavior.  One paper looks at how the 2006
