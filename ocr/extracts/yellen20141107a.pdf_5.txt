account for the weakness of this recovery compared with past recoveries.1  In the United 

States, fiscal policy has been much less supportive relative to previous recoveries.  For 

instance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at 

all levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the 

current recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs. 

Lessons 

 What lessons can we draw from this experience?  The first is that governments 

need to address long-term challenges and significantly improve their structural fiscal 

balances during good times so they have more fiscal space to provide stimulus when 

times turn bad.  When poor economic conditions drive policy interest rates close to the 

zero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate 

demand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates, thereby 

crowding out private demand.2  

A second lesson is that, while even if it is appropriate for fiscal policy to play a 

larger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless may face 

constraints in implementing fiscal stimulus.  This means that central banks need to be 

prepared to employ all available tools, including unconventional policies, to support 

economic growth and to reach their inflation targets.
