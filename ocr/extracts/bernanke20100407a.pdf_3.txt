this market appear to have such widespread consequences?  One important reason is that 

the subprime mortgage market was closely linked to a broader framework for credit 

provision that came to be known as the shadow banking system.  That broader 

framework, at least as it was structured during the run-up to the crisis, proved deeply 

flawed. 

The innovation underlying the shadow banking system was that it helped provide 

a wide range of borrowers indirect access to global credit markets.  For example, 

originators of subprime mortgages did not typically retain the loans they made on their 

own books.  Instead, the mortgages were packaged together in complex ways, sometimes 

with other types of loans, stamped with a seal of approval from one or more credit rating 

agencies, and sold to investors worldwide, thus--it was thought--broadly dispersing the 

underlying risks.  Credit risks were further dispersed--again, at least in theory--through 

the use of derivative financial instruments such as credit default swaps.  Importantly, 

residential mortgage markets were not the only markets caught up in the boom.  In part 

because large flows of capital into the United States drove down the returns available on 

many traditional long-term investments, such as Treasury bonds, investorsâ€™ appetite for 

alternative investments--such as loans to finance corporate mergers or commercial real 

estate projects--increased greatly in the years leading up to the crisis.  These securities 

too were packaged and sold through the shadow banking system.  

As we now know, however, neither the investors, nor the rating agencies, nor the 

regulators, nor even the firms that designed the securities fully appreciated the risks that 

those securities entailed.  Nor were the risks as widely dispersed as thought:  For 

example, many complex securities were held in off-balance-sheet vehicles financed by
