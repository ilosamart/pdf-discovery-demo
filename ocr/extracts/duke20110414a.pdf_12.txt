other sources of funding on businesses’ finances is even more difficult to determine from 

available data.   

Changes in personal wealth during the downturn were not uniform across 

households, and there were some big winners and losers.  While the households that 

disproportionately increased their wealth are more likely to start businesses, those that 

disproportionately lost wealth are less likely to do so.  In particular, the recent housing 

downturn has made it more difficult to use cash-out refinancing or home equity lending 

as a funding vehicle for small business formation.  It has also made it more difficult for 

some small business owners to fund the purchase of equipment or to cover business 

operating expenses. 

Even though our survey data suggest that only 3 to 5 percent of small business 

owners tend to rely on personal or business credit cards, the decline in bank credit card 

outstandings over most of the past two years indicates that this source of credit may still 

be quite limited.   

While balance sheet data for financial institutions are readily available, the 

relative contributions to changes in outstanding balances of new lending, paydowns, and 

write-downs and the levels of line usage are not available.  To focus on the link between 

lending and new business activity, we need measures of loan originations.  Indeed, a loan 

or lease origination is what typically generates an investment in equipment and signals 

business growth.9
