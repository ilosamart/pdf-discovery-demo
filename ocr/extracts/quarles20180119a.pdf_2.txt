It is a pleasure to be here with you at the American Bar Association banking law 

committee annual meeting.1  Thank you to Meg Tahyar, my longtime friend and colleague, for 

inviting me to speak today.  These are still the early days of my tenure at the Federal 

Reserve--last weekend marked my first three months as the first Vice Chairman for 

Supervision.  In those three months, people have had a lot of questions for me, but the most 

frequently asked question has been:  Whatâ€™s next?  Today I hope to give you some insights into 

how I am approaching the work of evaluating and improving the post-crisis regulatory regime 

and to outline some specific areas that are emerging as areas of focus early in my tenure.  Some 

of those areas are closer to being ready for action, while others are topics that I believe are 

important and would benefit from more attention and discussion.  My hope is that you will come 

away from our time together with a better sense of my preliminary thinking for charting a course 

forward on financial regulation.  

Efficiency, Transparency, and Simplicity of Regulation 

Before I delve into specifics, let me say a few words about the principles that are guiding 

my approach to evaluating changes to the current regime.  The body of post-crisis financial 

regulation is broad in scope, complicated in detail, and extraordinarily ambitious in its 

objectives.  Core aspects of that project have resulted in critical gains to our financial system: 

higher and better quality capital, an innovative stress testing regime, new liquidity regulation, 

and improvements in the resolvability of large firms.  We undoubtedly have a stronger and more 

resilient financial system due in significant part to the gains from those core reforms.  These 

achievements are consistent with the responsibility of the Federal Reserve to be a steward of a 

                                                            
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System.
