bank’s perceived creditworthiness leads to a decline in its dollar-denominated lending 

relative to its euro-denominated lending.  So, two principal effects of the dollar funding 

shock are intimately connected:  a widening of the so-called CIP basis in the FX swap 

market, and a reduction in credit supply to firms that borrow in dollars.4 

To test the model’s implications, my coauthors and I focused on events in the 

second half of 2011, when the credit quality of a number of large euro-area banks became 

a concern and U.S. prime money market funds sharply reduced their lending to those 

banks.  In a span of four months, the exposure of money funds to euro-area banks fell by 

half, from about $400 billion in May to about $200 billion in September.5  Coincident 

with this contraction in dollar funding, the CIP basis widened in the direction predicted 

by our model, increasing the cost of obtaining synthetic dollars via the FX swap market.   

We used data from the international syndicated loan market to test the model’s 

predictions about the reaction of lending to this type of funding stress.  We found that 

dollar-denominated lending by euro-area banks fell relative to their euro-denominated 

lending, while this result did not hold for U.S. banks.  We also found that, even holding 

fixed the identity of the borrowing firm, a syndicate formed to make a dollar-

denominated loan during this period was less likely to include euro-area banks, while the 

same was not true of syndicates making euro-denominated loans.  Finally, euro-area 

banks that relied most on funding from U.S. money market funds also cut back most 

sharply on their dollar-denominated lending.6   

                                                 
4 The CIP basis is typically measured as the difference between the interest rate differential embedded in 
FX swap prices and the differential implied by foreign- and domestic-currency Libor rates.
