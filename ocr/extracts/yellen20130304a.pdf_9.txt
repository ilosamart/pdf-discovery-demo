I mentioned that the FOMC’s new forward guidance offers considerable insight 

into the Committee’s likely reaction function, but I should note that the guidance it 

provides is not complete.  For example, the Committee has not specified exactly how it

  This language is consistent with 

optimal policy prescriptions that call for lower-for-longer considerations to pertain to the 

path of the federal funds rate both before and after liftoff.  

In addition, the guidance specifies thresholds for possible action, not triggers that 

will necessarily prompt an increase in the federal funds rate.  The FOMC statement 

therefore notes that “in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance 

of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including 

additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and 

inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.”

unemployment rate has declined below 6-1/2 percent if inflation is running and expected 

to continue at a rate significantly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  

Alternatively, the Committee might judge that the unemployment rate significantly
