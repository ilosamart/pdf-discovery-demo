This principle has been codified in Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which 

requires special regulations applicable with increasing stringency to large banking 

organizations.

  Under this authority, the Federal Reserve will impose capital surcharges 

on the eight large U.S. banking organizations identified in the Basel Committee 

agreement for additional capital requirements on banking organizations of global 

systemic importance.  The size of a surcharge will vary depending on the relative 

systemic importance of the bank.  Other rules to be applied under Section 165—including 

counterparty credit risk limits, stress testing, and the quantitative short-term liquidity 

requirements included in the internationally-negotiated Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

(LCR)—will apply only to large institutions, in some cases with stricter standards for 

firms of greatest systemic importance.     

An important, related reform in Dodd-Frank was the creation of orderly 

liquidation authority, under which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can impose 

losses on a failed systemic institution’s shareholders and creditors and replace its 

management, while avoiding runs and preserving the operations of the sound, functioning 

parts of the firm.  This authority gives the government a real alternative to the Hobson’s 

choice of bailout or disorderly bankruptcy that authorities faced in 2008.  Similar 

resolution mechanisms are under development in other countries, and international 

consultations are underway to plan for cooperative efforts to resolve multinational 

financial firms.

 The operative statutory language reads as follows:  “In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial 

stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing 

activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board of Governors shall . . . establish 

prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank 

holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than [$50 billion] that . . . are more 

stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to [other regulated firms] and . . . increase in 

stringency.”
