Challenges Arising from the Growth Slowdown  

I begin by reviewing recent global economic developments and the questions they 

raise about where we are likely to go from here.  There has been a steady, if 

unspectacular, climb in global growth since the financial crisis.  For example, based on 

recent IMF data from the World Economic Outlook, which uses purchasing power parity 

weights, world growth averaged 3 percent during the first four years of the recovery and 

as of July was expected to be 3.4 percent this year.2  The IMF expects global growth to 

reach 4 percent next year--a rate about equal to its estimate for long-run growth.  This 

global average reflects a forecast of steady improvement in the performance of output in 

the advanced economies where growth averaged less than 1 percent during the initial 

phase of the recovery to an expected 2-1/2 percent by 2015.  In contrast, the recovery in 

the emerging market economies started strong but has since fallen off, in part, as fiscal 

policy stimulus has been pared back.  

But--and this is no small “but”--the global recovery has been disappointing.  With 

few exceptions, growth in the advanced economies has underperformed expectations of 

growth as economies exited from recession.  Year after year we have had to explain from 

mid-year on why the global growth rate has been lower than predicted as little as two 

quarters back.  Indeed, research done by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve comparing 

previous cases of severe recessions suggests that, even conditional on the depth and 

duration of the Great Recession and its association with a banking and financial crisis, the
