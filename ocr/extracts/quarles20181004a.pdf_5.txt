Another significant aspect of diversity among community banks is the type of 

market served--urban versus rural.  These two types of areas differ in many respects, 

including the age distribution of the population, the share of the population with a college 

degree, homeownership rates, poverty rates, and the share of the population with internet 

access.5  And while the national population has been growing over the past 20 to 

30 years, many rural areas have experienced population declines, and the share of the 

population living in rural areas has been falling.6  Furthermore, since 2008, most job 

growth in the United States has occurred in urban areas.7  

Given these differing circumstances, it is not surprising that community banks 

operating in rural and urban areas tend to face different challenges.  For example, the 

number of competitors faced by a banking organization tends to be larger in urban 

banking markets than in rural markets, while hiring and retaining high-quality employees 

can be more difficult in rural areas.  And some observers have expressed concern about 

the implications of bank consolidation over the past two or three decades for access to 

banking services in rural areas while also wondering about the future viability of rural 

community banks.
