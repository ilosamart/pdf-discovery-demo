Reaching Consumers 

There’s a saying among communications professionals that “the medium is the 

message.”  In that vein, I believe that how we deliver financial education has a significant 

impact on how effective the lessons will be.  New technologies present exciting new 

opportunities to deliver timely financial lessons.  Mobile payments and financial services 

are growing at a rapid pace.4  Financial management “apps” for smart phones abound, 

making it possible for consumers to get just-in-time information.  The developments in 

mobile financial services have only begun to exploit the potential of this technology to 

provide tools for consumer financial decisionmaking.  I will be particularly interested to 

see how technology can be used to better serve lower-income populations who may be 

more focused on stretching their paychecks to meet monthly expenses than on investing.  

If you can have an app to track what you eat, certainly you could use one to track what 

you spend. 

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Financial Education  

Until now, we have had a limited understanding of which methods work best with 

respect to financial education.  For years, one of the correlates of higher scores on the 

JumpStart Financial Literacy test was participation in the Stock Market Game, an 

enrichment program offered in many schools.  The FINRA Education Foundation 

sponsored a study to determine just what it was about the game that made a difference.

is projected to continue at about 20 percent per year over the next four years.  Javelin Strategy and
