lower-income families, expressly for the purpose of reducing inequality in resources for 

children.   

A major reason the United States is different is that we are one of the few 

advanced nations that funds primary and secondary public education mainly through 

subnational taxation.  Half of U.S. public school funding comes from local property 

taxes, a much higher share than in other advanced countries, and thus the inequalities in 

housing wealth and income I have described enhance the ability of more-affluent school 

districts to spend more on public schools.  Some states have acted to equalize spending to 

some extent in recent years, but there is still significant variation among and within 

states.  Even after adjusting for regional differences in costs and student needs, there is 

wide variation in public school funding in the United States.28 

Spending is not the only determinant of outcomes in public education.  Research 

shows that higher-quality teachers raise the educational attainment and the future 

earnings of students.29  Better-quality teachers can help equalize some of the 

disadvantages in opportunity faced by students from lower-income households, but here, 

too, there are forces that work against raising teacher quality for these students.  Research 

shows that, for a variety of reasons, including inequality in teacher pay, the best teachers 

tend to migrate to and concentrate in schools in higher-income areas.30  Even within
