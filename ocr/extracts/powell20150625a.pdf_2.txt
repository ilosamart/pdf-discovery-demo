Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.  I especially want to thank 

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George for her leadership in the 

initiative that has brought us all together here today to discuss improvements to the U.S. 

payments system.  We have a diverse group of professionals participating in this 

conference, from industry, academia, and government.  It takes all of us, working 

together, to maintain and enhance a safe and secure payment system. 

The payment system touches our daily lives, whether it’s a consumer paying a 

bill, a company deciding to upgrade its point-of-sale terminals, a technology startup 

developing a new peer-to-peer payment app, or the government issuing tax refunds. 

Americans make more than 120 billion noncash payments each year.1  But it’s only when 

something goes wrong, like a data breach at a major retailer or bank, that the typical end 

user takes notice of the payments process.  

As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve plays many roles in 

the payment system, including payment system operator, supervisor of financial 

institutions and systemically important financial market utilities, regulator, researcher, 

and catalyst for improvement.  Most of you are aware of our current efforts to improve 

the speed, efficiency, and security of our payment system.  I’d like to discuss that project 

for a few minutes, and then talk about four things that we should all be doing to enhance 

payment security. 

For some years, members of the public have told us with increasing frequency and 

intensity that they see the United States falling behind other nations in the speed and
