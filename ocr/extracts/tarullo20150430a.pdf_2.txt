 On numerous occasions over the last year, I have discussed the importance of 

differentiating prudential regulation and supervision based on the varying nature of the risks 

posed by different groups of banks.1  This differentiation needs to be explicit both in the analytic 

foundations of our prudential system and in the application of that system to banking 

organizations.   

At an analytic level, we need to be clear that prudential aims vary with the risks posed by 

diverse groups of banks.  To take an obvious example, the risks to the entire financial system that 

would arise from the failure of a very large, universal bank call for different prudential objectives 

from those suitable for a $200 million community bank.  At the level of application, we need to 

tailor prudential regulations and supervisory practices with an eye both to those varying 

objectives and to the characteristics of differing groups of banks. 

This morning I would like to revisit, and develop a bit more, the concept of regulatory 

and supervisory “tiering” as it pertains to community banks.  First, I will lay some analytic 

foundations by identifying what I believe to be the most salient characteristics of community 

banks for determining suitable regulatory objectives and prudential policies.  Second, I will turn 

to the implementation of those objectives by explaining how we have tried in practice to shape 

supervisory policies appropriately.  Third, I will touch on the implications of those objectives for 

some regulatory issues, including capital requirements.
