institutions, and also by providing liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in key 

credit markets.5   

In addition, the worldwide scope of the crisis called for concerted international 

action.  Because of the global nature of dollar funding markets, the Fed authorized dollar 

liquidity swap lines with major central banks, beginning in December 2007.  In October 

2008, central bankers coordinated reductions in policy rates and the Group of Seven 

agreed to use all available tools to prevent the failure of systemically important financial 

institutions.6  The next month, the Group of Twenty announced a broad common 

strategy, including fiscal expansion. 

These steps likely prevented a second Great Depression, but they were not 

sufficient to avoid a severe global contraction.     

In the United States, with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound by the 

end of 2008, the FOMC judged that it could not provide much additional accommodation 

via its conventional tool--reducing the federal funds rate.7  Instead, the FOMC used two 

unconventional tools: large-scale asset purchases and enhanced forward guidance.  To 

varying extents, foreign central banks have also been using these tools.   

5 In our role as lender of last resort, we worked closely with the Treasury Department and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  For example, to stem the run on money market funds, the Treasury 
provided a temporary guarantee and the Fed created a backstop liquidity program.  In addition, the FDIC 
established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to guarantee certain unsecured liabilities of 
depository institutions and some bank holding companies. 
6 On October 8, 2008, the Federal Reserve and five other major central banks jointly announced a reduction 
in policy interest rates.  See Bank of Canada and others (2008). 
7 A handful of central banks in Europe have recently set certain policy rates below zero.  Specifically, the 
Danmarks Nationalbank, the European Central Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank 
have set negative policy rates.  In the United States, when the Federal Reserve sought to provide more 
accommodation despite the federal funds rate being, essentially, zero, we chose not to use negative rates, 
judging at the time that the small additional support for aggregate demand was not worth the accompanying 
risks to U.S. money markets and the intermediation of credit.
