integrate the forward-looking stress test results into each institution’s ongoing capital 

requirements.   

Some observers contend that current capital requirements are too onerous and are 

choking off credit.  But the evidence suggests otherwise:  U.S. bank lending has been healthy 

over recent years and profits are strong.  By any measure, U.S. banks appear very competitive 

relative to their international peers.  In that regard, the current level of capital is a sign of 

strength.  While there is a natural tendency to question the value of capital buffers when times 

are good, the severe costs associated with not having enough capital to absorb losses become all 

too evident in a downturn.  By the time losses are rising, it is generally too late to start building 

buffers, which became all too clear with devastating consequences in some countries during the 

last crisis.   

I support efforts to identify improvements that make regulations less burdensome.  But it 

is vital to be prudent regarding any material changes to the core capital and liquidity framework, 

and not lose sight of the need to safeguard financial resilience through the cycle.  Prudence 

would argue for waiting until we have tested how the new framework performs through a full 

cycle before we make judgments about its performance.  At this point in the cycle, it is 

premature to revisit the calibration of core capital and liquidity requirements for the large 

banking institutions.4

evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An Empirical Economic Assessment of the 
Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US (PDF),” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-034
