The responses to the panics of 1907 and 2008 also provide instructive 

comparisons.  In both cases, the provision of liquidity in the early stages was crucial.  In 

1907 the United States had no central bank, so the availability of liquidity depended on 

the discretion of firms and private individuals, like Morgan.  In the more recent crisis, the 

Federal Reserve fulfilled the role of liquidity provider, consistent with the classic 

prescriptions of Walter Bagehot.6  The Fed lent not only to banks, but, seeking to stem 

the panic in wholesale funding markets, it also extended its lender-of-last-resort facilities 

to support nonbank institutions, such as investment banks and money market funds, and 

key financial markets, such as those for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. 

In both episodes, though, liquidity provision was only the first step.  Full 

stabilization requires the restoration of public confidence.  Three basic tools for restoring 

confidence are temporary public or private guarantees, measures to strengthen financial 

institutions’ balance sheets, and public disclosure of the conditions of financial firms.  At 

least to some extent, Morgan and the New York Clearinghouse used these tools in 1907, 

giving assistance to troubled firms and providing assurances to the public about the 

conditions of individual banks.  All three tools were used extensively in the recent crisis:  

In the United States, guarantees included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 

(FDIC) guarantees of bank debt, the Treasury Department’s guarantee of money market 

funds, and the private guarantees offered by stronger firms that acquired weaker ones.  

Public and private capital injections strengthened bank balance sheets.  Finally, the bank 

stress tests that the Federal Reserve led in the spring of 2009 and the publication of the 

stress-test findings helped restore confidence in the U.S. banking system.  Collectively,
