dimension to our supervision by helping us evaluate the aggregate capital position of the 

largest banking firms as well as their individual capital levels. 

 The Federal Reserve--like all bureaucracies--has an unfortunate tendency to 

create acronyms, so, before I proceed further, let me explain our acronyms, in addition to 

SCAP, for stress tests.  With the SCAP now in the past, we currently have two distinct 

but related supervisory programs that rely on stress testing.  The first is the stress testing 

required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which we have shortened to the acronym DFAST--the 

Dodd-Frank Act stress tests.  The purpose of DFAST is to quantitatively assess how bank 

capital levels would fare in stressful economic and financial scenarios.  The second 

program, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, combines 

the quantitative results from the stress tests with more-qualitative assessments of the 

capital planning processes used by banks.  For example, under CCAR, supervisors 

evaluate the ability of banks to model losses for various categories of loans and securities 

and to estimate earnings and capital requirements in alternative scenarios.  We recently 

completed the first set of DFAST stress tests and disclosed the results, followed a week 

later by the disclosure of our CCAR findings, which included our qualitative assessments 

of firms’ capital planning.

The State of the Banking System, Then and Now  

 To provide context for the developments in the banking system since the 

introduction of the SCAP in early 2009, it’s worth briefly recalling the economic
