much less reason to intervene if it believes that the financial system is resilient enough to 

handle a significant failure without excessive disruption. 

Third, because government oversight alone will never be sufficient to anticipate 

all risks, increasing market discipline is an essential piece of any strategy for combating 

too-big-to-fail.  To create real market discipline for the largest firms, market participants 

must be convinced that if one of these firms is unable to meet its obligations, its 

shareholders, creditors, and counterparties will not be protected from losses by 

government action.  To make such a threat credible, we need a new legal framework that 

will allow the government to wind down a failing, systemically critical firm without 

doing serious damage to the broader financial system.  In other words, we need an 

alternative for resolving failing firms that is neither a disorderly bankruptcy nor a bailout. 

A prototype for such a framework already exists--namely, the rules set forth in the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 for dealing with a 

failing bank.  As the FDIC is now able to do with a failing bank, the government should, 

under appropriate circumstances and with appropriate safeguards, be able to seize and 

wind down a failing, systemically critical firm.  Institutions should not be permitted to 

receive assistance while open, but authorities must be empowered to sell, merge, or break

system as a whole.  The resolution agency should not be allowed to protect shareholders 

and other capital providers and it should have clear authority to impose losses on debt 

holders, override contracts, and replace managers and directors as appropriate.  If, in the 

end, funds must be injected to resolve a systemically critical institution safely, the
