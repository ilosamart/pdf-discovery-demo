States, including approximately 100 examiners from Ohio.  In addition, in May more than 1,400 

bankers and state bank commissioners from across the country participated in an “Ask the Fed” 

conference call to discuss CRE-related issues, such as credit workouts and troubled debt 

restructurings.  The session was an effective way of helping clarify the guidance and helped us 

hear more about concerns people in the industry have.       

The Federal Reserve is also working to develop better ways to measure the effectiveness 

of the lending guidance we have issued.  After all, if these sorts of issuances don’t work, we need 

to know that so we can figure out a better way to get our messages across.  Before issuing the 

CRE guidance last year, Federal Reserve staff surveyed examiners to gain a better understanding 

of the banks’ workout practices.  That information is serving as a baseline for assessing the 

impact of the supervisory guidance.  We also are asking examiners to capture, where possible, 

information on troubled debt restructurings and other types of loan workouts and dispositions as 

part of the ongoing examination process.  In addition, we are exploring the feasibility of more-

formal statistical approaches for measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of the CRE workout 

and restructuring policy statement.   

Despite all we are doing, I still hear the concern that the pendulum has swung and that 

examiners are being too strict on banks, a development some say is curtailing loans.  I hear this 

often when I talk to members of the Congress, who say bankers in their district tell them that 

examiners from all the banking agencies are making it too tough for them to make loans.  So I 

will say the same thing here that I say to people on Capitol Hill--if you believe Federal Reserve 

examination policies are improperly impeding the flow of credit, we want to know about it.  I 

can’t stress this enough:  We want to know if you believe that our supervisory actions are 

unnecessarily impeding the flow of credit.
