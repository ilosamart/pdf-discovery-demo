reduce the pace of purchases “in the next few meetings” if it saw continued improvement 

in the labor market that it was confident would be sustained.5  Yields rose even more 

sharply after the June FOMC meeting, when, during his postmeeting press conference, 

Chairman Bernanke noted that if the economy evolved as expected, the FOMC 

anticipated reducing the pace of purchases in the latter part of 2013 and halting purchases 

altogether by the middle of 2014.6         

Information gathering is an important part of managing market expectations--for 

the simple reason that you do not know if you are going to surprise the market unless you 

have a good estimate of what the market is expecting.  A remarkable feature of the taper 

tantrum is that it was a surprise that should not have been a surprise, at least from the 

perspective of the information the FOMC had at the time.  

In assessing market expectations for policy, the FOMC reviews a variety of 

market indicators and also draws heavily on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 

Survey of Primary Dealers, whose respondents are the market makers in government 

securities and the New York Fed’s trading counterparties.  This survey, conducted about 

one week prior to each FOMC meeting, gauges primary dealers’ expectations about the 

economy, monetary policy, and financial market developments.7   

In the June 2013 primary dealer survey, the median expectation was for tapering 

to start in December 2013, with purchases ending in June 2014, a path not significantly 

different from that laid out by Chairman Bernanke in his postmeeting press conference.

7 The responses to the survey are received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Markets Group 
typically by the penultimate Monday before the FOMC meeting.  At the time of the taper tantrum, there 
were 21 primary dealer participants.  Currently, there are 23 primary dealers.  Past survey results can be
