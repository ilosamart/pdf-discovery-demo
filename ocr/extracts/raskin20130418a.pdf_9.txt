Inequality and the Great Recession 

Given these developments, when house prices fell, household finances were 

struck a devastating blow.  The resulting fallout magnified this initial shock, ushering in 

the Great Recession.  Let me lay out this argument in more detail. 

As I mentioned earlier, low- to middle-income families held a disproportionate 

share of their assets in housing prior to the financial crisis and hence were very exposed 

to what was a historic decline in house prices.  And so, while total household net worth 

fell 15 percent in real terms between 2007 and 2010, median net worth fell almost 40 

percent.  This difference reflects the amplified effect that housing had on wealth changes 

in the middle of the wealth distribution.  

The unexpected drop in house prices on its own reduced both households’ wealth 

and their access to credit, likely leading them to pull back their spending.  In particular, 

underwater borrowers and heavily indebted households were left with little collateral, 

which limited their access to additional credit and their ability to refinance at lower 

interest rates.  Indeed, some studies have shown that spending has declined more for 

indebted households.8   

Compounding the effect of falling house prices on household wealth and credit 

was the fact that these low- to middle-income households are also composed of some of
