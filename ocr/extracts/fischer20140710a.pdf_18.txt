years.31  Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2003) examined the impact of bank 

concentration, bank regulation, and national institutions on the likelihood of a country 

suffering a financial crisis and concluded that countries are less likely to suffer a financial 

crisis if they have (1) a more concentrated banking system, (2) fewer entry barriers and 

activity restrictions on bank activity, and (3) better-developed institutions that encourage 

competition throughout the economy.32  The combination of the first finding with the 

other two appears paradoxical, but the key barrier to competition that was absent in 

Canada was the prohibition of nationwide branch banking, a factor emphasized by 

Calomiris and Haber in their discussion of the Canadian case.33  In addition, I put serious 

weight on another explanation offered in private conversation by a veteran of the 

international central banking community, “Those Canadian banks aren’t very 

adventurous,” which I take to be a compliment.34 

Why is the TBTF phenomenon so central to the debate on reform of the financial 

system?  It cannot be because financial institutions never fail.  Some do, for example, 

Lehman Brothers and the Washington Mutual failed in the Great Recession.  Other banks 

were merged out of existence, often at very low prices, with the FDIC managing the 

resolution process.  Banks in the United Kingdom and in Europe failed during the Great 

Recession.  It cannot be because equity-holders never lose in bank crises.  It could be

list.  This is evidence that the regulatory structure also matters.

34 This comment pushes one in the direction of supporting the Volcker rule and other restrictions on 
commercial banks undertaking capital market activities.  One criticism of the Volcker rule is that two of the 
key failed institutions in the recent financial crisis--Bear-Stearns and Lehman Brothers--were not banks.  It 
is hard to see why this fact suggests that permitting commercial banks to combine their activities with those 
of investment banks would be a stabilizing factor for the banking system.
