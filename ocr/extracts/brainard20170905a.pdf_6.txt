utilization is the primary explanation.3  Similarly, a 12-quarter average is typically long 

enough that temporary factors should not be the dominant concern. 

One key factor that may have played a role in the past three years is the decline in 

import prices, reflecting the dollar’s surge, especially in 2015.  By contrast, in the 

2004-07 period, non-oil import prices increased at roughly a 2 percent annual rate and 

had a more neutral effect on inflation.  Nonetheless, while the decline in non-oil import 

prices likely accounts for some of the weakness in inflation over the past few years, these 

prices have begun rising again in the past year at a time when inflation remains relatively 

low.   

So if import prices, resource utilization, and transitory factors together do not 

provide a complete account, why has inflation been so much lower in the past few years 

than it was previously?  In many of the models economists use to analyze inflation, a key 

feature is “underlying,” or trend, inflation, which is believed to anchor the rate of 

inflation over a fairly long horizon.  Underlying inflation can be thought of as the slow-

moving trend that exerts a strong pull on wage and price setting and is often viewed as 

related to some notion of longer-run inflation expectations.   

There is no single highly reliable measure of that underlying trend or the closely 

associated notion of longer-run inflation expectations.  Nonetheless, a variety of 

measures suggest underlying trend inflation may currently be lower than it was before the 

crisis, contributing to the ongoing shortfall of inflation from our objective.  That 

conclusion is suggested by estimates based on time-series models, longer-run 

                                                 
3 According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the natural rate of unemployment was about the 
same in the two periods:  It was 4.8 percent in the 2014-17 period and 5.0 percent a decade earlier.
