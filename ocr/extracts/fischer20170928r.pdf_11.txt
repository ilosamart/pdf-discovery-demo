expanding their balance sheets through large-scale purchases of longer-dated securities to 

put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and set in motion movements in 

asset prices and borrowing costs that would stimulate spending by households and 

businesses.  It is widely, though not universally, recognized that these asset purchases 

helped contain the economic downturns in the United Kingdom and the United States and 

underpinned the subsequent recovery in each country.  This experience raises the 

question of whether the balance sheet will continue to be a routine tool of monetary 

policy once interest rates normalize.25 The FOMC has indicated its preference that, 

barring large adverse shocks to the economy, adjustments to the federal funds rate will be 

the main means of altering the stance of monetary policy.26

Changing Perspectives on the Lender of Last Resort

The second section concerns the role of the lender of last resort.  The financial 

crisis and recession confirmed the value of central bank tools that affect the financial 

system, beyond those most associated with monetary policy.  One of these tools is the 

discount window or lender-of-last-resort function.  As of the mid-2000s, the posture of 

the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve toward the lender-of-last-resort function

reflected the principles enunciated by Bagehot and the long absence of a severe financial 

crisis:  The discount rate stood above the key policy rate by a fixed amount; the discount 

importantly in monetary policy until the mid-1980s, reflecting attempts by the authorities to influence the 
term structure of interest rates or to control the stock of money or the volume of liquidity (see Fischer 
(1987), Goodhart (1999), and Batini and Nelson (2005)).  A difference between most of these earlier 
operations and those in the modern era is that recent years’ asset purchases have usually involved an 
expansion of the central bank’s overall balance sheet.
