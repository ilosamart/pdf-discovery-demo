Good morning.  The title of this session is “Prescriptions for Housing Recovery.” 

I wish I had such a prescription.  Problems related to mortgage debt and mortgage 

underwriting played a central role in the recent financial crisis and resulted in a massive 

dislocation in the housing market.  It is difficult to think of a single prescription that by 

itself will generate a sustainable recovery in housing.  At the same time, I do see policies 

that I believe will help reduce the shadow inventory of houses in the foreclosure pipeline.  

I also see policy actions that could be taken to improve credit availability for potential 

homebuyers and, in turn, demand for houses.  I have talked at length in previous speeches 

about actions that I believe would help alleviate the effects of excess foreclosure 

inventory on the housing market.1  In my remarks today I will mention those possible 

actions only briefly and then focus primarily on policy issues that I expect will shape the 

availability of credit for home purchases in the future. 

Before I begin my remarks, I want to emphasize that the views that I will present 

today are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) or the Board of Governors. 

State of Housing Markets 

Let me start with a review of the fallout from the boom and subsequent bust in 

housing.  It was only six years ago that the housing market was booming:  The 

homeownership rate stood at 69 percent, and aggregate housing wealth reached nearly 

$23 trillion.  Since then, however, the housing market has struggled, to say the least:  The
