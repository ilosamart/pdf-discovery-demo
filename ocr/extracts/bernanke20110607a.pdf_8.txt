low and stable inflation remains credible.  Thus, the Federal Reserve will continue to 

closely monitor the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations and will take 

whatever actions are necessary to keep inflation well controlled. 

Commodity Prices 

 As I noted earlier, the rise in commodity prices has directly increased the rate of 

inflation while also adversely affecting consumer confidence and consumer spending.  

Let’s look at these price increases in closer detail. 

The basic facts are familiar.  Oil prices have risen significantly, with the spot 

price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil near $100 per barrel as of the end of last 

week, up nearly 40 percent from a year ago.  Proportionally, prices of corn and wheat 

have risen even more, roughly doubling over the past year.  And prices of industrial 

metals have increased notably as well, with aluminum and copper prices up about one-

third over the past 12 months.  When the price of any product moves sharply, the 

economist’s first instinct is to look for changes in the supply of or demand for that 

product.  And indeed, the recent increase in commodity prices appears largely to be the 

result of the same factors that drove commodity prices higher throughout much of the 

past decade:  strong gains in global demand that have not been met with commensurate 

increases in supply.  

From 2002 to 2008, a period of sustained increases in commodity prices, world 

economic activity registered its fastest pace of expansion in decades, rising at an average 

rate of about 4-1/2 percent per year.  This impressive performance was led by the 

emerging and developing economies, where real activity expanded at a remarkable 7
