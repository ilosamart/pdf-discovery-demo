educational attainment and a larger proportion of older workers in the workforce today 

relative to the workforce of past decades.5  If u* is lower than historical estimates 

suggest, this would imply that, even with today’s historically low unemployment rate, the 

labor market would not be as tight—and inflationary pressures would not be as strong—

as one would expect, based on historical estimates of u*.  Indeed, I believe the range of 

plausible estimates for u* may extend to 4 percent or even below.   

I also note that the decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been 

accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their 

prime working years.6  It has also been accompanied since 2014 by a rise in labor’s share 

of national income.  As I have documented previously, in the past several U.S. business 

cycles, labor’s share has risen as those expansions proceeded because workers command 

higher wages in a stronger labor market; notably, in those cycles, the rise in labor’s share 

did not pass through to faster price inflation.7  The previously mentioned increase in 

prime-age labor force participation has provided employers with a source of additional 

labor input and has been one factor restraining inflationary pressures.  Notwithstanding 

these recent gains, prime-age participation rates remain somewhat below levels achieved 

in the 1990s and may still have some more room to run.  If so, then potential output could 

be higher than many current estimates suggest.  

Over the past few years, we have also seen evidence of a pickup in U.S. 

productivity growth, albeit from the very depressed average pace that prevailed 

                                                 
5 More-educated workers and older workers both have lower structural unemployment rates, at least 
historically; see Aaronson, Hu, Seifoddini, and Sullivan (2015).

Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for 
prime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018, pp. 8–10).
