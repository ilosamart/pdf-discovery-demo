Thank you.  It is a pleasure to be here.  This morning I will first briefly review the 

U.S. and global economic outlook.  I will then discuss the basic rationale underlying the 

Federal Reserve’s recent policy decisions and place these actions in an international

The headwinds include the effects of deleveraging by households, the still-weak U.S.

unemployment rate, at 7.8 percent, is well above what we judge to be its long-run normal

and financial strains have pushed Europe back into recession.  Japan’s economy is

with deflation and persistent weak demand.  And in the emerging market economies, the
