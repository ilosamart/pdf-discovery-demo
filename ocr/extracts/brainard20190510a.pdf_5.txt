than before the recession, even after factoring in the decline in stock prices at the end of 

last year.  In contrast, the wealth of middle-income families still has not returned to its 

pre-crisis level, and lower-income families have a wealth shortfall of 16 percent.8   

The gap is also large in absolute terms.  At the end of 2018, the average middle-

income household had wealth of about $340,000, while the average households in the top 

10 percent of the income distribution had wealth of about $4.5 million (figure 3).  The 

average wealth of the top income decile is now 13 times higher than that of the middle-

income group, while it was 7 times higher in 1989.  

Given these developments, it is no surprise that the share of wealth held by 

middle-income households has declined over the past three decades.  However, the extent 

of the decline is nonetheless striking:  Today the 30 percent of households between the 

40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution hold 13 percent of all wealth, down 

from 19 percent over the past three decades (figure 4).  The top 10 percent of households 

by income now own 57 percent of all wealthâ€”up from 47 percent 30 years ago.  The 10 

percent of households with the highest income hold more of the national wealth than the 

remaining 90 percent of households combined.  

Do Middle-Income Households Have Middle-Class Economic Security? 

Having sketched out the contours of the overall level and growth of wealth owned 

by middle-income households, let us now turn to economic security.  Basic financial 

security is one important marker of the middle class.  Wealth is an important source of 

economic resilience for households, allowing them to handle unexpected expenses as 

                                                 
8 Wealth in figure 2 is indexed to the first quarter of 2007, which is between the peak in house prices in 
2006 and the start of the Great Recession at the end of 2007.  As figure 2 shows, household wealth began 
declining before the recession officially began.
