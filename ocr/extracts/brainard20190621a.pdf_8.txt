from you.  How is your community experiencing today’s economy?  Is everyone who 

wants a job able to get one?  Can they get the necessary training?  Are businesses finding 

it relatively easy to hire the workers they need?  How does price inflation and wage 

growth affect you?  What about the availability and cost of credit—whether to start or 

expand a small business, buy a car to get to work, or invest in owning a home or getting a 

degree?  And are there ways we can better communicate with you?  I look forward to 

hearing your views on these and other questions.
