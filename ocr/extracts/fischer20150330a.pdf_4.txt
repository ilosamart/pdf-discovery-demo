by the ABCP vehicles withdrew funding starting in the late summer of 2007.  The 

volume of assets in the vehicles was large, about $700 billion, and after the run, the 

ability of the financial system to fund credit through many types of asset-backed 

securities became constrained.3  The runs on ABCP also put considerable pressure on the 

banking system because of the liquidity backstops that banks had provided to the 

vehicles.4   

Some of the guarantors also insured mortgage-backed securities, and when doubts 

arose about the ability of the guarantors to pay claims on mortgage-backed securities, the 

credibility of their guarantees of municipal securities was also reduced.  Municipalities 

then found it more difficult and costly to issue debt even though their activities were 

otherwise unrelated to subprime mortgages.5   

Next, the crisis spread to nonbank finance companies, which made a substantial 

fraction of consumer loans in the United States--for example, auto and credit card loans.  

As the crisis went on, the ability of such lenders to fund themselves through 

securitizations and commercial paper became increasingly constrained.  For a period after 

the failure of Lehman Brothers, many investors were unwilling to buy commercial paper 

and asset-backed securities at any price, and, as a result, finance companies faced tight

Collapse of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market,” Journal of Finance, vol. 68 (June), pp. 815-48. 
4 Runs on the repurchase agreement (repo) funding of asset-backed securities were also troublesome for 
both banks and nonbanks.  See Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick (2012), “Securitized Banking and the 
Run on Repo,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 104 (June), pp. 425-51. 
5 Moreover, state and municipal borrowers had been issuing long-term debt while paying short-term 
interest rates by using structures such as variable-rate demand notes (VRDNs), which gave holders the right 
to put the securities back to liquidity providers on short notice.  When the money market fund investors that 
held VRDNs became worried about their ability to get their money out at short notice, the volume of 
putbacks rose, and these developments ultimately led to increased payment obligations for some 
municipalities.
