financial behavior affects their traditional credit scores, alternative credit scoring methods 

present new challenges that could raise questions of fairness and transparency.  It may 

not always be readily apparent to consumers, or even to regulators, what specific 

information is utilized by certain alternative credit scoring systems, how such use impacts 

a consumer’s ability to secure a loan or its pricing, and what behavioral changes 

consumers might take to improve their credit access and pricing. 

Similarly, fintech innovations that rely on data sharing may create security, 

privacy, and data-ownership risks, even as they provide increased convenience to 

consumers.  Recent examples of large-scale fraud and cybersecurity breaches have 

illustrated the significance of possible security risks.  As the data sets that financial 

institutions utilize expand beyond traditional consumer credit histories, data privacy will 

become a growing concern, as will data ownership and whether or not the consumer has 

any say over how these data are used and shared or whether he or she can review it for 

accuracy.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently issued a request for 

information to better understand the benefits and risks associated with new financial services 

that rely on access to consumer financial accounts and account-related information.9 

In addition to the risks I have outlined that are specific to new financial 

technologies, firms also must control for risks that have always been present, even in 

brick-and-mortar financial institutions.  For example, risks around the BSA and Anti-

Money Laundering rules cut across all segments and all portfolios.  Similarly, firms must

“consumers should be able to use their financial records and account information and securely share access 
in an electronic format.”
