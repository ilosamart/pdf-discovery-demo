The European rescue package announced in late October indicates a strong 

commitment by European leaders to address the issues stemming from sovereign debt.  

The package was a step in the right direction, but many details of the plan were unclear, 

and the measures would require rigorous implementation.  The continued rise in 

sovereign debt spreads for some countries, more generalized market volatility, and 

political turmoil that we have seen in recent days speak to the need for forceful action to 

stabilize the situation.   

We, along with other supervisors, are actively engaged in ensuring that U.S. 

financial institutions are appropriately managing their credit and liquidity risks.  To limit 

the spread of funding stresses, we have in place dollar liquidity swap lines with a number 

of foreign central banks.  We are monitoring European developments very closely, and 

we will continue to do all that we can to mitigate the consequence of any adverse 

developments abroad on the U.S. financial system.     

Conclusion 

The Federal Reserve and other U.S. financial regulators have accomplished a 

great deal since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted a little more than a year ago.  We have 

put into practice an institutional framework for undertaking a macroprudential approach 

to supervision and regulation, and we have implemented processes for identifying and 

responding to sources of systemic risk.  However, much remains to be done, including 

further work to close the gaps in the data coverage of the financial sector and to deepen 

our understanding of the effectiveness of different policy tools.  The bottom line is that 

developing an effective macroprudential policy is critical to preserving financial stability
