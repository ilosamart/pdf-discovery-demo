It is a pleasure to participate in this commemorative conference on the occasion of 

the 60th anniversary of the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA).

Europe--that cooperation and coordination among central banks around the world may be 

necessary at critical junctures to achieve these domestic objectives.

will start with the monetary policy responses of the Federal Reserve and other central 

banks during the financial crisis.  I will then discuss the efforts that the Federal Reserve 

has made, often in cooperation with other central banks and international partners, to help 

enhance financial stability.  Finally, I will focus on the challenges facing Latin American
