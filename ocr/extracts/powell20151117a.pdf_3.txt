central clearing can bring to an OTC market.  The tangled and highly opaque 

picture of a purely bilateral market is replaced by the neat hub-and-spoke network 

in which a CCP is buyer to every seller, and seller to every buyer, allowing netting 

and greater transparency for participants and regulators alike.  Of course, reality is 

not so elegant, as Figure 2 illustrates.  There are multiple CCPs, even within 

product classes, and major dealers act as clearing members across a broad network 

of CCPs.  Clearing members also perform a range of services for CCPs, including 

custody, liquidity provision, and settlement.  By design, increased central clearing 

will concentrate risks in CCPs; it is essential that, as these risks accumulate, the 

CCPs build up their ability to manage them.  It is often noted that CCPs made it 

through the recent financial crisis without direct government assistance.  But many 

of their major clearing members did receive such assistance.  CCPs must now plan 

for a world in which these large firms will fail and be resolved without government 

support.  

Recognizing the importance of strengthening our financial market 

infrastructure, the regulatory community has clarified and significantly raised 

expectations for CCPs and all key financial market infrastructures (FMIs or market 

infrastructures).  These heightened expectations are set forth in the Principles for 

Financial Market Infrastructures (or PFMIs), which were adopted in 2012 by the 

Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International
