In the years since the start of the global financial crisis, an enormous amount of 

effort has gone into ensuring that we have a robust financial system that promotes 

responsible risk taking and an efficient allocation of resources.  But despite these efforts, 

financial stability cannot be taken for granted, for financial decisions that benefit the 

people who make them can create systemic risk and harm society as a whole.  Further, 

the phenomenon familiar from macroeconomics--and for that matter from life--of 

decisions that result in short-run happiness and long-run grief is visible also in the area of 

financial stability.  For example, excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding, 

which may reward risk takers whose bets pay off, may also increase the risk of fire sales 

and contagion, creating a fragile financial situation.  The disruption in credit 

intermediation that typically accompanies such episodes can have lasting negative 

consequences for the real economy and welfare--some of which we are still seeing today.  

The Federal Reserveâ€™s financial stability responsibilities therefore strongly complement 

its dual-mandate objectives of achieving price stability and full employment.   

Today I will review the monitoring framework we have implemented at the 

Federal Reserve, before providing an assessment of current U.S. financial stability 

conditions.  I will conclude by arguing that while significant progress has been made in 

recent years toward making the financial system more stable and resilient, we should not 

ever be complacent.1  We still lack sufficient information to understand some parts of the 

shadow banking system, and risks sometimes evolve outside the scope of prudential 

regulation, with potentially negative implications for financial stability.  And sometimes
