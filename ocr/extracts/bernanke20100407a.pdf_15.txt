Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some 

combination of the above.  These choices are difficult, and it always seems easier to put 

them off--until the day they cannot be put off any more.  But unless we as a nation 

demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility, in the longer run we will have 

neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth. 

Today the economy continues to operate well below its potential, which implies 

that a sharp near-term reduction in our fiscal deficit is probably neither practical nor 

advisable.  However, nothing prevents us from beginning now to develop a credible 

plan for meeting our long-run fiscal challenges.  Indeed, a credible plan that 

demonstrated a commitment to achieving long-run fiscal sustainability could lead to 

lower interest rates and more rapid growth in the near term. 

Our economic challenges, both near term and longer term, are daunting indeed.  

Nonetheless, I remain optimistic that they can be met.  History has demonstrated time 

and again the inherent resilience and recuperative powers of the American economy.  

Our country’s competitive, market-based system, its flexible capital and labor markets, 

its tradition of entrepreneurship, and its knack for innovation have ensured that the 

nation’s economy has surmounted difficult challenges in the past.  I do not doubt that 

we can do so once again.
