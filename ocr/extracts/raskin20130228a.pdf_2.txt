Good afternoon.  I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for inviting me to 

join you for today’s 2013 banking outlook discussion.  There are a number of interesting and 

very relevant topics on your agenda, most of which are rightly focused on the financial and 

regulatory environment.  I would like to share some thoughts this afternoon on a broader topic, 

however, that may be due for a refreshed look:  the relevance of a bank’s reputation.  

Let’s start in an elementary way in constructing a concept of reputation: We know that 

reputation is not entirely a moral trait.  We understand that there is a distinction between 

character and reputation.  When we say that someone shows good character, we are usually 

referring to something at the core of their being or personality.  On the other hand, when we refer 

to a person’s reputation, we recognize that reputation is our perception of the person, that it is 

externally derived and not necessarily intrinsic to that individual.  In other words, we understand 

that a person may not have complete control over the perception that has been created.  

Reputation, through no fault of one’s own, can be tarnished.  In the same way, one’s reputation 

can be golden, even though nothing was done to earn it.  But like the notion of character, 

reputation can be earned and it can be a type of stored value for when challenges to one’s own 

reputation come later.

character, and they operate financial institutions with sterling reputations that reflect that basic 

character.  At the same time, there are bankers who, regardless of their personal character, 

manage financial institutions with reputations that have been tarnished.  Their banks’ reputations 

could have been tarnished by almost anything, but likely most tarnish is attributable to the 

subprime mortgage meltdown and the ensuing financial crisis that cost the economy trillions of
