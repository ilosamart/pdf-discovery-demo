Turning to price stability, the other goal of our dual mandate, we have seen little 

progress toward inflation moving back to our target of 2 percent.  The 12-month change 

in headline personal consumption expenditures prices is now close to zero--though that 

very low level of inflation is temporary, in large part reflecting the large declines in 

energy prices around the turn of 2015.  The stronger dollar is also weighing on U.S. 

inflation by reducing the prices we pay for our imported goods and services.  Core 

inflation is running at 1-1/4 percent and will likely remain lower than we would like in 

the months ahead as the exchange rate effects pass through.  Over the medium term, the 

FOMC expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market tightens 

and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices wane; indeed, energy 

prices appear to have stabilized. 

U.S. monetary policy 

Based on our reading of economic conditions, the FOMC decided at its June 17 

meeting to leave the federal funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent.  Importantly, our 

June statement included no time-based guidance about the timing of liftoff of the policy 

rate from zero, emphasizing, instead, conditions that need to be satisfied before the 

federal funds rate target range is adjusted.  The Committee will assess progress--both 

realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 

inflation.  Of course, because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, we should 

not wait until we have reached our objectives to begin adjusting policy.  It goes without 

saying that we are also mindful of the risks of tightening policy prematurely.   

We anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal 

funds rate when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and are
