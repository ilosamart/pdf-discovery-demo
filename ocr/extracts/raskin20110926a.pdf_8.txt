Committee currently strives for as low an unemployment rate as possible, consistent with 

price stability.  In our most recent projections, Committee participants estimated that the 

longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment is around 5 to 6 percent--well below the 

current unemployment rate of 9.1 percent. 

Since December 2008, the FOMC has been providing conditional forward 

guidance about the likely path of the target federal funds rate.  From March 2009 through 

June 2011, the Committee’s forward guidance indicated that exceptionally low levels of 

the federal funds rate were likely to be warranted “for an extended period.”  In August, 

we decided to be more specific about the timing, and our two most recent meeting 

statements have indicated that “economic conditions--including low rates of resource 

utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant 

exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”

Forward guidance can provide monetary accommodation by leading investors to 

expect a longer period of low interest rates.  As I noted earlier, a downward shift in the 

expected path of the federal funds rate is associated with reduced longer-term interest 

rates and generates a significant boost to consumer and business spending.  Simulations 

of the FRB/US model and other evidence suggest that forward guidance can be a potent 

tool of monetary policy.
