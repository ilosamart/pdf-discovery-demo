that failure occurring, would approximately equal the impact of the failure of a large bank 

holding company that is not a G-SIB, discounted by the somewhat higher probability of its 

failure.10 

As I explained recently, we will soon consider adopting a “stress capital buffer” to 

integrate the post-crisis capital regime with our supervisory stress test.11  In this approach, each 

firm would have a buffer requirement derived from our annual stress test, taking the place of the 

existing buffer requirement, which is the same for all firms.  This change would make the capital 

regime more risk-sensitive by using firm-specific information on risks drawn from the stress test. 

Using the supervisory stress test to guide a risk-sensitive capital regime seems far preferable to 

reliance on a bank’s internal models, which have proven problematic as a basis for risk-based 

capital requirements under Basel II.12 

The progressive implementation of this capital regime has substantially increased the 

resiliency of the largest banks.  Although there can be reasonable differences over just how to 

compute minimum requirements, the post-crisis regime differs from pre-crisis days precisely 

because there is now a well thought through rationale for those much higher minimum 

requirements.  Because of this regime, banks subject to the annual supervisory stress test have to 

this point more than doubled their high-quality capital, while shedding many of their riskiest 

assets and activities.   

                                                           
10 The reason why the non-G-SIB’s probability of failure is higher is because its capital ratio requirement is lower 
without a surcharge.  For an explanation of this “expected impact” methodology, see Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2015), “Calibrating the G-SIB Surcharge,” white paper (Washington:  Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, July 20).
