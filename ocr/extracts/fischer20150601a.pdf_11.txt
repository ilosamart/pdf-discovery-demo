This is a good point at which to turn to the regulation and supervision of the financial 

system. 

Lesson T5:  Regulation and supervision of the financial system.11  The natural and 

sensible reaction to the problem that the central bank and the government face when the 

dark clouds of a massive financial crisis appear on the horizon, is to make two sets of 

decisions.  The first relates to its immediate actions and the short run, where the goal 

should be to intervene in a way that prevents the massive crisis, at minimum future cost 

to the economy and the society.  The second is for the longer run, to rebuild the financial 

system in such a way that the probability of having to confront such a situation again is 

reduced to a very low level.  Hence regulations should be strengthened, essentially as 

they have been recently, through the activities of governments, legislators, and regulators 

in most countries.  In the case of the United States, most of the important changes have 

been introduced though the Dodd-Frank Act, and they have been supplemented by 

decisions of the regulators and the supervisors. 


We are now at a difficult point.  Regulations have been strengthened and the bankersâ€™ 

backlash is both evident and making headway.  Of course, there should be feedback from 

the regulated to the regulators, and the regulated have the right to appeal to their 

legislators.  But often when bankers complain about regulations, they give the impression 

that financial crises are now a thing of the past, and furthermore in many cases, that they 

played no role in the previous crisis.
