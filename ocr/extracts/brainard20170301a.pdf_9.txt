possible with a shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for 

significant reductions if economic conditions deteriorate.4   

Even so, recognizing that the median of the Committee projections places the 

long-run value of the federal funds rate around 3 percent--a very low level by historical 

standards--some could judge normalization to be well under way before too long.  Thus, 

monetary policy too may be approaching a transition. 

Once the short-term rate is comfortably distant from its effective lower bound, 

there are broadly two types of policy strategies that could be contemplated.  Many central 

banks around the world may contemplate similar choices in the coming years, while the 

Bank of Japan has already grappled with these issues in the past.5  One type of 

“complementarity” strategy might actively deploy the balance sheet as an independent 

second tool, complementary to the short-term rate.  Under this strategy, both tools would 

be actively used to help achieve the Committee’s goals.  This strategy would seek to take 

advantage of the ways in which the balance sheet might affect certain aspects of the 

economy or financial markets differently than the short-term rate.  Any differences in 

effects might derive from the fact that the balance sheet more directly, though not 

necessarily more precisely, affects term premiums on longer-term securities, while the 

short-term rate more directly affects money-market rates.   

                                                 
4 The Bank of England has stated that it is unlikely that it will reduce the size of its balance sheet until the 
Bank Rate has reached a level of around 2 percent; see Bank of England (2015), Inflation Report (London:  
BOE, November), p. 34,

5 In 2006, the Bank of Japan reduced the size of its balance sheet by allowing short-term security holdings 
to run off and without relying on asset sales; see Kazuo Ueda (2010), “The Bank of Japan’s Experience 
with Non-Traditional Monetary Policy,” paper presented at “Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation
