What is more difficult to determine is whether some portion of the increase in 

disability rates, retirements, and school enrollments since the Great Recession reflects 

cyclical forces.  While structural factors have clearly and importantly affected each of 

these three trends, some portion of the decline in labor force participation resulting from 

these trends could be related to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might 

reverse in a stronger labor market.9  Disability applications and educational enrollments 

typically are affected by cyclical factors, and existing evidence suggests that the elevated 

levels of both may partly reflect perceptions of poor job prospects.10  Moreover, the rapid 

pace of retirements over the past few years might reflect some degree of pull-forward of 

future retirements in the face of a weak labor market.  If so, retirements might contribute
