At this point, some financial institutions may have become nearly insolvent. And 

this, coupled with their increased reliance on potentially unstable short-term funding, 

could make them more vulnerable to sudden losses of public confidence. 

 Such a loss of confidence, in turn, makes it impossible for affected institutions to 

roll over existing debts or extend new credit, and may force deleveraging that requires 

selling illiquid assets quickly and cheaply in asset fire sales, resulting in further declines 

in asset prices. Such developments further threaten the solvency of financial institutions 

and intensify credit contraction, depriving households and businesses of financing. A loss 

of confidence that is institution-specific could spread, causing other institutions to 

experience their own heightened solvency risks, liquidity problems, and need to de-lever 

through asset sales.  

Something like what Iâ€™ve just described happened during and after the recent 

housing boom and bust. Home prices rose dramatically for a decade, and then plunged 

more than 30 percent, throwing the financial system into chaos, severely contracting 

credit, and triggering the most severe recession in modern memory. We are still living 

with the consequences. 

In short, there are common features to asset bubbles. All asset bubbles implicate 

different segments and participants in financial transactions--lenders, borrowers, and 

even participants that are connected by virtue of the benefits they derive from the 

appreciation in the value of the asset in question. The linkages transcend banks. Bubbles 

are characterized by increased leverage among the various types of lending institutions 

and by increased maturity transformation on and off the balance sheets of various lenders. 

Illiquid loans are funded increasingly by unstable short-term funding. At the same time,
