from their peaks--mostly on account of weaker expected global demand.  There has been, 

however, some modest improvement across some markets in the most recent weeks. 

As I noted, a moderate cyclical recovery characterizes the last several quarters in 

the United States.  But while the recovery is proceeding, investors remain uncertain about 

its trajectory.  Financial market participants are still searching--perhaps better 

characterized as lurching--for a new equilibrium. 

The economy’s path depends in part on whether a new market and public policy 

equilibrium is established to keep the financial repair process on track.  If volatility in 

financial markets persists at elevated levels, the expected pickup of business fixed 

investment may disappoint.  Business leaders in the United States may react to the latest 

in a long series of shocks by postponing investments in capital and labor alike.  In that 

way, massive excess cash balances might not be a source of strength, but a reminder of 

caution. 

If, however, volatility levels across asset markets abate--indicating that the 

financial repair process is continuing--the economic recovery should continue apace.  

Businesses and consumers would then be better positioned to convert the recovery into a 

more durable expansion. 

An Updated Crisis Response Manual 

Given recent U.S. experience in responding to the financial crisis, allow me to 

offer for consideration some ideas to inform the policy response going forward.  You can 

judge for yourselves whether policymakers--at home or abroad--will be receptive to these 

ideas.
