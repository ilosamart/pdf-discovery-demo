Age and Census Tract Characteristics of Individuals

in the Credit Record Sample


AGE 

Credit records include information that can be used to determine the age of the individual. The 
sample data indicate that older individuals are much more likely to opt out of receiving 
prescreened mail solicitations for credit or insurance than younger persons. About 10 percent of 
those age 55 and older have opted out, compared with 3 percent of individuals under the age of 
25 (table B.1). Younger individuals may be more likely to need credit in the future and for this 
reason less inclined to limit the number of credit offers they receive in the mail. It is also likely 
that younger individuals have received fewer prescreened solicitations and may be less aware of 
the opt-out option. 

URBAN, SUBURBAN, OR RURAL RESIDENCE 

The Bureau of the Census categorizes all areas of the country according to three levels, or 
degrees, of urbanization: urban, suburban, and rural. (Urban and suburban areas constitute 
metropolitan areas as defined by the Office of Management and Budget; rural areas constitute 
nonmetropolitan areas.) The sample data indicate that individuals residing in the suburbs are 
most likely to opt out, and those in rural areas are least likely to do so. 

RELATIVE INCOME OF CENSUS TRACT 

The sample data also include state, county, and census tract indicators for the individuals in the 
sample. For this analysis each census tract was placed into one of four relative income categories 
by comparing the median family income of the census tract to the median family income of the 
broader area in which it is located (incomes were as of the 2000 decennial census).42 For a census 
tract in a metropolitan (that is, urban or suburban) area, the comparison is to the median family 
income of the metropolitan area in which the census tract is located; for each rural census tract, 
the comparison is to the median family income of the nonmetropolitan portion of its state (table 
B.1). 

Individuals residing in lower-income areas (incomes less than 80 percent of the broader area 
median) have the lowest incidence of opting out (2.6 percent), while those in the highest-income 
areas (incomes 120 percent or more of the broader area medians) have the greatest incidence of 
opting out (9.5 percent). These patterns are consistent with differences in the use of credit by the 
residents of these areas; residents of higher-income areas, for example, have more credit 
accounts, on average, than residents of lower-income areas (data not shown in tables). As noted 

42 The four income categories correspond to the income groups used to measure the records of banking 
institutions in complying with the Community Reinvestment Act.
