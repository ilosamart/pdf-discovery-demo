Stress-testing techniques can also be used in more-focused assessments of the 

banking sector’s vulnerability to specific risks not captured in the main scenario, such as 

liquidity risk or interest rate risk.  Like comprehensive stress tests, such focused exercises 

are an important element of our supervision of SIFIs.  For example, supervisors are 

collecting detailed data on liquidity that help them compare firms’ susceptibilities to 

various types of funding stresses and to evaluate firms’ strategies for managing their 

liquidity.  Supervisors also are working with firms to assess how profitability and capital 

would fare under various stressful interest rate scenarios. 

Federal Reserve staff members supplement supervisory and stress-test 

information with other measures.  For example, though supervisors have long appreciated 

the value of market-based indicators in evaluating the conditions of systemically 

important firms (or, indeed, any publicly traded firm), our monitoring program uses 

market information to a much greater degree than in the past.  Thus, in addition to 

standard indicators--such as stock prices and the prices of credit default swaps, which 

capture market views about individual firms--we use market-based measures of systemic 

stability derived from recent research.  These measures use correlations of asset prices to 

capture the market’s perception of a given firm’s potential to destabilize the financial 

system at a time when the broader financial markets are stressed; other measures estimate 

the vulnerability of a given firm to disturbances emanating from elsewhere in the 

system.

  The further development of market-based measures of systemic vulnerabilities 

and systemic risk is a lively area of research.

 For example, conditional value at risk provides an estimate of the systemic importance of a firm at a 

moment in time, based on how the firm’s equity value and broader equity values co-vary when overall 

conditions are very adverse; see Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2008; revised September
