requirements, we could reduce the frequency and burden of such requirements, perhaps 

by requiring more-targeted resolution plans. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion, I believe we have a unique opportunity to further tailor our 

supervision and regulation framework for large banks in a manner that allows us to be 

more risk-sensitive while still meeting our core goals of promoting safety and soundness 

and enhancing financial stability.  

The recent legislation requires the Board to tailor its framework of supervision 

and regulation of large firms in a manner that continues to recognize size as one risk 

factor, but also more holistically incorporates other risk categories.  In implementing this 

legislation, we should consider tailoring regulation further to take into account large 

banksâ€™ complexity and interconnectedness. 

Of course, the details of how we implement a tailored framework will be subject 

to debate, and you can expect the Federal Reserve to be highly engaged in the public 

feedback process.  Implementing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and 

Consumer Protection Act is a high priority for the Board, and we look forward to hearing 

the range of views as we make progress.
