and speculative-grade corporate bonds (the red solid line).  Prior to the financial crisis, 

the cost of trading corporate bonds was low--on average, bid-ask spreads were about 

1 percent of the price of the bond for investment-grade bonds and about 2 percent for 

speculative-grade bonds.  This measure of trading costs skyrocketed during the financial 

crisis but has returned to the range seen in the few years prior to the crisis.  Alternative 

measures of trading costs, such as price impact measures, which attempt to capture the 

effect of transactions on market prices, follow a similar pattern.   

Transaction costs seem to suggest liquidity has improved.  One caveat, however, 

is that measures of aggregate transaction costs in the corporate bond market may 

underestimate embedded liquidity costs.  In preliminary work, Choi and Huh suggest that 

transactions in which dealers act simply as brokers, rather than as intermediaries that hold 

assets on their balance sheets, could reflect price concessions that dealers make to entice 

counterparties into the other side of a trade so that the dealers will not need to hold the 

traded assets.10  Price concessions, in turn, lower traditional measures of trading costs, 

making trading seem inexpensive, when in reality these concessions are fees the dealers 

pay to some investors for providing liquidity.  Moreover, as dealer inventories have 

declined over the past few years, this downward distortion to aggregate trading cost 

measures may have increased.  To address this problem, Choi and Huh try to isolate 

transactions in which corporate bond investors are looking for liquidity (in other words, 

are looking to trade) and then construct measures of transaction costs for only such 

trades.  The paperâ€™s results are preliminary but appear to suggest transaction costs have 

increased somewhat in recent years.
