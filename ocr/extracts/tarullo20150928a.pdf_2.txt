Strengthening the quantity and quality of capital held by banks has been a central element 

of post-financial crisis regulatory reform.  Yet, as the topic of this conference reminds us, the 

crisis also exposed weaknesses in other financial intermediaries that carried systemic 

implications.  In the United States, when Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed, they were so-

called freestanding investment banks, not subject even to the inadequate pre-crisis regulatory 

regime for bank holding companies.  The stress at American International Group (AIG), an 

insurance company, and the vulnerability of money market funds to destabilizing runs 

contributed to a profound deepening of the crisis.  Hence the theme for this session of the 

conference: In light of this recent history and, more generally, of the steady growth of nonbank 

financial intermediaries, to what degree should they be subject to the capital regulations 

developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and applied to bank holding 

companies in the United States and to all commercial and investment banks in Europe? 

 At first glance, the answer to this question might seem intuitively obvious.  After all, the 

risk of loss associated with a particular corporate loan or mortgage-backed security or, indeed, 

any other asset does not vary just because its legal owner is an insurance company or mutual 

fund, rather than a bank.  Yet we all know that regulatory capital requirements sometimes do 

vary with the nature of the firm.  And I suspect that most people in this room believe there are 

good reasons why they should vary under at least some circumstances.   

In my remarks this morning, I will explain how the identification of those circumstances 

should proceed--by looking not at the asset side of a financial intermediary’s balance sheet, but 

at the liability side.  The scope and nature of a firm’s liabilities provide the justifications for 

capital requirements regulation.  Differences in liabilities can, accordingly, sometimes warrant 

different capital requirements for portfolios of similar assets across firms.  At the risk of packing
