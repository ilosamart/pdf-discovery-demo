Among students of central banking, the Great Recession will be remembered in 

part for the monetary policy innovation it prompted.  Since 2008, we have seen several 

episodes of extreme financial conditions in major economies.  In many countries, 

monetary policy has shouldered a large share of the policy response.  Debt-deleveraging 

dynamics and disinflationary pressures have confronted policymakers in several 

economies with the classic challenge of providing accommodation when constrained by 

the zero lower bound.  In contrast to the Great Depression, a number of central banks 

have found the “courage to act,” which has led to important policy innovation.  While it 

will take many years for rigorous research to distill the lessons from this period, I will 

offer a few preliminary observations.1 

The Effectiveness of Unconventional Monetary Policy 

For much of the period since 2008, many economies, including the United States, 

the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the euro area, and Japan, have been at or near the zero 

lower bound.  Many economies have experienced depressed aggregate demand and large 

and persistent gaps between output and potential, which have led to significant reductions 

in the level of policy rates in order to achieve full employment and target inflation.  

Moreover, the neutral level of short-term risk-free rates looks to be much lower now in 

many countries than it had been previously.  A lower neutral rate raises the likelihood 

that the requisite monetary accommodation when using conventional tools alone implies 

setting the nominal policy rate below zero.  With constraints on moving nominal interest
