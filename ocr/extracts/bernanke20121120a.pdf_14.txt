Monetary Policy 

Let me now turn briefly to monetary policy. 

Monetary policy can do little to reverse the effects that the financial crisis may 

have had on the economy’s productive potential.  However, it has been able to provide an 

important offset to the headwinds that have slowed the cyclical recovery.  As you know, 

the Federal Reserve took strong easing measures during the financial crisis and recession, 

cutting its target for the federal funds rate--the traditional tool of monetary policy--to 

nearly zero by the end of 2008.  Since that time, we have provided additional 

accommodation through two nontraditional policy tools aimed at putting downward 

pressure on longer-term interest rates:  asset purchases that reduce the supply of longer-

term securities outstanding in the market, and communication about the future path of 

monetary policy. 

Most recently, after the September FOMC meeting, we announced that the 

Federal Reserve would purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 

and continue with the program to extend the maturity of our Treasury holdings.10  These 

additional asset purchases should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates 

and make broader financial conditions more accommodative.11  Moreover, our purchases

Statement,” press release, September 13,

11 One way in which our asset purchases affect the economy is through the so-called portfolio balance 
channel.  Because different classes of financial assets are not perfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios, 
changes in the supplies of various assets available to private investors may affect the prices and yields of 
those assets.  Thus, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury securities, for example, should raise the 
prices and lower the yields of those securities; moreover, as investors rebalance their portfolios by 
replacing the Treasury securities sold to the Federal Reserve with other assets, the prices of those other 
assets should rise and their yields decline as well.  An increase in our asset purchases may also act as a 
signal that we intend to pursue a persistently more accommodative policy stance than previously thought, 
thereby lowering investors’ expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate and putting additional 
downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.
