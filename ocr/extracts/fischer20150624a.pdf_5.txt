and to respond as new modeling techniques are developed or as firm activities and risk 

concentrations evolve over time.  For example, forecasting how a particular bank’s revenue may 

respond to a severe macroeconomic recession can be challenging, and we continue to seek ways 

to enhance our ability to do so. 

Supervisory stress testing models and methodologies have to evolve over time in order to 

better capture salient emerging risks to financial firms and the system as a whole.  However, the 

framework cannot simply be expanded to include more and more aspects of reality.  For 

example, incorporating feedback from financial system distress to the real economy is a complex 

and difficult modelling challenge.  Whether we recognize it or not, the standard solution to a 

complex modeling challenge is to simplify--typically to the minimum extent possible--aspects of 

the overall modelling framework.  However, incorporating feedback into the stress test 

framework may require simplifying aspects of the framework to a point where it is less able to 

capture the risks to individual institutions.  Even so, one can imagine substantial gains from 

continued research on stress testing’s role in macroprudential supervision and our understanding 

of risks to the financial system, such as knock-on effects, contagion, fire sales, and the 

interaction between capital and liquidity during a crisis.  

Finally, let me close by addressing a question that often arises about the use of a 

supervisory stress test, such as those conducted by the Fed, with common scenarios and models.  

Such a test may create the possibility of, in former Chairman Bernanke’s words, a “model 

monoculture,” in which all models are similar and all miss the same key risks.2  Such a culture 

could possibly create vulnerabilities in the financial system.  At the Fed we try to address this
