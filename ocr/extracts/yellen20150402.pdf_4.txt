conference will explore economic mobility as it is influenced by or affects families, 

communities, and the economy, so let me touch on each of those three facets. 

We know that families are the locus of both opportunities and barriers to 

economic mobility.  There are important research questions to be tackled here.  What 

individual or family characteristics may predict who will achieve upward mobility?  How 

much does someone’s initial circumstances in life influence how far that person can get 

or how hard he or she needs to work to get there?  Researchers and policymakers need a 

better understanding of how much mobility individuals may experience over the course 

of their lives and at what age people’s outcomes may become more difficult to change. 

Families are the source of many of the resources and experiences that influence 

economic mobility, and more research can help us understand to what extent and in 

which ways differences in the economic circumstances of families affect the upward 

mobility and economic security of offspring.  Research may be able to provide evidence 

on which public policies are most helpful in building an economy in which people are 

poised to get ahead.  Conversely, it would also be beneficial to understand whether any 

policies may hold people back or discourage upward mobility. 

There is some debate on how the level of economic mobility in the United States 

may have changed in recent decades and whether it is easier or more difficult for people 

to get ahead today than it was in previous generations.  Shortly, you will hear from a 

panel of distinguished experts with a range of views on this topic.  Looking at the very 

recent past, we should also be asking whether and how this may have changed coming 

out of the Great Recession.  Later, my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor 

Brainard, will speak on a topic of significant interest to me and I expect to many others--
