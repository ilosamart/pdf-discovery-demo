Treasuries in exchange for riskier but higher-yielding assets.7  After all, with a leverage ratio as 

the only significant constraint, the regulatory cost of holding a short-term Treasury bill is 

identical to that of a junk bond.  It is this very limitation of a leverage ratio that led to the 

creation of a complementary risk-based capital requirement in the 1980s.  To truly assure the 

safety and soundness of the financial system, a leverage ratio serving as the sole or dominant 

form of prudential regulation would probably have to be set considerably higher, at a level where 

the impact on financial intermediation could be quite substantial. 

 As to the impact of the 2 percent enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, our experience 

leads me to believe that it may be worth changing to account for the quite different business 

operations of the G-SIBs, particularly those in the custody business.  The complementarity of 

risk-based capital requirements and leverage ratios suggests that there should be some 

proportionality between the two.  This is, of course, the current situation with respect to the 

standards applicable to non-systemic banks, with the leverage ratio requirement being sensibly 

set somewhat below the risk based requirement.  However, with the additional standards 

applicable only to the eight systemically important firms, we have a sliding scale of risk-based 

surcharges but an across-the-board 2 percent leverage ratio surcharge.   

In practical terms, the asymmetry is most significant for the two banks that are 

dominantly custodial and transactional in nature, rather than lending and trading firms.  These 

banks have had the lowest risk-based surcharges of the eight G-SIBs--currently 1-Â½ percent--but 

their leverage surcharge is 2 percent.  This is especially problematic for their operations, since 

they prudently reinvest custody customer deposits into safe and liquid assets.   

                                                 
7 Some market observers and participants believe that current capital requirements have impinged somewhat on 
market liquidity for Treasuries.  While this claim is hard to prove with existing data, particularly given the 
difficulties of determining optimal levels of liquidity, it seems reasonable to assume that a very high leverage ratio 
would seriously constrict market making in Treasuries.
