toward domestic spending through policies to bolster household income and strengthen 

social safety nets, and Indonesia and Korea each made similar commitments to facilitate 

the process of global rebalancing.   

What are some specific policy measures that could be helpful?  First, increased 

public spending on social services, such as education, health care, and retirement 

benefits, could spur consumption by reducing the need for precautionary household 

saving.  In China, some redistribution of the profits of state-owned enterprises to the 

central government through larger dividend payments could provide revenue to support 

such spending.  Second, government support could be shifted away from manufacturing 

toward encouraging service-sector development, which has typically lagged behind in 

these economies.  Services tend to have a higher non-traded component, so faster growth 

of this sector would help rebalance growth toward domestic demand.  Third, additional 

development spending could be directed toward these countriesâ€™ poorest regions; for 

example, China has recently strengthened its efforts in this area.   

The case for boosting investment rates in Asian emerging economies to support 

global demand is less clear-cut.  At about 45 percent of GDP, Chinese investment rates 

are now so high that the return on new investment may already be quite low in some 

sectors.  In a number of other countries, however, investment rates are only at about the 

average of those in the advanced economies.  It seems plausible that, with their lower 

capital-to-labor ratios, investment rates should be higher in some emerging Asian 

economies.  Indeed, some have argued that infrastructure needs remain extremely 

pronounced in many emerging market economies, and that a wave of investment may be
