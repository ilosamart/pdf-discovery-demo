the single core country, presumably magnified by the larger combined global weight of 

the two economies. 

Now letâ€™s turn to the case in which the two central banks choose to rely on 

different policy tools. 10  In this case, one country responds to the positive shock by 

hiking its policy rate to reduce output to its initial level, while the second country 

responds by shrinking its balance sheet.  The country that relies on the policy rate to 

make the adjustment experiences an appreciation in the exchange rate, a deterioration in 

net exports and some expansion of domestic demand, while the country that chooses to 

rely solely on the balance sheet for tightening experiences a depreciation of its exchange 

rate and an increase in net exports.  Thus, while both countries achieve their domestic 

stabilization objectives, whether the requisite policy tightening occurs through increases 

in policy rates or reductions in the balance sheet matters for the composition of demand, 

the external balance, and the exchange rate.   

  I highlighted at the outset the commitment adopted by many leading nations to 

set monetary policy to achieve domestic objectives such that the exchange rate would not 

be a primary consideration in the setting of monetary policy.  In the case that balance-

sheet and conventional monetary policies have equivalent effects on both domestic 

spending and the exchange rate, this common principle is straightforward.  But if the 

cross-border spillovers of reductions in the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate 

are not equivalent, the sequencing of policy rate and balance sheet normalization could 

have important implications for the exchange rate and external balance.
