diverse workforce.  Demographic trends indicate that minorities will be an increasing 

share of the population in the years and decades ahead, and thus an increasing share of 

new customers for your institutions. 

My organization, the Federal Reserve, is also committed to a diverse workforce 

and to diversity in our senior leadership.  The Federal Reserve is pursuing this goal not 

only for all of the practical reasons I have cited to seek diversity, but also because it is the 

right thing to do.  I want to be clear to all of you that I am committed to improving 

diversity throughout our organization, including at the upper ranks.  Diversity is also 

important on the boards of directors and advisory councils of Reserve Banks.  I hope, in 

fact, that in this room today there are individuals who one day may serve as an advisor, 

director or even a Reserve Bank President or member of the Board of Governors. 

Improving diversity requires effort and constant focus.  We will continue working 

hard to achieve this goal.  I believe it is as vital to the Federal Reserve as it is to your 

employers, and to every employer, to improve diversity and extend opportunity to 

everyone.
