Thank you very much to the Hoover Institution for hosting this important 

conference and to John Taylor for inviting me to participate.1  In my capacity as both the 

Vice Chairman for Supervision at the Board of Governors and a member of the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC), part of my job is to consider the intersection of 

regulatory and monetary policy issues, the subject of my discussion today.  This topic is a 

very complex and dynamic nexus, especially as regulation and the implementation of 

monetary policy continue to evolve.   

One important issue for policymakers, and the one that I will spend some time 

reflecting on today, is how post-crisis financial regulation, through its incentives for bank 

behavior, may influence the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in the long run.  

Such a topic is admittedly difficult to address in the time we have today, so I will focus 

on a particular component of the regulation--the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)--and its 

link to banks’ demand for U.S. central bank reserve balances.  Besides illuminating this 

particular issue, I hope my discussion will help illustrate the complexities associated with 

the interconnection of regulatory and monetary policy issues in general.  Also, let me 

emphasize at the outset that I will be touching on some issues that the Board and the 

FOMC are in the process of observing and evaluating and, in some cases, may be far 

from reaching any final decisions on.  As such, my thoughts on these issues are my own 

and are likely to evolve, benefiting from further discussion and our continued monitoring 

of bank behavior and financial markets over time.       

                                                 
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the 

Federal Open Market Committee.
