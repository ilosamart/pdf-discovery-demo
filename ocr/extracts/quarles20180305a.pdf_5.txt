Our current approach aligns with other jurisdictions that host a large and complex foreign 

bank presence.  For example, the European subsidiaries of U.S. banking firms have long been 

subject to Basel-based standards imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom as 

host regulators.  In addition, European regulators are contemplating a holding company structure 

for the local operations of foreign banks to reduce fragmentation and ensure effective local 

supervision, similar in many ways to Federal Reserve rules.  

In adopting the enhanced prudential standards, however, the Board has acknowledged 

both the uniqueness of FBOs--as the U.S. operations are a small part of a larger firm--and the 

diversity of foreign bank operations in the United States.  The Board contemplated from the 

outset that circumstances may require application of the rule’s requirements to be adjusted in 

light of an individual firm’s structure or risk profile.  The Board has exercised this authority in 

the past, and I want to stress that we will continue to provide flexibility where appropriate to 

accommodate these differences.   

For instance, in implementing enhanced risk management standards, we have focused on 

outcomes--a strong control environment for foreign bank operations in the United States--while 

providing some flexibility in how those outcomes are achieved.  We have allowed the global risk 

committee to serve as the risk committee for the U.S. operations rather than require the creation 

of a standalone committee.  Further, for foreign banks with large U.S. branches but no IHC, the 

Board has acknowledged the challenges associated with the location of the risk committee.  The 

Board has accordingly allowed risk committees at U.S. holding companies as well as managerial 

committees located in the United States, provided that the global board provided appropriate
