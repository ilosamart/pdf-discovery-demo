resilience of its practices, including notable improvements to internal risk-management

Some challenges to macroprudential policy 

The steps taken since the crisis have almost certainly improved the resilience of 

the U.S. financial system, but I would like to highlight two significant challenges that 

remain.   

First, new regulations may lead to shifts in the institutional location of particular 

financial activities, which can potentially offset the expected effects of the regulatory 

reforms.  The most significant changes in regulation have focused on large banks.  This 

focus has been appropriate, as large banks are the most interconnected and complex 

institutions.  Nonetheless, potential shifts of activity away from more regulated to less 

regulated institutions could lead to new risks.   

It is still too early to gauge the degree to which such adaptations to regulatory 

changes may occur, although there are tentative signs.  For example, we have seen 

                                                   
 
by defining registration and business-conduct requirements that apply to the clearing organizations, to large 
participants in the swap market, and to data repositories.  The SEC and the CFTC have finalized or initiated 
the rulemaking process for many of these regulations.  For instance, the CFTC issued the final rule on the 
registration of swap dealers and major swap participants in January 2012 (Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, 2012), while the SEC issued the final rule on operational and risk-management requirements 
for clearing agencies in October 2012 (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2012).     
11 The list of reforms in this section of the speech is not comprehensive and omits important steps taken by 
the private sector.  For example, supervisory and industry efforts have reduced the amount of intraday 
credit provided by the two large clearing banks (JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon), which 
should improve the resilience of the triparty repurchase agreement market.  The industry has also 
undertaken important changes to bolster the resilience of its practices.  For example, firms in many parts of 
the financial system have initiated notable improvements to their internal risk-management processes.  See 
Joint Forum (2015) for examples of enhancements to credit risk practices that have been made by firms 
since the crisis.  These enhancements include increased focus on stress tests, enhanced reporting of 
exposures to counterparties and to industries, and improved systems to enable more detailed and more 
timely reporting.
