Good evening.  Thank you to John Bryant and Operation HOPE for inviting me today to 

open the HOPE Global Forums.1  I commend our hosts for bringing together such an impressive 

group of speakers and attendees, diverse in their perspectives, yet all of whom share the vital 

goal of advancing economic opportunity and inclusion.  It is fitting that this event is being held 

on the 50th anniversary of several notable events, including the publication of Dr. Martin Luther 

King’s last book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community, which urged unity in order 

to create equal opportunity, and the enactment of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which enshrined 

our nation’s commitment to equal access to housing.  These milestones remind us of the progress 

we have made to date as well as the challenges that remain, and inspire us to persist in our 

efforts.   

The conference has a robust agenda ahead.  Over the next few days, you will be 

discussing many issues relating to financial inclusion--such as housing, small businesses, 

workforce participation, and other topics--to which we at the Federal Reserve share a 

commitment, and that we view as critical to our mission.  Our economy is stronger when 

everyone has a chance to contribute fully and share in our national prosperity.  And I personally 

believe that financial inclusion helps us realize a founding notion of our country--that this is a 

place where opportunity, innovation, and productivity are encouraged and rewarded.  I’m 

particularly pleased to see on the conference agenda a number of sessions on issues to which we, 

at the Federal Reserve, devote considerable attention: access to credit and financial inclusion for 

consumers and small businesses.  Conversations like these are enormously important to 

                                                            
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open 
Market Committee.
