supervisory determination to a review panel composed of Reserve Bank staff that were 

not involved in the original supervisory determination and that were selected after 

consultation with staff at the Board in Washington.  Bank managers may submit relevant 

information to this panel in writing and may appear in person. 

If the bank’s managers or board believe this panel’s decision did not address their 

concerns in a satisfactory manner, the bank may make a second appeal to the president of 

the relevant Reserve Bank.  A third review--undertaken by the member of the Board of 

Governors with oversight responsibility for the Federal Reserve’s banking supervision, 

who at present is Governor Tarullo--can be requested if the institution is still not satisfied 

that its concerns have been addressed. 

The Federal Reserve’s ombudsman mediates complaints, facilitates appeals, and, 

where appropriate, refers matters to committees of the Board.

  We are working to 

increase awareness of the ombudsman’s office and encouraging bankers to use the 

ombudsman for matters that cannot be resolved at the local level.  Importantly, the 

ombudsman reaches out to every institution that has filed an appeal within six months 

after the appeal has been decided to ensure that no retaliation or other unjustified 

reactions have taken place.  The ombudsman has broad authority to investigate claims of 

retaliation, and, when appropriate, will report complaints to the Board.  The Board will 

not tolerate retaliation against banking organizations that file appeals or raise concerns 

about the supervisory process.  Beyond simple fairness, hearing concerns from banks
