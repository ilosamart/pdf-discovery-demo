Nonetheless, even though education is a sound investment for most students, the 

benefits can vary with the quality and type of education received.31  The SHED finds that 

fewer than 40 percent of nongraduates or graduates from for-profit institutions say their 

education was “worth the cost,” compared with two-thirds of graduates from public or 

nonprofit institutions.32  The downsides from such low-return education are compounded 

for those who took out student loans, in some cases leaving them worse off than before.  

As an indication of this problem, nearly three-fourths of recent borrowers who attended 

for-profit schools failed to make progress on paying off their student loans in the first few 

years, and almost half were in default within five years.33  Investments in education that 

do not pay off can set these individuals back on asset building as well as on other life 

goals they may have.  To advance more inclusive growth and opportunity, it is essential 

to help people, especially first-time and nontraditional college students, access smarter 

educational investments with more reliable and better returns.34  

Communities of Opportunity 

The connection between the conditions in a community and individual 

opportunity has been demonstrated in powerful research that many of you have 

pioneered, and we see this connection every day in our work in communities around the 

country. The neighborhood where a family lives can have profound implications for their 

economic opportunities and their children’s prospects.  Families living in neighborhoods 

with high concentrations of poverty and low economic or demographic diversity are more
