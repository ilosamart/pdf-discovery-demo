that she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got 

married.  Indeed, at the time, marriage bars were widespread.6   

There were notable exceptions, such as, of course, Mary Emma Woolley, a Brown 

graduate who went on to serve as the president of Mount Holyoke College, and Ethel 

Robinson, the first black woman to graduate from Brown, who taught English at Howard 

University.  Helen Butts, from the Class of 1928, taught natural sciences at Smith and 

later zoology at Wellesley, the beginning of a long and productive career as a biological 

researcher.  Another exception was Betty Stafford, the aunt of my husband, George.  She 

grew up in Providence, earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Brown in mathematics 

and then rather adventurously headed west, teaching at two universities in Texas in the 

1920s before completing her Ph.D. and then teaching at the University of Wisconsin.   

Despite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women, 

working outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women 

did enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates 

reaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married 

women.  This rise suggests that while the incentive, and in many cases the imperative, 

remained for women to drop out of the labor market at marriage when they could rely on 

their husband’s income, mores were changing.  Indeed, these years overlapped with the 

so-called first wave of the women’s movement, when women came together to agitate for 

change on a variety of social issues, including suffrage and temperance, and which 

culminated in the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the 

right to vote.
