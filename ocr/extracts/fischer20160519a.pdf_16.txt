appear in the basic three-equation model--and that is an assumption, not a 

theorem.14 

4. The Goals of Policy.  When he turns to optimal policy, Woodford starts 

Chapter 6 by asking what the goals of monetary policy should be.  He states 

that there is a fair amount of consensus in the literature that a desirable 

monetary policy is one that achieves a low expected value of an objective 

function that includes inflation and “some measure of output relative to 

potential.”   He then goes on to point out the many questions such a 

formulation leaves unanswered, including whether to target the price level or 

the inflation rate, should greater priority be given to reducing the variability of 

unforecastable inflation, should one seek to stabilize output deviations from a 

smooth trend or from the short-run aggregate supply curve, and so forth?  And 

then the surprising comment (p.382)  

The aim of the present chapter is to show how economic analysis 

can be brought to bear upon these questions.   

This sounds simple but it is not, for the explanation that Woodford provides is 

that  

we have seen that models founded on individual optimization 

can be constructed that, thanks to the presence of nominal 

rigidities, allow for realistic effects of monetary policy upon real 

variables.  Here we shall see those same nominal rigidities 

provide welfare-economic justification for central bankers’ 

traditional concern for price stability.   

                                                 
14 It is worth noting that the money stock dropped out of many models in the 1980s because standard 

relationships between money and real variables became unstable and because money aggregates became 

difficult to control.  Or, as Gerald Bouey, former governor of the Bank of Canada, once said to the House 

of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs, “We did not abandon M1, M1 

abandoned us.”
