There is also a widespread feeling that our supervision seems to have downplayed the 

difference in roles between boards and management.  Our current ratings system for bank 

holding companies, which for large banking firms would be replaced by the currently proposed 

LFI ratings system, refers to the “board and senior management” as a subcomponent rating of 

risk management.3  We have also combined the roles of the board and senior management in 

many of our supervisory feedback letters.    

 After careful consideration, last month we proposed a new framework for our oversight 

of boards.4  In formulating this proposal, we had discussions with academics, consultants, legal 

practitioners, and directors of banking firms.   

Let me start by saying what the new approach will not do.  We do not intend that these 

reforms will lower the bar for boards or lighten the loads of directors.  The new approach 

distinguishes the board from senior management so that we can spotlight our expectations of 

effective boards.  The intent is to enable directors to spend less board time on routine matters and 

more on core board responsibilities:  overseeing management as they devise a clear and coherent 

direction for the firm, holding management accountable for the execution of that strategy, and 

ensuring the independence and stature of the risk management and internal audit functions.  

These were all areas that were found wanting in the financial crisis, and it is essential that boards 

get these fundamentals right.  

Our new proposal will move to a principles-based approach.  We have identified five 

common attributes that effective boards should exhibit, and for which we will have high 

expectations.  This principles-based approach recognizes that large firms have a broad range of
