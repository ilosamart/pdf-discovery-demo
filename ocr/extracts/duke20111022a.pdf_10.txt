Manage Your Debt   

My final suggestion is to manage your debt.  Loans are an excellent way to use future 

income to pay for an important purchase today, such as a car, an education, or a home.  But 

before taking out a loan--a student loan, for example--you should ask yourself three questions.   

First, does the value of the purchase justify the payments you will have to make?  

Education is one of the best investments you can make, but think about whether the extra 

earnings from a particular course of study will enable you to earn enough to make loan payments 

in the future.  Furthermore, when preparing to manage student debt, consider the full breadth of 

expenses--room and board, books and supplies, etc.--that you will incur to determine the total 

amount you will need to borrow.  According to the American Council on Education, half of all 

graduates in 2004 used credit cards for school expenses.13 You want to avoid having to do that.  

The second question is closely related:  Will you be able to make the payments on the 

loan even if everything doesn’t go as you plan or if payments are higher in the future?  Consider 

the highest payment you will potentially face rather than just the initial payment.   

And finally, ask yourself if you have found the best loan for you.  Ask lenders questions, 

read the information they give you, and make sure you know everything about the terms of your 

loan. And shop around for the best deal.   

 In addition to thinking carefully about the initial loan decision, it is important to 

periodically re-evaluate your debt position.  Sometimes the best way to invest your new savings 

is to pay down high-cost debt.  Another way to save money is to refinance your mortgage into 

lower interest rates.  Through the government’s “Home Affordable Refinance Program,” 

borrowers with mortgages through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac can refinance their loans even if 

they owe more than the home’s current value.  Interest rates and mortgage underwriting are
