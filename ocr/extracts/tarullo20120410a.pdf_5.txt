 But stress testing is no more a panacea for the supervision of large financial institutions 

than capital requirements themselves, or any other regulatory device.  By design, the stress tests 

to date have not covered other sources of stress, such as funding and interest rate risks, which are 

the subjects of other supervisory exercises.  But just as strengthened capital requirements remain 

at the center of a better financial regulatory system, so stress testing is now recognized as a 

critical, forward-looking tool for ensuring that minimum capital requirements can be maintained.  

Indeed, stress testing has already come to epitomize the horizontal, interdisciplinary approach to 

supervising our largest bank holding companies that the Federal Reserve System has instituted 

over the past few years. 

 Firm-specific capital planning has also become an important supervisory tool.  In 

November 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a new regulation requiring large banking 

organizations to submit an annual capital plan.1  This tool serves multiple purposes.  First, it 

provides a regular, structured, and comparative way to promote and assess the capacity of large 

bank holding companies to understand and manage their capital positions, with particular 

emphasis on risk-measurement practices.  Second, it provides supervisors with an opportunity to 

evaluate any capital distribution plans against the backdrop of the firm’s overall capital position, 

a matter of considerable importance given the significant distributions that some firms made in 

2007 even as the financial crisis gathered momentum.  Third, at least for the next few years, it 

will provide a regular assessment of whether large holding companies will readily and 

comfortably meet the new capital requirements related to various Basel agreements as they take 

effect in the United States.
