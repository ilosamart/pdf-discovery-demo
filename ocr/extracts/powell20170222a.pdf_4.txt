uncertain, and today is no exception.  Our discussions of the economy may sometimes 

ring in the ears of the public with more certainty than is appropriate.  Take the concept of 

“maximum employment,” which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of 

unemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor 

force participation.3  The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the 

record suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4  There 

is also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation.  

Participation has been declining since about 2000 because of the aging of our population 

and other secular trends, and analysts generally agree that participation will continue to 

decline over time for these reasons (figure 2).  A canonical paper by a group of Fed 

economists estimates a trend rate of decline of about 0.3 percentage point per year.5  

After declining sharply and dipping well below the prior trend in the years following the 

crisis, participation has been roughly flat since late 2013.  Relative to this estimate of the 

declining trend, three years of flat participation implies a cyclical improvement of 

roughly 1 percentage point.  But there is a range of views on the underlying trend and 

whether we can expect a bit more near-term cyclical improvement in participation.  The 

                                                 
3 The labor force is made up of people who have jobs as well as people who are jobless but are looking for 
a job and are available to work. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Labor Force Participation,” webpage,

4 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the 
parameter estimates given the model.  The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 
95 percent confidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate.  See Douglas 
Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and 
Strategy (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).
