international standards or reviewing compliance with existing ones.  These discussions are 

usually conducted with numerous colleagues who are not themselves responsible for banking 

regulation in their own jurisdictions.  As important as these efforts have been, and continue to be, 

following the crisis, there is a risk that by not having opportunities for senior officials of the 

various national agencies that have direct supervisory responsibility for banking organizations to 

meet and discuss shared challenges, we give short shrift to the collective interest of bank 

regulators in effective supervision of all globally active firms.  Proposals to include prudential 

requirements or, more precisely, to include limitations on prudential requirements in trade 

agreements would lead us farther away from the aforementioned goal of emphasizing shared 

financial stability interests, in favor of an approach to prudential matters informed principally by 

considerations of commercial advantage. 

Conclusion 

 The job of regulating and supervising large, globally active banking organizations is a 

tough one.  Issues of moral hazard, negative externalities, and asymmetric information are, if not 

pervasive, then at least significant and recurring.  The job is made only harder by the fact that 

these firms cross borders in ways their regulators do not.  But we cannot ignore this fact and 

pretend that we have global oversight.  International standards for prudential regulation are not 

the same as global regulations, and consolidated supervision is not the same as comprehensive 

supervision.  The jurisdictions represented on the Basel Committee not only have the right to 

regulate their financial markets--including large FBOs participating in those markets--they have 

a responsibility to their home jurisdictions, and to the rest of the world, to do so.  The most 

important contribution the United States can make to global financial stability is to ensure the 

stability of our own financial system.
