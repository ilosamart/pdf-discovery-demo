through risk-sharing agreements, or through expanded use of credit-risk transfers.  Although 

private capital must surely be part of the reform effort, there may be limits to the amount of risk 

that we can credibly expect the private sector to insure.  It is extremely difficult to appropriately 

price the insurance of catastrophic risk--the risk of a severe, widespread housing crisis.  Both the 

private-sector insurance industry and government have struggled with this, particularly with how 

to smooth the consistent collection of premiums with the irregular payout of potentially 

enormous losses that may be needed only once or twice in a century.  Furthermore, losses can be 

correlated across asset classes and geographies in these catastrophic events, rendering risk-

diversification strategies ineffective.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have successfully transferred 

some credit risk to the private sector, but have thus far avoided selling off much of this 

catastrophic credit risk, arguing that doing so is not economical.9   

Principles for Reform 

After promising legislative initiatives have moved forward but fallen short of enactment, 

the air is again thick with housing finance reform proposals.  As I mentioned at the outset, 

housing finance reform has important implications for the Federal Reserve’s oversight of 

financial institutions, and for the U.S. economy and its financial stability.  While I would not 

presume to judge these reform proposals, I will offer some principles for reform.  These

overview differentiates between expected loss (credit losses that would be projected to occur even under a stable 
baseline), unexpected loss (losses that might occur under a stressful but plausible event such as recession) and 
catastrophic loss (losses beyond those of an unexpected loss and that are deemed highly unlikely to occur). The 
overview notes  that “ catastrophic risk events are deemed so unlikely, meaning they present so little risk, that the 
Enterprises have found it to be too costly (not economical) to transfer much of this risk to the private sector,”
