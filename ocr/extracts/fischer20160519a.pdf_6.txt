mono- nor a bimetallist, but a non-metallist.”  Wicksell then proceeds to 

suggest a reaction function for the central bank: 

According to our line of approach, they [proposals for stabilizing 

the value of money] can attain their objective only in so far as 

they exert an indirect influence on the money rate of interest, and 

bring it into line with the natural rate . . . (p.188) 

But  

This does not mean that the [central] banks ought actually to 

ascertain the natural rate before fixing their own rates of interest. 

. . . The procedure should rather be simply as follows: So long as 

prices remain unaltered, the banks’ rate of interest is to remain 

unaltered.  If prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised. . . . 

and likewise mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.  (p.189) 

To make this possible, Wicksell suggests the suspension of the free 

coinage of gold, as a “first step towards the introduction of an ideal standard 

of value”--“an international paper standard” (p.193).  And, on a soaring 

personal note at the end of the formal text of the book (p.196), he writes 

the question of monetary reform on international lines definitely 

remains among the most important of economic problems.  That 

its realization depends on international co-operation . . . is to my 

mind a positive recommendation.  I joyfully welcome every fresh 

step towards the uniting of nations for economic or scientific 

ends, for it adds one more safeguard for the preservation and 

strengthening of that good on which the successful attainment of 

all other goods, both material and immaterial, ultimately 

depends--international peace. 

If this were a paper about Wicksell, there would be no choice but to 

stop after this inspiring crescendo.  But although Wicksell plays a key role in 

this paper, the paper is not primarily about him.  Let me nonetheless conclude 

this section of the paper with a few additional comments.
