for example, if the Treasury took steps to shorten the average maturity of 

Treasury debt outstanding or, alternatively, if the Federal Reserve maintained 

large holdings of long-term assets.

Eliminating the ZLB Associated with Physical Currency:  While the European 

experience suggests that interest rates can be pushed somewhat below zero, the 

existence of physical currency likely still limits how deeply interest rates can be 

pushed into negative territory.  That observation has led some to ask whether it 

would it be possible for the financial system to operate effectively without 

physical currency provided by the central bank.  This is a theoretical question that 

has fascinated economists for decades and, with advances in technology, could 

possibly have practical implications as well.  Indeed, the Scandinavian countries 

have embraced the development of new payments technologies that seem to be 

reducing the need for physical currency for transactions in those countries.13

Nonetheless, a transition to a cashless economy in the United States seems very 

far off; indeed, U.S. currency outstanding has been increasing relative to nominal 

gross domestic product over recent decades, driven importantly by foreign 

demands for U.S. bank notes.  Moreover, to eliminate the ZLB associated with 

physical currency by going cashless, countries would need to transition to an 

economy that did not require widespread use of physical currency, and central 

banks in those countries would need to cease issuing physical currency on 

demand (for example, in response to demands spurred by negative rates on so-
