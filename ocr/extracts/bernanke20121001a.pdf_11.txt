money for the government to use--and will that inevitably lead to higher inflation?  No, 

that’s not what is happening, and that will not happen.  Monetizing the debt means using 

money creation as a permanent source of financing for government spending.  In contrast, 

we are acquiring Treasury securities on the open market and only on a temporary basis, 

with the goal of supporting the economic recovery through lower interest rates.  At the 

appropriate time, the Federal Reserve will gradually sell these securities or let them 

mature, as needed, to return its balance sheet to a more normal size.  Moreover, the way 

the Fed finances its securities purchases is by creating reserves in the banking system.  

Increased bank reserves held at the Fed don’t necessarily translate into more money or 

cash in circulation, and, indeed, broad measures of the supply of money have not grown 

especially quickly, on balance, over the past few years.  

For controlling inflation, the key question is whether the Federal Reserve has the 

policy tools to tighten monetary conditions at the appropriate time so as to prevent the 

emergence of inflationary pressures down the road.  I’m confident that we have the 

necessary tools to withdraw policy accommodation when needed, and that we can do so 

in a way that allows us to shrink our balance sheet in a deliberate and orderly way.  For 

example, the Fed can tighten policy, even if our balance sheet remains large, by 

increasing the interest rate we pay banks on reserve balances they deposit at the Fed.  

Because banks will not lend at rates lower than what they can earn at the Fed, such an 

action should serve to raise rates and tighten credit conditions more generally, preventing 

any tendency toward overheating in the economy. 

Of course, having effective tools is one thing; using them in a timely way, neither 

too early nor too late, is another.  Determining precisely the right time to “take away the
