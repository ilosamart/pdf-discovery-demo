lower than that today and will only return to its longer-run value over time.12  One 

important implication is that today’s low rates are not as stimulative as they may seem--

consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below target. 

Monetary Policy amid Uncertainty 

 I’d like to turn now to monetary policy.  I expect the economy to continue 

broadly along its current path, which implies further labor market tightening and inflation 

edging closer to 2 percent.  On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below 

current estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some time.  I see that as a 

desirable outcome and do not see data suggesting that we are behind the curve.  In recent 

years, the economy has faced significant downside risks, particularly from weak global 

conditions.  The Committee has been quite patient, and I believe that has served us well.  

But risks now seems to me to be more in balance.  Going forward, I see it as appropriate 

to gradually tighten policy as long as the economy continues to behave roughly as 

expected.  As always, the actual path could be faster or slower than expected and will 

depend on developments in the economy. 

Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to a discussion of how policy 

decisions are made, including the role of simple monetary policy rules.  Since the 1990s, 

central banks have grown ever more communicative about their monetary policy
