annual meeting in 2013 and spoke about financial market infrastructure reform.    

Two years have passed, and this is a good opportunity to take stock.  I’ll start by 

reviewing the progress made in strengthening central counterparty (or CCP) 

clearing, and then offer some thoughts on expanded central clearing for repurchase 

agreement (or repo) markets--an area of significant current interest.

derivatives market experienced rapid growth and an underappreciated buildup of 

risk.  The huge losses suffered by the American International Group (AIG) on its 

derivatives positions and the lack of transparency about the exposures of AIG’s 

counterparties were major accelerants to the financial panic that reached its acute 

phase in September 2008.  In response, in 2009 the Group of Twenty nations 

committed to moving standardized derivatives to central clearing, and to requiring 

posting of margin for derivatives that are not centrally cleared.2
