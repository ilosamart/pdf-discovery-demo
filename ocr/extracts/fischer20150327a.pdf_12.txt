derivatives are being cleared through central counterparties.  These developments may 

ultimately prove to be stability enhancing, but as the system evolves, we must remain 

attentive to the possibility of changes that may be destabilizing. 

More Needs to Be Done 

To say that the nonbank sector today appears less vulnerable than it did during the 

Global Financial Crisis, is not to say that authorities in the United States have tamed the 

nonbank sector.  Indeed, while progress has been substantial, areas for continued work 

remain, and I will briefly highlight three of them. 

Let me start with short-term wholesale funding markets.  While there have been 

some improvements in the plumbing of money markets, many nonbank financial firms, 

including hedge funds and broker-dealers, continue to rely on secured short-term funding 

to finance their activities, many of which involve longer-term and illiquid assets.  This 

maturity transformation remains a key vulnerability.  Further, many of the firms that rely 

on this maturity transformation are highly levered and thus more vulnerable to threats to 

their solvency.  The proposed international framework being developed by the Financial 

Stability Board for margins on securities financing transactions may be an important tool 

for limiting the pro-cyclicality and sharp deleveraging that can occur in these markets. 

Second, and more generally, we need to be alert to changes and trends in the 

financial system that may pose risks to financial stability, particularly those stemming 

from areas of the nonbank sector that are not subject to prudential supervision.  For 

example, the asset management industry has both grown and evolved in recent years.  

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the returns of indexes of relatively 

illiquid assets have mushroomed in size.  Examples include funds tracking the return on
