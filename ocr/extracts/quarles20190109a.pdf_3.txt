quarter of that premium came from life insurers,2 including, of course, the institutions 

represented in this room.   

In addition to its role providing insurance products--taking on risk and enabling 

policyholders to plan financially--the insurance industry plays an immensely important role 

through its investments.  In 2017, nearly 65 percent of the insurance industry’s $6.5 trillion in 

cash and invested assets was from the life insurance industry.3  Over 70 percent of life insurers’ 

invested assets were held in bonds,4 including corporate bonds, which fuel growth in the real 

economy.  Historically, insurers have been relatively conservative, buy-and-hold investors.  This 

has served both the industry and the economy well.5   

As we all appreciate, life insurance and annuities are in many ways a spread business, 

with investment of premium dollars funding later payments to policyholders.  In the years since 

the financial crisis, the insurance industry has shown resilience, with capital and surplus 

increasing at an average annual growth rate of 4.1 percent since 2007.6  With an approach to 

investment and financial management that focuses on the long-term, the U.S. insurance industry 

continues to play a valued role in the financial sector.
