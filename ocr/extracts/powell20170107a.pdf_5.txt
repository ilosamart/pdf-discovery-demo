stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, 

and are far more resolvable should they fail.  Many aspects of our financial market 

infrastructure, including the triparty repurchase agreement (or repo) market, central 

counterparties (CCPs), and money market funds, are more robust as well.    

Low Rates Can Mean Tradeoffs  

So far, I have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought 

us very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary 

policy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the 

financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.  All of 

that said, I would also agree that monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between 

macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.  Indeed, it would be a divine 

coincidence if that were not the case.  There are times when all of these objectives are 

aligned.  For example, the Fedâ€™s initial unconventional policies supported both market 

functioning and aggregate demand.  More broadly, post-crisis monetary policy supported 

asset values, reduced interest payments, and increased both employment and income.  All 

of these effects are likely to have limited defaults and foreclosures and bolstered the 

balance sheets of households, businesses, and financial intermediaries, leaving the system 

more robust.   

But at times there will be tradeoffs.  Low-for-long interest rates can have adverse 

effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as 

listed on the next slide.8  After all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-
