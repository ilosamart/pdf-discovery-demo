the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19  In this case, if the 

term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be 

to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve.   

It is worth highlighting that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP 

median is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and 

inflation around target.  So, while I will keep a close watch on the yield curve as an 

important signal on financial conditions, I will want to interpret yield curve movements 

as one of several considerations informing appropriate policy. 

Indeed, the possibility that the projected policy path may have unintended 

consequences is one of the compelling reasons for raising interest rates gradually.  The 

gradual pace of interest rate increases anticipated in the SEP median path should give us 

some time to assess the effects of our policies as we proceed.   

While the information available to us today suggests that a gradual path is 

appropriate, we would not hesitate to act decisively if circumstances were to change.  If, 

for example, underlying inflation were to move abruptly and unexpectedly higher, it 

might be appropriate to depart from the gradual path.  Stable inflation expectations is one 

of the key achievements of central banks in the past several decades, and we would 

defend it vigorously. 

Conclusion 

Our challenge is to sustain full employment and inflation at 2 percent, which is 

likely to warrant continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  With fiscal 

stimulus in the pipeline and financial conditions supportive of growth, the shorter-run
