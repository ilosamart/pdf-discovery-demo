has strengthened in recent months.  Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree 

to which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee’s outlook. 

And, as ever, the economic outlook is uncertain, and so monetary policy is not on 

a preset course.  Our ability to predict how the federal funds rate will evolve over time is 

quite limited because monetary policy will need to respond to whatever disturbances may 

buffet the economy.  In addition, the level of short-term interest rates consistent with the 

dual mandate varies over time in response to shifts in underlying economic conditions 

that are often evident only in hindsight.  For these reasons, the range of reasonably likely 

outcomes for the federal funds rate is quite wide--a point illustrated by figure 1 in your 

handout.  The line in the center is the median path for the federal funds rate based on the 

FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections in June.1  The shaded region, which is based 

on the historical accuracy of private and government forecasters, shows a 70 percent 

probability that the federal funds rate will be between 0 and 3-1/4 percent at the end of 

next year and between 0 and 4-1/2 percent at the end of 2018. 2  The reason for the wide 

range is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus rarely evolves as 

predicted.  When shocks occur and the economic outlook changes, monetary policy needs 

                                                 
1 The June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is an addendum to the minutes of the June 2016 

FOMC meeting and is available on the Board’s website at

2 The confidence interval equals (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis points) the median SEP path for the 

federal funds rate plus or minus average root mean squared prediction errors (RMSPEs) of the three-month 

Treasury bill rate, for horizons from zero to nine quarters ahead, based on forecast errors made over the 

past 20 years.  Average RMSPEs are calculated as the mean of the RMSPEs of the following forecasters, 

subject to availability for the horizon in question:  the Federal Reserve Board staff (Greenbook/Tealbook), 

the Administration, the Congressional Budget Office, the Blue Chip consensus forecast, and the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters.  Differences in predictive accuracy among these forecasters are not statistically 

significant.  For more information on the general methodology used to construct confidence intervals using 

historical forecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of 

the Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series
