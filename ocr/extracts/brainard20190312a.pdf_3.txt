With the passage of the CRA, Congress aimed to reverse the urban disinvestment from 

years of government policies and market actions that deprived lower-income areas of 

credit by redlining--using red-inked lines to set apart neighborhoods that were deemed 

too risky.  

The CRA is unique in important ways.  Unlike previous government efforts to 

address the needs of lower-income areas, the CRA puts decisionmaking about a 

community’s needs and priorities in the hands of local actors.  By stipulating that banks 

have an affirmative and continuing obligation to meet the credit needs of all segments of 

the local communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

communities, the CRA changed the way banks approach their lending and investment 

decisions in those communities.  More than 40 years later, the CRA continues to animate 

a vibrant community development ecosystem connecting community members with the 

banks that lend and invest, community organizations that deliver services and develop 

housing, and state and local governments that direct incentives and subsidies.  We 

participate actively through our community development and examination staff around 

the country, who help to connect stakeholders, analyze community needs, and assess 

outcomes. 

A second unique feature is the public nature of evaluations.  The CRA, as 

amended in 1989, directs federal regulators to evaluate banks’ records of helping to meet 

the credit needs of their local communities and assign one of four statutorily mandated 

ratings to their performance.2  Following additional amendments in 1991, the law 

                                                 
2 The banking agencies are the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The ratings are: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and 
Substantial Non-compliance.
