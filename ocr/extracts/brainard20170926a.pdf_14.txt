geographic mobility cannot be fully explained by population aging, by the housing boom 

and bust, by changes in the composition of industries, by the increasing ease of 

telecommuting from longer distances, or by the rise in dual-earner households which may 

make work-related relocation more difficult.  Some of the decline may be related to 

changes in the labor market, perhaps because workers are more likely to perceive that job 

opportunities are no better elsewhere, and consequently that the labor market returns to 

switching jobs or locations--in terms of better wages or higher job quality--have 

declined.33  Also, zoning requirements may be boosting housing costs in cities where job 

opportunities are most abundant, such as San Francisco, pricing out many potential 

workers and inhibiting migration.34 

Whatever the reason, the fact that families are less likely to move now than in the 

past suggests that many of those in less populous areas are not able to access the 

economic opportunity present in denser and more diversified large metropolitan areas at a 

time when the gap in labor market outcomes for larger metros relative to other areas 

continues to grow.   

Federal Reserve Work on Labor Market Disparities 

The Federal Reserve is deeply engaged in understanding disparities through our 

data collection, research collaboration, and community development work.  One way the 

Federal Reserve seeks to obtain a clearer picture is by collecting data ourselves.  For 

instance, some of the data I have cited today come from the Federal Reserveâ€™s triennial 

Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides detailed information on income and
