or instrumentality, in order to assist such com-
pany or entity in obtaining, retaining, or direct-
ing business for itself or another person.

These provisions do not apply to payments to
any employee whose duties are essentially min-
isterial or clerical.

Accounting Provisions

Although the obligation to maintain accurate
books and records and to have an adequate
system of internal accounting controls has been
acknowledged by responsible corporations for a
long time, this obligation was not previously
explicitly established into law until the passage
of the Act. Applying essentially to all compa-
nies whose securities are publicly traded in the
United States, the Act requires them to:

• Make and keep books, records, and accounts,
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the issuer; and

• Devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide rea-
sonable assurance that:
— Transactions are executed in accordance

with management’s general or specific
authorizations;

— Transactions are recorded as necessary
(1) to permit preparation of financial state-
ments in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles or any other
criteria applicable to such statements and
(2) to maintain accountability for assets;

— Access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization; and,

— The recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at rea-
sonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any difference.

Acting under its authority to issue regula-
tions, the SEC issued regulations, which became
effective on March 23, 1979, concerning falsi-
fications of records and the making of false,
misleading, or incomplete statements to audi-
tors. The first of these regulations says that no
person shall, directly or indirectly, falsify or
cause to be falsified, any book, record or account
subject to the provisions of the law described
above, that is, those used for making reports
under the SEC laws.

The second regulation prohibits a director or
officer of an issuer from making or causing to be
made a materially false or misleading statement,
and from omitting to state or cause another
person to omit a material fact necessary to make
a statement not misleading to an accountant,
external or internal, in connection with an audit
of the financial statements or preparation of
required reports. Conviction of a willful viola-
tion of these accounting provisions carries a
possible $10,000 fine or up to five years impris-
onment, or both.

Federal Elections Campaign Act—
2 USC 441B

The Federal Elections Campaign Act (FECA),
enacted in 1971, was designed to curb potential
abuses in the area of federal election financing.
In general, FECA regulates the making of cam-
paign contributions and expenditures in connec-
tion with primary and general elections to fed-
eral offices and specifically bans campaign
contributions by national banks. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency has, by regula-
tion (12 CFR 28.101(4)), made this provision
applicable to federal branches and agencies.1
FECA does not specifically address the making
of contributions and expenditures by banks or
other corporations to advocate positions on issues
that are the subjects of public referenda. As
originally enacted, FECA required disclosure of
contributions received or expenditures made;
however, amendments to the law in 1974 and
1976 imposed additional limitations on contri-
butions and expenditures as well. The 1974
amendments also established the Federal Elec-
tion Commission (Commission) to administer
FECA’s provisions. The Commission is respon-
sible for adopting rules to carry out FECA, for
rendering advisory opinions, and for enforcing
the Act. The Commission was reorganized as a
result of the FECA Amendments of 1976 and it
has since issued regulations interpreting the
statute Title 11 of the CFR.

1. 2 USC 441a, however, limits campaign contributions by
any person. The definition of person in 2 USC 431(h) is very
broad and could include the U.S. branches and agencies of
FBOs. Accordingly, any questions in this area should be
referred to appropriate legal counsel. In addition, 2 USC 441e
prohibits campaign contributions by foreign nationals (the
definition of which excludes U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent
resident aliens).
