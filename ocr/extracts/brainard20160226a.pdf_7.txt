The very low levels of the shorter run neutral rate reflect in part headwinds from 

the crisis that are likely to dissipate over time.  However, if many of the common forces 

holding down neutral rates prove persistent, then neutral rates may remain low through 

the medium term, implying a shallower path for policy trajectories. 

The global economy is also experiencing a downshift in emerging market growth 

momentum led by China, which may prove somewhat persistent.  Whereas earlier in the 

recovery there was a striking divergence between the relatively buoyant growth in major 

emerging economies and depressed growth in advanced economies, lately the extent of 

divergence has diminished noticeably.9  China is undergoing a challenging set of 

economic transitions.  Trend growth has slowed substantially and is expected to slow 

further, and the composition of growth is shifting away from resource-intensive 

manufacturing and exports toward a greater share for consumption and services.  Chinaâ€™s 

investment has slowed sharply recently after accounting for nearly one-third of global 

investment over the past three years and about one-half of global consumption in certain 

metals such as iron ore, aluminum, copper, and nickel.  Commodity exporters and close 

trading partners in Asia will be most affected, but the changes in the composition and rate 

of growth in a country that has accounted for about one-third of the growth in world  

output and trade will likely ripple through the global economy much more generally. 

                                                 
      Regarding sensitivity to risk, the risk premium for capital investment appears to have increased since 
the crisis; see Del Negro and others (2015).  A higher risk premium requires a lower risk-free rate to 
generate an equivalent level of investment.   
9 From the end of 2009 to the end of 2013, growth in important U.S. emerging market trading partners 
averaged 4.7 percent, while growth in advanced economies averaged 1.8 percent.  However, in 2014 
emerging country growth slowed to 3.3 percent, compared with 1.6 percent in advanced economies, and for 
the first three quarters of 2015, annualized growth was 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.
