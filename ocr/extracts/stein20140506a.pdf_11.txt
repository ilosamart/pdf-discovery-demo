Committee act as if it is averse to making sharp changes in the funds rate?  At one level, 

the answer is clear:  This behavior is in the service of our mandate, and nothing more.  

For if we were to make an unexpectedly abrupt adjustment at any time, it would likely 

have a large effect on long-term rates and credit conditions more generally, which in turn 

might compromise our ability to reach our goals for employment and inflation--for 

example, a large bond-market move of this sort might nip a nascent recovery in the bud, 

which is why it is to be avoided.    

Digging deeper, though, it is important to recognize that part of the reason that the 

bond market would react so strongly to a sharp change in the short-term policy rate is that 

we have settled into a self-sustaining equilibrium in which the Fed tends to act gradually, 

and the market has come to expect that gradualism.  In other words, the market has 

learned that a given increase in the federal funds rate at the beginning of a tightening 

cycle is typically followed by many more moves in the same direction, so there is 

naturally a multiplier effect on long-term rates of a given change in short-term rates.  And 

that multiplier depends on the expected degree of gradualism:  The more inertia there is 

in Fed policy, the more significant is any small move, and hence the larger is the 

multiplier.  Thus, an expectation of gradualism on the part of the market makes it all the 

more important for the Fed to adjust the policy rate gradually, thereby fulfilling the 

marketâ€™s beliefs.  

This line of reasoning can be thought of as a piece of positive economics--that is, 

it may shed some light on why the world is as it is.  But what, if any, are its normative 

implications?  On the one hand, as I have emphasized, a gradualist approach to monetary 

policy is likely to be the best way for us to deliver on our mandate at any point in time,
