Rouse have documented, microeconomic experiments and other research demonstrate the 

benefits of diversity for group deliberations and decisionmaking.  For instance, one well-

known experiment found that racially diverse groups of students outperformed other 

groups in solving problems, and another found similar benefits from gender diversity.6  

Turning to my own institution, it is notable that when the Congress established the 

Federal Reserve System, it took great care to ensure there would be a diversity of 

perspectives around the decisionmaking table in terms of regional representation.  That is 

why we have 12 Reserve Bank Districts represented on the Federal Open Market 

Committee.  But we have not lived up to that standard on other dimensions of diversity.  

For instance, it was not until 2017, more than 100 years after the creation of the Federal 

Reserve, that the first African American, Raphael Bostic, was chosen to lead a Reserve 

Bank.  We need to do better than that, and we will continue our efforts until the group of 

people around that table is more like America. 

To achieve our goals, we will need to improve the diversity of the economics 

ecosystem more broadly.  Of course, the Federal Reserve System hires people with all 

kinds of expertise--from lawyers to law enforcement, from financial analysts to data 

scientists.  But our footprint is especially large in the economics job market, where as a 

System we routinely hire one of every 25 newly minted economics Ph.D.’s each year.  In 

short, we have a significant stake in the diversity and vibrancy of the economics 

profession overall.
