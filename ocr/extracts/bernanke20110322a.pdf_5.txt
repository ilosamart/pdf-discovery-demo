Governors that provides oversight on bank supervisory and regulatory matters.  Although many 

of this committee’s efforts in the wake of the financial crisis have understandably been focused 

on the largest and most complex banking organizations, the Board believes that it is important to 

sharpen our focus on smaller banking organizations as well.  As a result, we recently established 

a special supervision subcommittee that focuses on community banks and smaller regional 

institutions.  This subcommittee is chaired by a former longtime community banker, Governor 

Betsy Duke, and also includes a former state banking commissioner, Governor Sarah Bloom 

Raskin.   

The subcommittee provides leadership and oversight on a variety of matters related 

specifically to our supervision of community and smaller regional banks.1  In particular, the 

subcommittee is reviewing new policy proposals through the lens of the effect those proposals 

could have on smaller institutions, both in terms of safety and soundness and potential regulatory 

burden.  Among other things, the subcommittee also monitors the Federal Reserve’s working 

relationship with state banking supervisors, which is particularly important because we share 

with them supervisory responsibility for state member banks.   

We have also undertaken an initiative to solicit feedback from community banks on a 

more regular basis.  In October, the Board announced that it would form a Community 

Depository Institutions Advisory Council to provide insight and information on the economy, 

lending conditions, and other issues of interest to community banks.2  To make this council as 

representative as possible, each of the 12 Reserve Banks now has its own local advisory council 

comprising representatives from banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions; one member from 

                                                 
1 For supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve generally considers banking organizations with assets of $10 billion 
or less to be community banking organizations and those with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to be 
regional banking organizations. 
2 This group replaces the former Thrift Institution Advisory Council, which provided the Board with useful 
information from the perspective of thrift institutions and credit unions.
