Hello.  I’m Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System.  I appreciate this opportunity to speak to the business and finance 

students and faculty--as well as the practicing financial professionals--attending the 

University of Dayton’s 13th annual RISE forum.

  Before I became Chairman, I had the 

pleasure of addressing the 5th annual forum as a member of the Board of Governors in 

2005.

  At that time, I spoke about the implementation of monetary policy and how 

crucial effective communication is to that implementation. 

Although I cannot join you in person this year, I note from the conference agenda 

that you are hearing from two Federal Reserve Bank presidents--Charles Evans of 

Chicago and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta--as well as former Federal Reserve Board Vice 

Chairman Roger Ferguson.  Effective communication in monetary policy is more 

important than ever, and I have little doubt that my current and former colleagues will 

provide you with insights about the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to achieve the 

goals that the Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. 

In my brief remarks today, I would like to mention another important mission of 

the Federal Reserve--promoting economic and financial knowledge among people of all 

ages and walks of life.  The Board in Washington and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks 

throughout the country are all deeply involved in economic education and supporting the 

work of teachers, schools, and national organizations.  For example, the Federal Reserve 

provides a financial and economic education website with a variety of resources for
