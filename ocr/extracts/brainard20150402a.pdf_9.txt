student debt may constrain their economic opportunities for years to come.  Borrowers 

who struggle to repay student loans face special challenges because student loans cannot 

be discharged in bankruptcy, unlike other forms of household credit.19  Fortunately, 

largely because of significant policy changes, beginning in the 2008-09 school year, the 

vast majority of student loans have been originated directly by the federal government 

and have flexible repayment and deferment options.20  Nonetheless, high levels of student 

indebtedness appear to be one factor influencing the Great Recession generation’s slow 

progression into homeownership. 

Household Formation and Homeownership 

Sharply lower household formation and homeownership rates are among the most 

striking legacies of the Great Recession, distinct from earlier recessions.  The number of 

households formed each year dropped by more than half, from about 1.35 million in the 

early and middle 2000s to about 600,000 households per year after 2007.  Moreover, the 

fraction of young adults who own homes also fell substantially:  After peaking at

proves that paying the debt would “impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents.”

20 The Great Recession also affected the way students borrowed to pay for college as private lenders 
tightened underwriting standards.  Private lenders originated more than $20 billion in student loans during 
the 2007-08 academic year.  However, that figure fell to about $9.4 billion in the following year and 
reached just $5.6 billion in the 2010-11 academic year.  During that same period, total federal loans 
originated increased from $49 billion to $76 billion.  Federal student loan programs also changed 
significantly during this time.  In 2010, the Congress eliminated the Federal Family Education Loan 
Program, which provided a federal guarantee for student loans originated by private lenders, leading to a 
sharp increase in the number of students borrowing directly from the U.S. Department of Education 
through the Federal Direct Loan Program.  In 2012, the Obama Administration created the Pay As You 
Earn program, which caps loan payments at 10 percent of discretionary income for eligible borrowers.  The 
following year, the Congress changed the method for determining Direct Loan interest rates--switching 
from a rate set by statute to a rate pegged to the 10-year Treasury note plus a markup.
