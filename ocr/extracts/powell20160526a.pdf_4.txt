pressure.  Some survey-based measures are at the low end of their recent historical

since mid-2014 and stand near all-time lows.  While I see expectations as staying 

reasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so and that inflation return over

The easing in global financial conditions since mid-February and the associated 

waning in downside risks are welcome, and in part reflect expectations that the FOMC

China’s exchange rate policy.  Elsewhere, risks are posed by the upcoming “Brexit” vote,

For several years after the crisis, economic activity remained far below its 

potential, and the need for highly accommodative policy seemed clear.  As the shortfall
