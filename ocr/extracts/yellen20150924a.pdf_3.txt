FOMC, uses to define its longer-run inflation goal.1  Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation 

began to move higher.  Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this 

upward move, but they were not the whole story, for, as illustrated here, inflation was 

already moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early 

1980s.2  And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and 

energy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s and rises to very 

elevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something more than the 

energy and food price shocks must have been at work. 

A second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine 

an estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1.  At 

each point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the 

level to which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any 

shocks to the economy have fully played out.3  As can be seen from the figure, this 

estimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period

2 The first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was 
the so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was 
caused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in 
many countries.  The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the 
1978-79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely 
attributable to bad weather and disease.  (See Blinder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that 
these and other special factors--including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971-74 
period--had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)  
3 The predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which 
uses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a 
stochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data 
definitions).  The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry (2010), 
which in turn follows Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and 
Sbordone (2014) for related applications.
