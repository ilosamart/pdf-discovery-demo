It is an honor to deliver the inaugural Michel Camdessus Central Banking 

Lecture.  Michel Camdessus served with distinction as governor of the Banque de France 

and was one of the longest-serving managing directors of the International Monetary 

Fund (IMF).  In these roles, he was well aware of the challenges central banks face in 

their pursuit of price stability and full employment, and of the interconnections between 

macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  Those interconnections were apparent in 

the Latin American debt crisis, the Mexican peso crisis, and the East Asian financial 

crisis, to which the IMF responded under Camdessusâ€™s leadership.  These episodes took 

place in emerging market economies, but since then, the global financial crisis and, more 

recently, the euro crisis have reminded us that no economy is immune from financial 

instability and the adverse effects on employment, economic activity, and price stability 

that financial crises cause.   

The recent crises have appropriately increased the focus on financial stability at 

central banks around the world.  At the Federal Reserve, we have devoted substantially 

increased resources to monitoring financial stability and have refocused our regulatory 

and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of systemic risk.  There have also been calls, 

from some quarters, for a fundamental reconsideration of the goals and strategy of 

monetary policy.  Today I will focus on a key question spurred by this debate:  How 

should monetary and other policymakers balance macroprudential approaches and 

monetary policy in the pursuit of financial stability? 

In my remarks, I will argue that monetary policy faces significant limitations as a 

tool to promote financial stability:  Its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as 

excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less
