some consumers, but potentially risky for others.  And we have proposed to ban compensation 

methods that give originators incentives to steer borrowers to loans with higher rates or 

disadvantageous terms.  

Credit Card Protections 

 Credit card regulations issued by the Federal Reserve in December 2008 and the 

provisions of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act)  

enacted by Congress last May combined to create the most comprehensive and sweeping 

regulatory reforms of credit cards in the history of the product.  In large part, these reforms 

respond to concerns that consumers could not accurately predict the costs associated with their 

credit cards and therefore could not make informed decisions about the use of credit.   

 The regulations improve credit card disclosures and establish a new baseline for 

transparency and fairness in the credit card industry.3  Based on extensive consumer testing, the 

Fed substantially revised the disclosures provided with credit card solicitations and disclosures 

contained in periodic statements to improve consumers’ understanding of costs associated with 

using their cards.  In addition, we imposed several new restrictions to ban certain practices, such 

as double-cycle billing, that increase the cost of credit in ways that cannot be effectively 

disclosed.  Except in certain limited circumstances, issuers are prohibited from increasing 

interest rates applied to existing balances.  They must also provide adequate notice of higher 

rates to be applied to future balances and are required to apply payments in excess of minimum 

payments to the balances that carry the highest interest rate.
