company may include in its consolidated liquidity buffer only qualifying assets held by a 

subsidiary U.S. bank that are in excess of the amount of the projected net cash outflows of the 

subsidiary bank and that can be transferred to the holding company without statutory, regulatory, 

supervisory, or contractual restrictions.  The Federal Reserve has also adopted rules requiring 

certain foreign banking organizations (FBOs) with large U.S. operations to hold financial 

resources in the United States commensurate with their U.S. liquidity risk.15       

Supervisory programs are also being used to supplement the Basel measures, in a manner 

roughly comparable to our practice in the area of capital regulation.  The very nature of 

quantitative liquidity standards means the effectiveness of the rules could wane over time 

because of changes in funding markets, reductions in the liquidity of assets previously deemed 

liquid, or regulatory arbitrage.  Furthermore, it is difficult for any standardized quantitative 

liquidity regulation to capture all relevant risks.  For instance, a bank’s short-term funding can be 

more or less stable depending on the structural characteristics of a firm’s funding providers.   

The LCR distinguishes between broad categories of funding counterparties, such as financial 

institutions and non-financial companies.  But it does not differentiate in a more granular way 

among entities that may behave very differently under stress, such as traditional banks and 

money market mutual funds.16      

15 FBOs with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must meet liquidity risk-management standards and 
conduct internal liquidity stress tests.  An FBO’s U.S. intermediate holding company must maintain a liquidity 
buffer in the United States based on the results of a 30-day liquidity stress test.  The U.S. branches and agencies of 
an FBO must maintain a liquidity buffer in the United States equal to the liquidity needs for 14 days, as determined 
by an internal liquidity stress test.  In addition, the Board has indicated that it intends to apply the Basel III liquidity 
rules to large U.S. operations of FBOs.  These requirements are comparable to local liquidity requirements imposed 
by the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, although the authority’s branch-level liquidity 
requirements are somewhat more flexible. 
16 Similarly, the effective liquidity of short-term loans that a bank may count as an inflow under the LCR is in part 
dependent on the nature of the bank’s relationship with the borrower.  A bank’s liquidity risk-management 
framework should recognize that, even under stress, it may be reluctant to refuse to roll over short-term credit to 
customers that it would like to retain in the longer run.
