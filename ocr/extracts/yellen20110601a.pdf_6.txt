stock market fall within the ranges prevailing in recent decades, and are well below the early-

2000 peak, although corresponding measures for small-cap equities (not shown) appear 

somewhat elevated.  In the residential real estate market, price-to-rent ratios are now somewhat 

below their long-run averages, in sharp contrast with the situation immediately before the 

financial crisis.   

Notwithstanding this general view, some areas warrant our ongoing attention.  As shown 

in figure 2, credit spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds have dropped sharply since the 

financial crisis.  This decline partly reflects improvements in earnings and corporate balance 

sheets, but also lower risk premiums.  One measure of risk premiums, the forward spreads far in 

the future, are extremely low compared with historical norms for high-yield bonds, suggesting 

that investors have become more willing to assume credit risk.  In the syndicated leveraged loan 

market, strong inflows appear to have contributed to an increase in prices.  I will return to 

developments in this market and discuss their potential ramifications shortly. 

Rapid debt growth may also signal emerging imbalances.  In recent quarters, issuance of 

high-yield bonds by nonfinancial corporations has been robust.  As shown in figure 3, credit 

flows have also been solid in the syndicated leveraged loan market, with a substantial amount of 

this credit being ultimately provided by nonbank institutional investors such as loan mutual 

funds, pension funds and insurance companies.  Nonetheless, a portion of the recent corporate 

issuance has been used to refinance existing debt, and small business lending remains quite 

weak.  Overall, despite a recent pickup in commercial and industrial lending, we see little 

evidence that financial institutions are significantly expanding the level of private credit, on net.  

Of course, these aggregate measures provide only a limited picture of overall credit 

conditions.  Another type of evidence comes from surveys of market participants’ practices.  For
