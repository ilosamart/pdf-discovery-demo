employed detailed forward guidance and conducted large-scale asset purchases, while the 

European Central Bank has moved to reduce the perceived risk of sovereign debt, 

provided banks with substantial liquidity, and offered qualitative guidance regarding the 

future path of interest rates. 

With short-term rates near zero, expanded guidance about intentions for future 

policy has helped to shape market expectations, which in turn has eased financial 

conditions by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and helped support 

economic activity.  Forward guidance about the short-term interest rate supplements the 

broader policy framework I described earlier, by providing information about how the 

Committee expects to achieve its stated policy objectives despite the complications 

created by the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate and uncertainties about the 

costs and efficacy of the available policy tools.  Beginning with qualitative guidance, the 

Committee’s communication about its anticipated future policy has evolved through 

several stages.  In December 2012, the Committee introduced state-contingent guidance, 

announcing for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be 

anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between 

one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above 

the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations 

continued to be well anchored.12  My colleagues and I emphasized that the conditions 

stated in that guidance were thresholds, not triggers.  That is, crossing one of the 

thresholds would not automatically give rise to an increase in the federal funds rate 

target; instead, it would signal only that it would be appropriate for the Committee to
