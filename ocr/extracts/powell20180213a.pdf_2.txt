It is both humbling and a great privilege to be standing here today.1  I am 

particularly honored by the trust and faith that the President has placed in me and by the 

Senate’s quick action in confirming me.  There is no greater honor than public service, as 

Randy, Lael and all of our colleagues here at the Fed would agree.   

The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve the goals of stable prices and 

maximum employment.  Price stability means that businesses and households can make 

important decisions without concern for high or volatile inflation.  Maximum 

employment means that those who want a job either have one or can find one reasonably 

quickly.  We also have important responsibilities for the stability of the financial system 

and for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including our largest 

banks.  Through regulation that is both effective and efficient, we seek to ensure that 

credit, which is vital for a healthy economy, will be available to families and businesses 

throughout the business cycle, so they can invest in a brighter future.  

These are awesome responsibilities, and the Congress has wisely entrusted us 

with an important degree of independence so that we can pursue our monetary policy 

goals without concern for short-term political pressures.  As a public institution, we must 

be transparent about our actions so that the public, through its elected representatives, can 

hold us accountable.  Over the past 25 years, the Fed has been a leader among central 

banks in improving transparency.  Today, we are open and accountable.  We strive to 

explain our actions in a way that enhances the public’s understanding of our goals and
