future path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings 

of long-term securities.10  While these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not 

apply to the federal funds rate, we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from 

the Great Recession, and we would do so again if needed.11 

Of course, economic conditions may evolve quite differently than anticipated in 

the baseline outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run.  If so, as I emphasized 

earlier, the FOMC will adjust monetary policy as warranted.  As our March decision and 

the latest revisions to the Summary of Economic Projections demonstrate, the Committee 

has not embarked on a preset course of tightening.  Rather, our actions are data 

dependent, and the FOMC will adjust policy as needed to achieve its dual objectives. 

Financial market participants appear to recognize the FOMC’s data-dependent 

approach because incoming data surprises typically induce changes in market 

expectations about the likely future path of policy, resulting in movements in bond yields 

that act to buffer the economy from shocks.  This mechanism serves as an important 

“automatic stabilizer” for the economy.  As I have already noted, the decline in market 

expectations since December for the future path of the federal funds rate and 

accompanying downward pressure on long-term interest rates have helped to offset the 

contractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign 

growth.  In addition, the public’s expectation that the Fed will respond to economic 

                                                 
10 With regard to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC could increase its size by resuming large-
scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.  Alternatively, 
the FOMC could increase the duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings without expanding the size of its 
portfolio by selling assets with relatively short residual maturities and buying equal amounts of assets with 
relatively long residual maturities.  Studies suggest that either action would reduce the term premiums 
embedded in longer-term interest rates considerably.
