objective.   

To what extent does it make sense to look through the recent low inflation 

readings on the grounds they are transitory?  It appears that temporary factors, such as 

discounted cell phone plans, are pushing down inflation to some extent this year.  By the 

same token, it is likely that other temporary factors--for example, prescription drug 

prices--boosted inflation last year.  Going forward, we should see a temporary boost to 

headline inflation due to Hurricane Harvey’s effect on gasoline prices that I mentioned 

earlier.  Temporary factors, by their nature, have little implication for the underlying 

trend in inflation.   

In contrast, what is troubling is five straight years in which inflation fell short of 

our target despite a sharp improvement in resource utilization.  It is instructive to put the 

shortfall in inflation in recent years in perspective by comparing inflation in the past few 

years with the last time the economy was in the neighborhood of full employment--

namely, just before the financial crisis.  In particular, over the past three years, 

unemployment has averaged roughly 5 percent.  Similarly, over the three years ending in 

early 2007--before the unemployment rate started rising--the unemployment rate also 

averaged 5 percent.  Despite a similar degree of resource utilization, core inflation 

averaged 2.2 percent from 2004 to 2007, notably higher than the comparable three-year 

average inflation rate today of 1.5 percent.  Why is inflation so much lower now than it 

was previously?  The fact that the period from 2004 to 2007 had inflation around target 

with similar unemployment rates casts some doubt on the likelihood that resource
