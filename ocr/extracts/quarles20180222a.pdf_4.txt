average 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis.  Why 

productivity growth has been so weak defies easy explanation.  The weak pace of 

business investment is likely part of the story.  In addition, some have argued that there 

has been a decline in business dynamism following the crisis; others do not link the 

slowdown to the crisis but rather to an exogenous slowdown in the rate of technological 

progress; and still others believe that productivity growth has not really slowed much at 

all and, instead, is just not being measured correctly in the official statistics.  Regardless, 

given the importance of productivity growth for the long-run potential of the economy 

and living standards, it is vitally important that policymakers pursue policies aimed at 

boosting the growth rate of productivity.       

Another aspect of the economy that has attracted a lot of attention is the apparent 

low level of inflation despite the tightness in labor markets.  The 12-month increase in 

headline PCE prices was 1.7 percent in December, a touch below the Fedâ€™s 2 percent 

objective.  After assessing the recent data, my take is that the current shortfall in inflation 

from target as most likely due to transitory factors that will fade through 2018, pushing 

inflation back up to target.  Suffice to say, a deviation from our target of a few tenths of 

1 percentage point, especially one I expect to fade, does not cause me great concern. 

Against this economic backdrop, with a strong labor market and likely only 

temporary softness in inflation, I view it as appropriate that monetary policy should 

continue to be gradually normalized.  An important component of this normalization was 

initiated in October, when we started to gradually scale back our reinvestment of 

proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency 

securities.
