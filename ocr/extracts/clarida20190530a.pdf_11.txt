composition, and trajectory impact broader financial conditions.  And as we stated in 

January, although adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate are our 

primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy, we are prepared to adjust the 

details of the plans for balance sheet normalization based on economic and financial 

developments. 

   At its March meeting, the Committee announced that it would slow the pace of 

the runoff of the securities holdings in its SOMA portfolio, and that it plans to cease 

balance sheet runoff entirely by September.16  Since starting the process of balance sheet 

normalization in 2017, the Federal Reserveâ€™s securities portfolio has shrunk by about 

$500 billion (roughly 2-1/2 percent of GDP) and the level of reserve balances has 

declined about $700 billion.  Consistent with our decision in March, we began to slow the 

pace of runoff of our balance sheet earlier this month.  When the process of normalizing 

the size of our balance sheet concludes in September, we expect that our reserves 

liabilities will, for a time, likely remain somewhat above the level necessary for an 

efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.  If so, we plan after September 

to hold the size of our securities holdings constant for a while.  During this period, 

reserve balances will continue to decline gradually as currency and other nonreserve 

liabilities increase.  At the point that the Committee judges that reserve balances have 

declined to the level consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of 

                                                 
16 Specifically, we slowed the balance sheet runoff in May by reducing the cap for monthly redemptions of 
Treasury securities from $30 billion to $15 billion; see Board of Governors (2019b).
