would suggest that a focus on the actual nature of liabilities associated with a firm’s activities 

provides a good starting point for sound analysis. 

 Finally, let me mention asset managers briefly.  As they have garnered increasing shares 

of financial system assets, a trend that accelerated following the financial crisis, the question has 

arisen whether they too should hold capital buffers.  Of course in most cases the asset manager 

itself does not have much of a balance sheet at all.  The funds themselves are often not leveraged, 

in which case nearly all the liabilities are shares of the fund held by investors, the price of which 

varies to reflect the value of the assets purchased by the manager of the fund.6   

While some commentators have suggested that liquidity challenges and consequent fire 

sale type behavior might develop if the structure of the fund places a premium on exiting first, 

these kinds of risks would support an argument less for capital buffers than for some form of 

prudential market regulation, such as rules on liquidity or redemptions.  I would note in this 

regard that last week the SEC issued a proposed rulemaking that would require open-ended funds 

to have liquidity risk management controls in place for shareholder redemptions, including 

during times of stress.7  Likewise, to the degree that certain idiosyncratic risks might exist with 

respect to the decisions and operations of certain asset managers, their liability structure again 

suggests that some form of prudential market regulation would be better suited to address these 

risks. 

                                                 
6 Through the use of certain kinds of derivatives, some funds acquire synthetic leverage.  There are arguments for 
additional regulation in those cases, though again, capital requirements do not seem at first glance the optimal tool. 
7 Under the proposed rules, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds would be required to implement liquidity risk 
management programs to address investor redemptions, including swing pricing during times of rapid redemption 
and calculation requirements to measure the amount of assets that could be liquidated without impacting market 
prices.  Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release 2015-201, SEC Proposes Liquidity Management Rules
