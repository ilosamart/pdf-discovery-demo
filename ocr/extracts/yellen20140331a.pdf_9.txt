Reserve has been actively using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which 

brings me to why the amount of slack is so important.   

If unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the 

jobs available, then the Federal Reserve’s efforts to create jobs would not be very 

effective.  Worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from 

the Fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk.  In fact, judging how much slack 

there is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my Federal 

Reserve colleagues and I consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our 

inflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment.  

This is not just an academic debate.  For Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and 

Vicki Lira, and for millions of others dislocated by the Great Recession who continue to 

struggle, the cause of the slow recovery is enormously important.  As I said earlier, the 

powerful force that sustains them and others who keep trying to succeed in this recovery 

is the faith that their job prospects will improve and that their efforts will be rewarded.   

Now let me explain why I believe there is still considerable slack in the labor 

market, why I think there is room for continued help from the Fed for workers, and why I 

believe Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and Vicki Lira are right to hope for better days 

ahead. 

One form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the 

unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which I have touched on already.  For example, 

the seven million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job.  This 

number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past 

experience, and the existence of such a large pool of “partly unemployed” workers is a
