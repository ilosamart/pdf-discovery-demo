objectives--namely, price stability and full employment.  Because temporary shifts in the 

rate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on 

expectations, they have only a transitory effect on inflation.  As a result, the central bank 

can “look through” such short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy, 

allowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price 

stability at risk.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy 

over the past decade or more.  Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation 

dynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over 

the next few years.   

On balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well 

anchored at present.  Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected 

inflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation 

derived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-

indexed ones, called TIPS.  Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term 

inflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent years 

despite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the 

potential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy.  The fact that these 

survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that 

prevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full 

employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its 

pre-recession average level of about 2 percent. 

This conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer-run 

inflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’
