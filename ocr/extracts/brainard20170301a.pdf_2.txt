The economy appears to be at a transition.  We are closing in on full employment, 

inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, 

and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time.  

Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional 

accommodation, continuing on a gradual path.1 

As normalization of the federal funds rate gets further under way, monetary 

policy too is approaching a transition, prompting increased focus on the balance sheet.  

How the federal funds rate and the balance sheet should be adjusted individually and in 

combination depends on the degree to which they are substitutes, their relative precision, 

and the degree to which their effects on the economy are well understood. 

Let me start with the outlook and then turn to policy. 

Progress at Home and Abroad 

Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity 

both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from 

abroad was considerable.  Between the middle of 2014 and 2016, a combination of 

notable fragilities and risks in large foreign economies, elevated sensitivity of the dollar 

to policy divergence, a sharp decline in oil prices, and financial marketsâ€™ heightened 

sensitivity to these downside risks slowed progress in the U.S. economy and the 

adjustment of monetary policy to an extent few had anticipated.  After being an important 

constraint in the past few years, the external environment currently appears more benign 

than it has been for some time, even though risks remain.
