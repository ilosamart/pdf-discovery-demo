guidance, I sat down with our supervision staff and went through each of the examples as 

if we were in a loan closing conference.  Based on what was discussed during those 

conversations and my close reading of the guidance, I think the best way to bridge the 

gap in perception is through well-documented facts.  For example, to support the value of 

a construction project, the bank would need current information on the project status, 

including an estimate of the cost to complete.  It would also need documentation of the 

method of realizing value for the completed project.  For instance, if the borrower has a 

take-out permanent loan commitment, the file should include an update on the status of 

the commitment including any conditions to closing.  If the property is under a sales 

contract, the bank should document the buyers’ continued willingness and ability to 

close.  If the bank is relying on other resources of borrowers or guarantors for repayment, 

it should have global cash flow information to be able to assess their ability to continue to 

carry the loan until conditions improve.  The fact that the loan has a good payment 

history and is performing is important, but not sufficient to make the case that resources 

are available to keep it current in the future.  Finally, the bank should have either a 

current appraisal or sufficient current market information to credibly update the 

assumptions in the most recent appraisal.  If market conditions are changing rapidly, 

“current information” may need to be more up-to-date than is usually the case.  

Examiners generally are not expected to challenge the underlying valuation assumptions, 

including discount rates and capitalization rates, used in appraisals or evaluations when 

these assumptions differ only in a limited way from norms that would generally be 

associated with the collateral under review.
