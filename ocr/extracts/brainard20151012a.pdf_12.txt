the decade before the financial crisis.7  This observation receives substantial support from 

a number of rigorous empirical papers over the past year that have estimated the longer-

run equilibrium federal funds rate to be lower now than previously.8  The projection of a 

relatively low neutral rate over the next few years also receives some weight in the 

September 2015 Summary of Economic Projections.  Most FOMC participants lowered 

their estimate of the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate in the long run, and 

a majority of participants now forecast a level no higher than 3.62 percent--down from 

4.12 percent in September 2012.9  A lower equilibrium funds rate implies a higher 

probability of policy being constrained by a lower bound for nominal interest rates. 

 Second, the ability of policymakers to react to unexpected shocks using 

conventional tools remains highly asymmetric in the neighborhood of an effective lower 

bound.  From the perspective of risk management, in today’s circumstances, we have 

considerably greater latitude to adjust the path of policy in response to inflation that 

exceeds current forecasts than we have to provide additional accommodation in response 

to additional adverse shocks. 

Consider two possible scenarios.  First, many observers have suggested that the 

economy will soon begin to strain available resources without some monetary tightening.  

                                                 
7 In Japan, the level is currently around 0.3 percent, down from an average of 1.5 percent in the decade 

before the crisis. 
8 Building on the work of Laubach and Williams (2003), both Hamilton, Harris, Hatzius, and West (2015) 

and Kiley (2015), for example, have recently constructed alternative estimates of the longer-run 

equilibrium federal funds rate. While these papers differ in their estimates and acknowledge a considerable 

amount of uncertainty, they all weigh in on the side of a relatively low equilibrium federal funds rate over 

the next few years.
