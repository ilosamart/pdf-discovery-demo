While the unemployment rate is now lower than before the financial crisis, the 

employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains about 1 percentage point 

below its pre-crisis level.  It is an open question what portion of the prime-age Americans 

who are out of the labor force may prove responsive to tight labor market conditions. 

While it is difficult to know with precision how much slack still remains, I am 

seeing more evidence that labor markets are tightening, and wages are accelerating, 

although at a measured pace.  The 12-month change in the employment cost index (ECI) 

for private industry workers in the first quarter was 2.8 percent, up from 2.3 percent in 

the year-earlier period.  By way of comparison, in the period from 2005 to 2007, just 

before the financial crisis, the ECI rose a bit more than 3 percent at an annual rate, while 

core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was around 2-1/4 percent.  I am 

hearing anecdotes of labor market shortages in particular occupations and sectors, 

echoing a theme in our recent Beige Book.  Going forward, I will be looking for 

confirmation in other measures of wages that labor market tightness is feeding through to 

wage gains.   

Sustainably Achieving Our Inflation Objective  

Turning to the second leg of our dual mandate, in the most recent data, the trailing 

12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.8 percent, up from a year earlier, when core 

PCE prices increased only 1.6 percent.  Overall PCE prices, which include the volatile 

food and energy sectors, increased 2.0 percent, largely reflecting the recent run-up in 

crude oil prices.  While the recent core PCE data are somewhat encouraging, we will 

                                                 
typically much lower--around 2 percent today--compared with high school noncompleters--currently 
around 6 percent.
