that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as 

unemployment remained above 6½ percent and inflation was projected to be no more 

than 2½ percent one-to-two years ahead.   

These unconventional tools appear to have been effective in helping promote the 

economic recovery.  In particular, research largely supports the conclusion that changes 

in guidance influenced interest rate expectations, that asset purchases pushed down 

longer-term interest rates and boosted asset prices, and that these improvements in 

financial conditions contributed to the economic recovery in recent years.2  The 

unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent at its 2009 peak to 6.6 percent today, 

although debate continues over whether significantly lower labor force participation rates 

and other labor market indicators should be read to indicate somewhat less progress than 

the unemployment rate alone would suggest.  But, while the recovery has been 

frustratingly slow and remains incomplete, there has been real progress, despite the fact 

that in the past couple of years a restrictive fiscal policy has been working at cross-

purposes to monetary policy, and that balance sheet repair and financial strains in Europe 

have made it more difficult for the economy to muster much self-sustaining momentum.
