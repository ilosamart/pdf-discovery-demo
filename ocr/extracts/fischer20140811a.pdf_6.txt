sector during the recovery period, the significant drag--now waning--from fiscal policy, 

and the negative impact from the growth slowdown abroad--particularly in Europe--are 

all prominent factors that have constrained the pace of economic activity.    

The housing sector was at the epicenter of the U.S. financial crisis and recession 

and it continues to weigh on the recovery.  After previous recessions, vigorous rebounds 

in housing activity have typically helped spur recoveries. In this episode, however, 

residential construction was held back by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed 

properties and by tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages.  Moreover, 

the wealth effect from the decline in housing prices, as well as the inability of many 

underwater households to take advantage of low interest rates to refinance their 

mortgages, may have reduced household demand for non-housing goods and services.    

Indeed, some researchers have argued that the failure to deal decisively with the housing 

problem seriously prolonged and deepened the crisis.6  Growth in other countries that 

experienced financial crises, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain, has been 

weighted down by struggling residential sectors.  More recently, many of these factors 

have abated in the United States and yet, after encouraging signs of improvement in 2012 

and in early 2013, over the past year the growth of residential construction has faltered 

and home sales have fallen off.  The sharp rise in mortgage interest rates in mid-2013 

likely contributed to this setback. 

The stance of U.S. fiscal policy in recent years constituted a significant drag on 

growth as the large budget deficit was reduced.  Historically, fiscal policy has been a 

support during both recessions and recoveries.  In part, this reflects the operation of
