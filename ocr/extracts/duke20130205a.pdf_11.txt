 Recognizing that a large part of good performance comes from factors that are more 

difficult to measure statistically, the researchers examined a sample of comments in examination 

reports and found that thriving banks benefited from a strong and localized customer service 

focus with high visibility in the community, conservative underwriting, and products that were 

profitable and met customer needs.  They supplemented their review of examination reports by 

interviewing management at some of the thriving banks.  The bankers they interviewed attributed 

their success to strong ties to the community, relationship banking, conservative underwriting, 

and a focus on products and markets they understood.  These results were strikingly similar to 

the results of interviews in separate studies at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City

 and the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

 These studies confirm what experience has already taught me:  Community banks that 

have deep ties to the community, engaged managers and directors, conservative underwriting, 

and strong risk management can not only survive, but thrive, even in adverse conditions.    

Using Research to Shape Supervisory Guidance on Lending 

 While much of our regulatory work recently has involved implementing the requirements 

of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are also continuing to review the lessons we learned during the crisis 

and the results of our recent research.  In most cases, this work is more likely to result in 

supervisory guidance than regulation.  Supervisory guidance is commonly viewed as a means to 

restrict activity but, in fact, during the crisis much of the guidance we issued actually directed
