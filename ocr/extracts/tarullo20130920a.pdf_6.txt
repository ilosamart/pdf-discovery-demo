official sector representatives.  One important exception is a speech delivered in 

September 2000 by the late Andrew Crockett, then the General Manager of the BIS.

  For 

several reasons, that speech is a good point of reference for us today—as a nod to Sir 

Andrew’s foresight, as an occasion for regret that his words were not more closely 

heeded by regulators,
8
 and as a way of illustrating how the challenge of macroprudential 

financial regulation has grown in the years since. 

Sir Andrew’s speech contained much that is now familiar and broadly accepted, 

but was fairly uncommon at the time: He distinguished between the objectives of 

microprudential regulation—protecting against idiosyncratic risk in a bank—and 

macroprudential regulation—protecting against systemic risk.  He set forth a description 

of the financial cycle that could be read as a loose paraphrase of Hyman Minsky’s theory 

of financial instability.

  He identified the procyclical and asset-correlation concerns 

regarding large bank activities that have commanded so much attention in the past several 

years.  And, again foreshadowing many recent discussions, he suggested macroprudential 

tools both to increase resiliency (as through capital regulation with a systemic 

perspective) and to lean against the wind in an effort to slow or limit the growth of 

unsustainable asset bubbles (as through maximum loan-to-value ratio requirements).

 Andrew D. Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements and Chairman of the 

Financial Stability Forum (2000), “Marrying the Micro- and Macro-Prudential Dimensions of Financial 

Stability,” speech delivered at the Eleventh International Conference of Banking Supervisors in Basel, 

Switzerland, September 21, www.bis.org/review/rr000921b.pdf.

 Reading between the lines, one wonders whether Sir Andrew anticipated that his call for action might not 

be taken up by banking regulators.  He styled his remarks as “provocative” and concluded by suggesting 

they were but “a small awareness-raising step in what, if pursued, is likely to be a long road.”

 Crockett, 2000 speech: “A review of the instances of financial instability would reveal some shared 

stylised elements.  There is first an over-extension phase during which financial imbalances build up, 

accompanied by benign economic conditions. In this phase, asset prices are buoyant and their surge tends 

to feed, and be fed by, rapid credit expansion, domestically or internationally.  Leverage, in overt or hidden 

forms, accumulates in balance sheets, masked in part by the favourable asset price developments.  The 

trigger for a reversal is essentially unpredictable.  It can originate either in the financial sphere (e.g., an 

asset price correction) or in the real economy (e.g., a spontaneous unwinding of an investment boom).  The 

process then moves into reverse.  Ex post, a financial cycle is evident.”
