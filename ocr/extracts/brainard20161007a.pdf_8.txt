institutions will work properly every day.  Confidence has built over time that when 

market participants trade, accurate and timely clearing and settlement will follow.    

Thus, robust security is an important element of any system.  The distributed 

nature of this new technology, combined with the fact that many connected participants 

can update the shared ledger, means that end-point security is another critical component 

of any successful implementation of the technology.  Adverse actors that can take over a 

participantâ€™s access to the ledger remains a key security concern, as thefts of 

cryptographic keys in Bitcoin continue to demonstrate.  Thus, advances in cryptography 

will remain a key priority to enable widespread adoption of distributed ledger 

technologies, along with systems for securing private keys, the management of access to 

private keys, and differentiated permissions for participants in the system to read and 

write to the ledger.  Recent episodes have illustrated the importance of having protocols 

agreed at the outset to determine whether and under what circumstances to reverse 

transactions once they have been recorded in a distributed master ledger. 

Finally, it will be important that users and administrators of distributed ledger 

technologies can meet their responsibilities to combat money laundering, terrorist 

financing, and other key law enforcement concerns.  Some of the new technologies 

would potentially allow authorized access to certain data records in a much more efficient 

manner than has previously been possible.  For example, distributed ledgers could be 

developed to collect personally identifiable information and country identifiers that 

enable banks to identify and report on suspicious activity.  It will be important that these 

new technological developments and their implementation perform in a safe and sound 

manner that is transparent and satisfies regulatory requirements.
