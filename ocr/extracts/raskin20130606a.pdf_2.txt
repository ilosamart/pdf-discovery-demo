Good morning and thank you to the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Financial 

Institutions (DFI) for the invitation to come to Columbus to share some thoughts with you on 

Ohio Bankers Day.   

In my remarks this morning, I want to describe some features of an appropriate 

regulatory capital framework for banks--focusing on community banks--and I’ll cut to the chase  

by setting out what I believe to be two imperatives in finalizing this framework.  Each of these 

imperatives has, at its core, the inherent goals of minimizing uncertainty and promoting safety 

and soundness.  These imperatives are timeliness and simplicity.

To explain why timeliness--by which I mean timely implementation of final capital rules 

in the United States--and simplicity are imperative, it helps to set the stage.  And to do that, I 

have to go back in time.  Way back, in fact, to when I was a child growing up in a small town in 

Illinois, just minutes away from the Indiana border.  There was no bank in our town, but there 

was one in the next town over, which was where my family and our neighbors would do their 

banking.  The bank probably had no more than $30 million in assets.  On Saturday mornings, my 

mother (who essentially was the CFO of the family financial unit) would toss me in the back seat 

of the car and drive over to deposit my parents’ paychecks, which, in those days before ATMs, 

meant visiting a teller.  If there were no checks to deposit, Saturday morning would be when my 

mother would go to withdraw cash for the week.  “Get in this line,” my mother would order.  

“We want Shirley.”   

Sometimes, we would end with a visit to the vault.  To my seven-year-old self, going to 

the vault was deadly serious, a ritual that began by signing in with a stern-looking man who held 

the keys.  It felt like entering a cave and looking at gold, although in retrospect I suspect my 

mother was only checking on insurance policies or her passbook savings.  After the vault, back
