As the inflationary forces that eventually led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods 

system gathered strength in the 1960s and 1970s, the focus of monetary policy shifted to 

the maintenance of the domestic value of the currency.  In the decades that followed, 

central banks began to place greater emphasis on the stabilization of inflation, and that 

trend has continued to date.4 

Although this shift in emphasis originated in the advanced economies, emerging 

market and developing economies eventually followed suit, with many of them bringing 

down high rates of inflation and formally adopting an inflation targeting policy 

framework.  Even in countries without formal inflation targeting frameworks, 

stabilization of inflation remains an important objective, sometimes alongside other 

important objectives such as stabilization of the external value of the currency, 

stabilization of the macroeconomy, financial stability, and the development of the 

monetary and financial systems. 

The U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy 

In the United States, the Federal Reserve has, since 1977, been operating under a 

dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability.5  Our main 

challenge, since the global financial crisis, has been to make rapid (or at least as rapid as 

possible) progress toward achieving these objectives.  While it has taken a long time, and 

extraordinary monetary policy actions, the U.S. economy is now close to full 

employment, with core inflation, at 1.2 percent, below our 2 percent inflation target, but, 

                                                 
4 Note that the reference here is to the stabilization of inflation rather than just keeping inflation low. 
5 While the dual mandate, with equal weight on employment and inflation, is exceptional among leading 
central banks, I believe that central banks with a legislated or declared sole or primary goal of maintaining 
price stability in practice rarely, if ever, act as if the level of employment or economic activity is of little 
concern.
