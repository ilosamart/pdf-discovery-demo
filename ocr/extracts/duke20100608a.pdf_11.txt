levels, which in turn leads to fewer new accounts.  At the same time, senior loan officers at 

commercial banks continue to report weak borrower demand for mortgages and for consumer 

loans.8    

The fact that consumers are shedding debt is not surprising, as households report a 

heightened awareness of their debt burden.  For instance, in a recent survey, one in three 

households surveyed reported that they are stressed about their ability to pay their debt.  Among 

delinquent borrowers, the stress is even more pronounced, with 84 percent reporting being 

particularly stressed and 86 percent reporting being devoid of sufficient savings.9  One potentially 

positive outcome of this stress would be if it gives consumers an incentive to save and makes them 

wary to take on debt unless they are sure of their ability to pay.  In combination with regulations 

that require creditors to consider the borrower’s ability to pay and disclosures that are clear about 

the cost of credit, these hard lessons could lead to more sustainable credit decisions by lenders 

and borrowers alike. 

Balancing Access to Credit and Risk Management  

 In the course of our country’s history we have seen the standard of living and economic 

prosperity that can result from a robust consumer credit market.  We have also seen the financial 

devastation and personal tragedy that can result from weak underwriting and poor loan structures 

recklessly marketed to consumers in ways that hide their potential cost.  Certainly the lessons of 

the recent crisis underscore the need for a stronger, safer, but still robust system of consumer 

credit.  As both industry and policymakers explore what changes are necessary and what a better-

functioning system would look like, I would suggest five core principles for balancing access to 

credit and sound risk management:
