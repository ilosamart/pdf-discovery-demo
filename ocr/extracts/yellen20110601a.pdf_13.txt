identified at an early stage--is difficult at best given the bluntness of the monetary policy tool and 

the uncertain lags with which it operates.  For these reasons, the use of monetary policy to 

address financial imbalances should generally remain a last resort. 

Conclusion 

 The Federal Reserve is fully engaged in monitoring financial markets for potential 

imbalances and developing the tools necessary to carry out that task.  These ongoing efforts 

include attempting to recognize early signs of misaligned valuations in asset markets and 

increases in leverage.  At present, we see few indications of significant imbalances, and the use 

of leverage appears to remain well below pre-crisis levels.  That said, I’ve noted some recent 

developments that warrant close attention, including indications of potentially stretched 

valuations in certain U.S. financial markets and emerging signs that investors are reaching for 

yield.  Should broader concerns emerge, I believe that supervisory and regulatory tools, 

including new macroprudential approaches, rather than monetary policy, should serve as the first 

line of defense.
