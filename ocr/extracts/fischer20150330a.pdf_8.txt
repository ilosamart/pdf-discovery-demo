To promote solvency, one could impose ratio-type capital requirements, such as 

leverage ratio requirements or risk-based requirements.  An alternative is to require that 

firms perform regular stress tests to demonstrate that they can remain solvent and 

continue to lend even under stress.  In the Fed’s case, it has chosen to impose all of these 

requirements on banks, but these requirements cannot simply be applied, as is, to 

nonbanks.   

It is well known that solvency and liquidity can be difficult to separate during 

stress periods because fears about solvency, even if unfounded, can prompt a run.  Thus, 

one could also imagine promoting both solvency and liquidity at some nonbanks by 

imposing restrictions on their structure or activities in ways that reduce the likelihood of 

runs.  An example of this is recent changes by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC) in regulations for prime money market mutual funds.  Starting in 2016, prime 

institutional money funds will be required to publish a floating net asset value rather than 

a stable value of $1 per unit.  Stable-value funds, as we saw during the crisis, can be 

vulnerable to an unexpected “break the buck” event that leads to a run.  Under the new 

rules, funds can also impose limitations on withdrawals of liabilities and can impose 

liability redemption fees.  The SEC considered requiring money market funds to hold 

some capital but chose not to do so.  Only time will tell whether the adopted reforms have 

the intended run-damping effects, but if they do, capital will be much less necessary. 

Some may raise concerns that increased regulation of nonbanks will only increase 

moral hazard and increase risk to the system on net.  But moral hazard may already be 

present.  Over the past 20 years and more, governments have sometimes acted to contain 

damage from distress at nonbanks because of the economic damage that might have
