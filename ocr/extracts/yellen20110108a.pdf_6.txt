the effect of arbitrageurs is limited by their risk aversion or by market frictions such as 

capital constraints.  Consequently, the term structure of interest rates can be influenced 

by exogenous shocks in supply and demand at specific maturities.  Purchases of longer-

term securities by the central bank can be viewed as a shift in supply that tends to push up 

the prices and drive down the yields on those securities. 

In the context of such an analytical framework, the effect of an asset purchase 

program also depends on investors’ perceptions of the future path of short-term interest 

rates as well as their perceptions of the timing and pace of the central bank’s eventual 

unwinding of its asset purchases.  Thus, central bank communication may play a key role 

in influencing the financial market response to such a program. 

Recent empirical work provides a rough gauge of the quantitative effects of 

longer-term securities purchases.5  For example, event studies have investigated the 

short-term response of asset prices to announcements by the Federal Reserve and the 

Bank of England regarding their respective asset purchase programs.  And regression 

analysis has been used to estimate statistical models that embed predictions from a 

specific theoretical framework.  

Table 1 summarizes the response of selected financial variables on four dates 

associated with the Federal Reserve’s first round of asset purchases.  On November 25, 

2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $600 billion in agency 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt.  On December 1, Chairman

other central banks; for example, see D’Amico and King (2010); Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack 
(2010); Hamilton and Wu (2010); and Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong (2010).
