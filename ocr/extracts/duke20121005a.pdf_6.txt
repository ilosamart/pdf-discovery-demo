all too often, the private market is not likely to solve the problem on its own.  In such cases, 

government authorities and public resources may be required.   

Of course, not all vacant properties pose a problem for the local community, as some 

homes become briefly vacant during the usual process of changes in ownership.  But the longer a 

home stands vacant, the greater likelihood that poor maintenance and the associated problems 

that result can become serious issues for the surrounding community.  Statistics from the 

American Housing Survey show that properties that have been vacant for longer than two years 

are much more likely to have severe problems, such as cracked floors or walls, broken or 

boarded up windows, and a roof or foundation in disrepair, that make these properties harder to 

rehabilitate and less appealing to prospective buyers. 

Segmenting the Inventory of Long-Term Vacancies  

Analysis by Federal Reserve Board staff has calculated the fraction of housing units in 

each census tract that has been vacant for at least two years--which I will refer to as “long-term” 

vacancy--and categorized tracts that appear in the top 10 percent of this distribution into three 

types.11 

The first category of high long-term vacancy census tract is an area where a large 

percentage of housing units were built post-2000, and that therefore can be thought of as 

“housing boom” tracts.  These locations also have a higher median income, higher median house 

value, and a larger fraction of residents with at least a college degree than other high long-term 

vacancy census tracts.  Examples of metropolitan areas with a large number of tracts in this 

category are Denver, Colorado; Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Phoenix, Arizona.   

                                                 
11 The vacancy data are from the USPS and the tract characteristics are from the five-year sample of the 2010 
American Community Survey.
