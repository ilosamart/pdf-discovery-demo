a moment, the lack of a tight relationship between capital flows and interest rates 

suggests that other factors also have been important. 

Even though interest-rate differentials and capital inflows do not always move in 

the same direction, numerous empirical studies have shown that interest rates do in fact 

help explain capital flows once other determinants of these flows are also taken into 

account.6  In particular, when U.S. rates decline relative to those in EMEs, private capital 

flows to EMEs tend to rise, consistent with investors rebalancing toward higher-yielding 

assets.  In a similar vein, event studies have shown that the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy 

announcements, including those related to asset purchases, have been associated with 

capital flows to EMEs as well as upward movements in EME currencies and asset 

prices.7  But the role of monetary policy in driving capital flows and the effects of those 

flows on EMEs should not be overstated.  In this regard, I will offer two considerations. 

First, many factors affect capital flows to EMEs, not just the stance of advanced 

economy monetary policy.  Differences in growth prospects across countries and the 

associated differences in expected investment returns are important factors.8  Chart 2 

shows the growth rate of real GDP for EMEs and advanced economies.  Given their stage 

of development and demographic profile, EMEs should grow faster than advanced 

economies on a trend basis.  As shown by the line in the right panel, EME growth has, in 

fact, consistently outpaced that of the advanced economies.  In addition, the bounceback 

of the EMEs from the global financial crisis widened this differential even more,
