can under some circumstances be added to the model, with the amount of 

money supplied by the central bank having to be consistent with the money 

demand equation.  But inflation in such a situation is not necessarily caused 

by the quantity of money; rather the quantity of money may be caused by and 

consistent with the inflation rate resulting from the three basic equations in 

which the money stock does not appear--in particular from the gap between 

the natural and actual rates of interest.  For this result to go through, the 

money stock cannot per se be among the variables that determine the 

equilibrium of the remaining--the non-monetary--part of the model.  This 

means that the separation result is not possible if there is a real balance effect 

operating in the goods markets.  Or to put the result differently, the separation 

feature is consistent with an inside money monetary system, while it may well 

not be consistent with an outside money structure.  It is thus consistent with 

the suggestion by Harry Johnson mentioned above, that monetary analysis 

might better be carried out primarily in an inside-money than an outside-

money model. 

This neo-Wicksellian result is somewhat surprising.  It provides 

justification for the behavior of those central banks that think and talk of 

monetary policy purely in terms of the policy interest rate and other financial 

return variables, but not of the money stock.  However, we need to remind 

ourselves that it is built on an assumption that the money stock per se does not
