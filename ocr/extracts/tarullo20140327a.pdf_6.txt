clearly the principle that the specific characteristics of domestic markets may call for regulation 

of foreign banks in the host country, not just at a consolidated level. 

In short, the work of the Basel Committee over the years has not been directed at 

restraining host-country authorities from supervising and regulating foreign banking operations 

in their country.  On the contrary, the committee has repeatedly asserted the complementary 

responsibilities of both home and host countries to oversee large, internationally active banking 

groups, in the interests of both national and international financial stability.  And the committee 

has frequently returned to this set of issues in responding to developments that pose a threat to 

the safety and soundness of the international financial system. 

The Shift in Foreign Bank Activities 

Unfortunately, neither the Basel Committee nor national regulators responded in a timely 

fashion to the magnitude of the expansion in scale and scope of the world’s largest banking 

organizations in the roughly 15 years before the financial crisis.  As illustrated in figure 1, at the 

end of 1974, just before the Basel Committee was created, the assets of the world’s 10 largest 

banking organizations together equaled about 8 percent of global GDP.  The three largest were 

all American--BankAmerica, Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan.  But their combined assets were 

equal to less than 3½ percent of world GDP and, as illustrated in figure 2, about 10 percent of the 

GDP of their home country, the United States.  By 1988 the combined assets of the world’s 10 

largest banking organizations as a proportion of world GDP had nearly doubled to about 15 

percent, a ratio that held constant during the succeeding decade, at the beginning of the emerging 

market financial crisis in 1997. 

 Then the explosive growth began.  In the next decade--that is, up to the onset of the 

financial crisis in 2007--the combined assets of the world’s 10 largest banks as a share of global
