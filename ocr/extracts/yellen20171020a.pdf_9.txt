Congress granted the Federal Reserve that authority in 2006, to become effective in 2011.  

However, in the fall of 2008, the Congress moved up the effective date to October 2008.   

Having authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the Federal 

Reserve can influence the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates regardless 

of the amount of excess reserves in the banking system.  The mechanics of the new 

framework are straightforward:  Banks will generally only provide short-term funding at 

an interest rate around or above what they could earn at the Fed.  As a result, if the 

Federal Reserve raised the rate it paid, other short-term lending rates would likely rise as 

well.11  This new approach for raising short-term interest rates is working well:  Since 

December 2015, we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range 

for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate has 

risen accordingly.12 

A Closer Look at Our Balance Sheet Strategy 

In light of our recent decision to start reducing our securities holdings this month, 

I would like to discuss a few aspects of our balance sheet strategy.13  The FOMC 

anticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities 

                                                 
11 The Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed to help strengthen its influence 
over short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.  For instance, the overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement facility allows a variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-
sponsored enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions to invest funds overnight with the Federal 
Reserve at a rate determined by the FOMC.

to other short-term interest rates, see Alyssa Anderson, Jane Ihrig, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Gretchen

Interest Rates?” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2),
