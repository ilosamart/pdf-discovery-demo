because debt can impair the ability of the holding company to serve as a source of strength to 

subsidiary banks.  However, the Board also recognizes that limited access to equity funding by 

small institutions means that the transfer of ownership of small banks often requires the use of 

acquisition debt.   

The policy statement allows small, noncomplex bank holding companies to operate with 

higher levels of debt than would normally be permitted, subject to restrictions to ensure that 

higher debt does not pose an undue risk to subsidiary banks and that leverage is reduced over 

time.  Bank holding companies that are subject to the policy statement are exempt from the 

Boardâ€™s risk-based and leverage capital guidelines, and are subject to reduced regulatory 

reporting requirements.18     

The original policy statement set the maximum size of qualifying holding companies at 

$150 million in total consolidated assets.  This threshold was increased to $500 million in 2006 

to address the effects of inflation, industry consolidation, and asset growth.  The intervening 

eight years have obviously brought dramatic changes in the financial, business, and regulatory 

environments.  Accordingly, I believe it is worth considering raising the asset threshold once 

again, this time to $1 billion.  Approximately 85 percent of all bank holding companies qualified 

after the threshold was raised in 2006, a figure that has dropped to about 75 percent today.  

Raising the threshold to $1 billion would recoup that lost coverage and go a bit further, covering 

89 percent of holding companies. 

Such an increase would entail some policy tradeoffs, of course, which obviously become 

of greater concern as the threshold rises further.  But I think the balance of considerations argues 

                                                 
18 Bank holding companies with less than $500 million in assets may still be required to file regulatory reports with 

the same detail and frequency as larger bank holding companies if they meet certain criteria that are set forth in the 

instructions for the Federal Reserve FR Y-9SP and FR Y-9C regulatory reports 

(www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx) or to otherwise meet supervisory needs.
