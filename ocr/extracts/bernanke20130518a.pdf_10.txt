Well, what does all this have to do with creativity and critical thinking, which is 

where I started?  The history of technological innovation and economic development 

teaches us that change is the only constant.  During your working lives, you will have to 

reinvent yourselves many times.  Success and satisfaction will not come from mastering a 

fixed body of knowledge but from constant adaptation and creativity in a rapidly 

changing world.  Engaging with and applying new technologies will be a crucial part of 

that adaptation.  Your work here at Simonâ€™s Rock, and the intellectual skills, creativity, 

and imagination that that work has fostered, are the best possible preparation for these 

challenges.  And while I have emphasized technological and scientific advances today, it 

is important to remember that the arts and humanities facilitate new and creative thinking 

as well, while helping us to draw meaning that goes beyond the purely material aspects of 

our lives.  I wish you the best in facing the difficult but exciting challenges that lie ahead.  

Congratulations.
