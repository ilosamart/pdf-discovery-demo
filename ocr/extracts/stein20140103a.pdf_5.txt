degree of exposure to fire-sale risk.  That synergy, in our view, is at the heart of the 

business of traditional banking. 

We have developed a simple theoretical model that captures the main ingredients 

of this story and makes some further testable predictions.  It’s probably ill-advised over 

lunch, but I will take a crack at sketching this model for you here.  However, let me start 

with three stylized facts to motivate the theory.   

Stylized Facts   

The first fact, and the one that I suspect will surprise you the least, is the strong 

homogeneity of the liability side of banks’ balance sheets:  Banks are almost always and 

everywhere largely deposit financed.  For example, in the cross section, and using year-

end 2012 data, a bank at the 10th percentile of the distribution had a ratio of deposits to 

assets of 73.6 percent, while a bank at the 90th percentile had a ratio of 88.9 percent.

  A 

similar homogeneity is apparent in the time series:  Over the past 115 years, deposits 

have averaged 80 percent of bank assets, with a standard deviation of only 8 percent.  

These patterns are in sharp contrast to those for nonfinancial firms, for which capital 

structure tends to be much less determinate, both within an industry and over time.  They 

suggest that for banks--unlike non-financials, and counter to the spirit of Modigliani and 

Miller (1958)--an important part of their economic value creation happens on the liability 

side of the balance sheet, via deposit-taking.

 In this calculation and those that follow, we eliminated from the sample the very smallest banks--those 

with less than $1 billion in assets.  We did so because otherwise, these banks--which are extremely 

numerous but account for only a small fraction of total banking system assets--would dominate any 

statements we might make about percentiles of the population distribution.
