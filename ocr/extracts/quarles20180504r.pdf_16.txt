Of course, a host of complex issues underlie this decision, so I would just like to 

emphasize two general points.  First, a wide range of quantities of reserve balances--and 

thus overall sizes of the Fed’s balance sheet--could be consistent with either type of 

framework.  Second, while U.S. liquidity regulations likely influence banks’ demand for 

reserves, the Fed is not constrained by such regulations in deciding its operational 

framework, because U.S. banks will be readily able to meet their regulatory liquidity 

requirements using the range of available high-quality liquid assets, of which reserve 

balances is one type.   

Importantly, additional experience with the Federal Reserve’s policy of gradually 

reducing its balance sheet will help inform policymakers’ future deliberations regarding 

issues related to the long-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet, issues that will not need to 

be decided for some time.  

The final and most general point is simply to underscore the premise with which I 

began these remarks:  Financial regulation and monetary policy are, in important 

respects, connected.  Thus, it will always be important for the Federal Reserve to 

maintain its integral role in the regulation of the financial system not only for the 

visibility this provides into the economy, but precisely in order to calibrate the sorts of 

relationships we have been talking about today.
