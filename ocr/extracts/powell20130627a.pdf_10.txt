What of the potential costs or risks of the asset purchases?  A variety of concerns 

have been raised over time.  With inflation in check, the most important potential risk, in 

my view, is that of financial instability.  One concern is that our policies might drive 

excessive risk-taking or create bubbles in financial assets or housing.  A related worry is 

that the eventual process of reducing purchases and normalizing the balance sheet may 

itself be destabilizing or disruptive to the economy.  Indeed, recent volatility in markets is 

in part related to concerns about the possibility of a reduction in asset purchases.  I’ll 

address both of these broad concerns, starting with incentives for risk-taking. 

Monetary policy has helped to keep real interest rates low.  While longer-term 

real rates have turned positive in recent weeks, they remain at historically low levels.  

Experience suggests that low real rates, if maintained for a long time, can lead to asset 

price bubbles and eventually to financial instability.  But low rates are not solely or even 

primarily a result of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policies; they are 

rooted in the market’s expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic 

recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the 

advanced economies.7  Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns 

should be low across all asset classes.  The concern would be that these conditions, and 

our policies, could be encouraging irrational expectations of high returns.  Is there any 

sign of that now? 

By most measures, equity valuations seem to be within a normal range.  Whether 

one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option
