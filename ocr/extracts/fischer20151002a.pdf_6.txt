a Section 120 recommendation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).8  

More recently, the SEC has also proposed rules to modernize data reporting by 

investment companies and advisers, as well as to enhance liquidity risk management and 

disclosure by open-end mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds.9  Other 

provisions include the central clearing requirement for standardized over-the-counter 

derivatives and the designation by the FSOC of four nonbanks as systemically important 

financial institutions.10  The industry has also undertaken important changes to bolster the 

                                                   
 
8 The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development approved final rules for risk retention, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, in October 
2014 (Board of Governors and others, 2014).  Under the final rules, sponsors of almost all types of 
securities will have to hold a 5 percent stake in the securities, although securitizations that are collateralized 
by qualified residential mortgages (as defined by the agencies) are exempt from risk retention.  The intent 
of risk retention is to improve loan underwriting and securitization structuring by better aligning the 
interests of lenders, securitization sponsors, and investors.  The SEC adopted new MMF rules in July 2014 
(U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2014).  These rules include two key provisions:  a floating net 
asset value requirement for prime MMFs sold to institutional investors and a system of “standby” liquidity 
fees and temporary restrictions on redemptions, or “gates,” for all MMFs except government MMFs that 
can be imposed at the discretion of an MMF’s board when the fund’s liquidity is impaired.  These rules are 
intended to mitigate the vulnerability of MMFs to destabilizing runs.     
9 On May 20, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to enhance and modernize disclosure of portfolio information 
and risks by registered investment companies, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
(U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2015a).  The proposals would require funds to disclose to the 
SEC and the public more information about their borrowing, usage, and terms of derivatives and repurchase 
agreements, securities lending activity, and sensitivity to interest rates.  In addition, the proposal would 
introduce structured reporting formats to facilitate analysis of the data by the SEC and the public.  Also on 
May 20, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to require investment advisers to report more information about the 
assets, borrowing, and derivatives exposures of the separately managed accounts that they manage (U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 2015a).  On September 22, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to enhance 
liquidity risk management by mutual funds and ETFs (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
2015b).  The proposal would require each of these funds to adopt a liquidity risk-management program, 
categorize the liquidity of every portfolio asset, set its own minimum share of “three-day liquid assets,” and 
disclose information about portfolio liquidity and the use of lines of credit and inter-fund lending.  The 
proposal also would allow mutual funds to use “swing pricing,” a process of adjusting the net asset value of 
a fund’s shares to pass on to purchasing or redeeming investors more of the costs associated with their 
trading activity.  
10 The Dodd-Frank Act requires that standardized swaps that previously traded in over-the-counter (OTC) 
markets be cleared through central counterparties, and that large participants in standardized swap markets 
be subject to heightened regulation.  These requirements are meant to address the vulnerabilities in the 
OTC derivatives market that were highlighted by the 2008 financial crisis.  The Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC are tasked with implementing the Dodd-Frank Act provisions
