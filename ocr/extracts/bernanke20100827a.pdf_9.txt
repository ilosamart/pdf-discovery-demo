At this juncture, the risk of either an undesirable rise in inflation or of significant further 

disinflation seems low.  Of course, the Federal Reserve will monitor price developments 

closely. 

In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss the policies the Federal Reserve is 

currently using to support economic recovery and price stability.  I will also discuss some 

additional policy options that we could consider, especially if the economic outlook were 

to deteriorate further. 

Federal Reserve Policy 

In 2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserve, along with policymakers around the 

world, took extraordinary actions to arrest the financial crisis and help restore normal 

functioning in key financial markets, a precondition for economic stabilization.  To 

provide further support for the economic recovery while maintaining price stability, the 

Fed has also taken extraordinary measures to ease monetary and financial conditions.   

Notably, since December 2008, the FOMC has held its target for the federal funds 

rate in a range of 0 to 25 basis points.  Moreover, since March 2009, the Committee has 

consistently stated its expectation that economic conditions are likely to warrant 

exceptionally low policy rates for an extended period.  Partially in response to FOMC 

communications, futures markets quotes suggest that investors are not anticipating 

significant policy tightening by the Federal Reserve for quite some time.  Market 

expectations for continued accommodative policy have in turn helped reduce interest 

rates on a range of short- and medium-term financial instruments to quite low levels, 

indeed not far above the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates in many cases.
