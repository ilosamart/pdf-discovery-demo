I am pleased to be here at the beginning of a new year to offer my assessment of 

recent economic developments and the economic outlook for 2011.  I also plan to discuss 

the actions that the Federal Reserve has been taking to support the economic recovery.  

Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the views that I will be presenting are my own 

and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) or the Board of Governors. 

Recent Economic and Financial Developments 

 In the third quarter of 2009, the U.S. economy began to emerge from the deepest 

recession of the post-World War II period--one that had been precipitated by a severe 

financial crisis.  Economic history teaches that such downturns typically are deeper, and 

that the pace of their subsequent recoveries is more moderate, than is the case for 

business cycles not associated with financial crises.  Certainly, that has been the U.S. 

experience for the past year and a half:  Real economic activity has been steadily 

recovering overall, but the speed and strength of the rebound have been restrained by 

significant financial headwinds.  

 Perhaps the most telling measure of the modest pace of the economic recovery is 

the painfully slow improvement in the labor market.  To be sure, we are seeing some 

signs of improvement in the data.  Indicators of hiring and job openings have continued 

to rise in recent months, and, more recently, new claims for unemployment insurance 

have begun falling again.  Still, 18 months into recovery, there are more than 7 million 

fewer jobs in the economy than there were just prior to the recession, and the 

unemployment rate remains stubbornly close to its peak.  American families have not 

experienced such a prolonged and severe period of unemployment since the early 1980s.
