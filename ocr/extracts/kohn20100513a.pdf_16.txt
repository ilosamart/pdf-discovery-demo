Reserve’s balance sheet can return completely to normal.  As a consequence, these types of 

purchases can increase inflation expectations among some observers who may see a risk that we 

will not reduce reserves and raise interest rates in a timely fashion.  So far, longer-term inflation 

expectations have generally been well anchored over the past few years of unusual Federal 

Reserve actions.  However, many unsettled issues remain regarding the linkage between central 

bank actions and inflation expectations, and concerns about the effect of the size of our balance 

sheet are often heard in financial market commentary.   

Lesson from Conducting Monetary Policy in a Crisis 

It is certainly too soon to fully assess all the lessons learned concerning the conduct of 

monetary policy during the crisis, but a few observations seem worth noting even at this early 

stage. 

First, commitments to maintain interest rates at a given level must be properly 

conditioned on the evolution of the economy.  If they are to achieve their objectives, central 

banks cannot make unconditional interest rate commitments based only on a time dimension.  

The Bank of Canada has recently illustrated that need by revising its time commitment based on 

changing circumstances.  To further clarify that the “extended period” language is conditional on 

the evolution of the economy, the FOMC emphasized in the November 2009 statement that its 

expectation that the federal funds rate is likely to remain at an “exceptionally low” level for an 

“extended period” depended on the outlook for resource utilization, inflation, and inflation 

expectations following the anticipated trajectories.  

Second, as I previously pointed out, firmly anchored inflation expectations are essential 

to successful monetary policy at any time.  That’s why central banks have not followed the 

standard academic recommendation to set a higher inflation target--either temporarily or, as has
