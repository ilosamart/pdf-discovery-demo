the subject of GAO policy audits, such as procurement decisions that may be brought to 

light only by the GAO’s attention, monetary policy decisions occur with all of the world 

watching.  They are announced immediately, described in an FOMC statement, often 

elaborated on in a press conference, and the subject of endless same-day-analysis and 

debate.  

With all of this transparency and analysis, very little would be revealed by GAO 

policy audits that would help evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy.  The benefits 

of frequent GAO policy audits would also be low because the effects of monetary policy 

are felt with a considerable time lag and are often only clear years later. 

Audit the Fed also risks inserting the Congress directly into monetary policy 

decisionmaking, reversing decades of deliberate effort by the Congress to insulate the 

Fed from political pressure in carrying out its day-to-day duties.  Indeed, some advocates 

of the bill have expressed support for complete elimination of the Federal Reserve.  Long 

experience, in the United States and in other advanced economies, has demonstrated that 

monetary policy is most successful when decisions are rendered independent of influence 

by elected officials.  As recent U.S. history has shown, elected officials have often 

pushed for easier policies that serve short-term political interests, at the expense of higher 

inflation and damage to the long-term health and stability of the economy.14

performance is Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. Summers (1993), “Central Bank Independence and 
Macroeconomic Performance:  Some Comparative Evidence,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 
vol. 25 (May), pp. 151-62.  More recent research finds the relationship to be less solid, however, in part 
because independent central banks have in several cases been instituted precisely because economic 
performance has been subpar; for example, see Christopher Crowe and Ellen E. Meade (2007), “The 
Evolution of Central Bank Governance around the World,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 21 (4), 
pp. 69-90; Christopher Crowe and Ellen E. Meade (2008), “Central Bank Independence and Transparency:  
Evolution and Effectiveness,” European Journal of Political Economy, vol. 24 (4), pp. 763-77; and 
N. Nergiz Dincer and Barry Eichengreen (2014), “Central Bank Transparency and Independence:  Updates 
and New Measures,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (1), pp. 189-259.
