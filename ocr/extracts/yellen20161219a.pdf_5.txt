While globalization will likely continue and technology will continue to advance, 

we don’t know how fast the economy will grow, what new technologies will be 

developed, or how quickly and consistently employment will expand.  What is 

considerably more certain, however, is that success will continue to be tied to education, 

in part because a good education enhances one’s ability to adapt to a changing economy. 

One reason for the increasing economic advantage of a college or graduate degree 

is the very slow growth of earnings in the last few decades for those with only a high 

school education.  It concerns me, as it should concern all of us, that many are falling 

behind.  Improvements in elementary and secondary education can help prepare more 

people for college and the opportunities college makes available, but for those who do 

not attend college, we must find other ways to extend economic opportunity to everyone 

in America.    

In discussing higher education, you may have noticed that I have spoken in terms 

of completing your degrees.  Research shows that a large share of the benefits I have 

described from higher education comes only to those who graduate.  Even those 

completing three or more years of college benefit much less when they don’t get a 

degree.5  For example, some of you may be worried about paying off loans you have 

taken out to pay for your education.  The good news is that the vast majority of student 

borrowers who complete their degrees find work that allows them to keep up with their 

payments and pay off their loans. 

Everything I have said so far could apply to the graduates this year of any college 

or university.  The rest of what I have to say is about you, the 2016 graduates of the
