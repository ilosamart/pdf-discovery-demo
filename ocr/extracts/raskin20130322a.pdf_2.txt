I am delighted to be here at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 

(NCRC) Annual Conference today, and to be gathered with so many people who have 

been working for decades to strengthen communities and the integrity of our nation’s 

economic institutions and financial practices.  Those of you involved in community 

development and community reinvestment know all too well the trauma and hardship 

experienced by low-income communities over the last several years. You know it in a 

way that is lost on people whose communities have not been so badly battered by these 

economic storms.  That’s why I’m looking forward this morning to sharing with you my 

perspective on the importance of focusing on the situation and prospects of low- and 

moderate-income working Americans. 

In my remarks, I will start by discussing the types of jobs being generated in the 

current recovery.  Certainly, the pace of recovery in employment has improved, but it’s 

important to look at the types of jobs that are being created because those jobs will 

directly affect the fortunes and challenges of households and neighborhoods as well as 

the course of the recovery.  I will then suggest that we think about how the absence of a 

substantial number of new high-paying jobs, when combined with changes in the 

landscape for financial services, affects access generally to affordable, sustainable credit.  

Finally, I will explore some of the monetary, supervisory, and regulatory touchpoints in 

which the situation and prospects of low- and moderate-income working Americans can 

be addressed. 

Challenges Posed by Labor Market Conditions  

The Great Recession stands out for the magnitude of job losses we experienced 

throughout the downturn.  These factors have hit low- and moderate-income Americans
