value of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy, 

and interpersonal and organizational skills.  These habits and skills help prepare people 

for work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and 

be in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials 

that are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings.  Indeed, a growing body of 

economic and education literature has focused on the relative efficiency of addressing 

workforce development challenges through investments in early childhood development 

and education compared with interventions later in life. 

I believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners
