understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a 

growing economy to double.  A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor 

productivity (or anything else that is growing) to double can be calculated by dividing 70 

by the growth rate.  When labor productivity was growing at 3-1/4 percent per 

year--during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973--it took 22 years for labor productivity to 

double.  Looking again at Figure 1, in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016, when labor 

productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1-3/4 percent, it would have taken 

approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double.  There is a vast difference 

between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are 

doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only 

every 41 years.   

Now, productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects--for example, 

capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging.    

And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not 

fundamentally changed our lives.  It has certainly changed our lives to some extent, and 

there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data.  But to 

figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth, we have 

to ask not whether there is bias, but whether the bias has increased.  To a first 

approximation, one could assume that the rate of bias is constant, and does not account 

for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the 

slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3  That is the conclusion most 

researchers reach, but the data issue is not settled.  As Bob Solow famously said, just

explain the deceleration of productivity.
