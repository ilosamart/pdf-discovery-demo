Good morning.  I am delighted to join you here today to discuss the state of 

community banking and issues of importance to community banks like yours.1  New York 

may be home to Wall Street, but, just like the rest of the country, most of the banks in the 

Second District are community banks.  There are more than 170 banking organizations 

here with less than $10 billion in assets, serving millions of customers. 

Community banks play an essential role in our financial system, supporting the 

economic health and vitality of the communities you serve.  Unlike many of your larger 

competitors, community banks offer customers face-to-face interaction with a local banker 

who has the authority to make the final decision on a loan--a banker with a long-term 

investment in the community who will not be moving to another branch in a new town 

within a few years.  Community bankers benefit from local knowledge and relationships 

that often lead to more successful and efficient lending decisions.  These advantages have 

enabled many community banks in the Second District and around the country to maintain 

or increase their local market shares while competing with larger regional and money 

center banks, and I expect that they will continue to do so. 

Nonetheless, community banks face significant challenges today.  The number of 

community banks has declined significantly over the past decade.  The Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation’s “Problem List” of at-risk banks has declined from 888 at the peak 

of the financial crisis to 291 at the end of 2014, but that is still well above typical pre-

crisis levels of fewer than 100. There are several factors driving consolidation and 

elevating the number of problem banks, beyond the lasting effects of the recession.  For 

starters, community banks have been challenged in some of your traditional product lines

Reserve System.
