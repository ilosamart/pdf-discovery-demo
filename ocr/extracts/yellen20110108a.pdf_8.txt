holdings is then maintained for about two years, and that the asset position is then 

unwound linearly over the following five years.9  

This trajectory of securities holdings causes the 10-year Treasury yield to decline 

initially about 1/4 percentage point and then gradually return toward baseline over 

subsequent years.  That path of longer-term Treasury yields leads to a significant pickup 

in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth relative to baseline and generates an 

increase in nonfarm payroll employment that amounts to roughly 700,000 jobs.10  It 

should also be noted that this exercise is performed as a deterministic simulation and 

hence does not capture the potential benefits of the asset purchase program in mitigating 

downside risks to economic activity and inflation. 

 I would also like to note that the same research paper analyzed the 

macroeconomic effects of the FOMCâ€™s full program of securities purchases, including the 

first round of purchases that was initiated in late 2008 and early 2009, the modification of 

the reinvestment policy that was announced last August, and the second round of 

purchases that was initiated in November.  Those simulation results indicate that by 2012, 

the full program of securities purchases will have raised private payroll employment by 

about 3 million jobs.  Moreover, the simulations suggest that inflation is currently a 

percentage point higher than would have been the case if the FOMC had never initiated 

                                                 
9 In addition, the federal funds rate is assumed to remain unchanged from baseline for several years and 
then to follow the prescriptions of a simple estimated policy rule; for further details, see Chung and others 
(2011). 
10 The simulation results are reported as deviations from baseline and hence eventually return to zero.   
In effect, under circumstances in which the baseline path involves a large and relatively persistent 
unemployment gap, these results can be interpreted as gauging the extent to which the policy stimulus 
accelerates the pace at which the economy returns to its balanced-growth path with maximum sustainable 
employment and low, stable inflation.
