prices began to rise more rapidly in the late 1990s.  Prices grew at a 7 to 8 percent annual 

rate in 1998 and 1999, and in the 9 to 11 percent range from 2000 to 2003.  Thus, the 

beginning of the run-up in housing prices predates the period of highly accommodative 

monetary policy.  Shiller (2007) dates the beginning of the boom in 1998.  On the other 

hand, the most rapid price gains were in 2004 and 2005, when the annual rate of house 

price appreciation was between 15 and 17 percent.  Thus, the timing of the housing 

bubble does not rule out some contribution from monetary policy. 

To try to assess the importance of that possible contribution, in the remainder of 

my remarks I will consider briefly two related questions.  First, the cumulative increase in 

housing prices shown in Slide 5 is quite large.  Can accommodative monetary policies 

during this period reasonably account for the magnitude of the increase in house prices 

that we observed?  If not, what does account for it?  Second, house prices rose 

significantly during this period in many industrialized countries, not just in the United 

States.  If monetary policy was an important source of house price appreciation in the 

United States, it seems reasonable to expect that, in an international comparison, 

countries with easier monetary policies should have been more likely to have significant 

rises in house prices as well.  Is that the case?  

With respect to the magnitude of house-price increases:  Economists who have 

investigated the issue have generally found that, based on historical relationships, only a 

small portion of the increase in house prices earlier this decade can be attributed to the 

                                                                                                                                                                 
purchased using so-called conforming mortgages, these indexes missed price movements in many houses 
financed with jumbo, alt-A, and subprime mortgages.  See Dokko and others (2009).
