as well as similar facilities throughout the country, allows students to play the role of a 

family head with financial challenges and opportunities, giving them a chance to practice 

financial decisionmaking in a realistic setting.  

Students and their parents can become financially literate together through 

exercises such as intergenerational homework assignments, which reinforce the concepts

To provide the most effective education, curriculums should also have clear 

standards and goals.  To that end, the federal government’s Financial Literacy and 

Education Commission, of which the Federal Reserve is a member, has identified five 

core competencies that should be covered by financial education:  earning and income, 

spending, saving and investing, borrowing, and protecting.  Behind each of these 

competencies is a set of related knowledge and skills, and corresponding behaviors.  For 

example, in the category of earning and income, students are expected to know the 

difference between gross pay and net pay, and information about benefits and taxes.  

With this knowledge, they can understand their pay stubs and take full advantage of their 

workplace benefits.  The five core competencies are reflected in the National Standards 

for Personal Finance being developed by the Council for Economic Education; several of 

our Federal Reserve System colleagues are working with the council on this project.
