Of course, there were considerable differences in how foreign economies were 

affected by the Fed’s policies.  Because the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also 

experienced slow growth after the financial crisis, their central banks adopted similar 

policies.  By contrast, the Fed’s accommodative policies put further upward pressure on 

asset prices and currencies in some emerging market economies (EMEs) that were 

already experiencing rapid output growth.  Thus, EME central banks had to navigate 

between tightening policy more--and hurting exports through a bigger exchange rate 

appreciation--and maintaining an accommodative stance closer to the Fed’s, but with a 

higher risk of overheating.4  These tradeoffs faced by EME central banks underscore 

some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence with the United States--a 

tradeoff with which I am personally very familiar.   

Spillovers from Recent Policy Tightening 

Monetary policy divergence remains a familiar theme today, but the focus has 

obviously shifted to the consequences of tighter U.S. monetary policy for the global 

economy.  Policy divergence is an ongoing concern given that most AFEs and many 

EMEs have continued to pursue highly accommodative monetary policies that remain 

appropriate in light of their weaker cyclical positions and subdued levels of underlying 

inflation.  Many observers point to the “taper tantrum” in 2013 as illustrating how 

monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve can potentially have strong contractionary 

effects on foreign financial conditions.  Subsequently, the expectation that a steadily 

improving U.S. labor market would call for tighter U.S. monetary policy--and hence 

imply greater monetary divergence with our trading partners--helped drive a sharp
