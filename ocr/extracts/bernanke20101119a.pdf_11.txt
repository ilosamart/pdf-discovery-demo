rates have seen their competitiveness reduced relative to those emerging market 

economies that have intervened more aggressively. 

It is striking that, amid all the concerns about renewed private capital inflows to 

the emerging market economies, total capital, on net, is still flowing from relatively 

labor-abundant emerging market economies to capital-abundant advanced economies.  In 

particular, the current account deficit of the United States implies that it experienced net 

capital inflows exceeding 3 percent of GDP in the first half of this year.  A key driver of 

this “uphill” flow of capital is official reserve accumulation in the emerging market 

economies that exceeds private capital inflows to these economies.  The total holdings of 

foreign exchange reserves by selected major emerging market economies, shown in 

figure 9, have risen sharply since the crisis and now surpass $5 trillion--about six times 

their level a decade ago.  China holds about half of the total reserves of these selected 

economies, slightly more than $2.6 trillion. 

It is instructive to contrast this situation with what would happen in an 

international system in which exchange rates were allowed to fully reflect market 

fundamentals.  In the current context, advanced economies would pursue accommodative 

monetary policies as needed to foster recovery and to guard against unwanted 

disinflation.  At the same time, emerging market economies would tighten their own 

monetary policies to the degree needed to prevent overheating and inflation.  The 

resulting increase in emerging market interest rates relative to those in the advanced 

economies would naturally lead to increased capital flows from advanced to emerging 

economies and, consequently, to currency appreciation in emerging market economies.  

This currency appreciation would in turn tend to reduce net exports and current account
