small-denomination domestic currency in circulation has been steadily declining since the 

1970s, leading us to believe that cash payments have similarly declined. 

Most interestingly, the recent period of economic weakness appears to have 

caused some consumers to shift away from credit cards not only as a source of credit but 

also as a method of payment.  As I said earlier, between late 2008 and early 2010, the 

value of credit card purchases declined 10 percent.  In comparison, although the rate of 

growth in debit card use slowed during the recession, debit card transactions did not 

decline in either volume or value.   

This shift from credit to debit makes sense from the perspective of the consumer.  

If credit is tight and consumption is contracting, consumers who are reluctant or unable to 

increase their debt levels can use debit cards to pay for current expenses out of current, 

rather than future, income.  In addition, for individuals with existing credit card balances, 

interest must be paid on new purchases as well as on previous balances.  Those 

individuals might seek to avoid interest charges on new purchases by using debit cards.  

This incentive is even stronger in the presence of higher credit card interest rates.  

Finally, some consumers might use debit cards to track their spending in real time when 

budgets are tight. 

Regulatory Changes in Consumer Credit and Payments 

In addition to the economic recession and recovery, the regulations governing 

consumer payment and credit products changed significantly in the past few years.  So it 

is especially difficult to separate the effects of economic conditions from regulatory 

effects on credit and debit card usage.
