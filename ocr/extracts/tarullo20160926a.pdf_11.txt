specified floor at this current CCB level to avoid any reduction in the stringency of the 

regulatory capital rules.  A firm’s buffer requirement would be recalculated after each year’s 

stress test, and its capital plan would not be approved in CCAR if the plan indicated that the firm 

would fall into the buffer under the stress test’s baseline projections.  

Let me use a hypothetical example to illustrate how the SCB would work.  Assuming that 

a firm’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio declines in CCAR’s severely adverse scenario from 

13 percent to 8 percent, that firm’s SCB would be the greater of 2.5 percent or the 5 percent 

decline--thus, 5 percent.  Assuming further that this firm is a GSIB with a surcharge of 3 percent 

and that the countercyclical buffer is not in effect, the firm would be constrained in making 

capital distributions that would bring its common equity tier 1 capital ratio under 12.5 percent.  

The 12.5 percent figure is the sum of the 4.5 percent minimum common equity tier 1 risk-

weighted capital requirement, the 3 percent surcharge, and the 5 percent stress loss as calculated 

in annual stress test.10 

Because the GSIB capital surcharge already exists as an additional buffer requirement in 

the regulatory capital rules, the stress capital buffer approach would effectively add the GSIB 

capital surcharge to our estimates of the amount of capital needed under stress.  This would 

generally result in a significant increase in capital requirements applicable to the GSIBs, for most 

of which CCAR has been their binding capital constraint.  But having both the stress loss buffer 

and the capital surcharge included in our capital requirements is wholly consistent with the 

reasons for having a capital surcharge in the first place.  Indeed, not having the two together has 

actually been an anomaly that arose from the sequencing of the various capital strengthening 

measures we have undertaken.
