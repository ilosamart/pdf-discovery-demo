Great Recession.  Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved 

significantly since before the crisis. 

Perhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United 

States and abroad.3  This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for 

years and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-

taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.  These factors’ contributions are 

highly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the 

decline in neutral rates are important.  All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates 

increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower 

bound in future economic downturns.  That development, in turn, could make it more 

difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business 

investment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.4 

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less 

responsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between 

inflation and employment.5  This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.  

It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during 

downturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained 

inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment

contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); 
and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018). 
4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound 
and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others 
(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019). 
5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research as a 
flattening of the short-run Phillips curve.  For evidence of this flattening in the slope of the Phillips curve in 
the United States and abroad, see, among others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, 
and Summers (2015); and Bank for International Settlements (2017).
