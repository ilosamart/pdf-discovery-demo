accommodation, between December 2008 and March 2010, the FOMC elected to 

purchase large amounts of longer-term Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed 

securities (MBS).  Those purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates 

generally and helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long-term 

Treasury rates, which had widened during the financial crisis.  Reducing longer-term 

rates influences the economy in much the same way as lowering the expected path of 

short-term rates.  For instance, the decline in longer-term rates lowers the cost and 

increases the availability of capital and credit, which in turn encourages business 

expansion.  In the most recent episode, another important result of lower rates has been a 

reduction in debt service burdens from existing debt.  Households in particular have 

significantly reduced mortgage payments through refinancing.  And numerous small 

business owners have told me that they could not have survived the downturn without 

low rates. 

Economic activity picked up in early 2010, but by the time the FOMC met in 

August, the rate of growth seemed to be slowing and inflation continued to drift lower.  

In addition, lower mortgage rates were resulting in faster prepayment of mortgages 

underlying the agency MBS held by the Federal Reserve.  To avoid the modest monetary 

tightening that would result from the Fedâ€™s gradually shrinking portfolio of agency MBS, 

the FOMC voted to reinvest all principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in 

longer-term Treasury securities.  The Committee also began a discussion about the 

strength of the recovery, the amount of slack in the economy, the likely path of inflation, 

and the appropriate action to provide additional monetary accommodation should such 

action be deemed necessary.  In November, the FOMC judged that additional monetary
