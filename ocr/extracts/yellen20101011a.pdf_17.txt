In the implementation of macroprudential supervision, I believe it will be 

similarly advantageous to put in place a system of controls in which fixed rules play an 

important role while a place is preserved for the discretionary judgments of regulators.  

Fixed rules will diminish the need for policymakers to make the difficult decision to take 

away the punch bowl.  Moreover, if discretionary macroprudential policy interventions 

are deferred until a boom is well under way, the macroeconomic spillovers could prove 

difficult for monetary policy to offset.   

For these reasons, a stronger system of prudential controls designed to mitigate 

the buildup of systemic risk must be put into place, a system that will incorporate 

mechanisms to automatically counter pro-cyclical behavior.  All the same, discretionary 

interventions will inevitably play a part in macroprudential supervision.  For one thing, 

it’s important to keep in mind that financial institutions have been very adept at gaming 

rule-based systems.  And, over time, there is always an incentive for risky financial 

activities to migrate outside the perimeter of supervision and regulation, even if that 

perimeter is moving.  That’s precisely what happened prior to the mortgage crisis, when 

leverage ballooned in the shadow banking system and investment banks and some 

nonbanks became principal participants in credit derivatives markets.  Furthermore, the 

financial system will evolve in ways that preclude any wholly rule-based system from 

countering all emerging systemic threats.  Discretionary macroprudential interventions 

are certain to be needed to address dangerous developments, and judgment must play a 

role. 

A second consideration in macroprudential supervision relates to the need for 

robust policies.  This concern derives from the observation that we still have a lot to learn
