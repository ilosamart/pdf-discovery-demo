the projections.  Of course, the economy has looked to be poised for a breakout several 

times since 2009, only to disappoint.  Will this time be different? 

There are, in my view, good reasons to believe that the economy will continue to 

gain strength.  I would point in particular to the housing sector, which in prior recoveries 

has been an important engine of growth.  For the first two years of the current recovery, 

housing contributed nothing to growth, as housing investment hovered at extremely low 

levels.  House prices declined sharply through most of 2011, wiping out about half of 

home equity and restraining consumer spending.  But the housing market finally began to 

recover in early 2012, and that recovery seems to be proceeding strongly.  Single-family 

housing starts have risen by more than 40 percent over the past two years, albeit from a 

low base.  House prices are up more than 10 percent over the past 12 months.  A better 

housing market has helped boost consumer attitudes from very low levels and supported 

consumer spending.  The housing sector is still being held back by limited credit 

availability for less-creditworthy homebuyers and tight conditions for homebuilders.  But 

overall trends suggest to me that the housing recovery can continue for many years and 

become an important contributor to growth.   

The labor market has also made real progress, as I will discuss in a moment.   

Auto sales have nearly returned to pre-recession levels.  Our financial system is far 

healthier and better capitalized than it was before the crisis.  And after losing one-half of 

its value during the financial crisis, the stock market now exceeds its pre-recession peak 

in nominal terms.   

Growth would be higher this year but for U.S. fiscal policy.  The Congressional 

Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the
