been too pessimistic in our forecasts of the unemployment rate.  For example, over the 

past year unemployment has declined notably more quickly than we or other forecasters 

expected, even as GDP growth was moderately lower than expected a year ago.  This 

discrepancy reflects a number of factors, including declines in participation, but an 

important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery; intuitively, 

when productivity gains are limited, firms need more workers even if demand is growing 

slowly.  Disappointing productivity growth accordingly must be added to the list of 

reasons that economic growth has been slower than hoped.17  (Incidentally, the slow pace 

of productivity gains early in the recovery was not evident until well after the fact 

because of large data revisions--an illustration of the frustrations of real-time 

policymaking.)  The reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear:  It may 

be a result of the severity of the financial crisis, for example, if tight credit conditions 

have inhibited innovation, productivity-improving investments, and the formation of new 

firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to use capital 

and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement.  Notably, productivity growth has 

also flagged in a number of foreign economies that were hard-hit by the financial crisis.  

Yet another possibility is weak productivity growth reflects longer-term trends largely 

unrelated to the recession.  Obviously, the resolution of the productivity puzzle will be 

important in shaping our expectations for longer-term growth. 

To this list of reasons for the slow recovery--the effects of the financial crisis, 

problems in the housing and mortgage markets, weaker-than-expected productivity 

growth, and events in Europe and elsewhere--I would add one more significant factor--
