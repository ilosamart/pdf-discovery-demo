rates throughout the economy, and since December 2008, the target has been near zero.  To 

improve mortgage market functioning and support housing markets and economic activity more 

broadly, the Federal Reserve has purchased large amounts of debt and mortgage-backed 

securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae in addition to purchasing long-

term Treasury securities to help improve conditions in private credit markets. 

 In the context of the enormous stress in many markets that characterized the financial 

crisis, the Federal Reserve also established new lending facilities and expanded existing facilities 

to respond to the unusual absence of liquidity in important markets and thereby enhanced the 

flow of credit to businesses and households.  In particular, the Federal Reserve has provided 

support to securitization markets, which had been an important source of funding for loans to 

households and businesses.  Securitization markets (other than those for mortgages guaranteed 

by the government or government-sponsored enterprises) essentially shut down in mid-2008.  In 

response, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the Treasury Department, developed the Term 

Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  The TALF promotes the issuance of securities 

backed by loans to households and small businesses, including auto loans, credit card loans, 

student loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  In 2009, the 

program was broadened to allow investors to use the TALF to finance both existing and newly 

issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). 

  The TALF helped restart securitization markets and increase the availability of credit to 

small businesses and consumers.  To date, the TALF program has helped finance 480,000 loans 

to small businesses, 2.6 million auto loans, 876,000 student loans, more than 100 million credit 

card accounts, and 100,000 loans to larger businesses.  Included among those business loans are 

4,900 loans to auto dealers to help finance their inventories.  About half of the SBA securities
