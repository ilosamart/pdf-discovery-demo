I would like to thank Daniel Yergin for his kind invitation to speak this evening at 

the CERAWeek conference.  The energy industry--more precisely, the price of oil--is on 

the minds of almost everyone these days, and this conference is addressing many 

important issues.  I am a macroeconomist, and do not plan on focusing tonight on 

developments in the energy sector.  But from time to time the price of oil becomes a 

macroeconomic issue, and this is one of those times.  So I have been listening intently to 

the many experts who have already spoken here today, and look forward to the discussion 

that will follow this speech, in the belief that I will emerge with a better understanding of 

recent and future developments in the industry.   

To get things started, I thought I could provide some background on recent 

monetary policy decisions.1   

As you all know, at our December meeting the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage 

point, to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.2  At our meeting in January, we decided to maintain that 

range.  The increase in December came after seven years during which the FOMC had 

kept the federal funds rate between 0 and 25 basis points.  This ultra-low rate was in 

keeping with our congressional mandate to pursue a monetary policy that fosters 

maximum employment and price stability, which we define as 2 percent inflation.   

Our decision in December was based on the substantial improvement in the labor 

market and the Committee’s confidence that inflation would return to our 2 percent goal
