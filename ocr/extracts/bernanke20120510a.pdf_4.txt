The credit quality of large banks’ assets is looking better as well, although the 

improvements have been uneven across types of loans.  In the aggregate, delinquency 

rates on loan portfolios at large banks have declined substantially from their peaks.  

However, while delinquencies on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and consumer 

loans have fallen to the lower end of their historical ranges, delinquencies on loans 

backed by commercial or residential real estate have declined only moderately and 

remain elevated. 

The profitability of large banks has been edging up as credit quality has firmed 

and banks have trimmed noninterest expenses.  Even so, large banks’ profitability 

remains well below the levels that prevailed before the financial crisis began, and banks 

continue to struggle to expand their revenues.  Developments that can be traced back to 

the financial crisis--including a still-weak economy, changes in market conditions and 

practices, and tighter financial regulations--are clearly important reasons for these trends. 

Community banks play important roles in local economies, and so it is notable 

that their condition has also improved.  Their regulatory capital ratios have increased 

significantly since 2009 and stand well above their recent norms.  As has been the case at 

large banks, delinquency and charge-off rates at community banks have declined across 

most major categories of loans, and fewer institutions failed in 2011 than in each of the 

previous two years.  That said, clusters of small bank failures can affect credit availability 

in a community while bank-dependent borrowers work to establish new relationships 

with surviving institutions.  In addition, while standard measures of community banks’ 

profitability, such as return on equity and assets, improved last year, as was also true at
