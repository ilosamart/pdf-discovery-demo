outstripped growth in the advanced economies (the solid red line).  These differences are 

partially attributable to longer-term differences in growth potential between the two 

groups of countries, but to a significant extent they also reflect the relatively weak pace 

of recovery thus far in the advanced economies.  This point is illustrated by figure 2, 

which shows the levels, as opposed to the growth rates, of real gross domestic product 

(GDP) for the two groups of countries.  As you can see, generally speaking, output in the 

advanced economies has not returned to the levels prevailing before the crisis, and real 

GDP in these economies remains far below the levels implied by pre-crisis trends.  In 

contrast, economic activity in the emerging market economies has not only fully made up 

the losses induced by the global recession, but is also rapidly approaching its pre-crisis 

trend.  To cite some illustrative numbers, if we were to extend forward from the end of 

2007 the 10-year trends in output for the two groups of countries, we would find that the 

level of output in the advanced economies is currently about 8 percent below its longer-

term trend, whereas economic activity in the emerging markets is only about 1-1/2 

percent below the corresponding (but much steeper) trend line for that group of countries.  

Indeed, for some emerging market economies, the crisis appears to have left little lasting 

imprint on growth.  Notably, since the beginning of 2005, real output has risen more than 

70 percent in China and about 55 percent in India.  

In the United States, the recession officially ended in mid-2009, and--as shown in 

figure 3--real GDP growth was reasonably strong in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the 

first quarter of this year.  However, much of that growth appears to have stemmed from 

transitory factors, including inventory adjustments and fiscal stimulus.  Since the second 

quarter of this year, GDP growth has moderated to around 2 percent at an annual rate,
