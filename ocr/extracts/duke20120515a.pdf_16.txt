But perhaps the most important solution that I am suggesting today is that 

policymakers move forward with the difficult decisions that will affect the future of the 

mortgage market.  To be sure, important issues need to be addressed and hard questions 

remain to be answered.  It will not be easy to decide what to do about the GSEs, or how 

best to promote a robust secondary market, or what form crucial regulations should 

ultimately take.  And it is unlikely that anyone will fully agree with the final decisions 

that are made.  Nevertheless, until these tough decisions are made, uncertainties will 

continue to hinder access to credit, the evolution of the mortgage finance system, and the 

ultimate recovery in the housing market.  I don’t want to diminish the importance of any 

individual policy decision, but I do believe that the most important prescription for the 

housing market is for these decisions to be made and the path for the future of housing 

finance to be set.  It’s time to start choosing that path.
