The Causes of Reduced Lending to Small Businesses 

 Numerous factors have contributed to the reduced lending to small businesses.  For 

instance, for most commercial banks, the quality of existing loan portfolios continues to 

deteriorate even as levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans remain on the rise.  Throughout 

2009, loan quality deteriorated significantly for both large and small banks, and the latest data 

from the fourth quarter indicate continuing elevated loss rates across all loan categories.  

Anecdotal information suggests that, while consumer delinquencies may be close to peaking, 

other types of lending such as CRE and small business lending are likely to see delinquencies 

and charge-offs continue to rise for some time to come.  In response to a special question in the 

January SLOOS, a large net fraction of banks reported that the credit quality of their existing 

C&I loans to small firms was worse than that for their loans to larger firms in the fourth quarter.  

In addition, respondents did not, on net, anticipate an improvement in the performance of their 

small loan portfolio over the next year.  Accordingly, banks have reduced existing lines of credit 

sharply and tightened their standards and terms for new credit.  While some businesses are being 

denied credit due to a recent history of payment problems, even businesses with excellent 

payment records may find credit restricted or unavailable due to weakened balance sheets, 

reduced revenues or falling real estate collateral values.  Further, businesses that qualified for 

credit under more accommodative conditions may not meet new tighter standards.  Credit 

conditions may be particularly tight for small businesses because their finances are, in many 

instances, very closely intertwined with the personal finances of their owners.  Data from the 

Federal Reserve’s 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances showed that approximately 

11 percent of households own and actively manage a small business.2  Of these households,
