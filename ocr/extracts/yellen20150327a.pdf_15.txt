continue to expand in line with its expectations--a view that is also supported by the 

research literature.11  

A second reason for the Committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy 

accommodation relates to asymmetries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the 

vicinity of the zero lower bound.  In the event that growth in employment and overall 

activity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent 

objective, the FOMC can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation.  But if 

growth was to falter and inflation was to fall yet further, the effective lower bound on 

nominal interest rates could limit the Committee’s ability to provide the needed degree of 

accommodation.  With an already large balance sheet, for example, the FOMC might be 

concerned about potential costs and risks associated with further asset purchases.   

Research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming 

constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the 

more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current 

policy should lean in accommodative direction.12  In effect, such a strategy represents 

insurance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and 

11 A number of studies have shown, using model simulations, that policymakers can improve 
macroeconomic performance by adjusting the stance of monetary policy more cautiously in response to 
changes in economic conditions when the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is uncertain.  For a
