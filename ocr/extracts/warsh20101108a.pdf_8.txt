The goals of the Federal Reserve’s policies are to promote economic recovery and to help 

ensure price stability, consistent with our mandate.  I am less optimistic than some that additional 

asset purchases will have significant, durable benefits for the real economy.  Of course, benefits 

may well be more substantial than I anticipate.  Lower risk-free rates and higher equity prices--if 

sustained--could strengthen household and business balance sheets, and raise confidence in the 

strength of the economy.  Modestly higher rates of inflation could increase nominal growth, and 

ostensibly place the economy on a stronger trajectory. 

But, expanding the Fed’s balance sheet is not a free option.  There are significant risks 

that bear careful monitoring by the FOMC.  If the recent weakness in the dollar, run-up in 

commodity prices, and other forward-looking indicators are sustained and passed along into final 

prices, the Fed’s price stability objective might no longer be a compelling policy rationale.  In 

such a case--even with the unemployment rate still high--the FOMC would have cause to 

consider the path of policy.  This is truer still if inflation expectations increase materially.  And if 

the Fed’s holdings work predominantly through the so-called portfolio balance channel, the 

cessation of purchases should not reverse any benefits attained. 

The Fed’s increased presence in the market for long-term Treasury securities also poses 

nontrivial risks.  The Treasury market is special.  It plays a unique role in the global financial 

system.  It is a corollary to the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency.  The prices assigned 

to Treasury securities--the risk-free rate--are the foundation from which the price of virtually 

every asset in the world is calculated.  As the Fed’s balance sheet expands, it becomes more of a 

price maker than a price taker in the Treasury market.  And if market participants come to doubt 

these prices--or their reliance on these prices proves fleeting--risk premiums across asset classes 

and geographies could move unexpectedly.  The shock that hit the financial markets in 2008
