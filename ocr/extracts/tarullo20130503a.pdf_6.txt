potential for an adverse feedback loop.  An effective set of financial reforms must 

address both these related problems of too-big-to-fail and systemic vulnerability.   

Regulatory Response to Date 

 As is obvious from the scope of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act and the amount of activity at the regulatory agencies, reform 

efforts to date have been extensive.  They have also been significant.  Without trying to 

give a full review, let me draw your attention to some of the more notable 

accomplishments, which can be categorized in three groups. 

 First, the basic prudential framework for banking organizations is being 

considerably strengthened, both internationally and domestically.  Central to this effort 

are the Basel III changes to capital standards, which create a new requirement for a 

minimum common equity capital ratio.  This new standard requires substantial increases 

in both the quality and quantity of the loss-absorbing capital that allows a firm to remain 

a viable financial intermediary.  Basel III also established for the first time an 

international minimum leverage ratio which, unlike the traditional U.S. leverage 

requirement, takes account of off-balance-sheet items.   

 Second, a series of reforms have been targeted at the larger financial firms that are 

more likely to be of systemic importance.  When fully implemented, these measures will 

have formed a distinct regulatory and supervisory structure on top of generally applicable 

prudential regulations and supervisory requirements.  The governing principle for this 

new set of rules is that larger institutions should be subject to more exacting regulatory 

and supervisory requirements, which should become progressively stricter as the 

systemic importance of a firm increases.
