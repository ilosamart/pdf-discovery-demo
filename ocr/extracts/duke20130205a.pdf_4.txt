the group of smallest banks, those with total assets of $50 million or less.  To put this estimate in 

perspective, such a decline could cause about 13 percent of the banks of that size to go from 

profitable to unprofitable.  As a comparison, given the same increase in regulation, they assume 

banks between $500 million and $1 billion would hire three employees and experience a decline 

of about 4 basis points in return on assets for the median bank. While this is still a significant 

effect, very few banks in this group would go from being profitable to unprofitable as a result of 

the regulatory burden.  

Regulatory overreaction to a crisis is always a risk.  But this time, I think community 

bankers have been more successful than they realize in making the case against “one-size-fits-

all” regulation.  I can’t remember a time when I have seen more regulatory proposals drafted that 

differentiate between banks based on size or complexity.  I urge you to continue to identify the 

regulatory requirements that are the most onerous to your business model, and continue to 

suggest alternatives to achieve those regulatory objectives in a less intrusive way. 

In fact, most of the regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) are directed primarily at larger, systemically 

important banks, and many of the Act’s provisions specifically exempt community banks.  For 

example, banks with less than $10 billion in total assets were exempted from a number of the 

debit interchange restrictions, and early studies indicate that those exemptions are working.  In 

addition, formal stress testing was required only for banks with total assets of $10 billion or 

more.  In implementing these requirements for the larger banks, the bank regulatory agencies 

specifically indicated that capital stress testing would not be required for community banks.

This does not mean that community banks are exempted from prudent risk management, but
