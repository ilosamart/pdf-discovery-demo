II. Normalization of Monetary Policies 

The cumulative effects over half of a decade of the extraordinary actions by the 

Federal Reserve and other central banks will need to be unwound in the coming years, as 

progress toward economic recovery makes it necessary to withdraw our substantial 

monetary accommodation.  In the normalizing of its policy, just as when loosening 

policy, the Federal Reserve will take account of how its actions affect the global 

economy.   

The taper tantrum episode notwithstanding, most EMEs have generally weathered 

the wind-down of our asset purchases reasonably well so far.  The actual raising of policy 

rates could trigger further bouts of volatility, but my best estimate is that the 

normalization of our policy should prove manageable for the EMEs.  We have done 

everything we can, within the limits of forecast uncertainty, to prepare market 

participants for what lies ahead.   

Some critics of our policies have argued that, by continuing for so long with 

quantitative easing, the United States fueled a global boom in asset prices and credit 

growth that could provide the seeds of the next financial crisis, with the removal of 

monetary accommodation serving as an eventual trigger.   

But I am much more hopeful.  First, the Federal Reserve and other central banks 

are going to great lengths to communicate policy intentions and strategies clearly.  Given 

this, markets should not be greatly surprised by either the timing or the pace of 

normalization.  In fact, it bears mentioning that, following the taper tantrum, when the 

Fed started to taper its purchases, there was little reaction from markets.
