General Theory, this contrast between equilibrium and actual interest rates was at the 

heart of the so-called liquidity trap, a situation where the equilibrium interest rate is so 

low that even a zero (or slightly negative) nominal interest rate is not low enough to 

stimulate economic activity.7  Keynes’s bottom line was that, when the economy falls 

into the liquidity trap, traditional monetary policy loses its effectiveness and fiscal policy 

has to be used for countercyclical stabilization.  And here lies the first reason why we 

should be concerned about chronically low interest rates:  When the equilibrium interest 

rate is very low, the economy is more likely to fall into the liquidity trap; it becomes 

more vulnerable to adverse shocks that might render conventional monetary policy 

ineffective. 

Of course, as we have all learned over the past several years, unconventional 

monetary policy tools developed and used since the Great Recession--such as large-scale 

asset purchases and extended forward guidance--have significantly mitigated concerns 

about the liquidity trap.8  Nonetheless, the question of whether unconventional tools are 

perfect substitutes for cutting short-term interest rates remains a topic of active research.9 

Let me briefly mention a second reason for worrying about ultralow interest rates:  

The transition to a world with a very low natural rate of interest may hurt financial 

stability by causing investors to reach for yield, and some financial institutions will find it 

harder to be profitable.  On the whole, however, the evidence to date does not point to 

notable risks to financial stability stemming from ultralow interest rates.  For instance,
