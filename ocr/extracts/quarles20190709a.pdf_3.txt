these tests will continue to be the most risk sensitive and consequential assessment of the 

affected banks’ capital requirements.   

 Transparency around the stress testing process and results was a fundamental 

principle of the first stress test and every one that has followed, and it will remain a 

primary goal.  Stress tests, as ever, will provide the public with essential information to 

assess the health of banks and the overall financial system.  To be credible, stress tests 

will also continue to provide significant information about how the Fed does its work, so 

the public can understand the rigor and independence of our assessment process and how 

we come to our judgment of the firms we test.   

Fidelity to these principles, embraced in the depths of the crisis by the first stress 

test a decade ago, does not mean that stress testing should never change or that it hasn’t 

changed over the years.  We have learned from our experiences with the early tests and 

added useful features and adjustments.  These include a counterparty default scenario, as 

well as a number of policy statements that more explicitly convey the principles we find 

important in a sensible stress testing program.    

Stress testing has evolved, and must continue to evolve, to take on what we as 

supervisors learn from our work and what we can learn from others.  Each year, we have 

refined both the substance and the process of the stress tests, guided by our own 

experience and by critiques and suggestions from others.  This feedback comes from a 

variety sources, including conferences such as this one, and I am confident that the 

presentations today will provide insights that result in improvements in our stress tests.    

If stress tests are to continue to be relevant and effective, I strongly believe that 

they must continue to change:  they must respond to changes in the economy, the
