uncertain economic and financial environment.  In particular, we were concerned that market 

participants would not fully appreciate for how long we anticipated keeping interest rates low.  If 

they hadn’t, intermediate- and longer-term rates would have declined by less, reducing the 

stimulative effect of the very low policy rates. 

 Given the severity of the downturn, it became clear that lowering short-term policy rates 

alone would not be sufficient.  We needed to go further to ease financial conditions and 

encourage spending.  Thus, to reduce longer-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, we 

purchased large quantities of longer-term securities, specifically Treasury securities, agency 

mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt.   

Central banks have lots of experience guiding the economy by adjusting short-term 

policy rates and influencing expectations about future policy rates, and the underlying theory and 

practice behind those actions are well understood.  However, the economic effects of purchasing 

large volumes of longer-term assets, and the accompanying expansion of the reserve base in the 

banking system, are much less well understood.  So my second homework assignment for 

monetary policymakers and other interested economists is to study the effects of such balance 

sheet expansion; better understanding will help our successors if, unfortunately, they should find 

themselves in a similar position, and it will help us as we unwind the unusual actions we took.   

 One question involves the direct effects of the large-scale asset purchases themselves.  

The theory behind the Federal Reserve’s actions was fairly clear:  Arbitrage between short- and 

long-term markets is not perfect even when markets are functioning smoothly; and arbitrage is 

especially impaired during panics when investors are putting an unusually large premium on the 

liquidity and safety of short-term instruments.  In these circumstances, reducing the supply of 

long-term debt pushes up the prices of the securities, lowering their yields.
