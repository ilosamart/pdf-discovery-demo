A tool that might be better targeted to actual risks, while avoiding unnecessary “bank-

like” regulation would be what I have previously termed “prudential market regulation”--that is, 

a policy framework that builds on the traditional investor-protection and market-functioning 

aims of market regulation by incorporating a system-wide financial stability perspective.  This 

approach would take into account such considerations as system-wide demands on liquidity 

during stress periods and correlated risks that could exacerbate liquidity, redemption, or fire sale 

pressures.  The specific policies associated with prudential market regulation might be 

transaction-specific or apply to certain kinds of business models.   

One example of such a measure is the SFT minimum haircut idea I mentioned earlier.  

Generally, though, prudential market regulation would be a tool more available to market 

regulators, since it would apply to activities on a market or transactional basis.  In her important 

speech last year, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Jo White provided a 

roadmap for just such a regulatory approach for the asset management industry.10  The SEC has 

since begun to develop that approach.11  

The second institutional issue is the question of which regulators would make the 

assessment and policy tradeoffs that I contemplate in addressing financial stability risks 

associated with nonbank financial intermediation.  The natural answer would be the regulator 

with authority to act.  While this may well be the best answer from a policy perspective, it does 

raise some potential issues on its own.  For example, if regulators with responsibility for one 

sector believe that the failure of regulators with responsibility for another sector to act on 

financial stability concerns is creating debilitating disadvantages for firms in the first sector, they
