leverage and greater maturity mismatch in individual shadow banking institutions and in 

the sector as a whole. 

While banks also rely on short-term funding and leverage, they benefit from a 

government-provided safety net, including deposit insurance and backstop liquidity 

provision by the central bank.  Shadow banking activities do not have these safeguards, 

so they employ alternative mechanisms to gain investor confidence.  Among these 

mechanisms are the collateralization of many shadow banking liabilities; regulatory or 

contractual restrictions placed on portfolio holdings, such as the liquidity and credit 

quality requirements applicable to money market mutual funds; and the imprimaturs of 

credit rating agencies.  Indeed, the very foundation of shadow banking and its rapid 

growth before the crisis was the widely held view (among both investors and regulators) 

that these safeguards would protect shadow banking activities against runs and panics, 

similar to the protection given to commercial banking by the government safety net.  

Unfortunately, this view turned out to be wrong.  When it became clear to investors that 

these alternative protections might not be adequate to protect against losses, widespread 

flight from the shadow banking system occurred, with pernicious dynamics reminiscent 

of the banking panics of an earlier era.  

 Although the vulnerabilities associated with short-term wholesale funding and 

excessive leverage can be seen as structural weaknesses of the global financial system, 

they can also be viewed as a consequence of poor risk management by financial 

institutions and investors, which I would count as another major vulnerability of the 

system before the crisis.  Unfortunately, the crisis revealed a number of significant 

defects in private-sector risk management and risk controls, importantly including
