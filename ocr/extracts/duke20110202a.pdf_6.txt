lending to financial institutions against good collateral.  Because central banks step in 

when other sources of funds retreat, central banks acting in this capacity are known as 

lenders of last resort.  But that phrase doesn’t mean that central banks make bad loans; 

nearly all of their loans are to sound borrowers with sound collateral.  Banks rely on 

short-term funding such as overnight interbank loans or customer deposits to make the

had to be adapted to fit markets and lenders that had never been supported by the Federal 

Reserve before.   

Now, I didn’t live through the banking crises of the distant past or those that 

might have occurred in other countries.  But I can tell you what it was like at the center of 

the most recent crisis.  Funding was drying up for one institution after another and for
