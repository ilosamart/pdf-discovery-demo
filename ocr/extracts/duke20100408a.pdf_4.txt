 In addition to providing materials for financial education, the Federal Reserve has also 

begun to assess the effectiveness of the education programs it engages in, so that we can better 

evaluate the outcomes of our efforts.  This research is intended to help us better answer the 

question, “What works in education?” so that we may allocate our resources in the best possible 

manner. 

 While financial education is an important first step in enabling consumers to make 

informed financial decisions, it is also important that consumers be presented with clear and 

consistent information about their financial products.  The Federal Reserve is the primary 

government agency charged with writing rules governing consumer financial products.  

Historically, we have focused on disclosure as the best way to provide consumers with 

information to choose between products or to make decisions about using financial products.   In 

recent years, we have used extensive consumer testing to gauge consumers’ understanding of 

financial disclosures and to highlight practices that simply cannot be understood by consumers 

even with the best disclosures.  If we identify practices that cannot be adequately explained 

through disclosure, we now prohibit those practices.  Recently, the Federal Reserve has written 

strong new consumer protection rules for mortgages, credit cards, and overdraft charges.  And 

we have improved our response time for drafting rules to address emerging trends that may pose 

new risks for consumers.
