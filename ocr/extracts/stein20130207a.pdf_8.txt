tolerance on the part of households would lead them to bid down credit spreads; these 

lower spreads would then be the leading indicator of low expected returns.   

On the other hand, in an institutions-driven world, where agents are trying to 

exploit various incentive schemes, it is less obvious that increased risk appetite is as well 

summarized by reduced credit spreads.  Rather, agents may prefer to accept their lowered 

returns via various subtler nonprice terms and subordination features that allow them to 

maintain a higher stated yield.  Again, the use of PIK bonds in LBOs is instructive.  A 

long time ago, Steve Kaplan and I did a study of the capital structure of 1980s-era 

LBOs.

  What was most noteworthy about the PIK bonds in those deals was not that they 

had low credit spreads.  Rather, it was that they were subject to an extreme degree of 

implicit subordination.  While these bonds were not due to get cash interest for several 

years, they stood behind bank loans with very fast principal repayment schedules, which 

in many cases required the newly leveraged firm to sell a large chunk of its assets just to 

honor these bank loans.  Simply put, much of the action--and much of the explanatory 

power for the eventual sorry returns on the PIK bonds--was in the nonprice terms. 

It is interesting to think about recent work by Robin Greenwood and Sam Hanson 

through this lens.

  They show that if one is interested in forecasting excess returns on 

corporate bonds (relative to Treasury securities) over the next few years, credit spreads 

are indeed helpful, but another powerful predictive variable is a nonprice measure:  the 

high-yield share, defined as issuance by speculative-grade firms divided by total bond 

issuance.  When the high-yield share is elevated, future returns on corporate credit tend to 

be low, holding fixed the credit spread.  Exhibit 1 provides an illustration of their finding.
