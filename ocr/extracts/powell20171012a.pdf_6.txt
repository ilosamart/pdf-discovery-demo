Risks to Emerging Market Economy Prospects from the Future Course of Monetary 

Policy 

Some observers have noted that the risk of a reversal of EME capital flows may 

become more pronounced as U.S. and global interest rates return to more normal levels.  

These developments could encourage capital to return to the advanced economies and, by 

raising domestic interest rates and putting downward pressures on emerging market 

currencies, could also enlarge EME debt burdens.  In assessing this risk, as I mentioned 

earlier, three elements are important:  first, the vulnerabilities in the EMEs themselves; 

second, the evolution of advanced-economy monetary policies; and, third, how markets 

might respond to that evolution.  Let me discuss each of these elements in turn.  

Emerging Market Economy Vulnerabilities 

There is clear empirical evidence that the response of EME financial markets to 

different shocks, including changes in U.S. interest rates, depends importantly on the 

state of economic fundamentals in the EMEs themselves.  For example, Bowman and 

coauthors document in their study that a deterioration in a countryâ€™s economic conditions 

significantly increases its vulnerability to adverse effects from changes in U.S. interest 

rates.6  A case in point is the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when rises in sovereign 

bond spreads were significantly greater in those EMEs with greater relative 

vulnerabilities.   

There is little doubt that over the past couple of decades, EME macroeconomic 

fundamentals and policy frameworks have improved substantially.  One way you can see

monetary policies on EME asset prices and the channels through which these effects are transmitted include 
Bruno and Shin (2015); Chen, Mancini-Griffoli, and Sahay (2014); Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub 
(2013); Tepper and others (2013); and Hausman and Wongswan (2011).
