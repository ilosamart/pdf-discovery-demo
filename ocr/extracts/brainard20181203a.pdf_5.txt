are also offering high-speed links to firms that wish to engage in high-frequency trading 

without investing directly in microwave tower infrastructure.   

We have seen important recent changes among infrastructure providers as well.  

CME Group’s acquisition of NEX and the BrokerTec platform has recently been 

finalized, with direct implications for the structure of the Treasury market.5  We have 

also witnessed the conclusion of J.P. Morgan’s exit from broker-dealer settlement 

services in the triparty Treasury repo market and the transition to BNY Mellon 

Government Securities Services Corp. as a subsidiary offering Treasury market 

settlement services.  Beyond these changes, some new trading platforms are 

experimenting with the very structure of the market.6  These platforms are promoting 

new trading models such as all-to-all trading, in which many buy-side and sell-side 

participants transact directly, and direct streaming, in which live continuous, executable 

prices are delivered electronically under bilaterally or multilaterally negotiated terms.  

These services can potentially bridge all of the venues of the Treasury market, connecting 

not just dealers and proprietary trading firms, but also those entities with buy-side clients.   

And, finally, the macroeconomic landscape has undergone some significant 

changes that have important implications for the Treasury market.  At the time of the 

flash rally in October 2014, the Federal Reserve was still actively purchasing Treasury
