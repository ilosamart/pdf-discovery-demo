makes those other measures more effective.  The success of the 2009 stress test in restoring 

confidence in the financial system during the crisis encouraged Congress to make stress testing a 

required and regular feature of large-firm prudential regulation. 

 As the term suggests, stress tests evaluate the capacity of banks to absorb losses that may 

be associated with major economic adversity and remain not only technically solvent, but also 

viable financial intermediaries.  They are explicitly forward-looking, in that they involve creating 

unlikely but plausibly severe economic scenarios and then modeling the likely impact of those 

scenarios on bank assets and earnings.  The Federal Reserve has tied the results of stress tests 

into capital regulation by requiring that bank capital distributions be consistent with maintaining 

viability in the event the severe scenario were to materialize.  That is, dividends and share 

repurchases cannot bring the bank’s capital level below the sum of minimum capital 

requirements and the amount of losses that could be sustained in the stress event.  By looking at 

the impact of such scenarios on the considerable part of the financial industry accounted for by 

the larger bank holding companies subject to the requirement, the Federal Reserve’s approach 

gives insight into how substantial economic or financial shocks would affect the financial system 

and the real economy.   

One virtue of stress testing is that it allows a forward-looking assessment of potential 

losses that is customized to the portfolios and business models of each bank, while still being 

consistent across the banks.  The Federal Reserve uses independent supervisory models to 

estimate losses and revenues under stress, both to achieve more comparability across the results 

for different banks and to preclude any temptation for banks to game their own models.  This 

linkage of stress testing to bank capital requirements has been a good way for regulators to 

regularize exercise of their broad statutory discretion to set individual capital requirements on a
