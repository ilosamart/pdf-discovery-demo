Simplified Capital for Small Institutions 

At previous outreach meetings, community banks have asked whether the Federal 

Reserve can exempt smaller financial institutions from meeting all of the revised capital 

requirements.  Based on lessons from the crisis, bank capital requirements were 

significantly revised to make the requirements more risk-sensitive and raise the quality 

and quantity of capital.  In some instances, smaller institutions have indicated that the 

degree of categorization of risks, the attendant recordkeeping and systems changes, and 

the increased reporting burden on their institutions are generating significantly increased 

compliance costs that are not commensurate with the risk profile of the institution.  For 

smaller and less complex community banks, the benefit from this increased risk 

sensitivity may be outweighed by the burden of increased complexity, and a 

commensurate improvement in safety and soundness of the institution may be achievable 

by simply holding a larger cushion of capital measured against a simpler definition of 

assets.  To be workable, such an approach would need to provide a robust measure of the 

financial institution’s capital health and meet the objectives of the Collins amendment.  

We are currently exploring possible options.6   

                                                 
5 It is important to note that any change in the appraisal threshold will only affect federally related 
transactions covered by the prudential regulators’ rules.  The majority of residential mortgages would 
remain subject to the appraisal requirements set by secondary market, particularly by Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac.
