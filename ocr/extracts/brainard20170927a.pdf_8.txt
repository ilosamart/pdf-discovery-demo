5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans.  Labor force 

participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than 

unemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent.  These 

differences are not a recent development--similar differences across racial and ethnic 

dimensions have existed for as long as these data have been collected.  Even more 

striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic 

groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age 

and education levels.9   

 Although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups 

are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably 

during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades.  Differences in 

unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during 

recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and 

these differences shrink during recoveries.  For example, in the second quarter of 2017, 

the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points 

higher than for white adult men.  This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to 

the smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.  

Differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women 

relative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites.  Since racial disparities 

tend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that
