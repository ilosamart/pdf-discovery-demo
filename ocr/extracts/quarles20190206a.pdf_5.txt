 This year, we are taking similar steps to improve a cornerstone of our post-crisis rules. 

Supervisory stress tests offer an independent and valuable lens on the health of the banking 

system. They offer us a forward-looking measurement of bank capital, a view of common and 

systemic risks across the banking sector, and a broader understanding of the health of the 

financial system. The results are valuable for markets, analysts, and ultimately, the participating 

firms. 

 Ten years have passed since the Federal Reserve conducted its first supervisory stress 

tests. That initial experiment helped stabilize financial markets and shore up our banking system 

at a critical and uncertain time. Our challenge now is to preserve the strength of the test, while 

improving its efficiency, transparency, and integration into the post-crisis regulatory framework. 

To that end, the stress tests have not remained static. Just in the past several days, the 

Board acted to suspend stress tests this year for lower-risk firms--generally, those with total 

assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.7 That move follows the passage of the Economic 

Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.8 The extended cycle provides 

administrative burden relief for these institutions and recognizes the different risks that they 

typically pose--especially compared to the largest and most complex firms, whose failure poses 

the greatest risk to the real economy. Even with this change, the stress tests remain a core part of 

our supervision of these firms. Our experience with this “interim” year will inform the move to a
