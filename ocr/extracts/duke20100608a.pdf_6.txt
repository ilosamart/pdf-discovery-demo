small businesses would have become even less available and more costly.  The Federal Reserve

reliance on complex and opaque credit instruments led to the current set of circumstances in 

which lenders are skittish about lending, borrowers are skittish about borrowing, and investors 

are skittish about investing.  The credit markets must reemerge in sounder and more transparent
