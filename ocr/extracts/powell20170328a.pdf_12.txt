The Fed is accountable to Congress and the public for its activities and decisions.  

Historically, the activities of central banks were shrouded in mystery.  Montagu Norman, 

the famously secretive Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1944, reportedly 

took as his personal motto, “Never explain, never excuse” (figure 11).21 

In the modern era, all that has changed, as central banks have come to see 

transparency both as a requirement of democratic accountability and as a way of 

supporting the efficacy of their policies.  Over recent decades the Fed has significantly 

augmented its public communications, as have other major central banks.  The Chair 

testifies before Congress twice each year about the U.S. economy and the FOMC’s 

monetary policy in pursuit of its statutory goals of stable prices and maximum 

employment (figure 12).22  The Federal Reserve Board prepares a Monetary Policy 

Report to accompany that testimony.23  The Chair also holds press conferences after four 

FOMC meetings each year.   The FOMC releases statements after its meetings that 

explain the economic outlook and the rationale for its policy decision.  Detailed minutes 

of the Committee’s meetings are published three weeks later.24  Since 2007, FOMC 

participants have submitted quarterly macroeconomic projections that are published in 

the Summary of Economic Projections.25  In 2012, the FOMC issued a Statement on 

                                                 
21 Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, referenced the motto in a 2007 speech.
