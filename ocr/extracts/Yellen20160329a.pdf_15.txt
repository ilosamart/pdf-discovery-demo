expected path of policy.  I have done my best to do so today, in the time you have kindly 

granted me.

federal funds rate. Market participants may hold different views about the economic outlook and the 
associated risks and at times may be confused about the FOMC’s strategy.  In such situations, the 
Committee must do what it believes is appropriate while clearly explaining the rationale for its actions.
