unemployment rate cited in the FOMC consensus statement--while the inflation rate 

settles down at 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation objective and the median long-run 

forecast in the dealer survey.  

The solid black line in the bottom panel of the figure shows the median of 

dealers’ expectations for the path of the federal funds rate through the end of 2015.  The 

dealers assumed it would remain near zero through the first half of 2015, consistent with 

the guidance the Committee subsequently provided.  Beyond 2015, the federal funds rate 

is assumed to gradually rise to 4 percent, the long-run value expected by most dealers as 

well as most FOMC participants.  I have assumed in the baseline that this process is 

largely completed within four years.16    

The question I now want to address is whether this illustrative baseline path for 

the federal funds rate is one that reflects a balanced approach to attaining our longer-run 

objectives, consistent with our consensus statement.  As I noted, this balanced approach 

means inflation and unemployment will sometimes temporarily deviate from longer-run 

objectives, but that these deviations would be minimized.  To answer this question I need 

to rely, as I noted, on a specific macroeconomic model, and, for this purpose, I will 

employ the FRB/US model, one of the economic models commonly used at the Board.  

The model lets us analyze every possible policy path to see which one yields the best 

feasible outcome for the paths of unemployment and inflation.  Although the exact 

                                                 
16 It is worth noting that the dealer forecasts probably incorporate some effect from asset purchases that 
were only later announced by the FOMC.  At the time of this survey, the median probability that the 
primary dealers assigned to the FOMC announcing a new program of asset purchases in September was 
55% and the median probability assigned to further asset purchases within one year was 70%.  The median 
value of asset purchases anticipated by the dealers under such a program was about $500 billion.  In the 
simulations that follow, I treat the balance sheet as unchanged relative to its baseline path, and focus on the 
federal funds rate as the tool for conducting monetary policy even though the Committee is currently using 
both forward guidance concerning the funds rate path and the balance sheet to provide monetary 
accommodation.  (The text of this footnote has been revised since its original release.)
