GDP nearly tripled, to about 43 percent.  The largest bank in the world at that time, Royal Bank 

of Scotland (RBS), had assets equivalent to about 6.8 percent of global GDP, nearly twice the 

comparable figure for the three largest banks combined in 1974.  Adding the assets of Deutsche 

Bank and BNP Paribas--the second and third largest banks in 2007--to those of RBS, the three 

had combined assets equal to about 17 percent of global GDP.  And each of the three had assets 

nearly equal to, or in one instance substantially more than, the GDP of its home country.  Even 

the eighth-ranked bank, UBS, had assets well over four times the GDP of its home country, 

Switzerland.   

 Not only did the size of the largest banks change dramatically, so, too, did their scope, 

reflecting the overall integration of capital market and traditional lending activities that 

accelerated in the decade and a half preceding the crisis.  This trend was particularly apparent in 

the United States and the United Kingdom, homes to the worldâ€™s two largest financial centers.  In 

the United States, the proportion of foreign banking assets to total U.S. banking assets has 

remained constant at approximately one-fifth since the late 1990s.  But the concentration and 

character of those assets have changed noticeably.  Today there are as many foreign as U.S.-

owned banks with at least $50 billion in U.S. assets, the threshold established by the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for banks for which more stringent prudential 

measures must be established.

  Perhaps even more important was the shift in composition of 

foreign bank assets in the 15 years before the crisis, with the proportion of assets held in the U.S. 

broker-dealers of the 10 largest FBOs rising from approximately 15 percent to roughly 50

 As of September 30, 2013, there were 24 such foreign banks, compared with 24 U.S. firms.  Source:  For U.S.
