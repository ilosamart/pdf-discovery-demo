The Role of Banks 

Large-scale economic and financial events provide an opportunity to re-think basic 

assumptions--that is, once we get through the period of crisis management.  But it takes a while 

to get there, and reactions to financial crises consist, first, of strategic containment, and then, of 

developing techniques of prevention.  In terms of our recent financial crisis, the Federal Reserve 

attempted to provide the containment through the use of both traditional and innovative 

macroeconomic tools.  Congress, in turn, attempted to supply the subsequent preventative tools.  

In that regard, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank 

Act), which embodied Congress’ strategy for preventing another crisis, was passed in July 2010.  

But in addition to containment and prevention, there is a third component to a meaningful 

response that we ignore at the public’s peril.  And that is a significant probing of the more 

fundamental aspects of how well our financial system is serving us, and at what cost.  In fact, I 

have spent a lot of time, post-crisis, thinking about the role that banks and other financial market 

entities play in the U.S. economy and in local communities, how well they play that role, and 

how much it costs us as a society to encourage or enforce that role through regulation.   

To date, much of the public discussion of the recent financial crisis has focused on the 

specific symptoms of this particular episode of financial malfunction.  Most people are aware 

that the staggering loss of jobs, income, and wealth we experienced were associated with what 

went wrong in the financial sphere.  But we cannot forget the need to relate these results to the 

role that banks and other financial market entities should play in the first place.  We need to ask 

how well banks and financial market entities are performing that role and how to assess the 

public and private sector costs associated with assuring that they play this role.
