adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation.  

Anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both 

unemployment and inflation.  When a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring 

down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank’s inflation target.  With 

expectations anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring 

inflation back down, and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise.  Thus, policy can 

be a bit more accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer-term 

expectations.  

Shifting Stars and the “New Economy” of the Late 1990s 

The second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a situation that was in 

some ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation.  In mid-1996, the unemployment 

rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants 

and others were forecasting growth above the economy’s potential.  Sentiment was 

building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising 

inflation.9  But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing 

the wonders of a “new economy” in which improved productivity growth would allow 

faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks.  

Greenspan argued that the FOMC should hold off on rate increases.   

Over the next two years, thanks to his considerable fortitude, Greenspan 

prevailed, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate only once from mid-1996 through
