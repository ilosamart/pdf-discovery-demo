that servicers be willing and diligent in offering assistance to troubled homeowners:  It is 

key to the pace of economic recovery.        

  For those in the housing and mortgage fields, making needed changes will not be 

easy.  In particular, for those in the mortgage servicing industry, it means difficult 

changes and significant investments to rectify broken systems.  For those servicers who 

are subsidiaries or affiliates of a broader parent financial institution, the responsibility for 

change and further investment absolutely extends up to that parent company, many of 

which have enjoyed substantial profits while their servicing arms have been run on the 

cheap.     

   In November, I spoke about the problems in residential mortgage servicing 

operations that were undermining the performance of this industry.  These problems 

existed before November and as far as I can tell they remain unaddressed.  How do I 

know this?  Late last year, the federal banking agencies began a targeted review of loan 

servicing practices at large financial institutions that had significant market 

concentrations in mortgage servicing.  The preliminary results from this review indicate 

that widespread weaknesses exist in the servicing industry.  The agencies intend to report 

more specific findings to the public soon, but I can tell you that these deficiencies pose 

significant risk to mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes, impair the functioning of 

mortgage markets, and diminish overall accountability to homeowners. 

 I’m sure this has been said, but I’ll say it again because I have seen little to no 

evidence of improvement in the operational performance of servicers since the onset of 

the crisis in 2007:  Until these operational problems are addressed once and for all, the 

foreclosure crisis will continue and the housing sector will languish.
