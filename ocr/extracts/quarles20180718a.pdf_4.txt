certain buffers and surcharges, the application of the supplementary leverage ratio, and 

the application of the qualitative objections as part of the Board’s capital planning 

framework, among others.  In April, the Board proposed the stress capital buffer, which 

would simplify its regulatory capital requirements for the largest banks by integrating the 

stress test results with the Board’s non-stress capital requirements.  

Further, the Board recognized that the failure of one of the largest banking 

organizations could create spillovers that would undermine U.S. financial stability and 

harm consumers and the broader economy.  To offset this risk, the Board has required 

these firms to internalize the cost of their potential failure in a tailored manner that 

corresponds with their importance to the U.S. financial system.  These efforts include the 

Board’s capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and total 

loss-absorbing capacity requirements. 

The EGRRCPA and Tailoring 

But while the concept of tailoring is inherent in how the Board thinks about 

supervision and regulation, reasonable people can disagree on the sufficiency of tailoring 

to date.  In my view, we’ve made a good start in improving the efficiency of our 

regulatory regime.  But we still have more to do to streamline our framework in a manner 

that more directly addresses firm-specific risks. 

The recent legislation requires us to reevaluate how we regulate banks that have 

between $100 billion and $250 billion in total assets.  In particular, we need to make a 

tailoring-related decision in the near term:  How will we decide which enhanced 

prudential standards should apply to which firms with total assets between $100 billion 

and $250 billion?
