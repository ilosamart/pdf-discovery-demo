The effects of capital regulation on credit availability have been investigated 

extensively.  Some studies suggest that higher capital weighs on banks’ lending, while 

others suggest that higher capital supports lending.23  Such conflicting results in academic 

research are not altogether surprising.  It is difficult to identify the effects of regulatory 

capital requirements on lending because material changes to capital requirements are rare 

and are often precipitated, as in the recent case, by financial crises that also have large 

effects on lending. 

Given the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending, 

rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that 

balanced the possible stability gains from greater loss-absorbing capacity against the 

possible adverse effects on lending and economic growth.24  This ex ante assessment 

pointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards--and 

subsequent research supports this assessment.25  The steps to improve the capital

“The Credit Crunch,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 2, pp. 205-47.  Research finding a 

sizable negative relationship between capital requirements and lending includes Shekhar Aiyar, Charles W. 

Calomiris, and Tomasz Wieladek (2014), “Does Macro-Prudential Regulation Leak?  Evidence from a UK 

Policy Experiment,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 46 (s1; February), pp. 181-214.  Research 

finding little relationship between lending and capital ratios (outside financial crises) includes Mark 

Carlson, Hui Shan, and Missaka Warusawitharana (2013), “Capital Ratios and Bank Lending:  A Matched 

Bank Approach,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol. 22 (October), pp. 663-87.  Research suggesting 

that higher capital levels may increase lending includes Leonardo Gambacorta and Hyun Song Shin (2016),

International Settlements, April), www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf.

25 The ex ante studies from the Basel Committee and the Macroeconomic Assessment Group referenced in 

note 24 pointed to sizable net benefits from higher capital requirements.  More academic research pointing 

to similar conclusions using macroeconomic models (and typically focused on model-specific measures of 

economic welfare) includes Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Sim (2014), “Bank Capital and the 

Macroeconomy:  Policy Considerations,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 43 (June),
