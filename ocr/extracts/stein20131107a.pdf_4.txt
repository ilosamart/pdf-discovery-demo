 This is clearly a fire sale in the positive-economics sense, but is there a market 

failure here that calls for regulation?  Intuition suggests not. The airline arguably caused 

the fire sale by using a lot of leverage in its purchase of the 737, but it also seems to bear 

most of the cost, by being forced to liquidate at a large loss.  The movie star and the 

private-equity firm are, if anything, made better off by the appearance of a buying 

opportunity, and there are no other innocent bystanders. So the airline’s ex ante capital 

structure choice would seem to internalize things properly; the fire sale here is just like 

any other bankruptcy cost that a firm has to weigh in choosing the right mix of debt and 

equity. 

 For a fire sale to have the sort of welfare effects that create a role for regulation, 

the reduced price in the fire sale has to hurt somebody other than the original party 

making the leverage decision, and this adverse impact of price has to run through 

something like a collateral constraint, whereby a lowered price actually reduces, rather 

than increases, the third party’s demand for the asset.4  So if hedge fund A buys an asset-

backed security and finances it largely with collateralized borrowing, A’s fire selling of 

the security will create an externality in the conventional sense only if the reduced price 

and impaired collateral value lower the ability of hedge funds B and C to borrow against 

the same security, and therefore force them to involuntarily liquidate their positions in it 

as well.5 The market failure in this case is not simply the fact that this downward spiral 

                                                 
4 An alternative mechanism that works similarly is when the third party is a regulated intermediary and 
mark-to-market losses reduce its capital ratios, and again force it to involuntarily sell assets in the face of 
falling prices.
