returns to junk bond and leveraged-loan investors, it need not follow that this risk-taking 

has ominous systemic implications.  That is, even if at some point junk bond investors 

suffer losses, without spillovers to other parts of the system, these losses may be confined 

and therefore less of a policy concern. 

In this regard, one lesson from the crisis is that it is not just bad credit decisions 

that create systemic problems, but bad credit decisions combined with excessive maturity 

transformation.  A badly underwritten subprime loan is one thing, and a badly 

underwritten subprime loan that serves as the collateral for asset-backed commercial 

paper (ABCP) held by a money market fund is something else--and more dangerous.  

This observation suggests an idealized measurement construct.  In principle, what weâ€™d 

really like to know, for any given asset class--be it subprime mortgages, junk bonds, or 

leveraged loans--is this:  What fraction of it is ultimately financed by short-term 

demandable claims held by investors who are likely to pull back quickly when things 

start to go bad?  It is this short-term financing share that creates the potential for systemic 

spillovers in the form of deleveraging and marketwide fire sales of illiquid assets. 

This short-term financing share is difficult to measure comprehensively, but 

exhibit 5 presents one graph that gives some comfort.  The graph shows dealer financing 

of corporate debt securities, much of which is done via short-term repurchase agreements 

(repos).  This financing rose rapidly in the years prior to the crisis, then fell sharply, and 

remains well below its pre-crisis levels today.  So, on this score, there appears to be only 

modest short-term leverage behind corporate credit, which would seem to imply that even 

if the underlying securities were aggressively priced, the potential for systemic harm 

resulting from deleveraging and fire sales would be relatively limited.
