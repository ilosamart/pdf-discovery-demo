 Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be able to join the Economic Club of Indiana for 

lunch today.  I note that the mission of the club is “to promote an interest in, and 

enlighten its membership on, important governmental, economic and social issues.”  I 

hope my remarks today will meet that standard.  Before diving in, I’d like to thank my 

former colleague at the White House, Al Hubbard, for helping to make this event 

possible.  As the head of the National Economic Council under President Bush, Al had 

the difficult task of making sure that diverse perspectives on economic policy issues were 

given a fair hearing before recommendations went to the President.  Al had to be a 

combination of economist, political guru, diplomat, and traffic cop, and he handled it 

with great skill.  

My topic today is “Five Questions about the Federal Reserve and Monetary 

Policy.”  I have used a question-and-answer format in talks before, and I know from 

much experience that people are eager to know more about the Federal Reserve, what we 

do, and why we do it.  And that interest is even broader than one might think.  I’m a 

baseball fan, and I was excited to be invited to a recent batting practice of the playoff-

bound Washington Nationals.  I was introduced to one of the team’s star players, but 

before I could press my questions on some fine points of baseball strategy, he asked, “So, 

what’s the scoop on quantitative easing?”  So, for that player, for club members and 

guests here today, and for anyone else curious about the Federal Reserve and monetary 

policy, I will ask and answer these five questions: 

1. What are the Fed’s objectives, and how is it trying to meet them? 

2. What’s the relationship between the Fed’s monetary policy and the fiscal 

decisions of the Administration and the Congress?
