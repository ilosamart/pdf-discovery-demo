I appreciate this opportunity to offer a few thoughts on the effects of advanced 

economy monetary policies on emerging market economies (EMEs)--an issue of great 

importance for Asia and the global economy.1  Since the global financial crisis, the 

Federal Reserve has sought to strengthen the U.S. economic recovery through highly 

accommodative monetary policy.  But my colleagues and I are keenly aware that the U.S. 

economy operates in a global environment.  We understand that America’s prosperity is 

bound up with the prosperity of other nations, including emerging market nations.   

Emerging market economies have long grappled with the challenges posed by 

large and volatile cross-border capital flows.  The past several decades are replete with 

episodes of strong capital inflows being followed by abrupt reversals, all too often 

resulting in financial crisis and economic distress.2  Some of this volatility no doubt 

reflects the evolution of strengths and vulnerabilities within the EMEs themselves.   

In recent years, renewed attention has been placed on the role of advanced 

economies and of common or global factors in driving capital movements.3  In particular, 

many observers have singled out monetary policy in the United States and other 

advanced economies as a key driver.  As advanced economies pursued highly 

accommodative monetary policies and EMEs subsequently received strong capital 

inflows, reflecting investors’ pursuit of higher returns, concerns were expressed that a 

flood of liquidity would overwhelm emerging markets, drive up asset prices to 

unsustainable levels, set off credit booms, and thus sow the seeds of future crises.  More

2 Notable examples of such crises include Latin America in the early 1980s, Mexico in 1994, the Asian 
financial crises beginning in 1997, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2001, and Brazil in 2002.  See Broner and 
others (2013), Forbes and Warnock (2012), Ghosh and others (2012), and Reinhart and Reinhart (2009) for 
discussions of large capital flow movements. 
3 An earlier literature also examined the role of “push” and “pull” factors in explaining international capital 
flows.  Examples include Calvo and others (1993, 1996), Fernandez-Arias (1996), and Chuhan and others 
(1998).
