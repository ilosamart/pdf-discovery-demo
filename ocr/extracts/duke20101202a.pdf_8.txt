Although households account for the vast majority of credit card loans and credit 

card spending in our economy, the market for small business credit cards has grown 

considerably over the past 10 to 15 years.  After checking accounts, credit cards are the 

second-most-common financial product used by small businesses.  Small business cards 

are structured to cater to business needs with features, pricing, and underwriting unique 

to their typical usage.  Issuers provide several services specifically for small businesses, 

such as employee cards with customizable spending limits and detailed spending 

statements each month or quarter.  Also, small business cards often have higher credit 

limits than personal cards to facilitate the higher spending needs of small businesses. 

Small businesses are noticeably less likely than households to carry a balance on 

their cards.  As of the end of 2009, 83 percent of small businesses used credit cards.  Of 

those using credit cards, 64 percent used small business cards and 41 percent used 

personal cards.  Despite the widespread use of credit cards, only a minority of small 

businesses--18 percent--reported borrowing on credit cards.  In comparison, nearly one-

half of households reported carrying a balance on their credit cards.3  Thus, although 

most small businesses appear to use credit cards for transactions purposes, and perhaps as 

a source of short-term credit, the data suggest that only a small fraction of them rely on 

credit cards as a source of longer-term credit.  Yet even if firms do not carry a balance, 

reductions in the size of their credit card lines may strain their cash flow and force them 

to cut spending or require them to use more expensive forms of short-term credit, such as 

trade finance.
