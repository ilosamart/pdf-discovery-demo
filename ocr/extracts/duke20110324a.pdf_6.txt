differences, but the dominant pattern across families is no change in portfolio holdings.  

Moreover, responses to a question we asked about changes in portfolio composition over the 

crisis indicate that 54 percent of all families made no change at all in their portfolios over the 

period covered by the panel SCF.  This is perhaps surprising, given the large change in asset 

values that occurred during the crisis. 

Preretirement Age Group 

In this dataset, the preretirement group includes families whose household head was 

between 50 and 61 years old in 2007.  This age group traditionally has a particularly strong effect 

on the overall economy because the preretirement years are typically characterized by peak 

earnings, peak saving, and peak spending.  The baby-boom generation, by virtue of its sheer size, 

has had an outsized influence on the economy as it has entered every stage in the life cycle, and 

its magnification of the preretirement effect is no exception.  In addition, in 2007, this group held 

more than one-third of all household net worth.  Because wealth is a key driver of household 

decisions about spending, saving, and investment, we might expect behavioral shifts in response 

to wealth changes to have significant effects on the performance of the U.S. economy.  We will 

look at changes from 2007 to 2009 in the attitudes of this group and how those changes might 

vary depending on whether they experienced gains or losses in wealth during the crisis.   

I chose the preretirement group to examine because of its significant size and wealth, but 

also because this seemed like the group most likely to be affected by changes in wealth and to 

feel the need to change behavior as a result of any such changes.  The preretirement group must 

accumulate assets to sustain itself through retirement, continue working, or rely on their children 

or the government for support.  Given their vast numbers, the adjustments they make can affect
