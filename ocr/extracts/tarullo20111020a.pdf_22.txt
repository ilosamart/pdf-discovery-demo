Even the acute problems reflected in todayâ€™s grim employment picture cannot be 

reversed as quickly as in past recoveries, precisely because the recent recession arose 

from a financial crisis that was in turn the result of asset bubbles and high levels of 

unsustainable debt.  But the fact that these problems cannot be solved quickly does not 

mean there is nothing to be done.  Without more, the harm to the unemployed and their 

families continues, and the risks of longer-term harm increase--both to the unemployed 

and to the country as a whole.  A shortfall of aggregate demand is the most important 

factor behind those dismal statistics.  Particularly if we take account of the unusual nature 

of the current shortfall in fashioning policy responses, there is much that government 

policy--including monetary policy--can still do.
