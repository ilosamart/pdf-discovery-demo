middle-income families, putting homeownership out of reach.  By 2017, the median sales 

price for a single-family home was about four times median household income, up from 

three times median income in 1988.23   The homeownership rate for middle-income 

families was 68 percent in 2016, down from its peak in 2004 of 74 percent.24  For black 

households, the declines during and after the recession erased a decade of increases in 

homeownership—the homeownership rate for black households across the income 

spectrum was 42 percent in 2018, the same as the rate in the mid-1990s.25  The 

homeownership rate of Hispanics also declined with the recession but has recovered 

somewhat, reaching 47 percent in 2018. 

With homeownership lower and home prices rising faster than incomes, renting is 

also taking a bigger slice of many middle-income households’ earnings, leaving less 

savings for a down payment, an unexpected expense, or other investments.  From 2007 to 

2018, the share of income spent on rent rose from 18 percent to 25 percent for middle-

income renters.26  

Many middle-income families struggle to afford rent, particularly in the high-

demand areas where jobs are most available, underscoring the need for more workforce 

housing.  One way to increase the supply of middle-income housing is to reduce 

exclusionary zoning and other land-use restrictions that limit the supply of housing and
