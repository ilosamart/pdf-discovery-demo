care, regulation, taxes, and trade can cause firms to delay projects until the policy 

environment clarifies.   

Firms also seem quite uncertain about the disruptive capacity of new 

technologies.  Technological developments appear to be rapidly reshaping entire 

industries--in retail, transportation, and communications.  Elevated uncertainty about the 

continued viability of long-standing business models could be weighing on investment 

decisions.  Relatedly, it is possible that as the economy evolves in response to new 

technologies, production is becoming less capital intensive than it was in earlier 

decades.10      

Another possible explanation for the weakness of investment in the United States 

has been a decrease in competition within industries, as evidenced by decreasing firm 

entry and exit rates as well as increased industry concentration.11  Less competition 

allows firms to maintain high profits while lowering the pressure on them to increase 

production to maintain market share. 

In an earlier discussion, I attempted to quantify the effect that these factors--slow 

growth, demographics, and investment--might be having on the long-run equilibrium rate 

in the United States.12  According to simulations from the Board’s FRB/US model, the 

slowdown in growth appears likely to be the primary factor depressing the long-run 

equilibrium rate, although the contributions from demographics and weak investment 

demand were also sizable.
