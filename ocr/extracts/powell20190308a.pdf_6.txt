affecting the reserve market.4  Put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the 

typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market 

fluctuations.  

While the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain, standard 

projections, such as those in the table, suggest we could be near that level later this year.  

As we feel our way cautiously to this goal, we will move transparently and predictably in 

order to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives.  

The Committee is now well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet 

runoff later this year.  Once balance sheet runoff ends, we may, if appropriate, hold the 

size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to 

the desired level as other liabilities, such as currency, increase.  We expect to announce 

further details of this plan reasonably soon.   

There is no real precedent for the balance sheet normalization process, and we 

have adapted our approach along the way.  In these final phases, we will adjust the details 

of our normalization plans if economic and financial conditions warrant.  After decisions 

regarding the size of the balance sheet have been made, we will turn to remaining issues, 

such as the ultimate maturity composition of the portfolio.  The Committee has long 

stated that it intends to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities.   

Forward Guidance and the Normalization of Policy Communication  

The Committee has also been normalizing communication about our policy after a 

decade of forward guidance.  Since December 2008, the FOMCâ€™s postmeeting statement 

had contained ever-evolving forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the
