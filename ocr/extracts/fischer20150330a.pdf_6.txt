authorities to address the distress of nonbanks and its influence on the financial system.  

Before the crisis, the authorities had few policy levers to provide liquidity or to resolve 

failures of nonbanks in a way that would avoid serious spillovers.  Liquidity was 

ultimately provided to some nonbank markets, such as the markets for securities backed 

by consumer and business assets, but the facilities were far from simple and took 

substantial time to create and implement.6   

Finally, nonbank distress can transmit to the banking sector through many 

channels, such as counterparty relationships, disruptions in funding markets, and knock-

on effects of asset fire sales.  The failure of Lehman provides a good example.  It was a 

nonbank, and its failure both imposed direct losses on its many types of counterparties 

and disrupted many markets with negative effects on banks.  

Principles for Prudential Regulation of Nonbank Intermediaries and Activities 

It is widely understood that any regulation of nonbanks should fit their activities 

and the vulnerabilities they pose, which implies that not every nonbank financial 

institution or activity necessarily needs to be regulated.  The two key principles for 

prudential regulation of nonbanks when it is warranted, are simple:  First, we should be 

attentive to solvency and liquidity; second, we should recognize that the financial system 

will change over time, and thus close monitoring and analysis of the system are essential.   

Insolvency and illiquidity are classic financial stability concerns.  And as 

mentioned, they were common themes of the distress at nonbanks that we observed
