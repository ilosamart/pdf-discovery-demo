unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might increase the risk of a costly unanchoring 

of inflation expectations, leading in turn to financial and economic instability.  It is 

noteworthy, however, that the expansion of the balance sheet to date has not materially 

affected inflation expectations, likely in part because of the great emphasis the Federal 

Reserve has placed on developing tools to ensure that we can normalize monetary policy 

when appropriate, even if our securities holdings remain large.  In particular, the FOMC 

will be able to put upward pressure on short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate 

it pays banks for reserves they hold at the Fed.  Upward pressure on rates can also be 

achieved by using reserve-draining tools or by selling securities from the Federal 

Reserve’s portfolio, thus reversing the effects achieved by LSAPs.  The FOMC has spent 

considerable effort planning and testing our exit strategy and will act decisively to 

execute it at the appropriate time.  

A third cost to be weighed is that of risks to financial stability.  For example, 

some observers have raised concerns that, by driving longer-term yields lower, 

nontraditional policies could induce an imprudent reach for yield by some investors and 

thereby threaten financial stability.  Of course, one objective of both traditional and 

nontraditional policy during recoveries is to promote a return to productive risk-taking; as 

always, the goal is to strike the appropriate balance.  Moreover, a stronger recovery is 

itself clearly helpful for financial stability.  In assessing this risk, it is important to note 

that the Federal Reserve, both on its own and in collaboration with other members of the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council, has substantially expanded its monitoring of the 

financial system and modified its supervisory approach to take a more systemic 

perspective.  We have seen little evidence thus far of unsafe buildups of risk or leverage,
