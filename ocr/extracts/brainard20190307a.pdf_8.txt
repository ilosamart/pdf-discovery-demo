new normal that I have noted previously.6  The responsiveness of price inflation to 

resource utilization at the national level has been very weak for some time.  This raises 

the possibility that the economy may have room to run.  As the unemployment rate has 

fallen to levels not seen in many decades, we have heard concerns that the steeper 

Phillips curve of the past might reassert itself, perhaps in a nonlinear manner.7  But all 

available evidence suggests inflation expectations remain well anchored to the upside.    

Indeed, the contours of today’s new normal suggest we should be equally 

attentive to a risk of erosion in inflation expectations to the downside.  A range of 

evidence suggests that the long-run “neutral” rate of interest--the rate of interest 

consistent with the economy growing at its potential rate and stable inflation--is very low 

relative to its historical levels.  The low long-run neutral rate limits the amount of space 

available for cutting the federal funds rate to buffer the economy from adverse 

developments and is likely to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy 

rate is pinned at the lower bound.  In turn, more frequent or extended episodes when 

inflation is below target and policy is at the effective lower bound risk pulling down 

private-sector inflation expectations in a self-reinforcing downward spiral, which could 

further compress the monetary policy buffer to cushion downside shocks.8   

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made clear that the 2 percent 

inflation goal is symmetric.9 As the median SEP forecasts have indicated, a number of 

Committee members have previously projected a policy path consistent with inflation

fiscal space.
