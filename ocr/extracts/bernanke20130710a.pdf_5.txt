  Likewise, economic historians have 

pointed out that, under the real bills doctrine, the Fed increased the money supply 

precisely at those times at which business activity and upward pressures on prices were 

strongest; that is, monetary policy was procyclical.  Thus, the Fed’s actions tended to

During this early period, the new central bank did make an important addition to 

its menu of policy tools.  Initially, the Fed’s main tools were the quantity of its lending 

through the discount window and the interest rate at which it lent, the discount rate.  

Early on, however, to generate earnings to finance its operations, the Federal Reserve 

began purchasing government securities in the open market--what came to be known as 

open market operations.  In the early 1920s, Fed officials discovered that these operations 

affected the supply and cost of bank reserves and, consequently, the terms on which 

banks extended credit to their customers.  Subsequently, of course, open market 

operations became a principal monetary policy tool, one that allowed the Fed to interact 

with the broader financial markets, not only with banks.

about its accountability to the public?  As this audience knows, when the Federal Reserve 

was established, the question of whether it should be a private or a public institution was 

highly contentious.  The compromise solution created a hybrid Federal Reserve System.  

The System was headed by a governmentally appointed Board, which initially included 

the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency.  But the 12 regional 

Reserve Banks were placed under a mixture of public and private oversight, including
