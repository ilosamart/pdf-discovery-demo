policy, and the strength of global demand, so its value at any point in time cannot be 

estimated or projected with much precision.  My FOMC colleagues and I will therefore 

need to continue to reassess and revise our assessments of the neutral rate in response to 

incoming data and adjust monetary policy accordingly.  

How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties?  In 

my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments.  Moving too quickly 

risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass.  

A gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low 

neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut 

the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock.28  But we should 

also be wary of moving too gradually.  Job gains continue to run well ahead of the 

longer-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new 

entrants to the labor force.  Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds 

rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, 

potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to 

overcome without triggering a recession.  Persistently easy monetary policy might also 

eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications 

for financial stability.  For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects 

economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep 

monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent.   

                                                 
28 It might be thought that the FOMC could mitigate this problem by raising the federal funds rate higher 
than might otherwise be called for while the economy continues to expand in order to increase the extent to 
which interest rates could be cut later should a recession occur.  But this strategy would be 
counterproductive, because it would only serve to weaken economic activity and push down inflation 
before the recession.
