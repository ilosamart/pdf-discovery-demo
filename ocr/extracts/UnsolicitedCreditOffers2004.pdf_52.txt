products available in the marketplace and might expend valuable time and effort pursuing 
products for which they do not qualify. 

Moreover, restrictions on sending prescreened solicitations are likely to cause creditors 
and insurers to use less-efficient techniques to market their services, including additional 
mailings to prospective customers and to those unqualified for the product or service. 
The additional mailings would result in higher costs and ultimately higher prices to 
consumers, greater unease for those sensitive to privacy issues, and potentially more 
incidences of identity theft. 

The fact that approximately 20 million consumers have placed their names on the opt-out 
lists maintained by the national CRAs suggests that it is not especially difficult to avoid 
written offers of credit or insurance if so desired. Further, consumer survey responses 
reveal relatively little support for further government restrictions in this area. 

Finally, any further legislative or regulatory changes to the opt-out system should be 
informed by an evaluation of the effects of several new provisions of the Fact Act. In 
particular, the Fact Act provides further enhancements to the opt-out notice provisions of 
the FCRA, including a review of the presentation and placement of the notice in written 
prescreened solicitations and an extension of the opt-out period from two years to five 
years. The Congress has also directed the FTC to raise public awareness of opt-out 
rights.
