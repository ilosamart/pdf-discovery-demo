that specialized in the industries that were most negatively affected by increased imports 

from China.25   

Research suggests that some of the decline in prime-age labor force participation 

relates to some individualsâ€™ reduced ability or desire to work, in some cases resulting 

directly from the ongoing decline in job opportunities.  There are many reasons why 

some prime-age men may be less willing or able to work.  One possibility is that the 

unusually long spells of nonemployment associated with the Great Recession may have 

eroded job skills and informal employment networks.  Another possibility that is 

increasingly in focus is that physical disabilities, as well as sharp increases in opioid use, 

have increasingly inhibited some individuals from participating in the labor force.  The 

fraction of prime-age men receiving disability insurance benefits has increased from 

1 percent in the late 1970s to 3 percent more recently.26  Recent research also finds that 

among all prime-age men who are not in the labor force, about one-third reported having 

at least one disability, and nearly one-half reported taking pain medications daily.27  

These supply-side explanations may be related to the drop in labor demand:  the despair 

related to diminished prospects of a stable and quality job may lead to substance abuse 

and related health or mortality concerns.28

Schott (2016a) and Acemoglu and others (2016).  For evidence related to cross-country differences in these 
effects, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013), and Pierce and Schott (2016b).

27 Krueger (forthcoming) describes evidence from a variety of surveys showing that a significant fraction of 
prime-age men who are out of the labor force report having pain, being in poor health, or taking medication 
related to this pain, and that these behaviors are far more common among prime-age men than prime-age 
women.
