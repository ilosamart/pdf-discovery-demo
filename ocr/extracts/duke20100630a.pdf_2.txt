Good morning.  I am happy to be with you here at Ohio Bankers Day, sponsored by the 

Division of Financial Institutions at the Ohio Department of Commerce.  I’m sure you have 

plenty of topics to discuss during your meeting: commercial real estate, the housing market, 

regulatory reform, and the state of the local and national economies--to name just some.  I plan 

to focus on a topic that is getting a lot of attention at the Federal Reserve and one that I know is

During the recent financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and other policymakers throughout 

the government took unprecedented actions to preserve the financial system and the flow of

outstanding continues to decline.  So it seems important to ask why, in the face of all that was 

done to preserve it, is credit still dropping?  I have heard some say it is because banks don’t want 

to lend.  But I have trouble with that explanation.  Banks have to lend to be profitable.  A bank

solutions, therefore, will not be easy, and they will take time. 

Given my banking background, I have approached my responsibilities for economic and 

regulatory policymaking with a keen awareness of the importance of credit to the growth of an 

economy--most importantly, that there needs to be the right amount of credit.  Too much credit 

leads to underwriting mistakes and mispricing of risks, as well as an overheated economy.  Too 

little credit can choke an economy, as businesses can’t find adequate funding for expansion and 

consumers are unable to borrow against their future income to purchase cars and houses and to
