domestic demand depends on the responsiveness of domestic demand relative to the 

exchange rate.  The exchange rate channel, by raising the price of imports in domestic 

currency, also pushes up domestic inflation and exerts downward pressure on foreign 

inflation. 

The strength of spillovers across countries and the extent to which that affects 

policy divergence across countries depend on a foreign economy’s openness to these 

different channels.  The recent experience of Sweden suggests that for highly open 

economies, the effect of foreign shocks can be extremely powerful.11  Sweden’s 

economic growth has been relatively rapid recently, reaching nearly 4 percent over the 

most recent four quarters.  Moreover, the employment gap is estimated to be nearly 

closed, and there are signs of financial excess in the housing market.  In ordinary times, 

these conditions would be consistent with relatively tight monetary policy.  However, 

inflation has run persistently well below the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target.  

Given the relative openness of Sweden’s economy, moving the inflation rate back up to 

target has been greatly complicated by the sensitivity of Sweden’s exchange rate and 

financial conditions to developments in the euro area, where domestic economic 

conditions are consistent with much more accommodative policy.  As a result, the 

Riksbank has been pursuing extremely accommodative monetary policy, most recently 

lowering the interest rate on deposits to minus 0.5 percent and authorizing the Governor 

and Deputy Governor to intervene in foreign currency markets.   

Even in the much larger United States economy, with imports accounting for a 

little over 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), spillovers can be quite strong, in 

                                                 
11 Imports and exports each account for a little under one-half of Sweden’s GDP.
