rationales for various forms of regulation is beyond the scope of my remarks today.4  But let me 

briefly note that prudential regulation has two distinct motivations--microprudential and 

macroprudential.   

Microprudential regulation is concerned largely with the safety and soundness of a 

financial institution considered individually.  It seeks to protect the DIF by combatting what 

would otherwise be moral hazard and subsidized funding through capital requirements, activities 

restrictions, and other measures.  Because microprudential regulations were designed primarily 

to minimize losses to the DIF, they have traditionally focused on insured depository institutions 

(IDIs); the regulation of owners and affiliates of IDIs is essentially about ensuring that the 

activities and risks of those other entities do not threaten the IDIs themselves.  Up until the last 

several years, microprudential regulation would have come close to covering the entire field of 

prudential regulation. 

 The financial crisis highlighted the need to supplement traditional microprudential 

regulation with a macroprudential approach oriented toward the well-being of the financial 

system as a whole.  Here there are two related objectives, both of which seek to avoid costs that 

failure or severe stress would impose on the economy beyond those suffered by shareholders of a 

financial firm.  One is protecting against systemic risk--for example, the risk that certain 

activities or the failure of a firm would result in very large negative externalities, either through a 

classic domino effect or through contagion effects producing a financial crisis.  Losses in a tail 

event are likely to be correlated for large firms deeply engaged in trading and relying on short-

protection, anti-money-laundering efforts, and other nonprudential aims provide additional bases for regulation of 
financial institutions.
