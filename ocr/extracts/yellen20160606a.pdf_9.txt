medium term.  This drag, in part, reflects the prolonged effects of the significant increase 

in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the middle of 2014, a development that

foreign producers.   

Although lower oil prices have likely been a positive influence on the U.S. 

economy overall, they also have had a negative side, given the sizable U.S. energy 

industry.  New drilling and energy-sector employment have plunged, and the effects have

in drilling activity are likely now behind us, and with oil prices having recovered

Business investment has been weak in the past six months or so, even beyond the 

energy sector, and investment in capital equipment is reported to have declined in the last 

quarter of 2015 and first quarter of this year.  I suspect there is a transitory element to this 

weak investment performance, and I expect investment to rebound.  But the latest labor 

market data raise the less favorable possibility that firms may instead have decided to 

expand their operations more slowly, and I intend to continue to pay close attention to 

developments in this area.

the challenges that the economy continues to face, I continue to expect further progress 

toward our employment and inflation objectives.   

Some Important Uncertainties
