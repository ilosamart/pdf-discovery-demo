Community Reinvestment Act 

The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have received 

numerous constructive comments on ways to update the implementation of the 

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to better reflect changes in the ways banking 

services are being provided and banks are interacting with their communities.  A few of 

the most common issues raised include those related to whether the definition of 

Assessment Areas should be revised because of changes in technology that allow banks 

to gather deposits and make loans far from existing branches and deposit-taking ATMs, 

whether the asset thresholds that determine the examination methods for banks of 

different sizes should be raised to lessen regulatory burden on smaller banks, and whether 

the performance tests should be revised to give more meaningful consideration to 

community development activities.   

These are important issues, and we are looking at a wide range of suggestions and 

options, which may mean it will take us time to distill the comments and formulate 

effective policy responses in collaboration with the other banking agencies.  In the 

meantime, I urge you to continue providing specific suggestions to help inform our 

interagency deliberations.
