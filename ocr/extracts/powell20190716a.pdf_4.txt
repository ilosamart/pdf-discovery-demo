have slowed notably.  Moreover, the manufacturing sector has been weak since the 

beginning of the year, in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker 

growth in the global economy, and, as our business contacts tell us, concerns about trade

Uncertainties about this outlook have increased, however, particularly regarding trade 

developments and global growth.  In addition, issues such as the U.S. federal debt ceiling 

and Brexit remain unresolved.  FOMC participants have also raised concerns about a 

more prolonged shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent target.  Market-based measures 

of inflation compensation have shifted down, and some survey-based expectations 

measures are near the bottom of their historical ranges.   

Many FOMC participants judged at the time of our most recent meeting in June 

that the combination of these factors strengthens the case for a somewhat more 

accommodative stance of policy.  We are carefully monitoring these developments and 

assessing their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation, and will act as
