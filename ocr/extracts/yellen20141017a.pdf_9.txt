concentrated at the top since 1989 at rates similar to those for overall wealth, which we 

saw in figure 3.15 

Those are the basics on wealth and income inequality from the SCF.  Other 

research tells us that inequality tends to persist from one generation to the next.  For 

example, one study that divides households by income found that 4 in 10 children raised 

in families in the lowest-income fifth of households remain in that quintile as adults.16  

Fewer than 1 in 10 children of families at the bottom later reach the top quintile.  The 

story is flipped for children raised in the highest-income households:  When they grow 

up, 4 in 10 stay at the top and fewer than 1 in 10 fall to the bottom.   

Research also indicates that economic mobility in the United States has not 

changed much in the last several decades; that mobility is lower in the United States than 

in most other advanced countries; and, as I noted earlier, that economic mobility and 

income inequality among advanced countries are negatively correlated.17  

Four Building Blocks of Opportunity 

An important factor influencing intergenerational mobility and trends in 

inequality over time is economic opportunity.  While we can measure overall mobility 

                                                 
15 In 1989, the top 5 percent of households held 54 percent of financial assets, the next 45 percent (that is, 

home-owning households in the 50th through 95th percentiles of the wealth distribution) held 42 percent, 

and the bottom half held 4 percent.
