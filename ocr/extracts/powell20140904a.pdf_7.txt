transactions may become even more infrequent in the future.  While it is also possible 

that activity in these markets could rebound, the threat that this form of borrowing may 

decline further, particularly in periods of stress, seems likely to remain. 

So let me pose a question:  Is it wise to rely on a critical benchmark that is built 

on a market in decline?  Clearly not.  The risks to market functioning are simply too 

great.  For example, market activity could decline to the point where publication of a rate 

becomes untenable.  And many of the panel banks have expressed concerns about the 

ongoing legal risks of remaining on the panel.  If the publication of LIBOR were to 

become untenable or if we were to simply “end LIBOR,” as some have urged, untangling 

the $150 trillion in outstanding U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts would entail a protracted, 

expensive, and uncertain process of negotiating amendments to an enormous number of 

complex documents--a horrible mess and a feast for the legal profession, to be sure.  It 

does not help matters that the hundreds of trillions of dollars’ worth of derivatives 

contracts referencing LIBOR do not, in general, have robust backups in the event that 

publication of a rate ceases.   

The FSB report identifies ways to improve U.S. dollar LIBOR, and to create 

alternatives to it, while minimizing transition costs, particularly for end users who bear 

no blame for the misconduct.  The proposed reforms come down to two simple ideas.  

First, U.S. dollar LIBOR needs to be redefined to include a broader range of transaction 

types.  Doing so will make it more robust and will allow it to reflect actual bank funding 

costs, which is what the rate was intended to do in the first place.  Second, we need to 

promote robust alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR that better reflect the secured nature of 

many of today’s financial market transactions.
