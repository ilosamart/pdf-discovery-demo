Continuing on with the theme of maturity transformation, the next brief stop on 

the tour is the agency mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) sector.  These agency 

REITs buy agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), fund them largely in the short-

term repo market in what is essentially a levered carry trade, and are required to pass 

through at least 90 percent of the net interest to their investors as dividends.  As shown in 

exhibit 7, they have grown rapidly in the past few years, from $152 billion at year-end 

2010 to $398 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012.      

One interesting aspect of this business model is that its economic viability is 

sensitive to conditions in both the MBS market and the repo market.  If MBS yields 

decline, or the repo rate rises, the ability of mortgage REITs to generate current income 

based on the spread between the two is correspondingly reduced. 

  Another place where the desire to generate yield can show up is in commercial 

banks’ securities holdings.  In recent work, Sam Hanson and I documented that the 

duration of banks’ non-trading-account securities holdings tends to increase significantly 

when the short rate declines.

  We hypothesized that this pattern was due to a particular 

form of agency behavior--namely, that given the conventions of generally accepted 

accounting principles, a bank can boost its reported income by replacing low-yielding 

short-duration securities with higher-yielding long-duration securities.  

Something along these lines seems to be happening today:  The maturity of 

securities in banks’ available-for-sale portfolios is near the upper end of its historical 

range.  This finding is noteworthy on two counts.  First, the added interest rate exposure 

may itself be a meaningful source of risk for the banking sector and should be monitored 

carefully--especially since existing capital regulation does not explicitly address interest
