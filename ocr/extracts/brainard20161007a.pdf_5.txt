value, tenor, and coupon payment stream, a smart contract would automatically execute 

payments on the specified schedule to the assigned owner over the life of the bond. 

Although the idea of automating certain aspects of contracts is not new, and banks do 

some of this today, the potential introduction of smart contracts does raise several issues 

for consideration.  For example, what is the legal status of a smart contract, which is 

written in code?  Would consumers and businesses rely on smart contracts to perform 

certain services traditionally done by their banks or other intermediaries?  Could the 

widespread automated interaction of multiple counterparties lead to any unwanted 

dynamics for financial markets?  These and other considerations will be important factors 

in determining the extent of the application of smart contracts. 

Regardless of the application, much of the industry is at a “proof of concept” 

stage of development.  These proofs of concept are often simple, experimental uses of the 

technology on a small scale that help stakeholders understand the potential and 

limitations of the technology for a specific purpose, which in turn typically lead to 

refinements and more developed proofs of concept.  As such, many potential applications 

are in their infancy, and the industry may still be several years away from an application 

that is ready to be fully implemented.  Even so, the industry seems to be making 

announcements daily on new proofs of concept and progress that may lead to pilots, so 

that timeline could accelerate.  In some cases, there have been announcements the 

technology will be used within the next year or two in actual production environments. 

The initial relatively simple proofs of concept must be followed by much more complex 

demonstrations in real-world situations before these technologies can be safely deployed 

in today’s highly interconnected, synchronized, and far-reaching financial markets.
