a.  Credit-worthiness Standards 

 Section 939A of the Act requires the agencies to establish, to the extent feasible, 
uniform standards of credit-worthiness to replace references to, or requirements of 
reliance on, credit ratings for purposes of the agencies’ regulations.  The agencies are 
therefore considering alternative credit-worthiness standards, including those currently in 
use in the agencies’ regulations, supervisory guidance, and market practices.  The 
agencies recognize that any measure of credit-worthiness will involve a tradeoff among 
the principles listed below.  For example, a more refined differentiation of risk might be 
achievable only at the expense of greater implementation burden.  In evaluating any 
standard of credit-worthiness for purposes of determining risk-based capital 
requirements, the agencies will, to the extent practicable and consistent with the other 
objectives, consider whether the standard would:   

 Appropriately distinguish the credit risk associated with a particular exposure 
within an asset class; 

 Be sufficiently transparent, replicable, and defined to allow banking organizations 
of varying size and complexity to arrive at the same assessment of credit-
worthiness for similar exposures and to allow for appropriate supervisory review; 

 Provide for the timely and accurate measurement of negative and positive changes 
in credit-worthiness;  

 Minimize opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage; 

 Be reasonably simple to implement and not add undue burden on banking 
organizations; and 

 Foster prudent risk management. 

 Question 1: The agencies seek comment on the principles that should guide the 
formulation of credit-worthiness standards.  Do the principles provided above capture the 
appropriate elements of sound credit-worthiness standards?  How could the principles be 
strengthened? 

b.  Possible alternatives to credit ratings in the risk-based capital standards 

 The agencies’ existing risk-based capital standards include a range of approaches 
to differentiating credit risk.  At one end of the spectrum, the agencies’ general risk-based 
capital rules provide a relatively simple approach to measuring and differentiating risk 
based on the use of broad risk buckets.  This approach requires all corporate exposures, 
for example, to receive the same risk weight, regardless of the variation in risks that exist 
across corporate exposures. At the other end of the spectrum, the agencies’ advanced 
approaches rules require a banking organization to make its own assessment of the credit 
risk of a corporate exposure, subject to a number of agency-prescribed standards.  This 
assessment is then used as an input into a supervisory formula to calculate minimum risk-
