could lead to a significant increase in structural unemployment over time as individuals 

who are out of work for long periods face the erosion of their skills.  However, such 

effects would take time to materialize and, in any event, would argue for aggressive 

policies to reduce unemployment promptly. 

Another portion of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve is likely due to 

increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which may have induced 

some unemployed workers to be more selective in the job offers they accept.  However, 

recent research suggests that the increase in unemployment due to extended benefits is 

probably small relative to the overall increase in unemployment, and, regardless of its 

magnitude, the influence of extended unemployment benefits will disappear as the 

economy improves and extended benefits expire.16   

Moreover, at least some of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve 

appears to reflect cyclical rather than structural influences.  For example, vacancies 

typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing 

counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in 

the Beveridge curve.  Indeed, as is evident from the figure, such counterclockwise 

movements have occurred in most previous recessions.   

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that most of the co-movement between 

unemployment and vacancies in recent years does not appear especially unusual.  In 

particular, low vacancies and elevated layoffs--likely driven by weak labor demand--can 

account for much of the increase in unemployment that has occurred since mid-2008.17
