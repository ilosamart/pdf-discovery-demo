how young adults are faring in the economy and what the short- and long-term 

implications may have been for entering the job market at a time of significantly 

constrained opportunities.  This is another example of how exogenous factors--those over 

which individuals have little or no control--may play an important role in determining 

how easily someone is able to improve his or her circumstances.   

Communities also affect economic mobility, and here, too, more research is 

needed to understand how and to what extent these effects occur.  Economists do not 

fully understand how locational differences affect economic mobility or the complex 

relationship between economic mobility and geographic mobility.  There are community 

characteristics--for instance, the composition and level of local employment, schools, 

transportation, physical infrastructure, and community facilities--that may affect the 

economic mobility of the residents of that community.  And there is also a community 

development analogue to economic mobility:  Further research may help us better 

understand why some communities succeed or fail in generating jobs, developing 

successful small businesses, attracting infrastructure investment, and so on.  How do 

some places advance economically and create circumstances in which residents, in turn, 

are more likely to thrive? 

Finally, there are important research questions to be answered about the 

relationship between economic mobility and the economy as a whole.  It seems obvious 

that greater economic opportunity and mobility promotes a healthier economy.  

Entrepreneurship, innovation, and hard work--surely key contributors to individual 

mobility--are central to a strong economy as well.  But research could help us better 

understand how much mobility at the individual level matters for overall growth in
