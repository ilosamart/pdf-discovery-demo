The Fed used this emergency lending authority to provide liquidity in the face of a 

systemwide panic that threatened the financial system.  As the crisis receded, the 

Congress took two related actions.  First, it gave the regulators what they had badly 

needed during the crisis, which was a means of resolving the largest financial institutions 

without threatening the financial system.  Second, the Congress prohibited emergency 

loans to individual firms but retained the Fed’s ability to establish broadly available 

lending programs during a crisis, with the prior approval of the Secretary of the Treasury 

and timely notification of the Congress.  

This tradeoff came after extensive consultation between the Congress and the 

Federal Reserve.  And I believe that it struck a reasonable balance.  I also believe it 

would be a mistake to go further and impose additional restrictions.  One of the lessons of 

the crisis is that the financial system evolves so quickly that it is difficult to predict where 

threats will emerge and what actions may be needed in the future to respond.  Because we 

cannot anticipate what may be needed in the future, the Congress should preserve the 

ability of the Fed to respond flexibly and nimbly to future emergencies.  Further 

restricting or eliminating the Fed’s emergency lending authority will not prevent future 

crises, but it will hinder the Fed’s ability to limit the harm from those crises for families 

and businesses. 

Conclusion  

In our democratic system, the Federal Reserve owes the public and the Congress a 

high degree of transparency and accountability.  The Congress has wisely given the Fed 

the tools it needs to implement monetary policy and respond to future crises as well as 

crucial independence to do its work free from short-term political influence.  I would
