example, in our redlining referrals, the Federal Reserve found that the banks treated majority-

minority areas less favorably than non-minority ones, such as through lending patterns,

to African American or Hispanic borrowers than it charged to non-Hispanic white borrowers and 

that the higher prices could not be explained by legitimate pricing criteria.12   

Efficiency, Simplicity, and Transparency of Consumer Compliance Supervision 

Consumers deserve to be treated fairly, regardless of the size of the banking institution. 

Yet, we can achieve this goal and still reduce regulatory burden through a balanced program of 

tailored and risk-focused supervision.  Accordingly, we continue to seek opportunities to 

promote efficient, simple, and transparent supervision where possible, so that the institutions we 

supervise can focus on finding solutions that work for all consumers and communities.  In an 

effort to promote consumer compliance, our community bank supervisory program focuses our 

examinations on the areas of highest consumer risk.  This has improved the efficiency and 

effectiveness of our examinations and reduced regulatory burden for many community banks.  

Banks and consumers benefit when supervision is timely and effective.  

Put simply, our role as supervisors should not be to play “gotcha” with our banks, but to 

support their compliance efforts.  The Interagency Consumer Compliance Ratings System, 

published in November 2016, is an example of this approach.13  This guidance provides 

incentives for institutions to focus on managing their consumer compliance risks, preventing
