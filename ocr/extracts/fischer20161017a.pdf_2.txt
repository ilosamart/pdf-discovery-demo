I am grateful to the Economic Club of New York for inviting me to speak today.  

My subject is the historically low level of interest rates, a topic not far from the minds of 

many in this audience and of many others in the United States and all over the world.1   

Notwithstanding the increase in the federal funds rate last December, the federal 

funds rate remains at a very low level.  Policy rates of many other major central banks are 

lower still--even negative in some cases, even in countries long famous for their 

conservative monetary policies.  Long-term interest rates in many countries are also 

remarkably low, suggesting that participants in financial markets expect policy rates to 

remain depressed for years to come.  My main objective today will be to present a 

quantitative assessment of some possible factors behind low interest rates--and also of 

factors that could contribute to higher interest rates in the future. 

Now, I am sure that the reaction of many of you may be, “Well, if you and your 

Fed colleagues dislike low interest rates, why not just go ahead and raise them?  You are 

the Federal Reserve, after all.”  One of my goals today is to convince you that it is not 

that simple, and that changes in factors over which the Federal Reserve has little 

influence--such as technological innovation and demographics--are important factors 

contributing to both short- and long-term interest rates being so low at present.    

There are at least three reasons why we should be concerned about such low 

interest rates.  First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates 

are a signal that the economy’s long-run growth prospects are dim.  Later, I will go into
