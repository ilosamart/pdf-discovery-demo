Monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy central banks played 

a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to EMEs in recent years.  There is 

good reason to think that the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies 

should continue to prove manageable for EMEs.  Fed policy normalization has proceeded 

without disruption to financial markets, and market participants’ expectations for policy 

(the red symbols in figure 6) seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers’ 

expectations in the Summary of Economic Projections (the black dots), suggesting that 

markets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with 

expectations.   

It also bears emphasizing that the EMEs themselves have made considerable 

progress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s.  Many EMEs 

have substantially improved their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks while adopting 

more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better 

insulation from external financial shocks.6  Corporate debt at risk--the debt of firms with 

limited debt service capacity--has been rising in EMEs, as shown in figure 7.7  But this 

rise has been relatively limited outside of China and has begun to reverse as stronger 

global growth has pushed up earnings.    

                                                 
Ghosh and others (2012).  These papers generally conclude that many factors, including both “pull” and 
“push,” affect EME capital flows.  
6 See, for example, Obstfeld, Ostry, and Qureshi (2017).  The results in IMF (2017) also indicate that while 
global financial conditions explain a significant portion of countries’ domestic financial conditions, 
domestic monetary policy changes also play an important role in economies with flexible exchange rates.   
7 The interest coverage ratio (ICR) is the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and 
amortization to interest expense.  A value of 2 or less is typically associated with an increased likelihood of 
distress.  For example, just before the Asian financial crisis, firms in Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia had an 
average ICR of 2; see Pomerleano (1998).
