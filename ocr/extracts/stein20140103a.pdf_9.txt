the Deposit Insurance Fund, I think there is something deeper here than can be explained 

by a simple appeal to deposit-insurance-induced moral hazard. 

So what, then, is the story?  As I alluded to earlier, it begins with the observation 

that a deposit franchise has two important dimensions.  First, it offers a bank a low-cost 

source of financing, given the premium that investors are willing to pay (that is, the lower 

yield they are willing to accept) for safe money-like claims.  And, second, it offers 

funding stability, since with an adequate capital buffer and deposit insurance, it is rational 

for depositors to be “sleepy” and disregard moderate changes in the mark-to-market value 

of long-term fixed-income assets.  Thus, a stable deposit franchise gives a bank the 

ability to ride out transitory valuation changes of the sort that might come from noise-

trader shocks or fire sales, without being forced to liquidate assets at temporarily 

depressed prices.

  As a result, traditional banks with stable funding have an advantage 

relative to their shadow banking counterparts in holding those assets where transitory 

repricing risk is high for a given level of underlying fundamental cash flow risk.   

Here’s one way to put the broad theme of our work:  We have learned from this 

year’s Nobel laureates, Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller, that discount rate variation--that 

is, transitory movements in asset prices not driven by changes in future expected cash 

flows--is central to understanding asset pricing.  Our basic message is that this same 

discount rate variation may also be central to thinking about financial intermediation and, 

in particular, the connection between the asset and liability sides of intermediary balance 

sheets.  In a world with transitory pricing shocks, a stable funding structure can be an 

important source of comparative advantage for holding certain types of assets.
