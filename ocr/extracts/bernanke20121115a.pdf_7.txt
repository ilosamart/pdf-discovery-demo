  Lenders also appear to have pulled back on offering these 

borrowers loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).  

When lenders were asked why they have originated fewer mortgages, they cited a

prices, and their existing real estate loan exposures.  They also mention increases in 

servicing costs and the risk of being required by government-sponsored enterprises 

(GSEs) to repurchase delinquent loans (so-called putback risk).  Other concerns include 

the reduced availability of private mortgage insurance for conventional loans and some 

program-specific issues for FHA loans as reasons for tighter standards.  Also, some 

evidence suggests that mortgage originations for new purchases may be constrained 

because of processing capacity, as high levels of refinancing have drawn on the same 

personnel who would otherwise be available for handling loans for purchase.  

Importantly, however, restrictive mortgage lending conditions do not seem to be linked to 

any insufficiency of bank capital or to a general unwillingness to lend.     

Certainly, some tightening of credit standards was an appropriate response to the 

lax lending conditions that prevailed in the years leading up to the peak in house prices.  

Mortgage loans that were poorly underwritten or inappropriate for the borrowerâ€™s 

circumstances ultimately had devastating consequences for many families and 

communities, as well as for the financial institutions themselves and the broader 

economy.  However, it seems likely at this point that the pendulum has swung too far the
