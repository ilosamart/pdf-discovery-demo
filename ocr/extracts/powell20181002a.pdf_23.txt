Figure 6. Indicators of Inflation Expectations

      Note:  Inflation compensation is the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and yields on Treasury Inflation−
Protected Securities (TIPS), which are indexed to the total consumer price index.  The series reports weekly averages of daily data and
extends from January 1998 through September 2018.  Household expectations are median long−term expectations from the University
of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.  The data are quarterly averages and extend through 2018:Q3.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters
(SPF) values are expectations for average personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index inflation over the next 10 years.  Before
2007, expectations are for consumer price index inflation, adjusted to a PCE basis.  The data are quarterly and extend through August 2018.
