in a context of price stability.     

Monetary Policy 

The low interest rate environment presents special challenges for monetary 

policy.  In setting our target for the federal funds rate, a good place to start is to identify 

the rate that would prevail if the economy were at 2 percent inflation and full 

employment--the so-called neutral rate.  “Neutral” in this context means that the rate is 

neither contractionary nor expansionary.  If the fed funds rate is lower than the neutral 

rate, then policy is stimulative or accommodative, which will tend to raise growth and 

inflation.  If the fed funds rate is higher than the neutral rate, then policy is tight and will 

tend to slow growth and reduce inflation.   

But we can only estimate the neutral rate, and those estimates are subject to 

substantial uncertainty.  Before the crisis, the long-run neutral rate was generally thought 

to be roughly stable at around 4.25 percent.  Since the crisis, estimates have steadily
