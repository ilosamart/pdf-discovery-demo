Branches.  Directors include prominent private-sector leaders who represent a wide and 

growing diversity of backgrounds and views about the economy.13 

The federated structure of the Federal Reserve System earned the endorsement of 

even the populist hero of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, William Jennings Bryan.  

The compromise created an institution that could address the shortcomings of the 

American financial system while assuring that control of the Federal Reserve would be 

shared widely.14  The structure was different from those of the first and second Banks of 

the United States, and from those of foreign central banks at the time.  Congressman 

Carter Glass, who worked to win passage of the Federal Reserve Act in Congress, called 

the Federal Reserve’s uniquely American design “an adventure in constructive finance” 

(figure 9).15 

The Modern Federal Reserve 

In the System’s early years, the decentralized structure gave the Reserve Banks 

considerable scope to make independent decisions that applied to their own Districts, 

which made it difficult to effect policy.  For example, one Bank’s purchases of securities 

could be offset by another Bank’s sale, given that the market for securities was national 

                                                 
13 Directors are chosen, according to Sections 4(11) and 4(12) of the Federal Reserve Act, “with due but not 
exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers” 
(see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 302 as amended by an act of Nov. 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1388), 
paragraphs on class B and class C directors, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section4.htm). 
14 Authors Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell write, “Throughout much of American history there has been a 
deep and abiding mistrust of bankers and a widespread fear of a ‘money monopoly’--a fear that those 
needing to borrow would be taken advantage of by those able to lend.  Such questions had figured 
prominently in the debates over the fates of the First Bank and Second Bank of the United States, and they 
played a role in the popular support of free banking legislation.  They had also led to the almost universal 
adoption of usury ceilings on interest rates (typically 6 percent) that were more honored in name than 
reality.  These concerns were the subject of congressional inquiries, the most famous of which were the 
Pujo hearings into the Money Trust in the wake of the 1907 panic.”  See Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell
