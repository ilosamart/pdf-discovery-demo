workers, the employment-to-population ratio is 79.3 percent, up almost 1 percentage 

point over the past year.  These developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor 

market is providing employment opportunities to more Americans.  Nonetheless, this is 

still about 1 percentage point below its previous cyclical peak, suggesting there may be 

some room for further gains.   

In another encouraging development, wage gains in the August report reached 

their highest level since the depth of the financial crisis, although wage growth remains 

moderate by historical standards.  While a variety of wage measures have accelerated 

over the past year and there is anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in some sectors 

and regions, there is no evidence of rapid acceleration in the aggregate wage indicators.  

At 3.9 percent, the August unemployment rate was about 1/2 percentage point 

lower than the previous year.  If unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as 

we have seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the 

1960s.  Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight 

levels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial 

imbalances.13  For instance, the inflation process may change in unexpected ways.   

So far, the data on inflation remain encouraging, providing little signal of an 

outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, and some reassurance that underlying 

trend inflation may be moving closer to 2 percent, on the other.  Core personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE) prices have increased 2 percent over the past 

12 months, consistent with the FOMCâ€™s objective.  Survey measures of inflation 

expectations remain stable in the lower end of the historical ranges, while market-based
