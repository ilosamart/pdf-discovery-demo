Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be here at the Banque de France and take part 

in this important symposium on the “Euro Area:  Staying the Course through 

Uncertainties.”1   

Both in the financial press and in international policy circles, one hears a great 

deal about the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy to other economies.  One hears 

somewhat less, though, about how global shocks affect the U.S. economy.2  So, in my 

remarks today, I will discuss how the U.S. economy’s increasing integration with the rest 

of the world has made it more exposed to foreign shocks, and I will focus in particular on 

the channels of transmission through which these shocks operate.  I will close with a few 

words on current prospects, in which global crosscurrents are again posing challenges for 

the U.S. economy and monetary policy.  

Greater Integration between the United States and the Rest of the World  

The U.S. economy’s integration with the rest of the world, both in terms of trade 

and finance, has risen substantially over the past 60 years.  Since the 1960s, both U.S. 

exports and imports have about tripled as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), with 

their sum now about 30 percent of GDP--still relatively small by international standards, 

but certainly notable.   

Financial linkages have grown enormously as well.  The United States has had 

open capital markets for a long time, but the sum of U.S. external assets and liabilities

based on a textual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee minutes, and examine the connection 
between this indicator and U.S. monetary policy.
