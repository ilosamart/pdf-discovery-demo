The Board adopted the GSIB surcharge requirement as part of its implementation of 

section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which established the important macroprudential principle 

that financial firms should be subject to increasingly stringent regulation as their systemic 

importance increases.  As explained in more detail in the white paper that accompanied the 

Board’s final GSIB risk-based capital surcharge rule,11 the material distress or failure of a GSIB 

would have an adverse impact on the financial system as a whole that is far greater than the 

impact on the financial system of the distress or failure of a non-GSIB banking firm. 

Accordingly, GSIBs should face capital surcharges to compel internalization of those external 

costs.  This should reduce the probability of a GSIB’s failure enough below that of a non-GSIB 

that the expected impact on the system of a GSIB and a non-GSIB failure are more comparable. 

Because the difference in the external costs of the distress or failure of a GSIB as 

compared to a non-GSIB is likely to be at least as high during times of macroeconomic and 

financial market stress as during ordinary times, there is no reason why the GSIB surcharge 

should not be a part of the post-stress capital regime.  A complementary point is that the extra 

buffer required by the GSIB surcharge also reflects the fact that even the best-conceived annual 

stress scenarios cannot capture all tail risks in the financial system.  The integration of capital 

rules and the stress test thus advances our second aim in initiating our CCAR review--the 

incorporation of more macroprudential elements. 

As some of you may know, Chair Yellen and I have, on a number of occasions over the 

past year or so, indicated publicly that we would be considering the effective incorporation of the 

surcharge into post-stress capital expectations.  Some industry representatives have subsequently 

argued that this step is not warranted.  While we will of course address these and other comments
