Under the CBO projection that I noted earlier, the primary budget deficit is expected to 

be 2 percent of GDP in 2015 and then rise to almost 3 percent of GDP in 2020 and 

6 percent of GDP in 2030.  These projections provide a gauge of the adjustments that will 

be necessary to attain fiscal sustainability.  To put the budget on a sustainable trajectory, 

policy actions--either reductions in spending or increases in revenues or some 

combination of the two--will have to be taken to eventually close these primary budget 

gaps. 

By definition, the unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debt that the CBO 

outlines cannot actually happen, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a 

government with debt, relative to national income, that is rising without limit.  The 

economist Herbert Stein succinctly described this type of situation:  “If something cannot 

go on forever, it will stop.”6  One way or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to 

stabilize the federal budget must occur at some point.  The question is whether these 

adjustments will take place through a careful and deliberative process that weighs 

priorities and gives people adequate time to adjust to changes in government programs or 

tax policies, or whether the needed fiscal adjustments will be a rapid and painful response 

to a looming or actual fiscal crisis.  Acting now to develop a credible program to reduce 

future deficits would not only enhance economic growth and stability in the long run, but 

could also yield substantial near-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates 

and increased consumer and business confidence.  Plans recently put forward by the 

President’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and other 

                                                                                                                                                 
government debt is higher than the growth rate of nominal GDP, as might happen if creditors become wary 
of lending, then a primary budget surplus rather than primary balance is needed to stabilize the ratio of debt 
to GDP.
