focused on marketwide risks, core financial institutions, and macro-level shocks, we are 

also developing a more granular understanding of the distribution and strength of 

household balance sheets.19  Progress on this frontier is being aided by greater access to 

timely, account-level, and geographically specific data on consumer credit, mortgages, 

and spending, although more research in this area would be valuable.   

Slower income growth, as well as substantial volatility in income, has raised the 

financial stress faced by low- and moderate-income families and may be limiting absolute 

mobility across generations.  Over time, the “American Dream” that each generation can 

expect to be better off than their parents’ generation has gone from being widespread to 

increasingly out of reach for much of the population.20  Researchers have found that the 

reduction in economic mobility has been driven primarily by a more unequal distribution 

of economic growth, with slower overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth a 

secondary factor.21   

Many households had been contending with volatile incomes even before the 

large negative shocks of the Great Recession and the increase in contingent work 

                                                 
19 See, for example, Parker (2014) and Sufi (2014) for useful, research-founded ideas for assessing and 
monitoring the potential for financial fragility among households in the context of the financial system; see 
also Palumbo (forthcoming) for a particular application.  The Quarterly Report on Household Debt and 
Credit from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which draws on its Consumer Credit Panel, is another 
example of new monitoring efforts on household finances in the Federal Reserve System.  More

20 Chetty and others (2017) estimate that rates of absolute mobility fell from about 90 percent for children 
born in 1940 to 50 percent for children born in the 1980s.  Some research, such as Winship (2017), reaches 
different conclusions on the magnitude of the change, although not on the direction. 
21 Chetty and others (2017) estimate that the slower overall GDP growth experienced by the 1980 birth 
cohort relative to the 1940 birth cohort can account for about 10 percentage points of the decline in 
absolute mobility, while the less equal distribution of income can account for about 30 percentage points of 
the decline.  Commenting on this work, Katz and Krueger (2017) underscore that stagnant growth of 
median household income since the 1970s has been central to the decline in absolute mobility.
