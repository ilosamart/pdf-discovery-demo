central banks.    

The success of these swap lines in alleviating funding pressures and reducing 

interbank borrowing rates is a testament to the benefits of central bank cooperation.  

Moreover, in addition to easing funding shortages, these swaps also helped to allay 

market fears--they had a preventive as well as a curative role.  For example, four of the 

central banks that participated in these arrangements--Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, and 

Singapore--did not end up drawing on the facilities, but it is generally believed that the 

existence of the lines helped prevent stresses that could have otherwise developed.  As 

the financial crisis receded, the swap lines were closed in February 2010.  However, swap 

lines with several foreign central banks were reopened in response to financial strains that 

developed in Europe.3 

 In many countries, policy rates fell to nearly zero.  With substantial economic 

slack remaining, these central banks faced the challenge of finding ways to further ease 

monetary policy.  The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet through the purchase 

of longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities.  

The idea was to put downward pressure on longer-term yields to spur demand and also to 

encourage some portfolio rebalancing toward riskier assets and loans to the private 

sector.  More recently, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to extend the 

average maturity of its holdings of securities by selling shorter-maturity Treasury 

securities and buying longer-maturity Treasury securities.  This maturity extension

through February 2013.
