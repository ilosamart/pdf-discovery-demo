policy space available to offset adverse developments using our more effective 

conventional tools, the low neutral rate could increase the likely frequency of periods of 

below-trend inflation.  In short, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk 

of pulling down private-sector inflation expectations.7   

Given today’s circumstances, with the economy near full employment and 

inflation below target, how should the FOMC achieve its dual-mandate goals?  Some 

might determine that preemptive tightening is appropriate on the grounds that monetary 

policy operates with long lags, and inflation will inevitably accelerate as the labor market 

continues to tighten because of the Phillips curve.  However, in today’s economy, there 

are reasons to worry that the Phillips curve will not prove very reliable in boosting 

inflation as resource utilization tightens.  Since 2012, inflation has tended to change 

relatively little as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, from 8.2 percent to 4.4 

percent.8  In short, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.9  

This is also apparent in a number of advanced foreign economies, where declines in their 

unemployment rates to relatively low levels have failed to generate significant upward 

pressures on inflation.10  Given the flatness of the Phillips curve, it could take a 

considerable undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to achieve our inflation 

objective if we were to rely on resource utilization alone.   

For all these reasons, achieving our inflation target on a sustainable basis is likely 

to require a firming in longer-run inflation expectations--that is, the underlying trend.

8 The inflation information refers to core PCE inflation measured on a 12-month average basis. 
9 Similarly, inflation did not fall very much as the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent during the 
Great Recession.  See Blanchard (2016), Kiley (2015), and Brainard (2015).
