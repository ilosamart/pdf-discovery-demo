of the demands on Medicaid and other social services.  Moreover, the municipal bond 

market has remained reasonably receptive this year to most borrowers, with rates low and 

new issuance relatively solid, despite the concerns about the fiscal positions of many state 

and local governments.  All that being said, with economic conditions still far from 

normal, state budgets will probably remain under substantial pressure for a while, leaving 

governors and legislatures a difficult juggling act as they try to maintain essential 

services while meeting their budgetary obligations. 

A question for the longer run is whether the vulnerability of state budgets to 

business-cycle downturns can be ameliorated.  The pressures that states face during and 

after a recession are the result, in part, of balanced-budget rules in state constitutions that 

prohibit the use of long-term borrowing to cover operating budget shortfalls, a constraint 

not faced by the federal government, as you know.  I do not advocate changing the 

balanced-budget rules followed by 49 of the 50 states; they provide important discipline 

and are a key reason that states have not built up long-term debt burdens comparable to 

those of many national governments.  However, as is the case today, these rules may 

force significant state cutbacks in bad economic times when services are most needed.  

Moreover, many government programs--in areas such as education or health care, for 

example--are likely to be most effective when funding sources are stable and predictable, 

allowing for longer-term planning.  

Tools exist to help mitigate the effects of the business cycle on state budgets.  

Many states deal with revenue fluctuations by building up reserve--or “rainy day”--funds 

during good economic times.  Measured as a percent of general fund expenditures, the 

aggregate reserve fund balances for all state governments stood at a record of about
