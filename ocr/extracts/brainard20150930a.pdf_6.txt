likely attributable to their ability to benefit from economies of scale in credit-score-based 

lending.   

Business loans with principal amounts between $100,000 and $1 million are 

generally not underwritten solely on the basis of credit scores--probably because lenders 

are not willing to incur the risk associated with larger loan amounts without the benefit of 

a traditional underwriting approach.  For these larger loans--and for smaller loans where 

the borrower does not qualify based on credit score alone--community banks are often the 

lender of choice.  Their local knowledge and close ties to the communities they serve 

enable community bankers to establish a deep understanding of local businesses that 

allows them to prudently provide credit to borrowers who might not otherwise be 

considered creditworthy.  A number of empirical studies confirm that relationships are 

important factors influencing both the availability and the terms of loans to small 

businesses.7   

Similarly, when we slice the Call Report data to separate commercial and 

industrial (C&I) loans from commercial real estate loans, we see that while community 

banks’ share of outstanding small C&I loans dwindled from about 54 percent in 2005 to 

40 percent in 2015, their share of small commercial real estate loans has remained 

relatively stable, moving marginally from 66 percent to 63 percent.  Community bankers’ 

intimate knowledge of their communities and their familiarity with local economic 

conditions provide an advantage relative to large, geographically dispersed banks in 

underwriting commercial real estate loans.
