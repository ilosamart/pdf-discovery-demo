effect on credit markets, especially if combined with other supervisory actions, and a tightening 

at the beginning of a recession could cause it to be deeper or longer than might otherwise be the 

case. 

Marsh and Norman highlight the need to avoid requiring excessive standardization of 

bank loans.  Such standardization could interfere with effective relationship lending, and as 

we’ve seen from the research I’ve already discussed, that relationship lending is a key aspect that 

makes community banks such valuable assets to small businesses and so important to a thriving 

economy.  The Marsh and Norman paper stresses that, to the extent the laws allow, we should 

reduce compliance costs for community banks, such as by simplifying capital rules for smaller 

banks and relying on market incentives, when feasible.  The Moore and Seamans results from 

their failure-prediction model contribute to this discussion by demonstrating that simple capital 

ratios do a good job of identifying those community banks with the greatest probability of 

failure, so that regulators need not unduly impede the actions of the great majority of community 

banks that are highly unlikely to fail.  Meanwhile, the Rosenblum and Organ paper argues for an 

alternative approach to addressing “too big to fail” that the authors suggest would benefit 

community banks by creating a more level playing field.  

Although both the traditional bank regulatory agencies and the Consumer Financial 

Protection Bureau (CFPB) are constrained, to some extent, by the language in the Dodd-Frank 

Act, all regulators should aim to ensure that we are not unduly rigid in our actions.  Indeed, some 

steps have already been taken with that goal in mind. For example, the federal banking agencies 

carefully considered the thousands of comments received from community bankers regarding 

three notices of proposed rulemaking for revisions to the capital framework.  In response to these 

comments, the agencies reduced and simplified many of the proposed changes to the risk-based
