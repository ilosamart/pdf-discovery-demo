Neighborhood stabilization is not just sound economic policy, it is rooted in a vision of our 

shared future, our sense of community.   

Conclusion  

In conclusion, I want to thank you for being here and especially for your work to promote 

neighborhood stabilization.  The program today is certainly not the end of this project.   I am 

pleased to say that, as a follow-up to this summit, the Federal Reserve and NeighborWorks will 

be working together to provide technical workshops for communities as they implement some of 

the strategies identified here.  As of now, we have scheduled workshops in Providence, Rhode 

Island and Cleveland, Ohio this fall and plans are underway to schedule similar workshops on 

the West Coast.  I look forward to your participation and feedback today and to new partnerships 

going forward as we continue to identify ways to streamline the process of repurposing REO and 

to address the community development needs of neighborhoods that have been harmed by 

foreclosures.
