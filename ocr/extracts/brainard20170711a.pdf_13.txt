Appendix:  Description of Stylized Model and Simulation Results 
 
 

A.  Model Description 

The model is a stylized open economy model that includes two symmetric 

countries linked through trade flows.  The model is specified in real terms under the 

implicit assumption that inflation is constant (so that real and nominal variables move by 

the same amount).  Moreover, the model abstracts from any financial linkages between 

the two economies, including the possibility that monetary policy actions in one country 

could directly affect yields in the other (e.g., through portfolio balance channels), though 

such effects are clearly important empirically.    

The two countries include a “Home” (H) county and a “Foreign” (F) country of 

equal size.  Variables in the foreign country are denoted with an asterisk.  In each 

country, the national accounting identity specifies that output, y, is equal to the sum of 

absorption d and net exports nx, that is: 

,

where the second equation incorporates the global resource constraint that nx + nx* = 0.  

Here output (y) and absorption (d) are expressed in percent deviation from their 

respective steady states, while net exports are expressed as share of output, and are equal 

to zero in the steady state (that is, prior to any shocks).
