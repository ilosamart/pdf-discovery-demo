“macroprudential” approach that fosters systemic stability as well as the stability of 

individual institutions.  We also more extensively monitor the financial system as a whole 

and, in cooperation with other agencies, have put in place stronger oversight of 

systemically important financial firms, including higher capital and liquidity 

requirements, tougher supervision, and a process for the orderly resolution of failed 

firms. 

We have also had to be innovative in finding ways to use monetary policy to help

adequate monetary accommodation has not been a straightforward task because our 

principal monetary policy tool, the target for the federal funds rate, has been stuck near 

zero since the end of 2008.  Consequently, we’ve had to find other ways to bring 

monetary policy to bear, notably including techniques designed to influence longer-term 

interest rates.  For instance, the Fed, like several other central banks, has purchased 

longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, help ease 

financial conditions, and promote a stronger recovery. 

A significant aspect of finding innovative ways to execute our duties as a central

communication and transparency.  Part of that effort has involved formally defining our 

goals under the mandate for maximum employment and price stability given to us by the 

Congress.  Two years ago, we established 2 percent as our inflation goal, and we 

regularly communicate policymakers’ views of the level of unemployment expected to 

correspond to maximum sustainable employment over time.  Additionally, our monetary
