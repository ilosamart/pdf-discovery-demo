lending to American businesses and households.  Moreover, as yields on credit products 

rise and yields on cash-like instruments decline, lending would become increasingly 

profitable and would likely move outside the regulated sector, probably leading to a need 

to widen the regulatory perimeter of the financial system. 

Lending to Insured Depository Institutions 

Although attention following the passage of Dodd-Frank Act has focused on the 

limitations it places on lender-of-last-resort lending, it must be noted that, if necessary 

and appropriate, the Federal Reserve has the authority to act as lender of last resort in 

several ways.  Most importantly, the Fed retains the power to extend discount window 

loans to insured depository institutions--including commercial banks, thrift institutions, 

credit unions, or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Such loans can be to 

individual institutions facing funding pressures, or they can be to banks more generally to 

address broader financial stresses.2   

Since the Great Depression, the Fed’s actions as lender of last resort were 

undertaken using its authority to provide discount window funding to insured depository 

institutions.  Such was the case in the Federal Reserve’s reaction to the Penn Central 

default of 1970, the stock market crash of 1987, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the initial 

stages of the recent financial crisis in August 2007.  Discount window loans have to be 

collateralized to the satisfaction of the lending Reserve Bank, and it is noteworthy that all 

of the Federal Reserve System’s lending during the Great Financial Crisis was 

collateralized and that all the loans have been repaid in full, on time, and with interest.   

                                                 
2 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) imposes costs and a 
reporting requirement on the Federal Reserve Board in some cases if Federal Reserve lending to a weak 
depository institution that ultimately fails raises the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s costs of 
resolving the institution.
