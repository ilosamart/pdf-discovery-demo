Consider first a regime in which there is no LOLR and, thus, financial intermediaries are 

left to self-insure against liquidity risk.  Absent regulation, in normal times firms might choose to 

“underhoard” liquidity, to use Jean Tirole’s term.4  As Tirole explains, firms may be incentivized 

to sacrifice some insurance in order to buy more illiquid (and presumably higher-yielding) 

investments.  This choice raises the prospect of huge negative externalities, since each firm may 

hold a smaller buffer than is socially optimal.  Were a liquidity stress to arise, particularly one 

following an asset price shock that broadly affected financial intermediaries, the result could be 

the kind of freezing up of financial system gears that took place a few years ago, with 

consequences for the broader economy that went well beyond the effects on specific markets or 

institutions. 

Assume, then, that regulation is put in place to force intermediaries to internalize all the 

liquidity costs of even the most severe, low-probability systemic events.  Firms would have to 

demonstrate that they either maintained more or less matched durations of their assets and 

liabilities in the steady state or, what in some circumstances could amount to much the same 

thing, have liquidity buffers sufficient to meet all liquidity demands even during a systemic event 

following a major shock to asset values.  Such an approach would entail two major costs.  First, 

such a requirement would significantly constrain the level of liquidity and maturity 

transformation in normal times, surely resulting in significant constraints on credit extension, 

with consequent negative effects on economic growth.  A primary economic function of banks 

and other financial intermediaries is facilitating liquidity management throughout the economy.  

4 Jean Tirole (2011), “Illiquidity and All Its Friends,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 49(2), pp. 287–325, at p. 
295.  Tirole introduces the term in a general discussion of firm incentives, not in the context of LOLR (which he 
addresses later).  But the incentives would seem even stronger where LOLR is available.
