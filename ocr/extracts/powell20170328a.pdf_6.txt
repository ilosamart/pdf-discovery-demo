financial system strained in such a manner is like dry kindling in danger of being exposed 

to a spark.  That spark could come from losses at a well-known bank, from a 

disappointing harvest, or from mere rumors.  In response, depositors or other investors 

would seek the return of their funds, which would force financial institutions to sell assets 

quickly to generate the necessary cash (figure 6).  That liquidation could lead banks to cut 

credit and force borrowers to repay debt sooner than expected. 

Simply put, the monetary system did not meet the country’s needs.  It was a 

system in crisis, boiling over repeatedly, harming the country. 

Central banks are designed in part to help the financial system meet occasional 

liquidity strains.  When demands for liquidity rise, central banks can respond by 

increasing the supply of money and thus adding liquidity to the system.  Central banks 

have a particularly important role in avoiding or mitigating extreme demands for liquidity 

during financial crises.  They do this by making loans to solvent financial institutions so 

they can meet their liquidity demands and avoid forced sales of their assets.  These ideas 

about central banks’ lending role were developed over the course of the 19th century but 

not yet implemented in the United States, which at the time remained without a central 

bank.8  By the beginning of the 20th century, the United States was behind the game. 

                                                 
relative to the rest of the world.  As a result, interest rates on American commercial paper (a key rate 
affected by international financial conditions) rose following poor harvests, stock and bond prices fell, and 
deposits flowed out of the New York banking system.  Industrial production decreased as well, with a lag.  
This set of effects created tight financial conditions of the sort that could lead to financial crises.  (See 
Christopher Hanes and Paul W. Rhode (2013), “Harvests and Financial Crises in Gold Standard America,” 
Journal of Economic History, vol. 73 (March), pp. 201-46.)  Other scholars focus on business cycle 
downturns as creating conditions favorable to financial crises, as depositors viewed the downturns as 
affecting the solvency prospects of their banks, leading to withdrawals and panics.  (See Gary Gorton 
(1988), “Banking Panics and Business Cycles,” Oxford Economic Papers, vol. 40 (December), pp. 751-81.)
