benefit of hindsight, that emphasis probably derived from three sources:  First, the 

quantity theory of money emphasized the link between the quantity of money and 

inflation; second, that research was carried out when monetarism was gaining credibility 

in the profession; and, third, there was a concern that interest rate rules might lead to 

price-level indeterminacy--an issue disposed of by Bennett McCallum and others.4   

Subsequently, John Taylor’s research, especially his celebrated 1993 paper, was a 

catalyst in changing the focus toward rules for the short-term interest rate.5  Taylor’s 

work thus helped shift the terms of the discussion in favor of rules for the instrument that 

central banks prefer to use.  His 1993 study also highlighted the practical relevance of 

monetary policy rules, as he showed that a particular simple rule--the rule that now bears 

his name--provided a good approximation to the behavior of the federal funds rate during 

the early Greenspan years.  The research literature on monetary policy rules has 

experienced a major revival since Taylor’s seminal paper and has concentrated on rules 

for the short-term interest rate. 

                                                 
literature on monetary policy:  Examples include Currie and Levine (1987) and Flemming (1993).  In 
addition, an interest rate was the policy instrument in some key contributions to open-economy monetary 
theory, such as Meade (1951) and Mundell (1960).  These traditions likely reflected the long-standing use 
of Bank Rate as a policy instrument in the United Kingdom and the fact that, for most of the period from 
the Treasury/Federal Reserve Accord of 1951 until the 1990s, central banks in countries other than the 
United States tended to be more explicit than the Federal Reserve chose to be about their use of short-term 
interest rates as their primary policy instrument.  Even in the U.S. context, however, there was a certain 
amount of research on interest rate policies.  For example, it was common practice among builders of large 
econometric models to consider different Federal Reserve interest rate strategies (see Ando, 1981).  In 
addition, the empirical and simulation properties of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate reaction function 
were the concern of such studies as Dewald and Johnson (1963), DeRosa and Stern (1977), Dornbusch and 
Fischer (1979), and Henderson and McKibbin (1993), while Sargent and Wallace (1975) and McCallum 
(1981) examined the analytical properties of interest rate rules.  A later magisterial study of the analytics of 
interest rate rules was Woodford (2003). 
4 See McCallum (1981).  I should add that when we presented work based on Cooper and Fischer (1972), 
we were urged by several economists to focus on the interest rate as the monetary policy instrument.  
Among these economists were Albert Ando and Franco Modigliani, who were then working with others on 
building the MPS (MIT-Pennsylvania-Social Science Research Council) model.
