In the aftermath of the financial crisis, ongoing increases in capital buffers, reductions in 

funding vulnerabilities, improvements in risk management, and attention to orderly resolution 

are producing a substantially more resilient financial system.  Yet even as the financial position 

of firms has been strengthened, headlines describing misconduct in financial firms have appeared 

with disturbing regularity.  For a time, these stories were the legacy of pre-crisis errors and 

misdeeds, with a focus on the mortgages and mortgage-related products that lay at the heart of 

the crisis.  But soon they were accompanied by allegations of post-crisis actions: rigging of 

LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) and foreign exchange rates, facilitation of tax evasion, 

inadequate controls on money laundering, and front running through dark pools, among others. 

A pattern of antitrust, market regulatory, and consumer protection problems would of 

course be troubling in any firm or industry.  From a prudential regulatory perspective, such a 

pattern in financial institutions creates additional concerns, particularly as it poses a threat to 

continued progress toward a safer and more stable financial system.  It is noteworthy that 

supervisory assessments of risks to the earnings and balance sheets of major financial institutions 

have, like those of many private analysts, placed increasing emphasis on exposure to public fines 

and private litigation losses.  And senior management is surely diverted from the challenges of 

fashioning sound business strategies when major legal problems arise. 

Behind much of this malfeasance lies something other than the excessive credit and 

market risk that led to the crisis itself, although there may be some common roots of these 

problems.  The hypothesis that this is all the result of “a few bad apples,” an explanation I heard 

with exasperating frequency a year or two ago, has I think given way to a realization within 

many large financial firms that they have not taken steps sufficient to ensure that the activities of 

their employees remain within the law and, more broadly, accord with the values of probity,
