compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial sector that September 

and led to a plunge in economic activity in the following months.  Not long after Fannie 

and Freddie were placed in government conservatorship, Lehman Brothers collapsed, 

setting off a week in which American International Group, Inc. (AIG), came to the brink 

of failure and required large loans from the Federal Reserve to mitigate the systemic 

fallout; a large money market fund “broke the buck” (that is, was unable to maintain a net 

asset value of $1 per share) and runs on other money funds accelerated, requiring the 

Treasury to provide a guarantee of money fund liabilities; global dollar funding markets 

nearly collapsed, necessitating coordinated action by central banks around the world; the 

two remaining large investment banks became bank holding companies, thereby ending 

the era of large independent investment banks in the United States; and the Treasury 

proposed a rescue of the financial sector.  Within several weeks, the Congress passed--

and President Bush signed into law--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, 

which established the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Federal Reserve 

initiated further emergency lending programs; and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) guaranteed a broad range of bank debt.7  Facing similar challenges in 

their own jurisdictions, many foreign governments also undertook aggressive measures to 

support the functioning of credit markets, including large-scale capital injections into 

banks, expansions of deposit insurance programs, and guarantees of some forms of bank 

debt.  

                                                 
7 In the fall of 2008, the three largest investment banks were (in alphabetical order) Goldman Sachs, Merrill 

Lynch, and Morgan Stanley.  Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by Bank of America, and the remaining 

two firms became bank holding companies.
