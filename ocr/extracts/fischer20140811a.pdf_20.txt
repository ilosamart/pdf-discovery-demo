affecting the global economy, and in thinking about how to return to higher output and 

productivity growth, policymakers are focusing on the uses of monetary policy in 

attaining the dual goals of maximum employment and stable prices and in maintaining 

financial stability.  They need also to strengthen financial sector regulation and 

supervision to reduce the probability of another crisis.   

At the same time, and although I earlier foreswore discussion of fiscal policy, it is 

clear that fiscal policies can be used both to increase growth and to deal with potential 

problems of financial stability. 

I look forward to hearing your views on the best way to move ahead on these and 

the other important issues we have gathered to discuss.   

Thank you.
