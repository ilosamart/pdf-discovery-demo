of the Financial Diaries, argue that access to steady, predictable cash flows is an 

important source of financial inequality.23   

Expenses can be just as unpredictable as income, and financial fragility results 

from the mismatch between the two.  The Pew Charitable Trusts showed that 60 percent 

of households self-reported that over the prior 12 months, they had experienced at least 

one financial shock, like a job change, divorce, major illness, or breakdown of a car or 

major household appliance.24  The median household spent half-a-month’s income on the 

most expensive shock (the median expense being $2,000).  Further complicating things, 

expense shocks rarely occur on their own, but instead can cascade into additional 

expenses and stress for families on the margins.  Pew showed that a third of households 

they studied self-reported two or more different financial shocks over the course of a 

year.25  Morduch and Schneider found that 65 percent of spending spikes involved 

increases in two categories of expenses, such as transportation and health care.  In more 

than half of the spending spikes they studied, spending was well above average in three 

categories.26  Moreover, the spikes in expenses tended not to coincide with corresponding 

spikes in income.
