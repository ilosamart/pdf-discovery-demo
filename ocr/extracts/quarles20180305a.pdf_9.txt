process we will take account of our own experience with the regulations since implementation, 

and we also want to take account of the views of market participants and other interested parties 

with views on the Volcker rule, including what is working and what is not.  We expect this 

process will proceed with dispatch. 

 We must also work within the confines of the statute.  For example, a number of my 

current and former Federal Reserve Board colleagues have expressed support for Congress 

providing an exemption from the Volcker rule for community banks, which is something I also 

support. 5  Short of a statutory exemption, we can only do our best to mitigate burden on 

community banks that generally do not engage in the types of activities the Volcker rule was 

intended to cover.6  Statutory changes likely would make our work of streamlining more 

straightforward and complete, but we have a fair bit that we can accomplish even absent such 

changes.  

 What are some of the improvements that we are thinking about that would be possible 

within the regulation itself?  As an initial matter, it should be clearer and more transparent what 

is subject to the Volcker rule’s implementing regulation and what is not.  The definition of key 

terms like “proprietary trading” and “covered fund” should be as simple and clear as possible.  It

Community Bankers Conference, New York, NY, May 14, 2015),

significant burdens from complying with these requirements, so I support raising the asset threshold for both the 
Volcker rule and incentive compensation rules, perhaps to $10 billion. In the event where the actions of a 
community bank might raise concerns in either of these areas, that could be addressed through our normal 
examination process.”); see also Daniel K. Tarullo, “Departing Thoughts,” (speech at The Woodrow Wilson School, 
Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, April 4, 2017),

the Volcker rule applies to a much broader group of banks than is necessary to achieve its purpose. As I have said 
before, the concerns underlying the Volcker rule are simply not an issue at community banks.”)
