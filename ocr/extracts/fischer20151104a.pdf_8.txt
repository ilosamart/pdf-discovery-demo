hearings on the report and related matters.  Accountability can be further enhanced by 

increasing the transparency of central banks about their operations.   

Accountability of the central bank helps deal with the potential conflict between 

the benefits of shielding the central bank from political pressures and the fact that 

unelected officials--albeit officials who are commonly nominated by the government and, 

in many cases, confirmed by the legislative branch--are determining policies critical to 

the country’s economy.   

Fourth, there is an argument in the profession about the difficulties of presenting a 

central bank with more than one policy goal.  The argument is often put as “You need as 

many instruments of policy as you have policy goals,” a result often attributed to Jan 

Tinbergen, co-winner of the first Nobel Prize in economics.9  Tinbergen’s result is correct 

if the targets have to be achieved exactly, but it is not correct if there are tradeoffs among 

the goals of policy, and the central bank utility or loss function includes the costs of 

missing each of the targets and the interactions among them.10   

Based on the Tinbergen result, central banks whose mandated goals are narrow, 

such as having only an inflation target, are often considered to have more independence 

than central banks with additional targets or with multifaceted objectives.  In practice, I 

doubt that any central bank targets inflation to the exclusion of all other outcomes.  For 

example, the Bundesbank was generally thought to have a very strict focus on inflation in 

the years in which it had an independent monetary policy before the founding of the 

European Central Bank.  But researchers who have studied the Bundesbank’s policies of
