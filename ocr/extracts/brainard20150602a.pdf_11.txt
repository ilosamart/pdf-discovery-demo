With the labor market evidencing additional slack not well captured by the 

standard unemployment rate and with inflation remaining soft, there may be additional 

room to support further healing in the labor market, which is appropriate following the 

deep damage from the Great Recession.   

Given the softness in the data we have seen so far this year and some uncertainty

in the face of the headwinds from abroad.  If continued labor market strengthening is 

confirmed and inflation readings continue to improve, liftoff could come before the end 

of the year. 

It is important to underscore, however, that the date of liftoff is only one in an 

ongoing series of decisions the FOMC will be making in response to incoming data.  Just 

as no previous recovery has proceeded as this one has, so, too, there is no reason to 

expect monetary policy to follow previous tightening cycles.  Given the unique 

conditions in the labor market and the economy more broadly, I will want to move step 

by step--observing how the markets and the economy respond before gauging the 

appropriate next step in the policy path. 

The divergence in conditions here and abroad also injects an element of

appreciation is generally transmitted into somewhat tighter financial conditions, the 

advent of quantitative easing in Europe appeared to have led to some compression in term

longer-dated yields have recently moved somewhat higher, it is nonetheless difficult to
