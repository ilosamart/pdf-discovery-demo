productivity could continue to rise in line with its long-term historical average.10  After 

all, as the experience of the 1990s shows, productivity cycles are extremely difficult to 

predict and, even considering the slowdown of the past decade, U.S. total factor 

productivity growth fluctuated around 1-1/2 percent in the postwar period. In addition, 

the recent weakness could reflect Reinhart-Rogoff cyclical factors associated with the 

financial crisis, and pent up improvements could be revealed once confidence returns.11  

Finally, fears about the end of productivity gains are based on evidence from the United 

States and other advanced economies.  Globally, however, there is tremendous scope for 

productivity gains reflecting technological catch up, infrastructure investment, and the 

potential for human capital increases due to improvements in education and nutrition, and 

the incorporation and inclusion of women into the labor force.  These gains should 

benefit not just the emerging market economies but also the rest of world more generally, 

including the United States.   

At the end of the day, it remains difficult to disentangle the cyclical from the 

structural slowdowns in labor force, investment, and productivity.  Adding to this
