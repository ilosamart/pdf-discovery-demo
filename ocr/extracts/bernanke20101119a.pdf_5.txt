Monetary Policy in the United States 

  With inflation expectations stable, and with levels of resource slack expected to 

remain high, inflation trends are expected to be quite subdued for some time. 

Because the genesis of the financial crisis was in the United States and other 

advanced economies, the much weaker recovery in those economies compared with that 

in the emerging markets may not be entirely unexpected (although, given their traditional 

vulnerability to crises, the resilience of the emerging market economies over the past few 

years is both notable and encouraging).  What is clear is that the different cyclical 

positions of the advanced and emerging market economies call for different policy 

settings.  Although the details of the outlook vary among jurisdictions, most advanced 

economies still need accommodative policies to continue to lay the groundwork for a 

strong, durable recovery.  Insufficiently supportive policies in the advanced economies 

could undermine the recovery not only in those economies, but for the world as a whole.  

In contrast, emerging market economies increasingly face the challenge of maintaining 

robust growth while avoiding overheating, which may in some cases involve the 

measured withdrawal of policy stimulus. 

Let me address the case of the United States specifically.  As I described, the U.S. 

unemployment rate is high and, given the slow pace of economic growth, likely to remain 

so for some time.  Indeed, although I expect that growth will pick up and unemployment 

will decline somewhat next year, we cannot rule out the possibility that unemployment 

might rise further in the near term, creating added risks for the recovery.  Inflation has 

                                                           
1 Figure 5 shows core and trimmed-mean measures to better display the decline in underlying, or trend, 
inflation.  Total inflation measures have been volatile in recent years but are currently a bit above 1 percent 
on a 12-month basis.  Projections by FOMC participants have indicated that, under appropriate monetary 
policies, inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures should converge 
to 2 percent or a bit less in the long run.
