Features of the Enhanced Capital Requirement 

While Dodd-Frank mandates an enhanced capital requirement for SIFIs, it does not 

specify the form of that requirement.  I would suggest five desirable characteristics. 

First, in keeping with the macroprudential aims of SIFI regulation, an additional capital 

requirement should be calculated using a metric based upon the impact of a firm’s failure on the 

financial system as a whole.  Size is only one factor to be considered.  Of greater importance are 

measures more directly related to the interconnectedness of the firm with the rest of the financial 

system.  Several academic papers try to develop this concept based on inferences about 

interconnectedness from market price data, using quite elaborate statistical models.iii  Others 

have proposed using more readily observed factors such as intra-financial firm assets and 

liabilities, cross-border activity, and the use of various complex financial instruments.  

Second, the metric should be transparent and replicable.  In establishing the metric, there 

will be a trade-off between simplicity and nuance.  For example, using a greater number of 

factors could capture more elements of systemic linkages, but any formula combining many 

factors using a fixed weighting scheme might create unintended incentive effects.  On the other 

hand, using a small number of factors that measure financial linkages more broadly might reduce 

opportunities for unintended incentive effects, but at the cost of some sensitivity to systemic 

attributes of firms.  Whatever the set of factors ultimately chosen, the metric must be clear to 

financial firms, markets, and the public. 

Third, the enhanced capital standards should be progressive in nature.  Dodd-Frank itself 

mandates that they “increase in stringency” with the systemic footprint of the firm, though the 

statute gives the Federal Reserve Board discretion in deciding how to realize this goal.  There are 

good reasons for this requirement.  Systemic importance is not a binary determination, but one of
