The financial crisis and its aftermath prompted an almost immediate call for 

change in financial regulation.  Beyond the basic reaction that prudential regulation 

needed to be stronger and less subject to arbitrage, considerable support grew for the 

formerly minority view that regulation also needed to be firmly grounded in a 

macroprudential perspective explicitly directed at the stability of the financial system as a 

whole, not just at each regulated firm individually.  The crisis also prompted increased 

attention to the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability.  Here the 

lines of debate seem more sharply drawn than in the area of financial regulation.  While 

few today would take the pre-crisis view common among central bankers that financial 

stability should not be an explicit concern of monetary policy, there is considerable 

disagreement over--among other things--the weight that financial stability concerns 

should carry compared with traditional monetary policy goals of price stability and 

maximum employment. 

This morning I will offer some comments on this ongoing debate.  In part, these 

remarks will give my perspective on some of the familiar points of contention, such as 

the relative priority and role of nonmonetary, compared with monetary, policy 

instruments in responding to risks to financial stability.  I also want to suggest that the 

cumulative effect over the past few decades of changes in financial technology, financial 

regulation, monetary policy itself, and perhaps the real economy have significantly 

altered the ways in which monetary instruments transmit through to the real economy.  

These changes may argue for refinement of monetary policy tools.  They may also 

indicate the need for regulatory measures that are neither time varying nor limited to
