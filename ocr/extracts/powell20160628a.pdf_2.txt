Thank you for this opportunity to speak here today.  The Chicago Council on 

Global Affairs has been a thought leader for nearly a century, encouraging public 

discourse, education, and research on important global issues.  The Council’s global 

focus is particularly important for understanding the challenges facing the U.S. economy 

today, as shown by last week’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the 

European Union.  In my remarks, I will review recent economic developments and the 

outlook for the economy.  I will also discuss the economy’s longer-term productive 

potential.  As always, the view I express here today are my own.  

The Dual Mandate and State of the Economy 

As you know, the Federal Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC), is charged by the Congress with achieving maximum employment and stable 

prices--the dual mandate.  For price stability, the FOMC has adopted a goal of 2 percent 

for inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures.  Many other central banks in developed economies have 

adopted inflation goals centered around 2 percent.   

The FOMC has not set a numerical goal for maximum employment, because the 

long-run sustainable level of employment is determined mainly by non-monetary factors 

that are outside the Fed’s control, such as demographics, social change, and fiscal and 

regulatory policies.  Nonetheless, four times a year, FOMC participants write down their 

estimates of the longer-run sustainable level of the unemployment rate (which many 

interpret as the “natural rate”); at the recent June FOMC meeting the median estimate of 

that rate was 4.8 percent.
