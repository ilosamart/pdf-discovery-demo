the interest rate means that monetary policy has less room to reduce the interest rate when 

that becomes necessary.  Also, low equilibrium rates could threaten financial stability by 

encouraging a reach for yield and compressing net interest margins, although it is 

important to point out that so far we have not seen evidence that low rates have notably 

increased financial vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system.  More fundamentally, low 

equilibrium real rates could signal that the economy’s long-run growth prospects are dim.   

Why are interest rates so low?2  In a speech last month, I identified a number of 

factors that have worked to boost saving, depress investment, or both.  Among the factors 

holding down interest rates is the sluggishness of foreign economic growth.  Another is 

demographics, with saving being higher as a result of an increase in the average age of 

the U.S. population.  Also, investment recently has been weaker than might otherwise be 

expected, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about longer-run growth prospects, as well as the 

decline in investment in the energy sector as a result of the fall in the price of oil.  

Finally, and most important, weak productivity growth has likely pushed down interest 

rates both by lowering investment, as firms lower their expectations for the marginal 

return on investment, and by increasing saving, as consumers lower their expectations for 

income growth and borrow less and/or save more as a consequence.  

Understanding the recent weakness of productivity growth is central to addressing 

the longer-run challenges confronting the economy.  Productivity growth over the past 

decade has been lackluster by post-World War II standards.  Output per hour increased 

only 1-1/4 percent per year, on average, from 2006 to 2015, compared with its long-run
