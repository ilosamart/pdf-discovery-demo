Thank you for inviting me to speak to you this afternoon.

 I’m honored to have the 

chance to be with so many former colleagues and friends. As I look around this room, 

I’m reminded of your efforts and the variety of perspectives that you have brought, over 

the years, to the endeavor of financial regulation. I’m reminded of the contributions you 

have made to the richness of these debates and tasks.  

There has been a flurry of pronouncements lately regarding regulations, rules, and 

guidance, and today’s meeting of the Exchequer Club seems like an opportune moment to 

pause and offer a perspective that lifts us above the many details.

 Newly adopted capital 

rules, and those newly proposed, in particular, have received the most attention, and I 

believe that these rules and proposed rules are a big step forward. There is no question 

but that a higher quantity and quality of bank capital will strengthen the banking system.  

Today, I want to discuss regulatory policies in the context of the growth and 

inevitable collapse of asset bubbles, with a focus on the role of credit. Regulatory 

policies, when well crafted, can lean against credit excesses that result in asset bubbles. 

In so doing, they can lean against vulnerabilities in the financial system that encourage 

the growth of excess credit. Well-crafted regulatory policies can also build resilience for 

banks after asset bubbles have burst. Many such regulatory policies are already in use, 

but there are others at the frontiers of regulation that haven’t been widely employed. 

Significantly, both sets of regulatory policies--those that lean against excesses and those 

that build resilience--need to be understood in the context of a comprehensive system of 

prudential supervision for all financial institutions.
