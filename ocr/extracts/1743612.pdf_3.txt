“There is stiJLl much to be done before the Conference 
will have achieved its ultimate purpose, fte need the help 
of ever/ member of the United £t<-tes delegation in carrying 
the program of the Conference to a successful conclusion.11

For these reasons it seems to ine that the ¿tô rd has accepted a 
responsibility as the Governmental agency at the head of the Federal Re­
serve System for cooperating in the further development of this program and 
while the exchange of views and information among the Banks and the board 
should continue so tnat they may be fully advised, the public expression 
of an adverse attitude, if any, on the p^rt of any of the Federal Reserve 
Banks would be likely to impair the usefulness of the System in its rela­
tions to the problems grovsing out of the conference.
