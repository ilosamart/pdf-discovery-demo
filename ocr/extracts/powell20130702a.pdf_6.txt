firm.  To do so, the resolution authority would first use available parent company assets 

to recapitalize the firm’s critical operating subsidiaries, and then would convert liabilities 

of the parent company into equity of a surviving entity.  This approach would have the 

effect of concentrating the firm-wide losses on the parent company’s private sector equity 

holders and creditors.   The SPOE approach places a high priority on what your own 

President Weidmann recently described as “the principle of liability,” meaning that those 

who benefit should also bear the costs.   

Perhaps the greatest challenge for the resolution of a systemic global bank is the 

possibility that public or private actors in different countries might take local actions that 

would cause the overall resolution to spin out of control.  Creditors and counterparties of 

solvent operating subsidiaries might rush for the exit if they are unsure of their status.  As 

a subsidiary comes under increasing stress, authorities might preemptively ring-fence 

local assets.  The process of resolution will need to be fully worked out and understood 

beforehand by market participants, regulatory authorities, and the general public.  It will 

be absolutely essential to build trust among all parties, and especially between regulatory 

authorities.   

Much remains to be done in eliminating “too-big-to-fail.”  The Federal Reserve is 

considering a requirement that systemic institutions maintain sufficient long-term debt at 

the parent company level to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries in the 

event of failure.  We expect to propose such a requirement later this year.  I share the 

view expressed recently by several of my Board colleagues that the work of large bank 

resolution is not complete, and that further measures may be necessary.  No one should 

doubt that the Federal Reserve is committed to completing this project.
