It is a pleasure to speak here this evening at the 87th Awards Dinner.  Tonight I 

will start with the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy.  Then I will turn to a topic 

that is inspired by the Citizens Budget Commission’s mission statement, which focuses 

on the “well-being of future New Yorkers.”  I imagine that future New Yorkers attending 

this dinner in 50 years may not look back on the near-term outlook in February 2018 as 

very interesting or important.  So, tonight, after a brief review of the here and now, I will 

focus on an issue that is likely to be of more lasting importance:  the need for policies that 

will support and encourage participation in the labor force, promote longer-term growth 

in our rapidly evolving economy, and spread the benefits of prosperity as widely as 

possible.   

The State of the Economy and Near-Term Prospects 

Beginning with the here and now, Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with 

achieving maximum employment and stable prices, two objectives that together are 

called the dual mandate.  I am pleased to say that, judged against these goals, the 

economy is in a good place.  The current economic expansion has been under way for 

almost 10 years.  This long period of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down 

near historic lows (figure 1).  The employment gains have been broad based across all 

racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the 

disabled (figure 2).1  And while the unemployment rate for African Americans and 

Hispanics remains above the rates for whites and Asians, the disparities have narrowed 

appreciably as the economic expansion has continued.  

                                                 
1 The unemployment rate of those with a disability and between the ages of 16 and 64 fell from more than 
16 percent in 2011 to less than 9 percent in 2018.  Meanwhile, their labor force participation rate has been 
rising over the past few years.  In 2018, about 8 percent of the population aged 16 to 64 reported 
themselves as having a disability, and their labor force participation rate was 33 percent.
