stating an explicit target for inflation alone would undermine the maximum-employment 

side of the dual mandate.  In fact, some central banks that have been assigned a single 

mandate of inflation stabilization have struggled to explain how the goals of growth and 

financial stability figure into their inflation-targeting framework.11 

A Consensus on Monetary Policy Goals 

Last January, the FOMC took a major step to clarify its interpretation of its dual 

mandate, issuing the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” 

that I mentioned earlier.  Unlike the regular postmeeting statements, which are intended 

to remain current only until the next FOMC meeting, this statement is meant to be a more 

enduring expression of the FOMC’s policy objectives and how it plans to pursue them.  

The intention is that the public can count on the principles expressed in the statement to 

remain unchanged for some time to come, even as the economic outlook changes.  For 

that reason, the Committee sought the endorsement of all its participants--the Board 

members and all 12 Reserve Bank presidents--not only the voting members.  My 

expectation is that this “consensus statement” will be reaffirmed each January, perhaps 

with minor modifications but with the core principles intact.  

Importantly, the consensus statement provides a numerical value--2 percent--for 

the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal.  But importantly, it pairs that inflation goal 

with a specific goal for maximum employment.  In particular, the statement cites a range 

summarizing FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of 

unemployment.  Finally, the statement says that the Committee will follow a “balanced
