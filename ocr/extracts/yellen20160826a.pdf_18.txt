Beyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role 

in dealing with severe economic downturns.  A wide range of possible fiscal policy tools 

and approaches could enhance the cyclical stability of the economy.25  For example, steps 

could be taken to increase the effectiveness of the automatic stabilizers, and some 

economists have proposed that greater fiscal support could be usefully provided to state 

and local governments during recessions.  As always, it would be important to ensure that 

any fiscal policy changes did not compromise long-run fiscal sustainability.     

Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise 

productivity growth.  Stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level 

of interest rates and therefore would provide the Federal Reserve with greater scope to 

ease monetary policy in the event of a recession.  But more importantly, stronger 

productivity growth would enhance Americans’ living standards.  Though outside the 

narrow field of monetary policy, many possibilities in this arena are worth considering, 

including improving our educational system and investing more in worker training; 

promoting capital investment and research spending, both private and public; and looking 

for ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic, financial, 

and social goals.
