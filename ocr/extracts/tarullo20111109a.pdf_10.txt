that additional capital requirements could help offset any funding advantage derived from the 

perceived status of such institutions as too-big-to-fail. 

The surcharge attempts to reduce the chances of a global systemically important bank’s 

(G-SIB’s) failure so as to bring the expected impact of the failure of such a firm--that is, the 

expected damage to the system upon its failure discounted by the possibility that it will, in fact, 

fail--more in line with that of other sizeable firms.  Moreover, the metrics for determining G-SIB 

status are heavily weighted toward the kind of interconnectedness features that pose 

macroprudential risks.  The framework includes a range of surcharges in the 1.0–2.5 percent 

range for what will likely be a global group of about 30 banks, to be phased in as an expansion of 

the Basel III capital conservation buffer from 2016 to 2019.   

For illustrative purposes, the Basel Committee used 2009 data to generate a list of banks 

that were of global systemic importance and, based on the criteria developed from that data, a 

hypothetical set of “buckets” associated with the different surcharge rates.  It is important to 

note, however, that this list, which was published last week, will not be used to determine any 

bank’s surcharge.  The list of banks to be covered and the surcharge buckets into which they will 

be placed when the surcharge begins to take effect in 2016 will be based upon data collected in 

2014.  This is as it should be, since the inclusion and ordering of the firms should be based upon 

the characteristics of the banks as they have evolved closer to the effective date.  Some banks 

have changed their profiles materially in the past couple of years, and the prospect of capital 

surcharges may be an incentive for others to do so as well.  In this regard, I should also note that 

the bucket allocation of each G-SIB will be recomputed in each year after 2016.  

The use of more up-to-date data means that banks will not know for some time exactly 

which buckets they will occupy when the surcharge first phases in.  However, the potential
