ratios should provide a rough baseline benchmark for ensuring that sufficient capital is held 

relative to a bank’s risk profile, and the leverage ratio--which has certainly stood the test of time-

-serves as an effective backstop to reduce the risk that a bank would allow its balance sheet to 

become overleveraged. 

Supervisory Assessments of Capital Adequacy 

Indeed, there is another side to appropriate regulation.  And that is supervision and the 

supervisory process.  At least as, if not more important as the regulatory ratios for banks is an 

effective supervisory assessment of capital adequacy.  Regulatory capital ratios certainly provide 

valuable input into a bank’s capital adequacy, but it is important to understand that these ratios 

are rough and imperfect estimates.  As supervisors, we expect banks to hold capital that captures 

the full range of risks associated with the bank’s activities, which, based on a bank’s expertise in 

managing the risks, may very well dictate capital levels that differ from these minimum ratios.   

I’m not talking about anything new here: If you look at the criteria for rating capital 

adequacy under the banking agencies’ CAMELS rating system for banks
7
, and under the Federal 

Reserve’s RFI rating system for bank holding companies, you will actually see very few 

references to minimum regulatory capital.

  Instead, the focus is on maintaining capital that is 

commensurate with the overall risk profile of the bank, not just credit risk.  This requires both 

management and the supervisor to have an effective understanding of the banking organization’s 

risk profile, which is central to our supervisory program.  This supervisory feature sometimes 

gets lost in the public debate about the value of well-constructed regulatory capital ratios, but I

 The interagency CAMELS rating system for banks is described in Supervisory and Regulatory (SR) letter 96-38, 

“Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System.”  The main compoments of the CAMELS rating system are capital 

adequacy (C), asset quality (A), management (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity to market risk (S), as 

well as an overall composite rating.

 The Federal Reserve’s RFI rating system for bank holding companies is set forth in SR letter 04-18, “Bank 

Holding Company Rating System.”  The main components of the RFI rating system are risk management (R), 

financial condition (F), and potential impact (I).
