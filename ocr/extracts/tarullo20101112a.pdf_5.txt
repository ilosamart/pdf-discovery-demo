Reforming Minimum Capital Requirements 

Although they had long used bank capital ratios as a supervisory tool, U.S. bank 

regulators did not impose explicit minimum capital requirements until the 1980s.  The proximate 

reason for this change was regulatory concern over the decline in capital ratios of the largest 

banks--a concern reinforced by Congress, as it saw some of those large banks facing enormous 

losses on their loans to foreign sovereigns.  This U.S. regulatory innovation was effectively 

internationalized a few years later in the original Basel Accord.   

At the same time, regulators came to regard capital requirements as a supple prudential 

tool.  As activity and affiliation restrictions were loosened in the United States, capital 

requirements seemed a promising way to protect the public’s interest in the stability of financial 

institutions that had access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window and Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation insurance.  Capital requirements promised to provide a buffer against 

bank losses from any activities in which the bank or its affiliates might engage, a consideration 

of equal or greater relevance in countries with universal banking models.  Some support also 

developed for the proposition that minimum capital levels could, by maintaining a material 

equity value for the bank, serve as a disincentive for excessive risk-taking by management and 

shareholders.   

In the ensuing quarter century, the attention of banking regulators around the world had 

been heavily oriented toward elaborating capital requirements to reflect more precisely the 

particular risks faced by a financial institution.  Capital requirements had, to a considerable 

extent, become the dominant prudential regulatory tool. 

The financial crisis showed that the concentrated, almost all-consuming regulatory focus 

on refining bank capital requirements in Basel II had come at the expense of attention to other
