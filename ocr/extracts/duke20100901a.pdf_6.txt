written an article that describes how formerly thriving subdivisions outside of larger 

metropolitan areas, once known as “boomburbs,” are now suffering some of the highest rates of 

foreclosure and subsequent REO inventories.  These communities are often so new that they do 

not have the community development infrastructure to address the impact of the large volume of 

REO properties.  While REO properties in these relatively strong markets are more attractive to 

investors, the nature of these communities may change dramatically with little opportunity for 

local government to direct--or even prepare for--those changes.     

To make matters even more challenging, potential REO inventories may be larger than 

the current inventory numbers indicate.  The Brooking Institution’s Alan Mallach provides us 

with an article that focuses on the growing number of properties that are delinquent or in the 

foreclosure process, but have not yet entered the market as REO.  This “shadow inventory” 

threatens to continue the downward pressure on housing prices and further destabilizes 

communities.  On a more positive note, however, Mallach contends that the neighborhood 

impact of REO properties can be mitigated if subsequent owners have a long-term interest.  He 

points out that the community impact of an REO property purchased by an individual homebuyer 

is barely noticeable.  Moreover, purchases by investors that plan to buy and hold the property for 

the long term can have positive outcomes for neighborhoods.  Finally, Mallach asserts that local 

governments are not powerless to limit the destructive impact of speculative investors.  Rather, 

he argues that they can influence investor behavior through the use of regulatory tools, such as 

licensing and inspections, to promote stability.  

The challenges faced by communities with large inventories of REO and vacant property 

will not be resolved overnight.  What began as a problem rooted in poorly underwritten loans has 

been exacerbated by high unemployment and slow economic growth.  As delinquencies and
