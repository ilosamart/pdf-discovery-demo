Inflexible exchange rates in these countries have tended to inhibit adjustment of 

unsustainable global imbalances in trade and capital flows.  Indeed, as I noted, such 

imbalances appear to have fostered the buildup of vulnerabilities in the run-up to the 

recent financial crisis.  Countries with current account surpluses and restricted capital 

flows have been able to resist currency appreciation for prolonged periods, even when 

justified by underlying fundamentals.  In principle, adjustment of imbalances could occur 

if countries permitting relatively limited movements in nominal exchange rates allow 

their national price levels to adjust over time.  But sterilization operations and other 

policy tools can, and often have, restrained such adjustment.  Meanwhile, countries with 

current account deficits should take steps to increase national saving, including by putting 

in place credible plans to reduce their fiscal deficits in the longer run.   

The international monetary system, in effect, still suffers from the same 

asymmetry that bedeviled the Bretton Woods system--namely, a marked differential in 

the pressures facing surplus and deficit countries to permit automatic adjustments or to 

undertake policy to reduce persistent global imbalances.  Surplus countries can resist 

adjustment by restricting capital flows and exchange rate movements, but deficit 

countries are forced to adjust when they run out of international reserves or lose access to 

external borrowing.  This asymmetry has served to inhibit the global rebalancing process, 

and it could threaten the ongoing recovery:  If deficit countries curtail spending without 

offsetting spending increases in the surplus countries, aggregate demand would decline, 

with adverse consequences for the global economy.    

Thus, in my view, we need to continue working toward an international monetary 

system characterized by more-flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and
