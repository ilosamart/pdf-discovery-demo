policymakers influence financial behaviors?  

•  How should financial literacy be measured to evaluate the impact of financial 

education on financial outcomes and predict future behavior and well-being?  Should 

these measures vary across demographic groups and the context in which consumers 

make financial decisions? 

Undoubtedly some of the research shared at this conference will shed light on 

these questions and also raise others.  I look forward to learning from your work and to 

implementing and supporting programs that have demonstrated results.
