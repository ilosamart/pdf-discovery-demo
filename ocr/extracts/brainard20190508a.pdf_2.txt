It is good to be here in Richmond today.1  I appreciate my colleague, Tom Barkin, 

leading this event, and it is a pleasure to also be with Sherrie Brach Armstrong, CEO of

economic development manager; Shawn Smith, director of workforce development

Today’s community listening session is part of a series called “Fed Listens.”  The 

Federal Reserve is undertaking a review to make sure we are carrying out the monetary 

policy goals assigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can.2  In 

conducting this review, we are reaching out to communities around the country in 

sessions like this to understand how you are experiencing the economy day to day. 

Two Goals 

So what are the monetary policy goals the Congress assigned us?  Congress has 

assigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve maximum employment 

and price stability.  These two goals are what we refer to as our dual mandate.  By price 

stability we mean moderate and stable inflation.  Specifically, the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC)—the group at the Fed responsible for determining monetary
