We do not understand sufficiently the determinants of inflation expectations to be 

confident that a regime change can be controlled.  Central banks, here and abroad, have worked 

for decades to get inflation down to levels consistent with price stability.  We should not risk 

these hard-won gains.  In changing the goal posts at this time of consequence, substantial harm 

would be done to a central bank’s institutional credibility, and perhaps lead to an unmooring of 

inflation expectations.  Such damage could lead investors to seek alternative currencies, with 

prices of commodities and other hard assets likely to increase.  

Conclusion 

Independence in the conduct of monetary policy is at the core of advanced modern 

economies.  And it can be too easily forgotten by those who have only known its benefits.  If the 

Federal Reserve lost its independence, its hard-earned credibility would quickly dissipate.  The 

costs to the economy would be incalculable:  Higher inflation, lower standards of living, and a 

currency that risks losing its reserve status.   

Now more than ever, market participants are watching the relationship between central 

banks and their governments.  They are keenly gauging whether changes in conditions, policies, 

or practices pierce the veil of central bank independence.  Central bankers the world over must 

demonstrate that we are worthy of this moment, and will be steadfast protectors of our 

institutions’ credibility.  That means respecting our important but circumscribed role in the 

conduct of policy, and performing our mission with competence and consistency.
