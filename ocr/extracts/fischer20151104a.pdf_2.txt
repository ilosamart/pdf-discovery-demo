It is a pleasure to speak to you tonight and an honor to deliver the 2015 Herbert 

Stein Memorial Lecture.1  My subject tonight is central bank independence.  But before 

turning to that topic, I would like to explain why this is a special occasion for me.   

My first real-world involvement in economic policy began late in 1983, when I 

was invited by Secretary of State George Shultz to join a small team to advise him on the 

stabilization of the Israeli economy, then suffering from triple-digit inflation and other 

ills.  Herb Stein, formerly chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Richard 

Nixon and Gerald Ford, was also on that team.  Herb was 67, wise, witty, and 

experienced, and I was 40 years old, with a lot still to learn.  By mid-1984, the advisory 

team consisted of only Herb and me. 

The experience of working for George Shultz, in partnership with Herb, was not 

only wonderful, but it also changed my life, for after that I had the policy bug.  I believe 

our team made a real contribution to the success of the Israeli stabilization program that 

began in mid-1985 and which is now recognized as a critical turning point in Israel’s 

economic history.  But tonight is not the occasion to retell that story.   

Rather, let me tell you a bit about Herb via what should be called Herbisms.  The 

most famous one is “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop,” which comes in 

very handy when trying to persuade someone to stop implementing policies that are 

driving their economy straight into a stone wall.  A second Herbism is extremely useful 

when discussing economic growth or interest rates:  “The difference between a growth 

rate of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.”  I have many more but
