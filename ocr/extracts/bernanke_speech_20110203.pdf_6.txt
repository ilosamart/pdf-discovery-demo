rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and 

contributes to an easing in broader financial conditions.  These changes, by reducing 

borrowing costs and raising asset prices, bolster household and business spending and 

thus increase economic activity.  By comparison, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of 

longer-term securities have not affected very short-term interest rates, which remain close 

to zero, but instead put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates.  By 

easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by 

households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional 

monetary policy, thereby strengthening the economic recovery. 

A wide range of market indicators supports the view that the Federal Reserve’s 

securities purchases have been effective at easing financial conditions.  For example, 

since August, when we announced our policy of reinvesting maturing securities and 

signaled we were considering more purchases, equity prices have risen significantly, 

volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and 

inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has 

risen from low to more normal levels.  Yields on 5- to 10-year Treasury securities 

initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective Fed purchases; these yields 

subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth 

and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases.  All of these 

developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more 

accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means.  Interestingly, 

these developments are also remarkably similar to those that occurred during the earlier 

episode of policy easing, notably in the months following our March 2009 announcement
