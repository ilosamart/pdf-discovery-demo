pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this

have been surprised by how well consumer spending--and private domestic final demand 

more generally--have held up in the face of this pronounced fiscal drag.  In the first 

quarter of this year, consumer spending and private domestic final demand rose at an 

annual rate of just above 2-1/2 percent.  More-recent indicators of household and 

business spending suggest that private demand is continuing to advance at a reasonable 

clip despite the fiscal tightening.  This strength is a reason for optimism.  Indeed, even if 

real GDP rises only 2 percent or so this year--which is at the bottom end of the range of 

projections from the June SEP--it would still represent a solid performance in the face of 

these fiscal headwinds. 

There is still a long way to go before we achieve a full recovery.  The healing 

process will take time, but we continue to make real progress. 

Let’s turn to monetary policy, starting with the dual mandate, pursuant to which 

the Congress directs the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy so as to foster stable 

prices and full employment.   

Dual Mandate—Inflation 

Inflation is currently running below the FOMC’s 2 percent long-term objective 

for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation, and these readings have our 

attention.   But inflation often fluctuates for transitory reasons.  We generally try to look 

through such transitory movements, whether above or below our objective.  There is 

some reason to think that the recent low readings partly reflect transitory factors.  Other
