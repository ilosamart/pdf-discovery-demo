commercial real estate guidance for banks affected loan growth.4  Another paper examines the 

effect of the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund on community bank lending to small 

businesses.  The third paper in this session focuses on what happens when banks perceive that 

examiners have given them inappropriately negative evaluations.   

The underlying theme of the third research session is how broad government policies 

affect community bank profitability and viability.  The first paper provides an overview of the 

effects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on community 

banks.  The second paper considers whether a provision of the JOBS Act that modified the 

threshold for Exchange Act reporting for unlisted banks and bank holding companies helped or 

hurt small banks.  The third paper contrasts the thousands of small community banks operating in 

the United States with the handful of very large financial institutions and proposes a new 

approach to regulation that recognizes the very different business models of these two types of 

institutions.  The fourth and final paper takes a high-level look at the effects of regulatory policy 

on the structure of the U.S. banking system and the viability of community banks.   

On day two of the conference, you will learn about the results of a recently conducted 

survey that was completed by more than 1,000 community bankers from across the country, as 

well as the feedback obtained from more than 1,300 bankers participating in town hall meetings 

hosted by state bank commissioners in 30 states.  The presentation of these findings will be 

followed by a panel discussion by a select group of community banking experts.
