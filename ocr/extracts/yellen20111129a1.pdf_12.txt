many years to come.  These developments have also affected emerging market 

economies, where there are now clear signs of slowing growth.  In addition, downside 

risks to global growth have increased significantly because of rising financial market 

pressures, reflecting an intensification of stress in European banking and sovereign debt 

markets as well as broader concerns about the outlook.   

These circumstances call for concerted domestic policy actions to boost growth 

and create jobs.  Indeed, as I already noted, we at the Federal Reserve are moving 

vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery.  However, monetary policy is not a 

panacea, and it is essential for other policymakers to also do their part.  In particular, 

there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing 

market.  Stronger housing demand has the potential to boost recovery.  The Congress and 

the Administration also can support the recovery in the near term while simultaneously 

putting fiscal policy on a sustainable trajectory in the long term.   

As I have emphasized in this talk, there is also an urgent need for policy action 

from a number of countries.  In Europe, forceful action is essential to address the region's 

fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only to growth but also to global 

financial stability.  In addition, many emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, 

have the scope to bolster domestic demand.  Such policies would support stronger, more 

balanced, and more sustainable global economic growth; they would enhance social 

welfare at home as well.  The most profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past 

several decades has been to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.  Further 

actions to boost aggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained.
