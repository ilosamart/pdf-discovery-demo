Last month I announced that I would be leaving the Federal Reserve Board at the 

end of May in order to return to my teaching position at Harvard.  So I would like to take 

a moment to express my gratitude to my many colleagues at the Board and around the 

Federal Reserve System who have taught me so much--not just about economic policy, 

but about public service.  It has been a privilege to work alongside such a talented and 

selfless group of people and to be a part of such a special institution.   

One of the many aspects of the job that I had not fully appreciated before joining 

the Board is how challenging the whole process of communicating about monetary policy 

can be.  As you know, over the past several years the Federal Reserve has dramatically 

altered how it talks to financial markets and to the public at large.  For much of its 

100-year history, the Fed was remarkably opaque; indeed, around the time I started my 

academic career in the mid-1980s, there was an active literature on the causes and 

consequences of such opacity.  The title of Marvin Goodfriend’s 1986 paper captured the 

situation well:  “Monetary Mystique:  Secrecy and Central Banking.”

Market Committee (FOMC) providing more timely information about its policy 

decisions.   

This evolution in the direction of greater openness has continued.  And, in the last 

10 years, there have been numerous changes in the FOMC’s communications policies:
