has likely played a role in flattening the Phillips curve.  But a flatter Phillips curve makes 

it harder to assess whether movements in inflation reflect the cyclical position of the 

economy or other influences.   

Second, what would be the consequences for inflation if unemployment were to 

run well below the natural rate for an extended period?  The flat Phillips curve suggests 

that the implications for inflation might not be large, although a very tight labor market 

could lead to larger, nonlinear effects.  Research on this question is ambiguous, again 

reflecting the limited historical experience.8  We should also remember that where 

inflation expectations are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept 

inflation under control.  If central banks were instead to try to exploit the 

nonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization 

significantly and persistently past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question 

our commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure.  

So far, we see no signs of this.  If anything, some measures of longer-term inflation 

expectations in the United States have edged lower in recent years. 

Third, can persistently strong economic conditions pose financial stability risks?  

Of course, strong economic conditions are a good thing!  Such conditions can make the 

financial system better able to absorb shocks through strong balance sheets and investor 

confidence.  But we have often seen confidence become overconfidence and lead to 

excessive borrowing and risk-taking, leaving the financial system more vulnerable.
