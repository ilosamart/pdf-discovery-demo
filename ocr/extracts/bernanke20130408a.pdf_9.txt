developed under great time pressure.  Of necessity, when projecting losses and revenues 

under alternative SCAP scenarios, supervisors relied on the firms’ own estimates as a 

starting point.  Although we scrutinized and questioned the firms’ estimates and made 

significant adjustments based on our own analysis, for that inaugural round of stress tests, 

it was not possible to produce completely independent estimates.   

 However, over the past four years, considerable progress has been made in data 

collection and in the development of independent supervisory models.  For our most 

recent supervisory stress tests, we collected and analyzed loan- and account-level data on 

more than two-thirds of the $4.2 trillion in accrual loans and leases projected to be held 

by the 18 firms we evaluated this year.  Those detailed data include borrower, loan, and 

collateral information on more than 350 million domestic retail loans, including credit 

cards and mortgages, and more than 200,000 commercial loans.  Currently, the Federal 

Reserve uses more than 40 models to project how categories of bank losses and revenues 

would likely respond in hypothetical scenarios.  The improvements in data and models 

have increased our ability to distinguish risks within portfolios.  Importantly, these 

supervisory models are evaluated by a special model validation group made up of experts 

within the Federal Reserve who do not work on the stress tests.  We have also created a 

Model Validation Council made up of external experts to provide independent views and 

advice.
