We have established a number of channels of communication to facilitate such input.  For 

starters, the Reserve Banks have long had programs in place to provide training and guidance to 

banks in their districts.  Recently, some of these programs have been expanded nationwide.  For 

example, our host, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, organizes national “Ask the Fed” calls 

to provide an opportunity for bankers all over the country to hear Federal Reserve staff discuss 

timely financial or regulatory topics and to ask questions on these topics.  Similarly, for 

consumer compliance issues, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts a national 

webinar series called “Outlook Live,” which complements the “Consumer Compliance Outlook,” 

a quarterly publication sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  In addition, the 

Federal Reserve recently launched “Community Banking Connections,” a website that serves as 

a “one-stop shop” for information on issues that affect community banks, as well as providing 

links to tools and resources that can help them. 

Another recently established communication channel is the Community Depository 

Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC).1  The council, which is made up of representatives of 

smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations from each of the 12 Federal Reserve 

Districts, meets with the Board of Governors in Washington twice a year.  These meetings allow 

the Board to gather firsthand information from community bankers about issues that concern 

them most and about economic conditions in their areas.      

In addition, the Board of Governors has a community bank subcommittee of our 

Committee on Bank Supervision that oversees the supervision of community banks and reviews 

regulatory proposals to ensure they are appropriately tailored for community banks.  The 

subcommittee also meets with Federal Reserve staff to hear about ongoing research in the
