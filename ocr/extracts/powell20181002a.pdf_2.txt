It is a pleasure and an honor to speak here today at the 60th Annual Meeting of 

the National Association for Business Economics (NABE).  Since 1959, NABE has 

promoted the use of economics in the workplace and advanced the worthy purpose of 

ensuring that leading American businesses benefit from the insights of economists. 

Today I will focus on the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to promote maximum 

employment and stable prices.  I am pleased to say that, by these measures, the economy 

looks very good.  The unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent, near a 20-year low.  

Inflation is currently running near the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 

objective of 2 percent.  While these two top-line statistics do not always present an 

accurate picture of overall economic conditions, a wide range of data on jobs and prices 

supports a positive view.  In addition, many forecasters are predicting that these favorable 

conditions are likely to continue.  For example, the medians of the most recent 

projections from FOMC participants and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well 

as the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast, all have the 

unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation 

staying very near 2 percent over the same period.1   

From the standpoint of our dual mandate, this is a remarkably positive outlook.  

Indeed, I was asked at last week’s press conference whether these forecasts are too good 

to be true--a reasonable question!  Since 1950, the U.S. economy has experienced periods 

of low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such 

                                                 
1 I am referring to the most recent forecast for year-end 2018 through 2020.  The unemployment rate for 
each forecast bottoms out at 3.4 percent or 3.5 percent in 2019 and remains below 4 percent.  Headline PCE 
(personal consumption expenditures) inflation is between 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent for all three years and 
forecasts.  The sources for the forecast data are given in the notes to figure 1.
