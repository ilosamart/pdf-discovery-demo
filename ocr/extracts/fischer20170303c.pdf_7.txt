discussed the important role that models and policy rules play in FOMC discussions and 

decisionmaking. 

Shortly after the speech, I received an e-mail from an old and esteemed colleague, 

Professor Athanasios Orphanides, with the subject line “I’d rather have Bob Solow with a 

model and a rule (following a careful evaluation process).”  What does a careful 

evaluation process entail?  I will paraphrase my correspondent at length.13 

Professor Orphanides’s recommendation is that the FOMC adopt a reference rule, 

based on a rigorous evaluation and paying particular emphasis to (1) robustness to model 

uncertainty, (2) robustness to natural rate uncertainty, (3) robustness to expectations 

formation, (4) robustness to the size of shocks and the effective lower bound, and (5) 

whatever else the Fed staff has identified as a gap in our knowledge that may matter in 

evaluation.  He suggested that, ultimately, the FOMC could arrive at a simple rule that 

would serve as a good benchmark to guide policy. 

My colleague certainly lays out an impressive work program for the Board’s 

cadre of Ph.D. economists.  However, I tend to agree with John Taylor and my Fed 

colleague John Williams when they write that “the search for better and more robust 

policy rules is never done.”14 

                                                 
13 The direct quotation from Professor Orphanides is as follows:  “My recommendation had been that the 
FOMC should adopt a reference rule, based on rigorous evaluation, using the technology the Fed staff has 
developed over the past couple of decades and paying particular emphasis on various aspects of robustness:  
(1) robustness to model uncertainty, (FRB/US (various vintages), EDO, SIGMA (again various vintages) 
and others),  (2) robustness to natural rate uncertainty, u*, r*, Q*, fx* and so on,  (3) robustness to 
expectations formation (mode[l] consistent, learning, partial learning by businesses/households, etc.), (4) 
robustness to the size of shocks and the ZLB [zero lower bound] (given that certainty equivalence does not 
hold), (5) whatever else the staff research has identified as a gap in our knowledge that may matter in 
evaluation.  The evaluation should allow for forecast-based rules as well as outcome-based rules and could 
be updated on an annual basis to incorporate new information.  But ultimately, the FOMC could arrive at a 
simple rule that would be, in the Committee’s judgment, a good benchmark to guide policy.”
