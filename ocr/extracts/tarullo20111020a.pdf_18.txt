if all parts of the government--or, for that matter, the private sector--are acting just the 

way we think they should.  In other words, we have to take the world as we find it and 

adjust our actions accordingly.  Sometimes that will mean tighter monetary policy to 

offset the inflationary effects of other policies.  Sometimes, as at present, it will mean 

more accommodative policies, even when we know that monetary policy alone cannot 

solve all the economyâ€™s problems. 

Within the FOMC and in the broader policy community, there has been 

considerable discussion of possible additional accommodative measures, from 

communication strategies such as forward guidance on the likely path of the federal funds 

rate to additional balance sheet operations.  I believe we should move back up toward the 

top of the list of options the large-scale purchase of additional mortgage-backed securities 

(MBS), something the FOMC first did in November 2008 and then in greater amounts 

beginning in March 2009 in order to provide more support to mortgage lending and 

housing markets.   

In November 2010, when the FOMC initiated another large-scale asset purchase 

program, only U.S. Treasury securities were involved, in large part because of a desire to 

return, once the recovery was well established, as quickly as possible to a Federal 

Reserve balance sheet that did not contain other kinds of assets.  A related concern of 

some was that the purchase of MBS was a form of credit allocation, rather than simply 

monetary policy that lowered long-term rates for all borrowers.  For similar reasons, the 

proceeds of agency securities accumulated pursuant to the first large-scale asset purchase 

program were reinvested in Treasury securities rather than in other agency securities.
