on the federal funds rate.5  That said, even if uncertain, it is probably safe to say that 

reserve demand is much higher than before the crisis.   

As we work to calibrate ample reserves, there are some tradeoffs that are worth 

noting.  For example, we could operate with a level of reserve balances at the lower end 

of what might be considered ample.  In that case, there would likely be occasions when 

unexpected declines in the supply of reserves or increases in the demand for reserves 

would require an open market operation to offset temporary upward pressures on the 

federal funds rate.  Alternatively, we could operate with an average supply of reserves 

large enough to keep the federal funds rate determined along the flat portion of the 

reserve demand curve even with an unexpected shift in the supply of or demand for 

reserves.  This approach would be operationally convenient but would also leave the size 

of the balance sheet and reserves larger than necessary most of the time.  In my view, it 

might be appropriate for us to operate somewhere in between these two extremes, with a 

sizable quantity of reserves large enough to buffer against most shocks to reserve supply.  

On those few days when that buffer is likely to be exhausted, we could conduct open 

market operations to temporarily boost the supply of reserves. 

With so much uncertainty over the level and slope of the reserve demand curve, a 

degree of caution is warranted.  As outlined in the minutes of the January FOMC 

meeting, the Committee has discussed ending the reduction in the Fed’s aggregate asset 

holdings sometime in the latter half of this year, with still-ample reserves in the system.6
