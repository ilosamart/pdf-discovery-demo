the nationâ€™s largest remaining banking firms following congressional enactment of the Troubled 

Assets Relief Program (TARP).  The Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury 

provided financing and backstops, respectively, for money market funds and various forms of 

securitized assets.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation extended its guarantees to bank 

deposits and the senior debt of banks. 

 These and other measures ultimately proved successful in placing a floor under the 

downward spiral of the financial system.  But it was against the backdrop of the need for massive 

taxpayer-backed assistance--to firms and to markets more generally--that Congress and financial 

regulators developed responses to the woefully inadequate capital levels of prudentially 

regulated firms; the systemic consequences of stress at previously non-prudentially regulated 

firms such as the free-standing investment banks; the widespread failures of risk management 

within these firms; the parallel failures in supervision of these firms; and the fragility of a 

financial system that had become characterized by large amounts of runnable short-term funding.   

 The first and, to my mind, still the most important element of regulatory strengthening 

was to increase the amount of capital held by banks to ensure they remained viable financial 

intermediaries that could finance economic activity.  In fact, this effort began as part of the 

emergency stabilization efforts in early 2009, when we conducted a stress test of the 30 largest 

banking firms.  Where we determined a firm did not have enough capital, we required that it 

either raise equity in the public markets or take some of the remaining government TARP 

capital.   

 The quick action in assessing the firms, recapitalizing them where needed, and sharing 

the results of the stress tests with the public stands as one of the turning points in the crisis.  

From there, we pursued a strategy of gradually strengthening ongoing capital requirements.
