 Thank you for inviting me to be here and to help you fulfill one of the Money 

Marketeers’ key objectives, “to enhance knowledge and understanding of the financial 

marketplace.”  

 I was a banker for more than 30 years before becoming a member of the Board of 

Governors, so I’ve spent my career trying to deepen my own knowledge and understanding of 

the financial marketplace.  In particular, because the outlook for interest rates and the economy 

was so important to my bank and my customers, I spent considerable effort trying to understand 

the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s primary monetary policymaking body, 

and trying to anticipate the decisions coming out of individual FOMC meetings.  In fact, the first 

bank investment class I ever took included instruction on how to use the weekly reports of 

monetary aggregates to decipher Fed actions.  That will give you some idea of how long ago that 

was: It was before the Committee began expressing its objective in terms of the federal funds 

rate—actually before the Committee began saying much at all.  Now, after two years of 

participating in the decisionmaking process, I would like to share some observations that I 

believe might help you better understand the formulation of monetary policy. 

Before I joined the Board, I was advised to read two speeches, “Come with Me to the 

FOMC” given by Governor Laurence Meyer in 1998, and an updated version presented by 

Governor Mark Olson in 2004.1

                                                           
1 See Laurence H. Meyer (1998), “Come with Me to the FOMC,” the Gillis Lecture, Williamette University, Salem 
Oregon, April 2, 

  It turns out that Governor Meyer’s speech was inspired by one 

given in 1967 by Edward Wayne, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.  As I 

thought about how to frame this discussion, a reprise of these earlier speeches seemed 

appropriate.
