Some observers question just how large the shortfall from full employment really 

is and hence worry that further increases in aggregate demand could push up inflation.  

Their concern is that a large part of the rise in unemployment since 2007 is structural 

rather than cyclical.  I agree that the magnitude of structural unemployment is uncertain, 

but I read the evidence as supporting the view that the bulk of the rise in unemployment 

that we saw in recent years was cyclical, not structural in nature.  Assessments 

concerning the degree of slack in the labor market are highly relevant to an evaluation of 

the appropriate stance of policy, so I’d like to review my reasoning in some detail. 

First, the fact that the rise in unemployment was quite widespread across industry 

and occupation groups casts doubt on the hypothesis that there has been an unusually 

large mismatch between the types of job vacancies and the types of workers available to 

fill them.  Certainly, job losses in the construction sector and in financial services were 

particularly sharp--not surprising given the collapse in the housing market and in the 

financial sector that we saw in 2008--but so were losses in manufacturing and other 

highly cyclical industries that typically are hit especially hard in recessions.  Indeed, 

measures of the dispersion of employment changes across industries did not increase 

more than past experience would have predicted given the depth of the recession.   

Some commentators have noted that “house lock”--the reluctance or inability of 

homeowners to sell in a declining price environment or when underwater on their 

mortgages--may be preventing people from moving to find available jobs in new 

locations.  However, evidence from migration patterns suggests that house lock is not 

having a significant effect on the level of structural unemployment.  While migration 

within the United States has been trending down for some time, the reduction in mobility
