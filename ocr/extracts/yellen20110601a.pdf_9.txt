appears to remain generally muted, with most investors not fully using their existing funding 

capacity.  Therefore, the risk of a rapid and disorderly deleveraging in the event of a swift 

change in market sentiment seems to be limited at this point. 

 Nonetheless, two dynamics with respect to the use of leverage bear watching.  First, 

important classes of generally unlevered investors (for example, pension funds) are reportedly 

finding it difficult in the present low interest rate environment to meet nominal return targets and 

may be reaching for yield by assuming greater interest-rate and credit risk in their portfolios.  

While some investors have also apparently boosted returns by increasing leverage, we see little 

evidence at present that this behavior is occurring on any significant scale.  Second, additional 

funding is reportedly broadly available to traditionally levered investors such as hedge funds.  To 

the extent that investors choose to take advantage of the readily available funding for less liquid 

assets, their use of leverage could rise quickly, increasing the risks of a disorderly deleveraging. 

A Case Study: The Syndicated Leveraged Loan Market 

 I mentioned earlier that strong demand has been pushing prices higher in the 

syndicated loan market and figure 7 shows recent developments:  Inflows into this asset class 

have indeed been robust and prices have been rising quite rapidly.  An important characteristic of 

syndicated loans is that they are floating rate instruments, priced at a fixed spread to Libor (the 

London interbank offered rate).  In an environment where interest rates may be expected to rise, 

this characteristic may partly explain such strong investor interest.  

 To assess the potential financial stability ramifications of these developments, we have 

focused initially on two key questions.  First, to what degree would financial intermediaries be 

exposed to a rapid change in investor sentiment?  Recall that prior to the financial crisis, a 

number of important financial institutions, in their role as lead arrangers of syndicated loans,
