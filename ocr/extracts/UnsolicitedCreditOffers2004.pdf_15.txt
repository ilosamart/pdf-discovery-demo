Opting Out: Mechanisms to Avoid Receiving 
Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit or Insurance 

The first issue that the present study is to address under section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act 
is “the current statutory or voluntary mechanisms that are available to a consumer to 
notify lenders and insurance providers that the consumer does not wish to receive written 
offers of credit or insurance.” 

THE FCRA STATUTORY MECHANISM 

Section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act specifically establishes a set of rules that 
regulate how creditors and insurers may use CRA records as the basis for sending 
unsolicited firm offers of credit or insurance to consumers. It also prescribes a 
mechanism by which consumers can elect not to receive these prescreened solicitations. 

Section 604(c) designates the conditions for “furnishing reports in connection with credit 
or insurance transactions that are not initiated by the consumer,” in other words, for 
prescreened offers of credit or insurance based on information in the individual’s credit 
record. Specifically, section 604(c) mandates that a CRA may provide information on a 
consumer for prescreening only if (1) the consumer authorizes the CRA to provide the 
information (not usually a component of prescreened offers of credit or insurance) or (2) 
“the transaction consists of a firm offer of credit or insurance,” the CRA has established 
the required procedures allowing consumers to exclude themselves from the prescreened 
lists, and the consumer has not done so. A “firm offer of credit or insurance” is defined 
as any offer of credit or insurance to a consumer that will be honored if, on the basis of 
information in the consumer’s credit record, the consumer meets the specific criteria used 
to select him or her for the offer, except that the offer may be further conditioned in 
certain circumstances.9 

This provision establishes an important first requirement, namely that prescreening must 
be employed solely for offering credit or insurance, not merely for advertising. 
Furthermore, a person receiving a prescreened list from a CRA may receive only limited 
information about each consumer: (1) the name and address of the consumer, (2) an 
identifier that is not unique to the consumer and that is used by the person solely for the 
purpose of verifying the identity of the consumer (such as a partial social security 
number), and (3) other information about the consumer that does not identify the 
relationship or experience of the consumer with a particular creditor or other entity. In 
addition, the law requires that CRAs must comply with the provisions concerning 

9 These circumstances include verification of the specific criteria (for example, verification of income 
and employment) used to select the consumer for the offer and the consumer’s willingness to supply any 
needed collateral disclosed in the offer. These circumstances are outlined in section 603(l) of the FCRA.
