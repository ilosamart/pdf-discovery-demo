the one-month relative to the three-month swaption implied volatility, the volatility of 

volatility, and the size of the tails of price-change distributions for certain assets.  We see 

some increases in the values of these indicators, which provide some evidence that 

liquidity may be less resilient than it had been previously.  But this evidence is not 

particularly robust, and, given the limitations of the existing data, it is difficult to know 

the extent to which liquidity resilience may have declined.   

As we continue to investigate quantitative evidence of the deterioration in the 

resilience of liquidity in some of the financial markets, we are also trying to tease out the 

various drivers of liquidity conditions, such as changes in regulation, trading strategies, 

and market structure.  Regulatory changes are often cited as a contributing factor.  

Trading financial assets is a balance-sheet-intensive activity, and the Dodd-Frank Act, 

has created incentives for institutions to carefully assess the risks of such activity through 

stricter requirements on leverage, liquidity, and proprietary trading, raising the cost of 

market making and possibly affecting market liquidity.  Indeed, there is evidence of 

reductions in broker-dealer bond inventories in recent years.  Nonetheless, since not all 

broker-dealer inventories are used for market-making activities, the extent to which lower 

inventories are affecting liquidity is unclear.  Moreover, reductions in broker-dealer 

inventories occurred prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, suggesting that factors 

other than regulation may also be contributing. In assessing the role of regulation as a 

possible contributor to reduced liquidity, it is important to recognize that those 

regulations were put in place to reduce the concentration of liquidity risk on the balance 

sheets of the large, highly interconnected institutions that proved to be a major amplifier 

of financial instability at the height of the crisis.
