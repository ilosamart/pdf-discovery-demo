To bolster that resiliency, the environment for foreign banks operating in the United 

States underwent a number of changes.  While there are important differences, those changes for 

foreign firms broadly parallel many of the changes instituted for domestic firms.  My Federal 

Reserve colleagues and I have termed these the core post-crisis regulatory reforms: capital, 

liquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning.1  Of course, the obvious and most prominent 

difference for foreign firms--as attendees of this conference certainly know--was the introduction 

of the intermediate holding company (IHC) structure, to which the post-crisis regulatory reforms 

apply. 

In my estimation, these reforms have gone a long way toward meeting our goal of a more 

resilient financial system.  That said, we are now at a point--with ten years of experience in 

setting up and living with the body of post-crisis regulation--where it is both relevant and timely 

to examine the post-crisis reforms and identify what is working well and what can be improved.  

If none of the regulatory measures implemented up to now were capable of improvement, this 

would be the first project of this scale and complexity conducted that had been done exactly right 

the first pass through.  If there was still work to be done after Hammurabi, there is probably still 

some work to be done now after Dodd and Frank.  In particular, as I have said elsewhere, we 

should be looking to see where we can achieve our regulatory objectives in ways that maintain 

our measures’ effectiveness, but improve their efficiency, transparency, and simplicity.  As part 

of that effort, we will consider additional tailoring and flexibility of our regulations in light of
