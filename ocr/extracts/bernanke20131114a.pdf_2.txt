Good morning.  I am pleased to address the Annual Conference of the Union of 

Arab Banks (UAB) as it celebrates 40 years of success representing the interests of the 

Arab banking and financial communities.   

The UAB may justifiably take great pride in its many accomplishments during the 

past four decades.  Among other achievements, the UAB has emerged as a key

has also been a champion of sharing best practices and training among regulators and 

bankers. 

The partnership that has developed between the Federal Reserve and the UAB 

may be counted among these successes.  Ten years ago, the Federal Reserve helped 

establish--with the support of many of the countries represented at this conference--the 

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Financial Regulators’ Initiative.  Sarkis 

Yoghourtdjian of the Federal Reserve Board, who is attending with you today, was asked 

to lead this initiative, whose aim has been to provide technical assistance and bank 

supervision training to central banks and bank supervisory authorities.  Now in its 10th 

and final year, the Financial Regulators’ Initiative has sponsored more than 40 training 

programs and conferences throughout the MENA region, and it has provided many short-

term, on-the-job training opportunities for MENA regulators with U.S. banking agencies.  

We are grateful to the UAB for its many contributions to the success of this initiative. 

In addition to celebrating accomplishments, anniversaries also provide a time for 

reflection and self-assessment.  Governments, central bankers, financial regulators, and 

the banking industry still labor today in the long shadow cast by the global financial
