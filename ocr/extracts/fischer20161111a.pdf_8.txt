assets around the globe, it probably contributed to the growing resource pressures in 

some of these economies.  EMEs had to choose between an accommodative monetary 

policy that was more in line with the United States and other advanced economies versus 

a tighter policy stance likely to cause their exchange rates to appreciate markedly and 

possibly cause a relatively sharp contraction in the tradable sectors of their economies.  

While the more accommodative stance had the attractive feature that it would lessen the 

hurt to the export sector, the downside was that it was more likely to lead to overheating 

and high inflation that could be costly to correct.    

My sense is that most EME central banks had considerable latitude to keep 

inflation near target and output near potential through maintaining a relatively tight 

policy, and thus to limit spillovers from easing by the advanced economies.  But while I 

think that there is a strong case for focusing on a limited set of objectives, including to 

ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, it is also important to 

recognize the tough tradeoffs faced by EME central banks given their understandable 

desire to avoid causing a sharp slowdown in exports.  The tradeoff faced by EME central 

bankers helps illustrate some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence 

between the United States and other economies closely tied to it through economic and 

financial channels. 

Notwithstanding these challenges, I should underscore that the Federal Reserve’s 

aggressive monetary easing contributed to a faster stabilization and recovery of the U.S. 

economy.  This benefited the global economy by mitigating a major source of downside 

risk, thus improving global risk sentiment and confidence.  Moreover, the Fed’s monetary 

policy actions were reinforced by many steps to help safeguard the U.S. financial system
