participation rate.  These developments suggest that an improving job market has made 

joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the

quarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed 

noticeably in the middle of this year.  As a result, economic activity over the past three 

quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each
