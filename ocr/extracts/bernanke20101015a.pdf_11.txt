including upward biases in the measurement of inflation.  A rationale that is particularly 

relevant today is that maintaining an “inflation buffer” (that is, an average inflation rate 

greater than zero) allows for a somewhat higher average level of nominal interest rates, 

which in turn gives the Federal Reserve greater latitude to reduce the target federal funds 

rate when needed to stimulate increased economic activity and employment.  A modestly 

positive inflation rate also reduces the probability that the economy could fall into 

deflation, which under some circumstances can lead to significant economic problems. 

Although attaining the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment and achieving 

the mandate-consistent rate of inflation are both key objectives of monetary policy, the 

two objectives are somewhat different in nature.  Most importantly, whereas monetary 

policymakers clearly have the ability to determine the inflation rate in the long run, they 

have little or no control over the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate, which is 

primarily determined by demographic and structural factors, not by monetary policy.  

Thus, while central bankers can choose the value of inflation they wish to target, the 

sustainable unemployment rate can only be estimated, and is subject to substantial 

uncertainty.  Moreover, the sustainable rate of unemployment typically evolves over time 

as its fundamental determinants change, whereas keeping inflation expectations firmly 

anchored generally implies that the inflation objective should remain constant unless 

there are compelling technical reasons for changing it, such as changes in the methods 

used to measure inflation. 

In recent years, the Federal Reserve has taken important steps to more clearly 

communicate its outlook and longer-run objectives.  Since the fall of 2007, the Federal 

Reserve has been publishing the “Summary of Economic Projections” (SEP) four times a
