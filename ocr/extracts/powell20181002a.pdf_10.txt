suggests that this reasoning can account for a good deal of the change in the Phillips 

curve relationship.13 It is also likely that many other factors have contributed to changes 

in inflation dynamics over recent decades.  We do not fully understand the causes and 

implications of these changes, which raises risk management issues that I will take up 

now.14  

A Favorable Outlook, but What Could Go Wrong? 

To set the stage, let us return to the situation facing the FOMC.  The baseline 

forecasts of most FOMC participants and a broad range of others show unemployment 

remaining below 4 percent for an extended period, with inflation steady near 2 percent.  I 

have made the case that this forecast is not too good to be true and does not signal the 

death of the Phillips curve.  Instead, the outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat 

Phillips curve and inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent.   

But we still must face the cautionary advice to beware when forecasts point to 

rarely seen outcomes.  As a way of heeding this advice, the Committee takes a risk 

management approach, which has three important parts:  monitoring risks; balancing 

risks, both upside and downside; and contingency planning for surprises.  Let me 

describe a few of the risks and how we are thinking about them. 

Could Inflation Expectations Become Unanchored? 

First is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor.  We attribute a 

great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer-term 

                                                 
13 Yellen (2017) gives a more detailed account of how a very flat Phillips curve with anchored expectations 
can account well for the recent inflation and unemployment data.  See also note 9. 
14 Many changes not directly related to policy might nonetheless have been precipitated by the 
improvement in policy.  For example, Pfajfar and Roberts, (2018) present evidence that when inflation is 
more stable, people simply pay less attention to it and that this could help account for changes in the 
Phillips curve relationship.
