financial system.  This collection and analysis of financial-sector data should allow 

regulators to see more of the financial landscape and better equip them to identify 

systemic risks and other emerging threats.

financial system.  The board will collect and analyze information on the EU’s financial 

system, identify and prioritize systemic risks, and issue warnings and recommendations 

to national and European authorities.  It will also work closely with the three newly 

created European Supervisory Authorities, which in turn are charged with coordinating
