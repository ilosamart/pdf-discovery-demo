complementary:  Policymakers need not sacrifice performance on one goal to pursue the 

other.  However, the pursuit of the two sides of the dual mandate can temporarily 

conflict.  For example, returning inflation to its longer-run goal might require, say, a 

tighter stance of monetary policy, whereas returning the economy to maximum 

employment might require just the opposite.  The consensus statement explains that in 

such circumstances the FOMC will pursue a balanced approach, taking into account the 

magnitude of the deviation of each variable from its objective and allowing for the 

possibility that the deviations may not be eliminated over the same time horizon.  The 

balanced-approach strategy endorsed by the FOMC is consistent with the view that 

maximum employment and price stability stand on an equal footing as objectives of 

monetary policy. 

As I see it, such a balanced approach has two important implications that deserve 

emphasis.  The first is that, if the FOMC is doing its best to minimize deviations from its 

objectives, then, over long periods, both unemployment and inflation will be about 

equally likely to fall on either side of those objectives.  To put it simply, if 2 percent 

inflation is the Committeeâ€™s goal, 2 percent cannot be viewed as a ceiling for inflation 

because that would result in deviations that are more frequently below 2 percent than 

above and thus not properly balanced with the goal of maximum employment.  Instead, to 

balance the chances that inflation will sometimes deviate a bit above and a bit below the 

goal, 2 percent must be treated as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates.  

The same holds true for fluctuations of unemployment around its longer-run normal rate. 

 The second property, which to me is the essence of the balanced approach, is that 

reducing the deviation of one variable from its objective must at times involve allowing
