including an enhanced Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detailed steps and 

information for localities seeking to develop foreclosure prevention activities.  The

As the foreclosure crisis unfolded and concerns expanded from loss mitigation 

and loan modifications to worries about housing values, vacant properties, and 

neighborhood stabilization, the Fed’s response evolved as well.  For example, starting in 

2009, the Board worked with the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland to 

produce a publication addressing issues related to the acquisition and disposition of real 

estate owned properties (REO), a term that refers to property owned by a financial 

institution, typically a bank, after a foreclosure.  The publication, “REO and Vacant 

Properties,”2 is a compendium of papers by national experts that highlight their key ideas 

regarding the disposition of vacant properties.  Last November, the papers were presented 

publicly at a forum at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., where more than 

100 participants shared ideas and lessons learned about community stabilization.3  In 

addition, last year, the Federal Reserve worked with other federal regulators to encourage 

neighborhood stabilization activities through the Community Reinvestment Act.  This 

year, we created video reports that describe specific strategies for managing vacant 

properties in Cleveland, Phoenix, and Detroit.4  

Throughout our work on the housing crisis, we have witnessed policy changes
