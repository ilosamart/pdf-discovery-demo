When we made our SCB proposal last April, we had aimed to make the SCB final 

for the 2019 stress test cycle.  However, the comments we received have been extensive 

and thoughtful, and have raised issues that require a carefully considered response.  

While I don’t believe these issues will prevent us from ultimately implementing the SCB, 

they have flagged certain elements of the regime that could benefit from further 

refinement.  Accordingly, I expect we will adopt a final rule in the near future that will 

settle the basic framework of the SCB, but re-propose certain elements.  To enable this 

process to run its course, I expect that the first SCB would not go into effect before 2020.  

For 2019, I expect CCAR will remain in place for firms with over $250 billion in assets 

or that are otherwise complex; however, we will consider whether we can move forward 

with any aspects of the SCB proposal for CCAR 2019, such as assumptions related to 

balance sheet growth.  I will also ask the Board to exempt firms with less than $250 

billion in assets from the CCAR quantitative assessment and supervisory stress testing in 

2019 in light of the every-other-year cycle contemplated in the tailoring proposal that the 

Board approved two weeks ago.2 

Returning to the SCB proposal, I would like to give you a sense of the comments 

we received and our approach to addressing those concerns.  The issue foremost on my 

mind is the volatility of the stress test results.  One concern frequently expressed is that 

the results of the supervisory stress test can lead to capital requirements that change 

significantly from year to year, which limits a firm’s ability to manage its capital 

effectively.  Some amount of volatility is necessary to preserve the dynamism of the 

stress test--by nature, the stress test will differ year-over-year based on macroeconomic 

conditions and contemporary understanding of salient risks in the economy.  In addition, 

the stress test results are sensitive to changes in a firm’s balance sheet, which means that 

a firm’s capital requirements will evolve as the firm’s activities and exposure evolve.  

However, I do think there is an important balance to be struck between preserving this
