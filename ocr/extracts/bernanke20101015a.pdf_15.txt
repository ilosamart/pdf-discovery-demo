such concerns and to ensure that it can withdraw monetary accommodation smoothly at 

the appropriate time, the Federal Reserve has developed an array of new tools.7  With 

these tools in hand, I am confident that the FOMC will be able to tighten monetary 

conditions when warranted, even if the balance sheet remains considerably larger than 

normal at that time. 

Central bank communication provides additional means of increasing the degree 

of policy accommodation when short-term nominal interest rates are near zero.  For 

example, FOMC postmeeting statements have included forward policy guidance since 

December 2008, and the most recent statements have reflected the FOMC’s anticipation 

that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “for an 

extended period,” contingent on economic conditions.  A step the Committee could 

consider, if conditions called for it, would be to modify the language of the statement in 

some way that indicates that the Committee expects to keep the target for the federal 

funds rate low for longer than markets expect.  Such a change would presumably lower 

longer-term rates by an amount related to the revision in policy expectations.  A potential 

drawback of using the FOMC’s statement in this way is that, at least without a more 

comprehensive framework in place, it may be difficult to convey the Committee’s policy 

intentions with sufficient precision and conditionality.  The Committee will continue to 

actively review its communications strategy with the goal of providing as much clarity as 

possible about its outlook, policy objectives, and policy strategies. 

Conclusion 

In short, there are clearly many challenges in communicating and conducting 

monetary policy in a low-inflation environment, including the uncertainties associated
