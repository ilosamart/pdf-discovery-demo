years—a more comprehensive measure of slack that includes shifts in labor force participation as 

well as unemployment—has recently risen close to its pre-crisis level. 

In contrast, the picture on inflation is puzzling this far into an expansion.  Despite the 

strengthening of the labor market, the measure of core inflation excluding volatile food and 

energy prices did not move up to 2 percent on a sustained basis until last year, and in the most 

recent reading, the 12-month change has moved down to 1.6 percent.  Other inflation measures 

paint a somewhat more reassuring picture.  The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean measure of inflation, 

which provides a different way to filter out idiosyncratic movements in various components of 

inflation, has increased 2 percent in the past 12 months, slightly higher than its level of 

1.9 percent for the two previous years.2   

The New Normal 

Since the Great Recession, there have been several changes in macroeconomic 

relationships, which I refer to as the new normal.3  Now is a good time to assess the 

characteristics of the new normal and what they mean for monetary policy.  The emerging 

contours of today’s new normal are defined by low sensitivity of inflation to changes in labor 

market slack, a low long-term neutral rate of interest, and low underlying trend inflation.  Let me 

take each in turn.   

In today’s new normal, price inflation has not moved up consistently as the labor market 

has strengthened considerably over the course of the long expansion.  This is what economists
