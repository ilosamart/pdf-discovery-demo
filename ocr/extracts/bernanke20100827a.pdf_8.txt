finances, rising incomes, and some easing of credit conditions will provide the basis for 

more-rapid growth in household spending next year.  

 Businesses’ investment in equipment and software should continue to grow at a 

healthy pace in the coming year, driven by rising demand for products and services, the 

continuing need to replace or update existing equipment, strong corporate balance sheets, 

and the low cost of financing, at least for those firms with access to public capital 

markets.  Rising sales and increased business confidence should also lead firms to expand 

payrolls.  However, investment in structures will likely remain weak.  On the fiscal front, 

state and local governments continue to be under pressure; but with tax receipts showing 

signs of recovery, their spending should decline less rapidly than it has in the past few 

years.  Federal fiscal stimulus seems set to continue to fade but likely not so quickly as to 

derail growth in coming quarters.   

Although output growth should be stronger next year, resource slack and 

unemployment seem likely to decline only slowly.  The prospect of high unemployment 

for a long period of time remains a central concern of policy.  Not only does high 

unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, impose heavy costs on the 

unemployed and their families and on society, but it also poses risks to the sustainability 

of the recovery itself through its effects on households’ incomes and confidence. 

Maintaining price stability is also a central concern of policy.  Recently, inflation 

has declined to a level that is slightly below that which FOMC participants view as most 

conducive to a healthy economy in the long run.  With inflation expectations reasonably 

stable and the economy growing, inflation should remain near current readings for some 

time before rising slowly toward levels more consistent with the Committee’s objectives.
