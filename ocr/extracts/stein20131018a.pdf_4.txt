across a range of markets, this school of thought is more open to working on multiple 

fronts and to formulating monetary policy with one eye on its potential implications for 

these imbalances.4   

 The debate between these three schools gets a lot of attention at venues like this 

one—and with good reason.  It touches on issues that are not only of policy interest, but 

also connect to deeper and strongly held views about how the world works.  In other 

words, this is paradigm-versus-paradigm stuff, which always helps to liven up an 

academic exchange.   

 But precisely for these reasons, the whole lean-versus-clean debate runs the risk 

of drawing attention away from other crisis-derived lessons that do not make as good 

fodder for academic discussion, but that are no less relevant from a practical policy 

perspective.  Let me focus the remainder of my remarks on one of these: the importance 

of the in-between.  The lean-versus-clean framing suggests a simple model in which there 

are just two dates: (1) an initial ex ante date that is prior to when a shock is realized—and 

when we may not even have much of a clue as to the form the shock will take—and (2) 

an ex post date when the shock has hit, its full effects have been felt, and policymakers 

are dealing with the aftermath.  But this before-and-after dichotomy is misleading.  Many 

                                                 
4 To be clear: Taking account of financial-stability considerations when formulating monetary policy can be 
fully consistent with the dual-mandate objectives of fostering full employment and price stability.   
Consider a traditional setting where the policymaker has a quadratic loss function over deviations of 
unemployment and inflation from their target levels.  Suppose further that high financial-sector leverage or 
very buoyant credit conditions today increase the probability of a sharp upward spike in credit spreads at 
some later date, and the latter prospect in turn raises the conditional variance of economic activity.  Then 
the policymaker’s risk aversion over unemployment outcomes may make her willing to try to tighten credit 
conditions, even at the cost of some employment today, so as to reduce the variance of future employment.  
In other words, financial-stability factors can weigh significantly in the decisionmaking process, without 
being an end objective in and of themselves.
