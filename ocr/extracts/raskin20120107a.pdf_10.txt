occur in a manner that permits an appropriate public evaluation.  There is currently a 

lively debate about the appropriateness and value of transparency regarding the 

regulatory remediation required by the enforcement actions entered into with the 14 

mortgage servicers.  The fact that this public debate is occurring is entirely appropriate, 

and underscores the importance that Americans place on enforcement in the mortgage 

servicing context. 

The cease and desist orders against the 14 large mortgage servicers are publicly 

available; they have been fully disclosed.  The corrective actions that the mortgage 

servicers are undertaking pursuant to the enforcement actions in an appropriate format 

also need to be shared with the public.  Not only is the public directly and significantly 

affected by how the acts of mortgage servicers have contributed to the state of the 

economy, but cities, neighborhoods, and communities have a direct and significant 

interest in the role that mortgage servicers play in the value of a homeowner’s 

investment. 

Conclusion 

Too many of the practices in the mortgage servicing industry have been 

developed and defended solely on the basis of “standard industry practice,” but many 

practices were not only standard, but shoddy.  This has proven true, I might add, on the 

underwriting and secondary-market sides of the business, and we are seeing courts reject 

many of those practices.   

 Appropriately tailored enforcement against these mortgage servicing practices is 

necessary as one way to rebuild an important sector of the housing market.  Accordingly, 

current deficiencies must be corrected.
