for a few years, and the spend-out from the recent budget agreement may occur with 

some delay.  A gradual pace is also warranted in light of the long period of undershooting 

the inflation target.   

I would not underestimate the challenge of calibrating monetary policy to sustain 

full employment and re-anchor trend inflation around 2 percent, while adjusting to 

sizable stimulus at a time when resource constraints are tightening and the economy is 

growing above trend.  I continue to view gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the 

appropriate path, although I will remain vigilant for the emergence of risks and prepared 

to adjust if conditions change.
