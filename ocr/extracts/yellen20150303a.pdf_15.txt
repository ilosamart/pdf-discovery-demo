We have a more consistent and industry-wide perspective on risks and 

vulnerabilities than we had prior to the crisis.  The focus on individual firms is still

with the FDIC on the orderly resolution of large institutions are reducing the problem of

institutions to make substantial progress in the coming months which will leave firms and 

the government better positioned to manage the failure of a large institution in an orderly 

way.13 

 The goal, through this and other actions I have described today, is to do whatever 

can be done to avert the dire threat and lasting damage of a severe financial crisis.  We

less damaging by limiting excessive risk-taking by firms we oversee and by helping 

ensure that the most systemically important firms are better prepared to weather a crisis.
