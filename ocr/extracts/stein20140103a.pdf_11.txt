lower rate of return on claims that can be made completely safe.  These latter safe claims 

can be interpreted as privately created money. 

Given these household preferences, the name of the game for financial 

intermediaries is to create as much in the way of safe money-like claims from each asset 

category i as possible.  And given the structure of the model, there are two distinct 

technologies for creating safe claims. 

The first technology we label “traditional banking.”  A traditional bank is 

relatively conservative in issuing safe claims.  In particular, for each dollar it holds of 

asset i, it issues zi of deposits and finances the rest with equity.  Since asset i always pays 

off at least zi, even in the worst-case scenario, a depositor in a traditional bank can sleep 

through whatever news comes in at time 1 and still be assured of having a safe claim.  In 

other words, a bank backs its deposits with enough capital so as to make these deposits 

safe over a two-period horizon and hence endogenously sticky; there is no reason for 

bank depositors ever to run at time 1.  Alternatively, one can think of the bank as having 

acquired deposit insurance--which allows depositors to sleep through time 1--and the 

deposit insurer as having imposed a capital requirement of (1- zi) on the bank so as to 

reduce its expected losses to zero. 

The second technology for creating safe claims we label “shadow banking.”  

Shadow banks are more aggressive:  They rely less on capital, and more on the exit 

option at time 1, to create safety for their investors.  Specifically, a shadow bank issues 

kiFi of short-term collateralized claims for each dollar of asset i it holds, where kiFi > zi.  

The way these claims are kept safe is that if there is bad news at time 1, the investors 

seize the collateral and dump it at the fire-sale price, realizing kiFi.  In other words, unlike
