for further improvement.  This roundtable is the first of several that the Federal Reserve 

System will host in the next several months to hear directly from bankers, community 

members, practitioners, researchers, and others about improving the CRA’s effectiveness 

in making credit available to lower-income areas.  We are inviting representatives of 

other banking regulatory agencies to join us so that we can all benefit from learning from 

different local experiences with the CRA.  Our hosts at the Reserve Banks will be taking 

notes, and a summary of the findings from this outreach initiative will be made public.  

Before we get started, I want to say a few words about the interagency process for 

revising CRA regulations and the Federal Reserve’s priorities.  As you know, the Office 

of the Comptroller of the Currency recently published an Advance Notice of Proposed 

Rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit public comment on a variety of questions related to 

revising CRA regulations.  Comments are due by November 19.   

Last week, the Board heard from members of the Fed’s Community Advisory 

Council that there may be some confusion about commenting on the ANPR because it 

was not published on an interagency basis.  Even though the Federal Reserve did not join 

in the publication of the ANPR, we will be reading the comment letters in anticipation of 

working with the Comptroller and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on a joint 

proposal.  We understand the importance of having the agencies work toward one set of 

CRA regulations that are clear and consistently applied and will do everything we can to 

make that possible.  CRA regulations are complicated, and the regulators will benefit 

from perspectives from a variety of channels, so I encourage you all to submit comments.  

The CRA is too important to the financial well-being of communities across this country 

for banks and community members to disengage in any part of this process.
