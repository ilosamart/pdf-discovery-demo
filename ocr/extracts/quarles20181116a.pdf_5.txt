stress test models and results, along with portfolios of hypothetical loans and associated 

loss rates.  I expect we will begin providing some of this additional detail starting in early 

2019.  I also expect the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and possible 

approaches to, gathering public input on scenarios and salient risks facing the banking 

system each year.  

Transparency matters not only because it provides additional due process to 

affected participants; it also creates an opportunity for broader, more insightful comments 

from the public.  As a result, it can allow us to be more nimble and better informed in our 

scenario design.  However, we want to maintain incentives for firms to conduct their own 

stress tests rigorously and thoughtfully, and avoid the risk that firms will use this new 

information to engage in transactions that are solely designed to reduce losses in the test 

without reducing actual risk.  Firms have indicated that additional disclosure about 

models would not affect their own stress tests.  We expect them to make good on that 

representation, as the Federal Reserve’s stress test is not, and cannot be, a full picture of a 

firm’s resiliency in light of its idiosyncratic risks.  We are confident that we can address 

these concerns through the regular examination process, by closely monitoring changes in 

firms’ portfolios and ensuring sufficient capital, controls, and governance in light of the 

risk characteristics of their activities. 

Qualitative Objection 

I also want to reiterate a point regarding the role of the qualitative objection.  The 

Federal Reserve eliminated this element of CCAR for large and noncomplex firms in 

2017, in part because of improvements in risk management at those firms.3  In my view, 

the time has come to normalize the CCAR qualitative assessment by removing the public 

objection tool, and continuing to evaluate firms’ stress testing practices through normal 

supervision.  While supervisory assessments would continue to center on a firm’s capital 

plan submissions, examination work would continue on a year-round basis, taking into 

account the firm’s management of other financial risks, and culminating in a rating of the 

firm’s capital position and planning.  Firms with deficient practices would receive 

                                                 
3 The capital planning evaluation remains as part of the normal supervisory process for these firms.
