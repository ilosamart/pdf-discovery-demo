 These observations raise the question of whether there are other tools that might 

be better suited to dealing with SFT-related fire-sales externalities.  I will touch briefly on 

three of these. 

1.  Capital surcharges 

In his May speech, Governor Tarullo alluded to the possibility of liquidity-linked 

capital surcharges that would effectively augment the existing regime of risk-based 

capital requirements.12  Depending on how these surcharges are structured, they could act 

in part as a tax on both the dealer-as-principal and dealer-as-intermediary types of SFTs.  

Accomplishing the latter would require a capital surcharge based on something like the 

aggregate size of the dealerâ€™s matched repo book; this comes quite close to the Pigouvian 

notion of directly taxing this specific activity.  As compared to relying on the leverage 

ratio to implement the tax, this approach has the advantage that it is more likely to treat 

institutions uniformly: the tax on SFTs would not be a function of the overall business 

model of a given firm, but rather just the characteristics of its SFT book.  This is because 

the surcharge is embedded into the existing risk-based capital regime, which should in 

principle be the constraint that binds for most firms.  

There are a couple of important qualifications, however.  First, going this route 

would involve a significant conceptual departure from the notion of capital as a 

prudential requirement at the firm level.  As noted previously, a large matched repo book 

may entail relatively little solvency or liquidity risk for the broker-dealer firm that 

intermediates this market. So, to the extent that one imposes a capital surcharge on the 

broker-dealer, one would be doing so with the express intention of creating a tax that is 

passed on to the downstream borrower (i.e., to the hedge fund, in my example).
