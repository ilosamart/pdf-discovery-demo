expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of 

such a pickup is highly uncertain.  Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers 

about the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that has occurred both at 

home and abroad.23  The strength of global growth will also have an important bearing on 

the neutral rate through both trade and financial channels, and here, too, the scope for 

surprises is considerable.  Finally, I would mention the potential for changes in fiscal 

policy to affect the economic outlook and the appropriate policy path.  At this point, 

however, the size, timing, and composition of such changes remain uncertain.24  

However, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few 

years will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one.  

                                                           
23 To sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth 
and the prospects for faster growth in the future, see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang (2015), 
Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming). 
24 A related source of uncertainty is the limited ability of economists to predict the effects of specific 
changes in tax policy or government spending on the overall economy.  In part, this uncertainty arises 
because the net effect depends to some extent on the response of financial markets; in addition, estimates 
vary considerably on the economic effects of changes in marginal tax rates or different types of spending.
