of quantitative effects or alternative views regarding the causal channels at work.4  

Furthermore, vulnerabilities from excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding 

in the financial sector grew rapidly through the middle of 2007, well after monetary 

policy had already tightened significantly relative to the accommodative policy stance of 

2003 and early 2004.  In my assessment, macroprudential policies, such as regulatory 

limits on leverage and short-term funding, as well as stronger underwriting standards, 

represent far more direct and likely more effective methods to address these 

vulnerabilities.5 

Recent International Experience 

Turning to recent experience outside the United States, a number of foreign 

economies have seen rapidly rising real estate prices, which has raised financial stability 

concerns despite, in some cases, high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to 

the central bank’s inflation target.6  These developments have prompted debate on how to

Financial Intermediation, vol. 19 (July), pp. 418-37; and Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2011), 
“Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Benjamin Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., 
Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3A (San Diego, Ca.:  Elsevier), pp. 601-50.  For a study 
emphasizing how changes in the response of monetary policy to financial vulnerabilities would likely 
change the relationship between monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities, see Oliver de Groot (2014),

5 This evidence and experience suggest that a reliance on monetary policy as a primary tool to address the 
broad range of vulnerabilities that emerged in the mid-2000s would have had uncertain and limited effects 
on risks to financial stability.  Such uncertainty does not imply that a modestly tighter monetary policy may 
not have been marginally helpful.  For example, some research suggests that financial imbalances that 
became apparent in the mid-2000s may have signaled a tighter labor market and more inflationary pressure 
than would have been perceived solely from labor market conditions and overall economic activity.  Hence, 
such financial imbalances may have called for a modestly tighter monetary policy through the traditional 
policy lens focused on inflationary pressure and economic slack.  See, for example, David M. Arseneau and
