While the recent trend of widening income and wealth inequality is clear, the 

implications for a particular family partly depend on whether that family’s living 

standards are rising or not as its relative position changes.  There have been some times 

of relative prosperity when income has grown for most households but inequality 

widened because the gains were proportionally larger for those at the top; widening 

inequality might not be as great a concern if living standards improve for most families.  

That was the case for much of the 1990s, when real incomes were rising for most 

households.  At other times, however, inequality has widened because income and wealth 

grew for those at the top and stagnated or fell for others.  And at still other times, 

inequality has widened when incomes were falling for most households, but the declines 

toward the bottom were proportionally larger.  Unfortunately, the past several decades of 

widening inequality has often involved stagnant or falling living standards for many 

families. 

Since the survey began in its current form in 1989, the SCF has shown a rise in 

the concentration of income in the top few percent of households, as shown in figure 1.6 

By definition, of course, the share of all income held by the rest, the vast majority of 

households, has fallen by the same amount.7  This concentration was the result of income 

and living standards rising much more quickly for those at the top.  After adjusting for 

                                                 
6 The share of income that went to the top 5 percent of households--a threshold of $230,000 in gross 

income in 2013--rose from 31 percent of income reported by all respondents in 1989 to 37 percent in 2007.  

The income share for this group fell in the financial crisis, to 34 percent in 2010, then rose in the recovery, 

regaining a 37 percent share in 2013. 
7 The top half of the distribution, except for the top 5 percent, earned 53 percent of all income in 1989 but 

only 51 percent in 2010. In 2013, households in the “next 45 percent” had incomes between $47,000 and 

$230,000.  While income has rebounded for the top 5 percent in the recovery, the share that went to the 

next 45 percent declined further to 49 percent in 2013.  The bottom half of the distribution saw their share 

of income fall from 16 percent in 1989 to 15 percent in 2007, edge up in 2010, and then reach a new low 

for the survey last year at 14 percent.
