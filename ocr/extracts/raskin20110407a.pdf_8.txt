day business of the bank.  A bank in which every employee understands his or her responsibility 

for managing risk is likely to be more sound than a bank in which risk management is always 

seen as someone else’s responsibility.   

While risk management starts at the business-line level, a well-run bank also has in place 

an effective program for enterprise-wide risk management that is supported by strong internal

separate risk management function, but that is not necessarily a problem if senior management 

and other key personnel establish a system of internal, independent checks and balances to 

ensure that risks are regularly identified, controlled or otherwise managed, and monitored.  These 

systems include not only core functions such as credit administration, effective reporting of 

information to senior management and the board, and policies and procedures that are 

documented and implemented, but also processes that try to look ahead to potential risks on the 

horizon.   

Another of the inner circles is a strong internal audit function that reviews the bank’s 

operations, risk management, and internal controls.  In particular, an effective internal audit

take seriously the importance of sound governance, business judgment, risk management, 

internal controls, and compliance.  Banking supervision provides another level of protection, but
