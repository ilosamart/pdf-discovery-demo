of this approach are less dramatic during a crisis, they are no less significant afterward.  

Entrenching too-big-to-fail status obviously risks imposing significant costs on the 

taxpayer.  It undermines market discipline, competitive equality among financial 

institutions of different sizes, and normal regulatory and supervisory expectations.  

The desirability of a third alternative to the Hobson’s choice of bailout or 

disorderly bankruptcy is obvious--hence the prominence during the regulatory reform 

debate of proposals for a special resolution process that would allow the government to 

wind down a systemically important firm in an orderly way while still imposing losses on 

shareholders and creditors.  The crisis has also focused attention on the special problems 

created by the failure of a large, internationally active financial firm.  In my remarks I 

will elaborate on the relationship between resolution regimes and an effective overall 

system of financial regulation and supervision, both in the international and domestic 

spheres.1  

At the risk of some oversimplification, I would state that relationship as follows:  

First, an effective domestic resolution process is a necessary complement to supervision 

that would bring more market discipline into the decisionmaking of large financial firms, 

their counterparties, and investors.  At the same time, even a well-designed resolution 

mechanism is no substitute for reformed regulatory rules and strengthened supervisory 

oversight. 

Second, the high legal and political hurdles to harmonized cross-border resolution 

processes suggest that, for the foreseeable future, the effectiveness of those processes will 

largely depend on supervisory requirements and cooperation undertaken before distress 

appears on the horizon.  I would further suggest that the importance of proposed
