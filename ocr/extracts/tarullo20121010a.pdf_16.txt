expected impact approach led to a fairly broad range of potential surcharges.  The 1-2 ½  percent 

amounts negotiated within the Basel Committee are at the low end of that range, reflecting a 

good deal of caution – frankly, a bit more caution than I think would have been desirable, even 

given the uncertainties.  Moreover, the Basel Committee decided to use “buckets,” grouping 

banks presenting roughly similar risks, rather than a customized calibration based on a single 

score.  Even though the Basel Committee does have an algorithm that produces such a score, it 

recognized that there is inevitably imprecision involved, and thus will look for obvious breaks in 

these scores in order to assign the banks to a limited number of buckets carrying differing capital 

surcharges.30 

Financial Stability Analysis in Merger Applications 

The second interpretive challenge, which I will address in more detail, arises from the 

addition of a financial stability factor to the review conducted by the Federal Reserve Board of 

proposed mergers and acquisitions involving banks and bank holding companies.31  In some 

respects, this process resembles the pre-merger reviews conducted by the antitrust agencies 

under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.  But the differences are also instructive.  One is that under the 

Bank Holding Company Act, the impact of a transaction on financial stability is not itself 

dispositive.  The Board could approve an acquisition even if it determined that there was some 

adverse effect on financial stability if it also determined that the transaction would produce 

benefits outweighing the financial stability concerns by, for example, increasing competition or 

efficiencies or public convenience.  This balancing requirement contrasts with an antitrust pre-

merger review, in which the focus is solely on whether the transaction would substantially lessen 

competition.32  The statutory formulation appears to reflect a Congressional supposition that, like 

many social desiderata, the pursuit of financial stability may at times require trade-offs with
