Lessons from Crises, 1985-
2014 
 
Fischer, 2014 (SIEPR)1 
 
S1. Fiscal policy also matters 
macroeconomically. 
 
S2. Reaching the zero lower 
bound is not the end of 
expansionary monetary policy. 
 
S3. The critical importance of 
having a strong and robust 
financial system. 
 
S4. The strategy of going fast 
on bank restructuring and corp 
debt restructuring is much better 
than regulatory forbearance. 
 
S5. It is critical to develop now 
the tools needed to deal with 
potential future crises without 
injecting public funds. 
 
S6. The need for 
macroprudential supervision. 
 
S7. The best time to deal with 
moral hazard is in designing the 
system, not in the midst of a 
crisis. 
 
S8. Don’t overestimate the 
benefits of waiting for the 
situation to clarify. 
 
S9. Never forget the eternal 
verities---lessons from the IMF. 
 
S10. “Never say never.”

10 Tentative Conclusions from 
the Past 3 Years 
 
Fischer, 1999 (IMF)3 
 
F1: It is very difficult to predict 
an economic crisis. 
 
F2: It is hard to get countries to 
act even when you do see a 
crisis coming. 
 
F3: It is hard to have a program 
implemented when the 
government you are dealing 
with is divided and weak, and, 
accordingly, it is difficult to 
decide whether to help. 
 
F4: There is little understanding 
of the IMF’s system of internal 
governance and accountability 
to its member governments. 
 
F5: Keynesianism is alive. 
 
F6: The strategy of going fast on 
bank restructuring and corp debt 
restructuring is much better than 
regulatory forbearance. 
 
F7:  Pegged exchange rate 
systems are crisis prone; crisis 
is more likely avoided if the rate 
floats. 
  
F8: Globalization is here to stay. 
 
F9:  The need to involve the 
private sector in the solution of 
international crises is probably 
the most difficult issue in the 
international financial 
architecture. 
 
F10:  The IMF is here to stay.
