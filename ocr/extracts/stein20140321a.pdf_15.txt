services.  Alternatively, a similar mechanism may play out with open-end bond funds, 

whereby losses cause large outflows of assets under management, again compromising 

the intermediation function and aggregate credit supply.21     

Conclusion 

To restate my main point, I believe that measures of bond market risk premiums--

for example, estimates of the expected excess returns on long-term Treasury securities 

relative to Treasury bills and on credit-risky bonds relative to Treasury securities--may 

turn out to be useful inputs into the monetary policy framework.  These variables have 

the potential to serve as simple proxies for a particular sort of financial market 

vulnerability that may not be easily addressed by supervision and regulation.  Again, 

however, let me emphasize the conjectural nature of these remarks.  Even if this broad 

way of thinking about the problem turns out to be useful, there is a ways to go--in terms 

of modeling and calibration--before it can be used to make quantitative statements.  Thus, 

at this early stage, I would not want to claim that one is likely to get policy prescriptions 

that differ significantly from those of our standard models.  We will have to do the work 

and see what emerges. 

Finally, a more general theme that has been lurking in the background here is the 

sharp difference in perspective that subfields of economics sometimes bring to a given 

question.  As I noted earlier, one of the central and most widely shared ideas in the 

academic finance literature is the importance of time variation in the risk premiums (or 

expected returns) on a wide range of assets.  At the same time, canonical macro models in 

the New Keynesian genre of the sort that are often used to inform monetary policy tend to 

                                                 
21 Basset and others (2014) document that changes in the EBP are associated with significant changes in 
bank lending standards, which suggests a broader pullback in the credit intermediation process.
