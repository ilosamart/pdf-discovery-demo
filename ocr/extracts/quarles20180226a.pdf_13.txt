in the economyâ€™s productive capacity, either through increased labor force participation 

or higher productivity growth, is likely to impart less upward pressure on prices.   

I will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and 

assessing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against the constraints of 

the economy, as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraints and 

the growth of the potential output of the economy.  

At our January meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target range for the 

federal funds rate between 1-1/4 and 1-1/2 percent.13  In this range, monetary policy 

remains accommodative.  With my current economic outlook, I anticipate that further 

gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor 

market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective.  Of course, as I mentioned, 

I will keep a close eye on economic indicators--and their implications for the outlook for 

inflation and real activity--and adjust my views on the appropriate monetary policy 

accordingly.
