economies.  Some emerging market economies do not have the infrastructure to support a 

fully convertible, internationally traded currency and to allow unrestricted capital flows.  

Moreover, the internal rebalancing associated with exchange rate appreciation--that is, 

the shifting of resources and productive capacity from production for external markets to 

production for the domestic market--takes time. 

That said, in the short term, rebalancing economic growth between the advanced 

and emerging market economies should remain a common objective, as a two-speed 

global recovery may not be sustainable.  Appropriately accommodative policies in the 

advanced economies help rather hinder this process.  But the rebalancing of growth 

would also be facilitated if fast-growing countries, especially those with large current 

account surpluses, would take action to reduce their surpluses, while slow-growing 

countries, especially those with large current account deficits, take parallel actions to 

reduce those deficits.  Some shift of demand from surplus to deficit countries, which 

could be compensated for if necessary by actions to strengthen domestic demand in the 

surplus countries, would accomplish two objectives.  First, it would be a down payment 

toward global rebalancing of trade and current accounts, an essential outcome for long-

run economic and financial stability.  Second, improving the trade balances of slow-

growing countries would help them grow more quickly, perhaps reducing the need for 

accommodative policies in those countries while enhancing the sustainability of the 

global recovery.  Unfortunately, so long as exchange rate adjustment is incomplete and 

global growth prospects are markedly uneven, the problem of excessively strong capital 

inflows to emerging markets may persist.
