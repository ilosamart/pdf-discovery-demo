With regard to balance sheet normalization, the FOMC has indicated that it does 

not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities.  When the time comes, we plan

liftoff is only the start of the process of normalization, and, going forward, the FOMC 

will once again be changing the federal funds rate as necessary, both up and down.  

Accordingly, discussion of monetary policy needs to begin to shift to the future path of
