747, were enormous.  These waves vastly expanded the range of available products and 

the efficiency with which they could be produced.  Indeed, according to the best available 

data, output per person in the United States increased by approximately 30 times between 

1700 and 1970 or so, growth that has resulted in multiple transformations of our economy 

and society.1  History suggests that economic prospects during the coming decades 

depend on whether the most recent revolution, the IT revolution, has economic effects of 

similar scale and scope as the previous two.  But will it?   

I must report that not everyone thinks so.  Indeed, some knowledgeable observers 

have recently made the case that the IT revolution, as important as it surely is, likely will 

not generate the transformative economic effects that flowed from the earlier 

technological revolutions.2  As a result, these observers argue, economic growth and 

change in coming decades likely will be noticeably slower than the pace to which 

Americans have become accustomed.  Such an outcome would have important social and 

political--as well as economic--consequences for our country and the world. 

This provocative assessment of our economic future has attracted plenty of 

attention among economists and others as well.  Does it make sense?  Here’s one way to 

think more concretely about the argument that the pessimists are making:  Fifty years 

ago, in 1963, I was a nine-year-old growing up in a middle-class home in a small town in 

South Carolina.  As a way of getting a handle on the recent pace of economic change, it’s
