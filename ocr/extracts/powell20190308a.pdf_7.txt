ELB or about the gradual pace at which that rate would return to more normal levels.  We 

removed the last elements of this crisis-era guidance in January.5  The federal funds rate 

is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate--the interest rate that tends 

neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy.  Committee participants generally agree 

that this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum 

employment and price stability.  Future adjustments will depend on what incoming data 

tell us about the baseline outlook and risks to that outlook. 

Policy communication will not simply revert to the ways of the early 2000s, 

however, for transparency advances have continued apace since then.  The most 

significant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that, since January 2012, 

the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included federal 

funds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future--often referred to as the 

“dot plot.”  Returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the FOMC’s 

postmeeting statement presents a challenge, for the dot plot has, on occasion, been a 

source of confusion.  Until now, forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool 

for communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion.  

For example, in early 2014, the Committee’s intentions were at odds with a 

common misreading of the dots, and Chair Yellen explained, “[O]ne should not look to 

the dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the Committee wants to or is 

speaking about policy to the public at large.  The FOMC statement is the device that the 

                                                 
5 Of course, “patience” as used in the January FOMC statement (see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130a.htm) might be seen as 
forward guidance.  This type of guidance was used at times before the crisis and may play a role in the 
future.  It is not, however, the explicit guidance about the medium-term level or direction of rates that 
distinguished the crisis-era guidance.
