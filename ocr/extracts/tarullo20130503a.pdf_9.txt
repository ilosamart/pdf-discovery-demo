Gaps in Regulatory Reform 

Despite this considerable progress, we have not yet adequately addressed all the 

vulnerabilities that developed in our financial system in the decades preceding the crisis.  

Most importantly, relatively little has been done to change the structure of wholesale 

funding markets so as to make them less susceptible to damaging runs.  It is true that 

some of the clearly risky forms of wholesale funding that existed before the crisis, such 

as the infamous SIVs, have disappeared or substantially contracted.  But significant 

continuing vulnerability remains, particularly in those funding channels that can be 

grouped under the heading of securities financing transactions (SFTs).

Repo, reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities margin 

lending are part of the healthy functioning of the securities market.  But, in the absence of 

sensible regulation, they are also potentially associated with the dynamic I described 

earlier of exogenous shocks to asset values leading to an adverse feedback loop of mark-

to-market losses, margin calls, and fire sales.  Indeed, some have argued that this 

dynamic is exacerbated by a “maturity rat race,” in which each creditor acts to shorten the 

maturity of its lending so as to facilitate quick and easy flight, and in which creditors pay 

relatively little attention to the recovery value of the underlying assets.

 For these reasons, there has been an instinct to address various aspects of wholesale funding discretely.  

Hence the attention paid by the Federal Reserve and other regulators to money market funds, and the steps 

taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce the risks associated with the extension of intraday credit by clearing 

banks in triparty repo funding markets.  These discrete steps are useful, particularly insofar as they cast 

light on implicit, but unpriced, support for short-term funding that has been provided by some financial 

intermediaries.  But they do not address head-on the dynamic described in the text.
