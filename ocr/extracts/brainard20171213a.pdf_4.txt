Workforce Development 

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is one of the facilitators of the Leading 

the Way campaign.  The Federal Reserve System has a long-standing interest in 

understanding labor market dynamics and promoting workforce development 

opportunities. Programs like this help workers prepare for jobs and help firms invest in 

workforce development.  Together, these efforts help make the economy more productive 

and help us achieve our goal of maximum employment.  In addition to the Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York’s efforts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is learning 

about labor markets in small industrial cities through their Working Cities Challenge and 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has focused on the importance of infrastructure 

including broadband for economic inclusion.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has 

been a leader within the Federal Reserve System in establishing the Investing in 

America’s Workforce Initiative, an effort across the Federal Reserve System to reframe 

training expenditures as investments in human capital rather than costs.  In October, 

Atlanta established the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity to focus on 

employment policies and labor market issues that affect low- and moderate-income
