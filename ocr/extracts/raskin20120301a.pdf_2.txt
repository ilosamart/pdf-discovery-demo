Good morning.  I appreciate this opportunity to meet with you today.  

I am pleased to see that my parents are in the audience.  I credit my parents with a 

lot, especially with promoting a strong work ethic in our family that taught us the 

fundamentals of a market economy.  From a tender age, my brother and I had a series of 

unusual jobs.  For example, Kenneth gave French horn lessons.  He was  about 13 years 

old at the time, so our parents would not permit him to charge more than $1.25 per hour.  

Kenneth had four students.  My mother permitted him to use the living room for lessons, 

as long as his students took off their muddy shoes at the door, so Kenneth had no 

overhead expenses and was both grossing and netting about $5.00 per week.  Given the 

scarcity of French horn teachers in our neighborhood, Kenneth had a monopoly in the 

French horn market.  So long as the local high school bands produced a steady stream of 

French horn players, Kenneth was assured that his services would be in demand.    

I had an even less lucrative job that involved truly unskilled labor.  I numbered 

pages.  My father, who was in the publishing business, would, in the days before word 

processing, bring home book manuscripts that did not have page numbers on them.  

These manuscripts needed to be numbered, and thatâ€™s where I entered the market, so to 

speak.  My father came up with the idea of paying me to number the manuscript pages.  

The rate he set for me was one cent--and that was not one cent per page, but one cent per 

two pages.  Needless to say, this wage was really too low for me, and I wanted to go on 

strike, but I was only 10 years old.  By the time I became a teenager, and it occurred to 

me that I could strike, I had been displaced by the progress of technology--specifically, 

word processors with automatic numbering options--which reduced my bargaining power
