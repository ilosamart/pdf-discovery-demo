I want to thank Neel Kashkari for launching the Opportunity and Inclusive 

Growth Institute and for inviting me to join the deliberations of this distinguished group 

today.  This new Institute is another great example of how individual Reserve Banks are 

taking the initiative in illuminating key dimensions of our work and shaping the agenda 

of the Federal Reserve System.1   

While it has long been understood that opportunity is central to the strength of 

America’s social fabric, it is now increasingly clear that opportunity and inclusion are 

central to the strength of America’s economy.  I will touch on the key ways that 

opportunity and inclusion matter for policymaking at the Federal Reserve, ranging from 

our dual-mandate goal of maximum employment to our monitoring of household 

financial health to our engagement in low- and moderate-income communities all over 

the country.  I will focus on how our work intersects with the groundbreaking work of the 

accomplished group of researchers assembled here.   

In the original design of the Federal Reserve, it was recognized that the American 

economy is not monolithic; that is why the Congress created our system of 12 Federal 

Reserve Districts.  We are present in communities all across America through our 

Reserve Banks and Branches and their boards and advisory councils.  This local 

presence, by design, gives us valuable perspectives on how Americans are experiencing 

the economy in different communities around the country and critical insights about the 

varied challenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers.  In turn, our local engagement 

                                                 
I am grateful to David Buchholz, Jeff Larrimore, Amanda Roberts, Claudia Sahm, and Jenny Schuetz for 
their assistance in preparing this text.
