 From a macroprudential perspective, the use of a common scenario allows us to 

learn how a particular risk or combination of risks might affect the banking system as a 

whole--not just individual institutions.  This experience with stress testing has indeed 

been very useful for our efforts to better monitor and evaluate potential systemic risks.  

For example, in our macroprudential work, as in our stress tests, we tend to rely on 

horizontal examinations and comparative studies, as opposed to firm-by-firm 

assessments; we use multidisciplinary, specialized teams to supplement the work of on-

site examiners; and we have increased our use of modeling and quantitative methods, 

using data drawn from different institutions and time periods.  All of these features are 

apparent in the workings of our Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, 

which provides coordinated oversight of the supervision of systemically important firms.  

We have also extended the lessons of systemwide stress testing to analysis of factors 

other than capital:  For example, we recently completed a horizontal review of liquidity 

positions and liquidity risk-management practices at some of the largest CCAR firms.  

Like the CCAR review of capital planning, this review was a multidisciplinary effort that 

used quantitative information--in this case, detailed data on firms’ liquidity positions--as 

well as qualitative information on liquidity risk-management practices. 

Notwithstanding the demonstrated benefits of comprehensive stress testing, this 

evolving tool also presents challenges.  For example, even as we continue to explore 

ways to enhance the transparency of the models we use to estimate banks’ projected 

revenues and losses, we have chosen not to publish the full specification of these models.  

As a result, we hear criticism from bankers that our models are a “black box,” which 

frustrates their efforts to anticipate our supervisory findings.  We agree that banks should
