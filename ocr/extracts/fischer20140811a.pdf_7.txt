automatic stabilizers, such as declines in tax revenues and increases in unemployment 

benefits, that tend to accompany a downturn in activity.  In addition, discretionary fiscal 

policy actions typically boost growth in the years just after a recession.  In the U.S., as 

well as in other countries--especially in Europe--fiscal policy was typically expansionary 

during the recent recession and early in the recovery, but discretionary fiscal policy 

shifted relatively fast from expansionary to contractionary as the recovery progressed.  In 

the United States, at the federal level, the end of the payroll tax cut, the sequestration, the 

squeeze on discretionary spending from budget caps, and the declines in defense 

spending have all curtailed economic growth.  Last year, for example, the Congressional 

Budget Office estimated that fiscal headwinds slowed the pace of real GDP growth in 

2013 by about 1-1/2 percentage points relative to what it would have been otherwise.  

Moreover, state and local governments, facing balanced budget requirements, have 

responded to the large and sustained decline in their revenues owing to the deep recession 

and slow recovery by reducing their purchases of real goods and services.  Job cuts at 

federal, state, and local governments have reduced payrolls by almost 3/4 of a million 

workers, resulting in a decline in total government civilian employment of 3-1/4 percent 

since its peak in early 2009.7  The fiscal adjustments of the last few years have reduced 

the federal government deficit to an expected level of 3 percent of GDP in 2014 and 

fiscal drag over the next few years is likely to be relatively low.  

A third headwind slowing the U.S. recovery has been unexpectedly slow global 

growth, which reduced export demand.  Over the past several years, a number of our key 

                                                 
7 None of this is to deny that it was necessary to reduce the large fiscal deficits in many countries that 

resulted from the combined effects of the recession and of expansionary fiscal policies at the early stages of 

the crisis; it simply reaffirms that the short-run impacts of contractionary fiscal policies are contractionary.
