to show up in the path for the federal funds rate that each individual sees as appropriate to 

achieve those objectives.15 

In preparing for FOMC meetings, policymakers routinely review alternative 

policy paths prescribed by several simple policy rules that are in wide usage.16  Decades 

of research have produced many variations of these rules, which are typically derived 

from differing but valid insights and which yield different rate paths.  For example, 

economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly update on the Bank’s 

website an analysis of seven different rules and their prescriptions.17 

A good way to see the range of possibilities is through a generalized form of a 

Taylor-type rule (figure 6).18  As you can see, this rule is based on key factors for 

monetary policy, such as the neutral real rate of interest, or r*, and deviations of inflation 

and output or unemployment from their longer-run values.  While these are often called 

“simple” rules, application of a rule requires a significant number of important choices.  

It is necessary to pick a value or a path for r*.  The rule also calls for an estimate of the 

output or unemployment rate gap.  There is particularly high uncertainty about measuring 

the deviation of output from its potential; our real-time estimates of this gap are often 

                                                 
15 The SEP is not a “consensus” forecast of the Committee, and the interest rate projections in the SEP are 
each individual participant’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Thus, the Committee’s forward-
looking approach to policymaking is not the same as the forecast-targeting approach advocated by 
Svensson (2005) and others.  See Lars E.O. Svensson (2005), “Monetary Policy with Judgment:  Forecast 
Targeting,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 1 (June), pp. 1-54.
