I wish to thank the New America Foundation, the Center for Financial Security, 

and the Congressional Savings and Ownership Caucus for the invitation to speak at this 

important conference addressing the savings and credit needs of Americans as our 

economy recovers.  It is a pleasure to be here with you today.   

As the mother of three teenagers who are struggling toward adulthood--always 

two steps forward and one step back, or perhaps a couple steps sideways--I inevitably 

think about economic inclusion from the standpoint of young people entering the 

workforce and the adult economy.  And so I ask myself: What does it mean for them to 

be included in the economy? 

Well, obviously I want them to be able to find satisfying, meaningful, and 

decently compensated work.  Surely this is as much a marker of the transition to 

adulthood in our society as registering to vote or earning the all-important driver’s 

license.  We might say that we are not truly included in the economy until we draw our 

first paycheck.  One of the tragedies of our current lingering recession is that so many 

young Americans have not been able to experience the thrilling rite of passage that comes 

with finding a stable and decent-paying job.  And, of course, even beyond the young, 

there are millions of Americans stuck in unemployment lines desperate to find a way 

back into the productive economy.   

The question of employment is not our focus today, but we should pause to 

underscore the promotion-of-maximum-employment imperative of the Federal Reserve’s 

dual mandate.  I believe that this imperative has broad importance in American social and 

economic life.
