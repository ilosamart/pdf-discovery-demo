this theory, repeated market surprises that raise questions about the central bank’s 

reaction function could threaten to disrupt the relationship between the central bank and 

the markets, making the central bank’s job more difficult in the future.3 

How can the Fed avoid surprising markets?  Clear communication of the Federal 

Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) views on the economic outlook and the likely 

evolution of policy is essential in managing the market’s expectations.  The Committee 

has a number of communication outlets, including the policy statement, the Chair’s news 

conference, and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  The SEP in particular has 

been useful in providing information on policymakers’ assessments of the potential 

growth rate of the economy and r*, the equilibrium real interest rate, both of which help 

guide the market’s expectations of the eventual path of policy. 

However, avoiding unintended market reactions has not always been easy.  The 

example that immediately comes to mind is the taper tantrum of mid-2013.  To recap, 

over the course of May and June in 2013, the yield on 10-year Treasury securities 

increased almost 1 percentage point amid increased market discussion of the eventual 

tapering of Fed asset purchases and some key communications on the topic (figure 1).4  

In particular, the 10-year yield rose about 10 basis points after then Chairman Bernanke 

discussed tapering in public for the first time during the question-and-answer session of 

his Joint Economic Committee testimony on May 22, commenting that the FOMC could 

                                                 
3 Historically, there have been times when central banks have preferred to surprise markets--most notably, 
when changing the value of exchange rate pegs during the era of fixed exchanges.  Indicating that a change 
in the peg was coming would invite an immediate run on the currency, at a significant cost to the central 
bank’s foreign reserves--even in economies with extensive capital controls.     
4 Also notably, Eurodollar futures rates and OIS (overnight index swap) forward rates for intermediate 
horizons rose sharply, likely in part because some investors who were surprised by the tapering news also 
revised their expectations about the path of the policy rate.
