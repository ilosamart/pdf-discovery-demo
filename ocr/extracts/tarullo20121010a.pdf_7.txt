 The third use of financial stability in Dodd-Frank is as a direct legal standard for the 

exercise of a regulatory authority, as opposed to my first category of Dodd-Frank provisions, 

which simply cite financial stability concerns as a motivation for a regulatory or supervisory 

program.  To date, the most conspicuous of this type of provision have been the authorities 

granted the FSOC to designate nonbank financial companies and financial market utilities as 

“systemically important.”  The first of these authorities is directed at financial firms that are not 

bank holding companies, and thus not subject to capital requirements and other parts of the 

holding company regulatory regime.  This authority is a direct response to experience in the 

financial crisis.  During 2008, serious problems at AIG and the five so-called “free-standing” 

investment banks – that is, firms not part of a bank holding company – contributed substantially 

to the severe stress in the financial system, with the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 

igniting the most acute phase of the crisis. 

The standard to be applied by the FSOC is whether “material financial distress at the U.S. 

nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, 

or mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the 

financial stability of the United States.”12  There follows a lengthy list of “considerations” to be 

taken into account by the FSOC.  However, particularly insofar as the last of these is “any other 

risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate,”13 the list does not provide extensive 

guidance for the FSOC in applying the basic standard.  Any companies so designated by the 

FSOC will be subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve, as well as to the special Section 165 

prudential standards I mentioned earlier.  To date, no firms have been designated, though the 

FSOC is actively considering possible designees.  Of course, the five previously free-standing 

investment banks have either been dismantled (Lehman), converted into bank holding companies
