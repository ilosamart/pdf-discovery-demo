particularly large in China, India, and Singapore.  Monetary policy was also eased 

substantially throughout emerging Asia.  

Partly as a result of those policy measures, the growth of the emerging Asian 

economies over the past several years appears to have relied less on external demand 

from the advanced economies.  The top panel of exhibit 4 shows that the shares of 

exports in nominal GDP in the Asian economies have trended downwards since 2006 

following a decade of solid increases.  However, trade balances in the region (shown in 

the bottom panel of the exhibit) generally remain in surplus, notwithstanding some recent 

narrowing in several countries.  These surpluses suggest that, on balance, the Asian 

economies continue to add more to global supply than to global demand.   

Crucially, private consumption as a share of output still remains quite low in 

several emerging Asian economies.  Exhibit 5 shows that Chinaâ€™s consumption share--the 

solid line--which was already well below that of other major economies in 2000, has 

fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of its GDP.

shares in other emerging Asian economies--the dashed line--are also significantly below 

those in the advanced economies--the dotted line--and have not moved up in the wake of 

the global financial crisis.   

Measures to boost private consumption would appear to benefit not only the 

global economy, but also the emerging Asian economies themselves.  China and other 

emerging market economies have already taken some steps to promote household 

consumption, but the progress on this front has been slow and further measures are 

warranted.  Indeed, at the G-20 Cannes summit, China pledged to rebalance its demand 

                                                 
2 Output per capita has been growing very rapidly in China, so per capita consumption has also been rising.
