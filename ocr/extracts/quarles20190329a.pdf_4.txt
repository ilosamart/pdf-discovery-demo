and I expect continued gains supported by profit growth, continuing impetus from 

incentives in the tax bill, and a generally favorable business environment.     

Most important, I have been encouraged by the recent step-up in labor 

productivity growth.  Last year’s increase of almost 2 percent marked the strongest 

growth since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis and was well above the 

1 percent pace that prevailed in the preceding five years.  I think there are many reasons 

to believe that this faster productivity growth could be persistent.  My expectation for 

further increases in capital spending is one.  For another, it could be that tight labor 

markets have played a role in boosting labor productivity growth as employers work to 

increase efficiency as new workers become harder to find.   

Turning to inflation, given the volatility and idiosyncrasies of the data, I view the 

current reading on core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, at 

1.8 percent, as being roughly consistent with our 2 percent objective.  Overall, inflation 

pressures are muted.  But I do not believe that the seeming unresponsiveness of inflation 

to the apparent tightness of the labor market and other aspects of the economy tells the 

whole story in evaluating slack versus constraint in the economy.  Of the many 

explanations for this phenomenon that have been offered, one possibility that we have to 

keep in mind is that inflation has remained stable precisely because of the public’s 

confidence that the Fed will maintain a framework that keeps the economy from 

overheating and inflation from rising significantly above the 2 percent benchmark.  

Inflation could then for some time remain quite stable in the face of an economy running 

hot.  But if public confidence began to erode because of Fed inaction, a possible 

consequence could be the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, rather than a gradual
