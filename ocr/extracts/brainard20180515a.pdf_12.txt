Some of these approaches involve encrypting data on the ledger so that the ledgers can still be 

copied across all the nodes in the network, but an entity cannot look at any element of that ledger 

except for transactions in which it has been involved.  Other approaches include so-called zero-

knowledge proofs or ring signatures that allow entities to validate transactions without seeing 

confidential information.  Still others are looking at platforms that connect multiple ledgers 

rather than having one single ledger that is copied across all nodes in the network.  While 

questions remain about the usefulness and viability of each of these approaches, it is important to 

underscore that preserving confidentiality is an important area of research. 

Finally, perhaps the biggest potential benefit for payments, clearing, and settlement of 

distributed ledger technology may be resiliency.  Distributed ledger technology may enable a 

network to continue to operate even if some of the nodes on the network are compromised  

because of the ability of the other nodes in the network to pick up the slack and continue 

processing transactions.  One challenge going forward will be to understand the implications that 

the confidentiality tools and different approaches to consensus under consideration may have on 

the resilience of the distributed ledger.  Given that resiliency is a key potential benefit of 

distributed ledger technology over existing platforms, it is critical to understand the trade-offs 

between resiliency and a consensus method that focuses on operational speed, or between 

resilience and confidentiality.   

Conclusion 

It is an exciting time for the financial sector as digital innovations are challenging 

conventional thinking about currency, money, and payments.  Cryptocurrencies are strikingly 

innovative but also pose challenges associated with speculative dynamics, investor and consumer 

protections, and money-laundering risks.  Although central bank digital currencies may be able
