What will happen with the price of oil?  The uncertainties are sizable, and progress 

toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will 

depend on how these uncertainties evolve.  Indeed, the policy path that my colleagues 

and I judge most likely to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability 

has evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that alter our 

economic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook.    

The Current Economic Situation 

The economic expansion following the Great Recession has now been under way 

for seven years.  The recovery has not always been smooth, but overall, the gains have 

been impressive.  In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I 

believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market 

since the recession.   

I will turn to this past Friday’s labor market report in a moment, but let me begin 

with some background:  The economy added 2.7 million jobs last year, an average of 

about 230,000 a month.  In the first three months of this year, payrolls were growing only 

modestly slower, at a little less than a 200,000 monthly pace.  The unemployment rate 

had fallen to 5 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009.  In addition, the Bureau 

of Labor Statistics’ measure of the job openings rate was at a record high in March, and 

the quits rate--the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs--has moved up and in 

March stood close to its pre-recession levels.1  The increase in the quits rate is a sign that 

workers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more 

job offers.   

                                                 
1 Note, however, that the help-wanted index published by the Conference Board suggests that the rate of 
job openings has been about flat over the past year.
