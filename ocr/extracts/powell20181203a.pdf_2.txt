Thank you, Anna.  It’s an honor to be part of this important occasion.  Tonight is an 

opportunity to recognize the vital contributions of the Federal Reserve’s community 

development staff, and an opportunity to honor Chair Yellen, who did so much to advance the 

Fed’s community development mission.  

Briefly, I would like to focus on the importance of promoting a strong economy that 

extends opportunity to all and on the role our community development staff plays to advance that 

goal. 

The Federal Reserve’s mission is to promote a strong economy and sound financial 

system; I am glad to say we have made a great deal of progress toward those goals.  

Unemployment is 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century.  Over 17 million jobs have 

been created during this expansion, with an additional 250,000 created in October. 

Beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength.  The steady decline 

in the unemployment rate is mirrored by the decline in financial hardship reported by 

respondents to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking over 

the past five years.1  Wage gains, increased household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence 

are supporting robust consumer spending.  Since the crisis, we have also taken numerous steps to 

make the financial system safer and stronger, leaving it better equipped to support the financial 

needs of consumers and communities through good times and bad.2
