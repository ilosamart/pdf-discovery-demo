behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than 

would be indicated by the current unemployment rate.   

There are three reasons, however, why we should be cautious in drawing such a 

conclusion.  First, the sluggish pace of nominal and real wage growth in recent years may 

reflect the phenomenon of “pent-up wage deflation.”15  The evidence suggests that many 

firms faced significant constraints in lowering compensation during the recession and the 

earlier part of the recovery because of “downward nominal wage rigidity”--namely, an 

inability or unwillingness on the part of firms to cut nominal wages.  To the extent that 

firms faced limits in reducing real and nominal wages when the labor market was 

exceptionally weak, they may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract 

qualified workers.  As a result, wages might rise relatively slowly as the labor market 

strengthens.  If pent-up wage deflation is holding down wage growth, the current very 

moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack.  

Further, wages could begin to rise at a noticeably more rapid pace once pent-up wage 

deflation has been absorbed.  

Second, wage developments reflect not only cyclical but also secular trends that 

have likely affected the evolution of labor’s share of income in recent years.  As I noted, 

real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor 

costs have been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to 

accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure.  

However, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect
