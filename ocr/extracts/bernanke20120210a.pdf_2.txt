The economic recovery began more than two years ago, but it doesn’t feel like 

much of a recovery for many Americans--certainly for those of you who depend on the 

housing sector for your living, as well as for the millions of others who have seen their 

home values plummet or lost their homes through foreclosure.  Though some progress 

has been made in reversing the losses in jobs and income sustained during the recession, 

the pace of expansion has been frustratingly slow and the unemployment rate remains 

very high by historical standards.  The state of the housing sector has been a key 

impediment to a faster recovery.  In the typical economic recovery, a resurgent housing 

sector helps fuel reemployment and rising incomes.  But as you know all too well, that 

scenario has not played out this time.  Although the precipitous declines in construction 

that began in 2006 are, thankfully, now behind us, homebuilding remains depressed in 

most areas, relative both to where it was before the downturn and to where it will need to 

be to meet the needs of a growing population in the longer term.   

The Federal Reserve has a keen interest in the state of housing and has been 

actively engaged in analyzing the housing and mortgage markets.

  Issues related to the 

housing market and housing finance are important factors in the Federal Reserve’s 

various roles in formulating monetary policy, regulating banks, and protecting consumers 

of financial services.  Traditionally, mortgage interest rates have been a key transmission

 These remarks draw heavily on research conducted by Federal Reserve staff, including work presented in 

the white paper on the U.S. housing market that was transmitted to the Congress in January (see Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “The U.S. Housing Market:  Current Conditions and 

Policy Considerations,” white paper  (Washington:  Board of Governors, January), 

http://federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-20120104.pdf) and in a 

publication on real estate owned and vacant properties (see Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and 

Cleveland and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), REO and Vacant Properties:  

Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization, report (Washington:  Board of Governors, September),
