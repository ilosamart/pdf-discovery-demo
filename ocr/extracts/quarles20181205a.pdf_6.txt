outweighing the sharper losses during the recession and since 2000 has grown about 20 percent 

faster in the West than in the rest of the country.  

This picture of the West leading the nation in economic growth is also reflected in 

population, a key factor in that growth.  From 2010 to 2017, the population of the West increased 

7.4 percent, compared to 5.3 percent for the nation.7  One might guess that this strong growth is 

primarily in cities, and in fact reflects the drain of population from smaller towns that is reported 

to be happening all over the United States.  But in fact, population gains in the West are quite 

well balanced between cities and towns, and smaller towns are doing better in the West than 

elsewhere in holding and even increasing their populations.   

In the cities of the West, those communities of 50,000 or more, the population grew 7.8 

percent from 2010 to 2017, eclipsed by the 10 percent growth in southern cities but well above 

the 2 percent to 3 percent increase in the cities of the Northeast and Midwest.8  At the same time, 

the West led the other regions of the United States in growth for towns and cities from 10,000 to 

50,000 in size, and likewise for towns between 5,000 and 10,000.    

Now let’s look at small towns, those with 5,000 or fewer residents.  It is this cohort of 

towns and their people that to my mind is really the essence of rural America.  There is a 

widespread impression that small towns all over America are shrinking and that population is 

shifting to larger towns and cities, and that is the story we can see in much of the regional data.  

From 2010 to 2017, the average small town shrank by 2 percent in the Northeast, by 1.4 percent 

in the Midwest, and only grew 1.3 percent in the South, while larger towns and cities grew 

substantially faster there and elsewhere.
