loans have significantly reduced both the size and duration of their leveraged loan 

commitments (figure 13).  Thus, they are not exposed to the large “pipeline risk” they 

faced as the crisis broke.  In addition, banks now routinely limit their risk by including 

“flex” provisions that, among other things, enable them to increase the interest rate on a 

loan offered for sale by 150 basis points or more, at the borrower’s expense.  So far, we 

have not seen the very large transactions of the pre-crisis period.  In these and other 

respects, the leveraged finance markets have evolved, probably because of supervision as 

well as lessons learned by the banks themselves.  Given these changes, banks at the core 

of our financial system seem less likely to experience stress should conditions in 

leveraged lending deteriorate.  Of course, the guidance now stands in the way of a return 

to pre-crisis conditions. 

Let’s now step back from the leveraged loan market to ask the broader question of 

how supervisors should address a clear deterioration of credit market conditions.  I will 

consider three factors that are often discussed in considering the broader question of 

when and how to intervene in the credit markets to promote financial stability through 

institution-specific supervisory policy.14 

First, do conditions present a threat to the safety and soundness of financial 

institutions at the core of the system?   

14 This approach is consistent with the financial stability framework in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), 
and emphasizes the importance of leverage, maturity transformation, and common risks and behaviors in 
the financial system that can amplify credit losses and harm the real economy.  See Tobias Adrian, Daniel 
Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2013), “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and Economics Discussion
