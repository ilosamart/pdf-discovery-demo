for, and its own interest in, ensuring that its exit does not disrupt the market.  Indeed, JPMC will 

itself need to rely on these services going forward.  The timeline set for a gradual transition over 

the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations; however, if unexpected 

complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted.  

  In the near term, this exit will leave BNYM as the sole provider of U.S. government 

securities settlement and triparty repo services for broker-dealers.  We have been working 

intensively with BNYM in anticipation of this transition.  We have long recognized that any 

disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial 

stability, and have calibrated our supervisory expectations accordingly.  To ensure financial 

stability, we expect the provision of U.S. government securities settlement services to be robust 

in nearly all contingencies. 

  As BNYM becomes the sole provider, we will raise our expectations even higher.  The 

bank has anticipated and welcomed this higher bar.  BNYM is one of 8 U.S.-based systemically 

important banks.  The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements 

and a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical 

services even in the event of a default.   

   BNYM is unique in that it also plays the dominant – and soon the sole – role in 

government securities settlement and in the triparty repo market.  These activities are comparable 

in their importance to those of the financial market utilities that have been designated as 

systemically important by the FSOC.  Thus, BNYM will continue to be held to the high 

standards to which all U.S. bank SIFIs are held.  And it will also be expected to operate in a 

manner that provides confidence that it is as resilient and robust as a systemically important 

financial market utility (FMU).  Such FMUs are, of course, held to the Principles for Financial
