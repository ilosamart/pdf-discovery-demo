funding.  Indeed, even the FSB proposal does not extend to SFTs backed by government 

collateral, a very important source of short-term wholesale funds. 

Asset management activities have commanded considerable attention lately, both 

internationally at the FSB and domestically at the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  

The asset management industry has grown rapidly since the financial crisis, both in terms of the 

dollar amount of assets under management and in the concentration of assets managed by the 

largest firms.  These trends may well continue as stricter prudential regulation makes investment 

in certain forms of assets more costly for banks.  To the extent that asset management vehicles 

hold relatively less liquid assets but provide investors the right to redeem their interests on short 

notice, there is a risk that in periods of stress, investor redemptions could exhaust available 

liquidity.  Under some circumstances, a fund might respond by rapidly selling assets, with 

resulting contagion effects on other holders of similar assets and, to the degree they had not 

already been subject to redemption pressures, other asset management vehicles holding those 

assets.  The use of leverage by investment funds, including through derivatives transactions, 

could create interconnectedness risks between funds and key market intermediaries and amplify 

the risk of such firesales. 

 Considerable work is needed, first, to develop better data on assets under management, 

liquidity, and leverage, in order to fill the information gaps that have concerned so many 

academics and policy analysts.  Then there is more work to be done in assessing the magnitude 

of liquidity and redemption risks, including the degree to which those risks vary with the type of 

assets and fund structure.  And finally, we will need tools that will be efficient and effective 

responses to the risks identified.
