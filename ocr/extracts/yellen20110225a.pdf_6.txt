might well be sufficient to facilitate an outward shift in the expected path of the funds 

rate, just as we saw over the course of last year.   

If financial market participants appeared to be expecting policy firming to begin 

somewhat sooner than policymakers considered desirable or appropriate under such 

circumstances, the language of the forward guidance could be adjusted to shift 

expectations toward the somewhat longer horizon over which the Committee expected 

the federal funds rate to remain extraordinarily low.  Figure 3 illustrates the potential for 

such a change in forward guidance to support economic activity.   In the left panel, the 

dashed line denotes the baseline path for the federal funds rate as embedded in current 

financial market data, while the solid line corresponds to an alternative path in which the 

initiation of policy firming is postponed by one year.  If policymakers viewed that 

alternative path as appropriate and market participants came to share that view, then 

financial conditions would become significantly more accommodative, even in the 

absence of any change in the current level of the funds rate.  As shown in the right panel, 

a simulation of the FRB/US model--a macroeconometric model developed and 

maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--indicates that such a shift in policy 

expectations would be associated with a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate 

(solid line) and a somewhat higher path of core inflation (dashed line) over coming years. 

The Effectiveness of Asset Purchases 

I will now turn to an assessment of the FOMCâ€™s program of longer-term securities 

purchases.  Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that asset prices and yields are 

affected not only by current securities purchases but also, importantly, by market 

expectations concerning future FOMC securities holdings.  This observation implies that
