in certain emerging markets.  That said, other factors appear to have been even more 

important.  Moreover, expansionary monetary policies in the advanced economies have 

supported global growth to the benefit of advanced and emerging economies alike. 

Turning to the risks and policy challenges going forward, much attention has 

focused on potential effects in EMEs when recovery prompts the United States and other 

advanced economies to begin the gradual process of returning policy to a normal stance.  

As events over the summer demonstrated, even the discussion of such a policy shift may 

be accompanied by considerable volatility. 

As shown in chart 8, from May through August, U.S. Treasury yields rose 

substantially as market participants reassessed the future course of U.S. monetary policy.  

In response, EME bond and equity funds experienced very large outflows, as shown by 

the bars.  EME yields rose as well, in some cases by more than those on Treasury 

securities, and many EME currencies depreciated.  The magnitude of these market 

responses may have been amplified by the carry-trade strategies that many investors had 

in place; these strategies were designed to take advantage of interest rate differentials and 

appeared profitable as long as EME interest rate differentials remained wide and EME 

exchange rates remained stable or were expected to appreciate.  When anticipations of 

Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades

exchange rates and asset prices.   

These developments, however, do not appear to have been driven solely by
