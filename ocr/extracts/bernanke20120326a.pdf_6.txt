The Change in Unemployment and Economic Growth:  A Puzzle? 

What will lead to more hiring and, consequently, further declines in 

unemployment?  The short answer is more-rapid economic growth.  Indeed, the 

improvement in the labor market over the past year--especially the decline in the 

unemployment rate--has been faster than might have been expected, given that the 

economy during that time appears to have grown at a relatively modest pace.  About 

50 years ago, the economist and presidential adviser Arthur Okun identified a rule of 

thumb that has come to be known as Okun’s law.  That rule of thumb describes the 

observed relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the growth rate of 

real gross domestic product (GDP).  Okun noted that, because of ongoing increases in the 

size of the labor force and in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rate 

of growth of its potential is normally required just to hold the unemployment rate steady.  

To reduce the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must grow at a pace above its 

potential.  More specifically, according to currently accepted versions of Okun’s law, to 

achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the course of a year, 

real GDP must grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than the rate of growth of 

potential GDP over that period.  So, for illustration, if the potential rate of GDP growth is 

2 percent, Okun’s law says that GDP must grow at about a 4 percent rate for one year to 

achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment. 

 In light of this historical regularity, the combination of relatively modest GDP 

growth with the more substantial improvement in the labor market over the past year is 

something of a puzzle.  Resolving this puzzle could give us important insight into how 

the economy is likely to evolve.  To illustrate the tension, consider the relationship
