requirements generally applicable to banking organizations, G-M propose that NFBs would issue 

capital notes that are debt-like except in periods of stress, when they would convert to equity.  In 

essence, all of an NFB’s capital would be contingent capital.  While contingent capital is an item 

on the financial regulatory agenda, it is considered a possible supplement to common equity, not 

a substitute for it.  In this respect, the G-M proposal moves in the opposite direction from Basel 

III, which has followed markets in making common equity the centerpiece of capital evaluation 

and requirements.5 

These inconsistencies with current law and practice in the G-M proposal do not 

themselves argue against its soundness.  They do, however, underscore the degree to which the 

NFBs would require development of a new financial regulatory approach, as well as a 

restructuring of the ABS and repo markets.   

More generally, the existence of costs or problems does not counsel the rejection of the 

proposal as such.  In the face of very real flaws in the pre-crisis state of these markets, and the 

failure of some ABS markets to recover, even where it seems they could function sensibly, there 

is a very good case for a policy initiative.  So let me consider briefly whether variants on the 

basic G-M approach might retain its core benefits while addressing some of its potential 

problems. 

One possibility would be to broaden the permissible ownership of NFBs to include bank 

holding companies.  This modification would make the most sense if one believed that the basic 

G-M approach was promising but that the risks of either an untenable business model or high 

industry concentration, and consequent anti-competitive effects, were high.  It is possible that a 

number of large, diversified financial holding companies would find an NFB a viable part of 

their operations.  G-M require that NFBs be stand-alone entities, and specifically prohibit
