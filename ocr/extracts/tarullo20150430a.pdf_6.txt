to time, hear complaints from community bankers that supervisory practice may not always be 

consistent across Reserve Banks.  To some degree, of course, this is an inevitable byproduct of 

an approach that leans toward bottom-up supervision.  Nonetheless, our staff at the Board will 

continue to assess practices across all the Reserve Bank districts to promote overall consistency 

without micromanaging the supervision of individual banks.  And I want to emphasize that, if 

community bankers believe that significant variation in certain practices or policies is having an 

unfair or deleterious effect on one or more of their banks, they should feel more than comfortable 

raising these concerns with Board staff.  We do not regard such observations as criticism of our 

examiners, but instead as opportunities to test, and possibly adjust, our policies to promote 

overall consistency.  

A third way in which our community bank supervision differs from that of other banks is 

the particular effort made to limit the length of examinations and the amount of time bank 

personnel must spend on them.  Community banks have much smaller balance sheets over which 

to amortize the resources they spend on regulatory and supervisory requirements.  Of late, we 

have increased off-site supervisory activities, which can reduce the burden on community bank 

personnel.  For example, we can conduct some aspects of the loan review process off site for 

banks that maintain electronic loan records.  While off-site loan review has burden-reducing 

benefits for both bankers and examiners, some bankers have expressed concern that increasing 

off-site supervisory activities could potentially reduce the ability of banks to have face-to-face 

discussions with examiners regarding asset quality or risk-management issues.  Accordingly, we 

remain flexible and will continue to work with community banks that may prefer their loan 

reviews to be conducted on site.
