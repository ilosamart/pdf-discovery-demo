Under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting 

central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that 

many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as 

“bygones.”  This means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls 

with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation 

trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target).  Central banks are generally 

believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the 

ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely.  Persistent inflation 

shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored 

or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 

In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup” 

strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation 

deviations from target.  Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a 

multiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the 

price level around a constant growth path.18  These strategies could be implemented 

                                                 
17 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be 
insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB.  For related discussions, see Reifschneider 
and Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016). 
18 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB 
entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion.  Nessén and 
Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting.  There 
is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.  Central banks 
that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon—
typically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run”—without regard to past inflation deviations.  
One exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of  
“2–3 per cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history 
dependence.  However, Ruge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is 
comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation 
goal.  The only known historical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933 
when the country abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level.  The 
temporary adoption of price-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome 
that contrasted with that in countries that stayed on the gold standard.  See Berg and Jonung (1999).
