banks and in comparable ways between U.S. banking organizations and foreign banking 

organizations.  As with domestic firms subject to enhanced prudential standards, the Federal 

Reserve would work to ensure that the new regime is minimally disruptive, through transition 

periods and other means.   

An IHC structure would also provide the Federal Reserve, as umbrella supervisor of the 

U.S. operations of foreign banks, with a uniform platform to implement a consistent supervisory 

program across large foreign banks.  In the case of foreign banks with the largest U.S. 

operations, the IHC would also help mitigate resolution difficulties by providing U.S. regulators 

with one consolidated U.S. legal entity to place into receivership under title II of the Dodd-Frank 

Act if the failure of the foreign bank would threaten U.S. financial stability.  Branches and 

agencies would remain separate, but all other entities would be included.  Further, an IHC 

structure would facilitate a consistent U.S. capital regime for bank and nonbank activities of 

foreign banks under the IHC, similar to the approach taken in other jurisdictions, such as the 

United Kingdom and some continental European countries.   

Some observers will, I am sure, ask if it is necessary to depart from the prevailing firm-

by-firm approach to foreign banking regulation and to adopt generally applicable requirements in 

implementing the Dodd-Frank enhanced prudential standards for foreign banks.  It is difficult to 

see how reliance on this approach can be effective in addressing risks to U.S. financial stability, 

at least in the absence of extraterritorial application of our own standards and supervision, and 

perhaps not even then.  We would, at a minimum, need to make regular and detailed assessments 

of each firmâ€™s home-country regulatory and resolution regimes, the financial stability risk posed 

by each firm in the United States, and the financial condition of the consolidated banking 

organization.  In fact, such an approach might result in the worst of both worlds--an ongoing
