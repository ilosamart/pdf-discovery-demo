monetary policy.  This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of 

monetary policy is an important input into the policy decision.  If, for example, incoming 

data in the months ahead were to reveal that inflation and inflation expectations are 

running higher than projected at present and in ways that are inconsistent with our 2 

percent objective, then I would be receptive to increasing the policy rate by more than I 

currently expect will be necessary.  Data dependence in this sense is easy to understand, 

as it is of the type implied by a large family of policy rules in which the parameters of the 

economy are known.5 

But what if key parameters that describe the long-run destination of the economy 

are unknown?  This is indeed the relevant case that the FOMC and other monetary 

policymakers face in practice.  The two most important unknown parameters needed to 

conduct--and communicate--monetary policy are the rate of unemployment consistent 

with maximum employment, u*, and the riskless real rate of interest consistent with price 

stability, r*.  As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should, I believe, be data 

dependent in a second sense:  that incoming data can reveal at each FOMC meeting 

signals that will enable it to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best 

estimate of where the economy is heading.6  And, indeed, as indicated by the SEP,

“Monetary Policy Principles and Practice” available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-principles-and-practice.htm for a 
discussion of the policy rate paths implied by five different policy rules using parameter values typically 
assumed in the literature. 
6 If the economy can be described by a linear model in which the only two unknown parameters are r* and 
u* and the shocks that hit the economy are normal, Kalman filtering can be used to derive a closed form 
mathematical expression for how to update one’s estimate of r* and u* as new macro data arrive.  But, in 
practice, “the” model of the economy is neither known, nor linear, and the shocks that strike it are not 
normal.  Thus, monetary policy in practice is, of necessity, as much or more an art than a science.
