surveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip survey, and the Survey of Primary Dealers, have 

largely moved sideways in the past year or two.  Taken together, these results suggest 

that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified.  Nevertheless, the 

decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong.  If 

so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a 

more accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.8   

Despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to 

consider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will 

return to our 2 percent objective.  Economic growth here and abroad could turn out to be 

stronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise 

as well as fall.  More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from 

perfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than 

expected over the next several years.  For these reasons, we must continue to monitor 

incoming wage and price data carefully. 

Monetary Policy Implications 

Let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the 

baseline outlook and associated risks.   

                                                 
readings on shorter-term expectations may also be influenced by current gasoline prices.  Moreover, 
readings from this survey are only available since 2013, making it difficult to determine the significance of 
these results. 
8 Another risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably since the turn of the 
year, is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with 
inflation stabilizing at 2 percent.  Currently, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate is 
4.8 percent.  However, this longer-run rate cannot be estimated precisely, and so it could be appreciably 
higher or lower--although given low readings on wages in recent years, I think the latter possibility is more 
likely than the former.  If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the 
labor market, drive faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective.
