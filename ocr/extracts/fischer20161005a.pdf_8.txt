dampen their propensity to invest in physical capital.12  At the same time, households 

might see the slower pace of technological innovation as reducing their future income 

prospects, which could increase their propensity to save.  If persistent, this slowing in the 

growth rate of potential GDP--and the resulting combination of lower investment and 

higher saving propensities--would put downward pressure on the natural rate of interest.  

More generally, any persistent factors that affect saving and investment decisions 

will also affect the natural rate.  Recent studies point to trends that may have had a 

sizable and lasting effect on the balance between saving and investment at the macro 

level.13  Some of these trends may have worked more directly on the demand for 

investment goods, whereas others may have had a more direct bearing on saving.  

Potential factors that others have mentioned as having contributed to reduced investment 

in physical capital include heightened economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the Great 

Recession and the lower physical capital needs of many of todayâ€™s growing firms, 

particularly information technology firms.14  On the saving side, some researchers have 

noted that high saving rates in some emerging market countries, combined with a lack of 

suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, may have put downward 

pressure on interest rates in advanced economies.15  Others have raised the possibility 

                                                 
12 A lasting slowing in the pace of technological innovation may also help explain the significant decline in 
the past 10 years in the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP), the portion of productivity that is not 
accounted for by measurable inputs to production--see Fischer (2016).  The available data suggest that, 
compared with reduced business investment, the decline in TFP growth accounts for a larger share of the 
slowing in the growth rate of potential GDP in recent years and, thus, may also be an important factor 
behind the decline in the natural rate of interest.
