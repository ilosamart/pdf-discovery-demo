I am delighted to participate in this Brimmer Policy Forum, not least because this 

year marks the 45th anniversary of Andrew’s appointment by President Johnson as a 

Governor of the Federal Reserve Board.  Andrew’s ongoing work in organizing this 

annual forum reflects his long-standing commitment to fostering economic analysis and 

public discourse on key policy issues.   

In my remarks today, I will discuss the rationale for the decision by the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) in November to initiate a new program of asset 

purchases, and I will address some frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding the 

program’s economic and financial effects both here and abroad.1  The purpose of the new 

asset purchase program, like all of the monetary policy actions taken by the FOMC since 

the onset of the global financial crisis, is to fulfill our congressionally mandated 

objectives of promoting maximum employment and price stability.  In pursuit of these 

goals, the FOMC brought the target federal funds rate down close to zero by late 2008; 

conducted large-scale purchases of longer-term securities during 2009 and early 2010; 

and, last summer, modified its reinvestment policy to keep the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet from shrinking as mortgage-related securities matured or were redeemed.  In early 

November, the Committee announced that it intends to purchase an additional 

$600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year.
