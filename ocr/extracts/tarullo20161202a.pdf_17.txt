in the future and, as I have explained at some length elsewhere, continued attention to such 

activities will be needed.18 

Turning now to an agenda for rationalizing what has already been done, I will not attempt 

to lay out a list of appropriate measures so much as to suggest some key considerations in 

forming such an agenda.   

First, it is critical that we not forget our still quite recent history.  Earlier in this talk I 

recounted the origins and effects of the financial crisis as a reminder as to why we now have the 

stronger capital requirements and other measures I have described.  There is surely a need to 

review over time the changes that have been implemented to assess how much additional 

stability we have gained and at what cost.  As we gain experience with the statutory and 

regulatory measures that have been implemented, we have begun assessments of the efficacy and 

efficiency of these measures.  Thus, for example, we are proposing to remove the qualitative 

assessment exercise in CCAR for most firms with less than $250 billion in assets.19  As part of 

our continuing examination of changes in market liquidity in the post-crisis period, we are 

assessing whether refinements might usefully be made in any of the regulations that have 

generally had beneficial effects in containing excessive and unsustainable liquidity.  And as part 

of our efforts to tailor our regulations according to the business models of firms, we are 

considering ways to address the special issues posed for the large custody banks by certain 

elements of our regulatory framework.  But in considering these and other changes, we will not 

weaken the essential elements of the existing regime that guard against another financial crisis.
