lax, at best, in the years before the peak in house prices.  However, the extraordinarily 

tight standards that currently prevail reflect, in part, new obstacles that inhibit lending 

even to creditworthy borrowers.  These tight standards can take many forms, including 

stricter underwriting, higher fees and interest rates, more stringent documentation 

requirements, larger required down payments, stricter appraisal standards, and fewer 

available mortgage products.  This tightening in mortgage credit can be seen in the 

increase in the credit scores associated with newly originated prime and Federal 

Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage originations (charts 28 and 29), which 

suggests that borrowers who likely had access to mortgage credit a few years ago are 

now essentially excluded from the mortgage market. 

Tight standards are an obstacle to mortgage refinancing as well.  The credit 

scores on new refinancings have risen in line with the credit scores on home purchase 

loans.  Low or negative home equity presents an additional barrier to refinancing, with 

perhaps only about half of homeowners who could profitably refinance having the 

equity and creditworthiness needed to qualify for traditional refinancing.  Although 

government programs have facilitated refinancing for many borrowers, many others 

have still not benefited from the low levels of interest rates. 

 Surprisingly, this tightness persists even when guarantees from the government-

sponsored enterprises (GSEs) or the FHA are available to shield lenders from credit 

risk.  Estimates by Federal Reserve staff suggest that less than half of lenders currently 

offer purchase mortgages to borrowers whose credit metrics fall into the lower range 

of GSE purchase parameters (chart 30).  Lenders reportedly attribute this hesitancy to 

concerns about the high cost of servicing in the event of loan delinquency, and to fears
