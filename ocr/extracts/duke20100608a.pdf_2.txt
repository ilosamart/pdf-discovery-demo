 Good morning.  I am pleased to be here today to address the Consumer Bankers 

Association’s Annual Conference.  Many of you may know that I spent most of my career as a 

banker.  Some of you also know that I spent two weeks a year for many years with the CBA 

Graduate School of Retail Bank Management teaching bank management concepts to mid-career 

bankers who specialized in providing financial services to consumers.  One of the best tools I 

ever found for teaching adults was a simulation exercise.  In the retail banking simulation 

developed for CBA, students compete by making the decisions that comprise a retail strategy—

choosing customer segments, designing products and prices, and establishing a distribution 

network.  The computer model calculates market share using a series of demand curves derived 

from actual consumer surveys and observed behavior, then applies pricing decisions and 

standard cost tables to construct profitability.  All of this number crunching takes place in the 

context of an assumed economic and regulatory environment.   

Of course, the credibility of a simulation exercise comes from its similarity to real world 

conditions that students have experienced.  As I thought about this speech, it occurred to me that 

if I had tried to simulate an environment in which interest rates dropped from more than 5 

percent to near zero in 16 months, unemployment went to 10 percent, housing prices dropped 

nearly 30 percent, mortgage delinquencies hovered around 10 percent, and credit card loss rates 

went over 10 percent, nobody would have believed it.  But that is exactly the environment that 

lenders have experienced in the last two years, and it has been the environment that I, and my 

fellow policymakers, have faced during my entire time at the Federal Reserve.  And I never got a 

chance to practice first in a simulation. 

 Consumers were at the very center of the recent crisis.  And consumers were the focus of 

Federal Reserve actions as we fought the crisis—lowering interest rates to stimulate economic
