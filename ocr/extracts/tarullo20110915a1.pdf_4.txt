shares and sustained positive economic profits, a fact not always reflected in financial analysis 

and regulation.  Yet IO economists, who have studied a variety of topics arising from 

concentrated market structures, have themselves generally focused on areas other than financial 

markets, with the important but limited exception of competition issues in commercial banking.  

I would venture to guess that the very peculiarities of financial markets that motivated the 

evolution of an entire subdiscipline in economics complicate application of conventional IO 

learning to these markets.  This is why I believe that some interchange between IO and finance 

researchers is important.   

While much of the interchange I have in mind will simply add nuance to existing work, 

we must recognize that some earlier findings about optimal market structure or regulatory policy 

may not hold once researchers incorporate systemic risk considerations into normative standards 

about what constitutes an efficient outcome.  As specific regulatory proposals or acquisitions are 

considered, we may well identify tensions between the traditional IO approach to antitrust and 

regulation, on the one hand, and the goal of maintaining the stability of the financial system, on 

the other. 

In the remainder of this talk, I will discuss three topics from the IO literature that seem 

promising for systemic risk research:  first, the need for a deeper understanding of scale and 

scope economies in the production of financial services; second, the ways in which patterns of 

competition and cooperation among large financial firms can affect systemic risk; and third, how 

market structure can affect firm incentives and thereby impose externalities on the financial 

system.
