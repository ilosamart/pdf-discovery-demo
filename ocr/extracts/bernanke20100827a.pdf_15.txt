stance--and thereby helping to anchor inflation expectations--the Committee increases its 

own flexibility to use securities purchases to provide additional accommodation, should 

conditions warrant. 

 A second policy option for the FOMC would be to ease financial conditions 

through its communication, for example, by modifying its post-meeting statement.  As I 

noted, the statement currently reflects the FOMC’s anticipation that exceptionally low 

rates will be warranted “for an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions.  A 

step the Committee could consider, if conditions called for it, would be to modify the 

language in the statement to communicate to investors that it anticipates keeping the 

target for the federal funds rate low for a longer period than is currently priced in 

markets.  Such a change would presumably lower longer-term rates by an amount related 

to the revision in policy expectations.  

Central banks around the world have used a variety of methods to provide future 

guidance on rates.  For example, in April 2009, the Bank of Canada committed to 

maintain a low policy rate until a specific time, namely, the end of the second quarter of 

2010, conditional on the inflation outlook.4

                                                      
4 In April 2010, the Bank of Canada removed the conditional commitment from its statement, and in June 
2010, the Bank raised its policy rate and announced a return to its normal operating framework for the 
overnight rate. 

  Although this approach seemed to work well 

in Canada, committing to keep the policy rate fixed for a specific period carries the risk 

that market participants may not fully appreciate that any such commitment must 

ultimately be conditional on how the economy evolves (as the Bank of Canada was 

careful to state).  An alternative communication strategy is for the central bank to 

explicitly tie its future actions to specific developments in the economy.  For example, in 

March 2001, the Bank of Japan committed to maintaining its policy rate at zero until
