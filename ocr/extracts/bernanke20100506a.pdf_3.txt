fall of 2008.  But confidence in banks remained tenuous in early 2009.  In markets, this 

unease had driven up credit spreads on corporate bonds issued by banks, impaired banksâ€™ 

access to short-term funding, and depressed values of bank equities.   

Importantly, the concerns about banking institutions arose not only because 

market participants expected steep losses on banking assets, but also because the range of 

uncertainty surrounding estimated loss rates, and thus future earnings, was exceptionally 

wide.  The stress assessment was designed both to ensure that banks would have enough 

capital in the face of potentially large losses and to reduce the uncertainty about potential 

losses and earnings prospects.  To achieve these objectives, for each banking organization 

included in the SCAP, supervisors estimated potential losses for each major category of 

assets, as well as revenue expectations, under a worse-than-expected macroeconomic 

scenario for 2009 and 2010.  Importantly, the SCAP was not a solvency test; rather, the 

exercise was intended to determine whether the tested firms would have sufficient capital 

remaining to continue lending if their losses were larger than expected.  The assessment 

included all domestic bank holding companies with at least $100 billion in assets at the 

end of 2008--19 firms collectively representing about two-thirds of U.S. banking assets. 

The SCAP represented an extraordinary effort on the part of Federal Reserve staff 

and the staff of the other banking agencies.  In a relatively short time, the supervisors had 

to gather and evaluate an enormous amount of information.  Extensive back-and-forth 

with the banks was necessary to ensure that the information provided was comparable 

and complete.  Moreover, to achieve the greatest possible consistency of results across 

institutions, supervisors supplemented judgmental assessments by banks and examiners 

with objective, model-based estimates for losses and revenues that could be applied
