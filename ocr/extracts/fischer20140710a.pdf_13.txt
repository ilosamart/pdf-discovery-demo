is a conflict between cautious risk management by the lenders and the desire of society to 

house its people decently.   

Third, there is generally a need for coordination among several regulators and 

authorities in dealing with macroprudential problems of both types.  

There are many models of regulatory coordination, but I shall focus on only two: 

the British and the American.  As is well known, the United Kingdom has reformed 

financial sector regulation and supervision by setting up a Financial Policy Committee 

(FPC), located in the Bank of England; the major reforms in the United States were 

introduced through the Dodd-Frank Act, which set up a coordinating committee among 

the major regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). 

In discussing these two approaches, I draw on a recent speech by the person best 

able to speak about the two systems from close-up, Don Kohn.22  Kohn sets out the 

following requirements for successful macroprudential supervision: to be able to identify 

risks to financial stability, to be willing and able to act on these risks in a timely fashion, 

to be able to interact productively with the microprudential and monetary policy 

authorities, and to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed actions appropriately.   

Kohn’s cautiously stated bottom line is that the FPC is well structured to meet these 

requirements, and that the FSOC is not.  In particular, the FPC has the legal power to 

impose policy changes on regulators, and the FSOC does not, for it is mostly a 

coordinating body.
