great professors.  And I also met the many outstanding students who were there at the 

time, among them Robert Merton.  I took courses from Samuelson and Solow and other 

MIT stars, and I wrote my thesis under the guidance of Paul Samuelson and Frank Fisher.  

From there, my first job was at the University of Chicago--and I understood that I was 

very lucky to have been able to learn from the great economists at both MIT and 

Chicago.  Among the many things I learned at Chicago was a Milton Friedman saying:  

“Man may not be rational, but he’s a great rationalizer,” which is a quote that often 

comes to mind when listening to stock market analysts.   

After four years at Chicago, I returned to the MIT Department of Economics, and 

thought that I would never leave--even more so when MIT succeeded in persuading Rudi 

Dornbusch, whom I had met when he was a student at Chicago, to move to MIT--thus 

giving him too the benefit of having learned his economics at both Chicago and MIT, and 

giving MIT the pleasure and benefit of having added a superb economist and human 

being to the collection of such people already present. 

MIT was still heavily involved in developing growth theory at the time I was a 

Ph.D. student there, from 1966 to 1969.  We students were made aware of Kaldor’s 

stylized facts about the process of growth, presented in his 1957 article “A Model of 

Economic Growth.”  They were: 

1. The shares of national income received by labor and capital are roughly 

constant over long periods of time. 

2. The rate of growth of the capital stock per worker is roughly constant over 

long periods of time.
