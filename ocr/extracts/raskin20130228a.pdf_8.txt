In other words, compressed net interest margins mean that many banks may look to new 

fee-generating products and trading activity to enhance profits.  The pressure to generate 

enhanced profits through high fees is palpable, and banks may choose to move aggressively 

down these paths.  But when a bank already suffers from a poor reputation--either deservedly or 

as a knock-on effect of broader discontent with the financial industry--it likely will face 

difficulties in introducing new fee-generating products or activities without inviting further 

criticism and damage to its reputation.  So an evaluation of the effects of the new product or 

activity on the bank’s reputation prior to launch is arguably necessary.   

Reputational Risk and Supervision 

The effects of the financial crisis, combined with the power of the Internet to broadly and 

quickly publicize information--whether factually accurate or not--should alert banks to how they 

are managing their reputations.  And supervisors have a duty to see that all risks are fully 

understood, even those risks that, like reputational risk, are unquantifiable or have not fully 

emerged.  I believe this is an area where supervision can add value.  To the extent possible, 

supervision can unveil hidden loss exposures that may be building up through the accumulation 

of reputational risk elements.  If we were better able to identify and monitor such free-floating 

risk, and in so doing, to push bank boards of directors and senior management to pay more 

attention to reputational risk, we could help reduce the underpricing of these risks. 

Many have argued, and I think it’s a compelling argument, that ineffective supervision 

and enforcement of existing laws and regulations contributed to the financial crisis.  By 

tolerating reduced transparency of risk in balance sheets and in complex institutional portfolios, 

as well as arbitrage around capital requirements and other prudential measures, supervision may 

have encouraged the underpricing of risk.  And the sudden correction of this underpricing of
