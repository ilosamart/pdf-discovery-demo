disclosing supervisory information in a moment.  As to disclosures bv firms themselves, the 

opaque nature of parts of a financial institution's balance sheet makes special disclosure 

requirements especially important.  There is, for example, a good case to be made for enhancing 

the Basel II requirements for disclosures relevant to a firm's internal ratings system, consistent 

with the protection of genuinely proprietary information.  On the other hand, there is little 

point--and the potential for considerable unnecessary cost--in compelling disclosure of massive 

amounts of information that cannot be effectively assimilated by investors and counterparties.  

We invite suggestions from investors such as yourselves as to the kind and form of disclosures 

that will be most useful. 

Incorporating the Public Into the Regulatory System 

As noted earlier, the financial regulatory system needs to be not only multifaceted, but 

also adaptive in responding to changes in financial firms and markets.  A dynamic regulatory 

regime is most likely to be realized if it receives non-governmental perspectives on these 

changes.  In addition to disclosing more data to investors and counterparties, exposing 

supervisory practices and policies to external assessment in a structured way can improve 

supervision.  Such exposure could, for example, reduce the chances of regulators converging 

around a conventional wisdom that overlooks anomalous data. 

One means for furthering this aim was suggested by our experience with the Supervisory 

Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) last year.  As you recall, the stress tests--as they have been 

popularly called--were a stringent, forward-looking assessment of prospective losses and 

revenues at the 19 largest U.S. regulated financial institutions.  We took the unusual, if not
