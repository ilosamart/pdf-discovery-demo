At that point, one option discussed, without any decision being made at this point, is to 

hold the level of total assets roughly fixed for a time.  Even as the total size of the balance 

sheet remains fixed, the composition of the liabilities would gradually change, in part as 

demand for currency grows in line with the economy.  Over time, the gradual increase in 

nonreserve liabilities would displace reserves as the overall balance sheet remains fixed.  

This plan would substantially reduce the pace of the decline in reserves, allowing us to 

gradually approach our assessment of the appropriate amount of reserves for the efficient 

and effective implementation of monetary policy.  Of course, in the longer run, once we 

reach our preferred level of reserves, the balance sheet would have to resume growth to 

match a continued increase in demand for nonreserve liabilities. 

I would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of some of the other decision 

points we will encounter as we continue the process of normalizing our balance sheet.  In 

particular, what does the Committee judge to be normal in regard to the type and duration 

of assets that we will hold?  On composition, in line with our previously announced 

normalization principles, I favor a return to a balance sheet with all Treasury securities, 

allowing our mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings to run to zero.  In those 

principles, we also state that while we do not expect sales of MBS as part of the 

normalization process, later we would be open to limited sales to reduce or eliminate 

residual holdings of MBS.  In regard to duration, moving to shorten the duration of our 

holdings could increase the Fedâ€™s ability to affect long-term interest rates if the need 

arose.  However, it might be preferable to have the composition of our Treasury holdings 

roughly match the maturity composition of outstanding Treasury securities, minimizing 

any market distortions that could arise from our holdings.  Over the course of our
