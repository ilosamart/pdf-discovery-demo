essentially the same capital requirements as U.S. BHCs with $50 billion or more 

of assets. 

Many of these rules do not apply to community banks, in light of their different 

business models. 

One more point on bank capital: The Swiss and Swedish regulators have already 

gone far in raising capital requirements, including by requiring bail-in-able secondary 

holdings of capital in the form of contingent convertible capital obligations (CoCos).  The 

United States may be heading in a similar direction, but not by using CoCos, rather by 

requiring minimum amounts of “gone-concern” loss absorbency--in the form of long-

term debt--that would be available for internal financing recapitalization through a new 

orderly liquidation mechanism created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).   

In addition to enhanced capital ratios and tougher measures of risk-based capital, 

the Basel III accord includes bank liquidity rules, another key element of global financial 

regulatory reform.  The Basel Committee has agreed on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

(LCR), which is designed to reduce the probability of a firm’s liquidity insolvency over a 

30-day horizon through a self-insurance regime of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to 

meet short-term stressed funding needs.  The BCBS is also working to finalize the Net 

Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which helps to ensure a stable funding profile over a one-

year horizon.   

The bottom line to date: The capital ratios of the 25 largest banks in the United 

States have risen by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of 2005 to the start of this 

year, depending on which regulatory ratio you look at.  For example, the tier 1 common
