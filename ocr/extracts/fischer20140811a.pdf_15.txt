other aspects of international coordination has been slow. It will also be important to 

ensure that coordination among different regulators of the financial system is effective 

and, in particular, will be effective in the event of a crisis.    

In addition, policymakers still have a good deal to learn about how these various 

reforms will change financial market structure and functioning, how effective they will 

be in enhancing stability, and whether there will be unintended consequences.  Among 

the most important of the possible unintended consequences is that toughened regulation 

of banks will move some financial activity out of the banking system and into the shadow 

banking system.  

In summary, considerable progress has been made in strengthening bank capital 

and liquidity; in improving the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and 

supervision; in developing suitable resolution regimes for financial institutions; and in 

strengthening the infrastructure for the clearing and trading of derivative contracts.  It is 

clear that further progress is needed with respect to goals 6-9, relating respectively to: 

improving compensation practices; strengthening international coordination, especially 

with regard to the resolution and regulation of G-SIFIs; finding ways of dealing with the 

shadow banking system; and improving the quality of credit rating agencies.   

That leaves aside the question of the capacity for effective macroprudential 

supervision, an issue we will take up as we begin to discuss the optimal conduct of 

monetary policy in the wake of the crisis, given the heightened attention of monetary 

policymakers to the importance of maintaining financial stability.
