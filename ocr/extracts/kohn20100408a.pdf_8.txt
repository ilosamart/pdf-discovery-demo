With only a moderate recovery likely on tap, I expect unemployment to come down only 

slowly from its currently elevated level.  Although the persistent high level of unemployment 

will tend to restrain inflation further, the effect of resource slack on inflation does not appear to 

be as great as some previous episodes might have led us to expect.  The difference is that 

inflation expectations now appear to be much more firmly anchored than they once were, 

probably reflecting the extended period of low inflation that we have experienced and a credible 

monetary policy directed at sustaining this performance.  I anticipate that inflation will remain 

low for a while, with core PCE inflation not likely to fall much further from the subdued pace I 

cited a few minutes ago.  

 Longer-Run Rebalancing 

The U.S. economy should emerge from this episode stronger, more resilient, and on a 

more sustainable growth path than before the recession.  This outcome will entail a gradual long-

run shift in both the composition and financing of aggregate spending.  In particular, as I already 

noted, consumers probably will save more than in the past, reflecting the likelihood that 

household net worth will be lower relative to income than it was over the past decade or so and 

that credit, appropriately, will be somewhat less available than during the boom.  In addition, 

housing is almost certainly going to be a smaller part of the economy than it was when lax credit 

standards encouraged overbuilding and overborrowing.  Increased private saving and reduced 

demand for housing should prompt movements in relative prices and other factors that will, in 

turn, make room for a larger role for business investment and net exports in overall economic 

activity.  In addition, households that have worked down debt levels will be less vulnerable and 

better able to withstand shocks in the future.
