I want to apologize in advance.  I found that the rich data set offered some occasionally 

surprising insights into both of these questions, and I was unable to choose between the two 

topics.  The result is a somewhat overpacked discussion.  Despite that, I warn you: These results 

are the tip of a very large iceberg and may spur more questions than answers in your minds.   

The Survey of Consumer Finances 

As some of you may know, the SCF is the premier source of microlevel information on 

the finances of American families.  The survey is normally conducted every three years by 

selecting a new sample of consumers willing to provide detailed responses to questions about 

their personal finances.  Because aggregate data consistently indicated that the crisis was having 

severe negative effects on households, the Federal Reserve thought a follow-up survey of 2007 

survey participants would offer a unique opportunity to understand the impact of the financial 

crisis on individual families and the resulting changes in the financial decisions and outlooks of 

those families.  Although we are only beginning to mine the data, I believe the richer 

understanding of individual circumstances provided by the data set will prove invaluable in its 

ability to help us understand how consumers are approaching a number of important decisions, 

such as spending, saving, and wealth accumulation. 

In 2009, we launched a program to conduct follow-up interviews with participants in our 

2007 SCF to update their information.  As always, consumers’ willingness to share their personal 

data in the interest of better public policy is a critical requirement for these surveys, and 

participants’ privacy is strictly guarded.  We are extremely grateful for the public-spirited people 

who dredge through their financial statements, pension accounts, credit card bills, and tax returns 

to give us the most accurate information possible.  And we are particularly grateful to the nearly 

90 percent of the participants in the 2007 survey who did so a second time in 2009.
