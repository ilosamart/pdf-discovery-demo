If countercyclical tools and other regulatory safeguards are not adequate over the cycle, 

monetary policy will need to carry a greater burden in leaning against financial excesses.  That 

would be unfortunate, because adding financial stability concerns to the burden of conventional 

monetary policy might undermine sustained achievement of our employment and inflation goals.   

Because the financial cycle is today likely to be tempered less than in the past by material 

increases in interest rates as the economy expands, the appropriate level of bank capital for 

today’s conditions is unlikely to be the same as in past business cycles:  Because interest rates 

likely will do less than in past cycles, regulatory buffers will need to do more.  As a 

consequence, now is a bad time to be weakening the core resilience of our largest banking 

institutions or to be weakening oversight over the nonbank financial system.  Instead, we should 

be safeguarding the capital and liquidity buffers of banks at the center of the system, carefully 

monitoring risks in the nonbank sector, and making good use of the countercyclical tool that we 

have. 

Achieving our Inflation Objective on a Sustained Basis 

Finally, let us turn to the apparent softness in underlying trend inflation.  One hypothesis 

for the flat Phillips curve is that central banks have been so effective in anchoring inflation 

expectations that tightening resource utilization is no longer transmitted to price inflation.11  

Another possibility is that structural factors such as administrative changes to health care costs, 

globalization, or technological-enabled disruption have been dominant in recent years, masking
