occupied markets and thus help housing prices stabilize sooner.  Banks would have the 

opportunity to offset carrying costs and potentially increase their ultimate recovery.  And the net 

result of removing some properties from the distress sale inventory could ultimately lead to 

higher recoveries for all holders of REO.  Given current market conditions, banks could still 

divest property within statutory time frames, but with better results for themselves, surrounding 

property owners, and the economy.  We are in the process now of exploring ways to clarify our 

guidance regarding rental of residential REO properties. 

 Let me turn now to a supervisory innovation that, I believe, will prove quite valuable in 

ensuring the stability of our financial system: stress testing.  At the height of the crisis, the 

Federal Reserve, working with other banking agencies, conducted stress tests on the largest 

financial institutions and published the results.  Banks that did not appear to have sufficient 

capital to withstand adverse conditions were required to raise additional capital.  Last year, we 

reviewed the largest banks’ capital plans in light of stress test results and used the information to 

guide approvals of planned capital distributions.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires annual 

supervisory stress tests for institutions with assets of at least $50 billion and internal stress tests 

for institutions with assets of $10 billion or more.  There are no current bank-wide stress testing 

requirements for banks with assets less than $10 billion.  The only expectations for smaller banks 

are those contained in existing guidance, such as for interest rate risk or for commercial real 

estate concentrations. 

 As strongly as I believe in the concept of stress testing for capital adequacy, I don’t believe 

that it needs to become a complicated, expensive, and burdensome process for smaller 

institutions with traditional business models.  In many cases, smaller institutions are already
