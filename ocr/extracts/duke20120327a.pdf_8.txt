in the state's lower-income communities.  One of the businesses in the fund’s portfolio, 

PrimeSource Food Service Equipment, moved from an affluent northern Dallas suburb to 

South Dallas, where the poverty rate was higher than 40 percent, relocating more than 

100 employees and hiring new employees from South Dallas.  I raise this example 

because it demonstrates what a little imagination can do to solve the problem of 

connecting people with jobs.  Moreover, this double bottom-line approach to 

investments--making a profit while benefitting the community--makes this kind of 

activity attractive to bankers with CRA obligations and other socially-minded investors. 

Community Development:  An Entrepreneurial Enterprise  

This innovative example serves as a reminder that successful community 

development is an entrepreneurial enterprise.  Thinking about community development 

this way reminds me of a presentation made at a recent Federal Reserve research 

conference on small business and entrepreneurship.6  Amy Wilkinson, Senior Fellow at 

Harvard’s Kennedy School Center for Business and Government, has conducted research 

to identify the skill sets of high-impact entrepreneurs and small business leaders.  The 

skills she identified are, not surprisingly, applicable to community development.  They 

include being able to spot opportunities that others don’t see, managing complexity, 

reiterating ideas and revamping plans repeatedly, experimenting and failing wisely, 

networking to create solutions, and, as Amy put it, “unleashing generosity” in ways that 

create reciprocity within the network.
