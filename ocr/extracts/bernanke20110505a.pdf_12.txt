manage potential losses in stress scenarios while comfortably meeting Basel III capital 

requirements as they are phased in.  But, with the help of macroeconomic and capital 

market analysts, we also considered the implications of the requests for the capital 

available to the banking system as a whole, with the objective of ensuring that bank credit 

would still be available to households and businesses even if the economy were to 

perform more poorly than expected. 

We now also routinely apply macroprudential methods to the analysis of 

significant economic developments, whether domestic or foreign.  The sovereign debt 

concerns in Europe provide one example.  As yields on European sovereign debt and 

bank debt rose in the spring of 2010, Federal Reserve supervisors began to evaluate U.S. 

banking firms’ exposures to European banking firms and sovereigns.  In addition to 

evaluating direct exposures, we analyzed scenarios under which sovereign debt concerns 

might lead to broader financial volatility.  Our focus was on the possibility that financial 

disruptions might impede credit flows and economic activity in both Europe and the 

United States.  In our work we conferred extensively with European bank supervisors; for 

example, we discussed potential risks to European banks’ abilities to obtain dollar 

funding and the implications of European banks’ need for dollars on U.S. money markets.  

This work suggested that providing a backstop for the dollar-funding needs of European 

financial institutions could mitigate the potential for spillovers to the United States from 

European sovereign debt concerns.  In accord with this analysis, in May 2010 the Federal 

Open Market Committee announced that it had authorized dollar liquidity swap lines with 

other central banks in a preemptive move to avert a further deterioration in liquidity 

conditions.
