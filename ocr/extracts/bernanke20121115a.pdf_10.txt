At the Federal Reserve, we have sought to support the economic recovery and 

maintain price stability--the two goals given to us by the Congress--by keeping both 

short-term and longer-term interest rates historically low.  Low interest rates reduce the 

cost to households of buying homes, cars, and other consumer durables while increasing 

the attractiveness of new capital investments by firms.  Increased demand in turn leads to 

faster economic growth and more jobs.  My colleagues and I have been and remain quite 

concerned about the stubbornly high level of unemployment--particularly long-term 

unemployment.  We have taken strong actions throughout the financial crisis and 

recovery to help stabilize the economy.  In September, we took the added step of stating 

that we will continue actions to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates until 

the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a context of price stability.  Our 

hope is that our statement provides individuals, families, businesses, and financial 

markets greater confidence about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to promoting a 

sustainable recovery with price stability and that, as a result, they will become more 

willing to invest, hire and spend.  In addition, of course, the historically low mortgage 

rates that have resulted from the Federal Reserve’s policies are directly supporting the 

housing market by putting homeownership within the reach of more people.    

While the economic recovery and regulatory policy affect access to credit for all 

households, some potential borrowers may face the added burden of discrimination.  In 

our role as a banking regulator, the Federal Reserve strives to ensure that the banks we 

supervise obey laws that prohibit illegal discrimination in lending.  I am reminded here 

that fair treatment in housing was a significant focus of Dr. King’s, and the Fair Housing
