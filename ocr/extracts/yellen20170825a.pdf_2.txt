A decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted 

in the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the 

United States since the Great Depression.  Already, for some, memories of this 

experience may be fading--memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and of 

why certain steps were taken in response.  Today I will look back at the crisis and discuss 

the reforms policymakers in the United States and around the world have made to 

improve financial regulation to limit both the probability and the adverse consequences of 

future financial crises.   

A resilient financial system is critical to a dynamic global economy--the subject 

of this conference.  A well-functioning financial system facilitates productive investment 

and new business formation and helps new and existing businesses weather the ups and 

downs of the business cycle.  Prudent borrowing enables households to improve their 

standard of living by purchasing a home, investing in education, or starting a business.  

Because of the reforms that strengthened our financial system, and with support from 

monetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced 

broadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to todayâ€™s strong 

economy.1    

At the same time, reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system.   

Banks are safer.  The risk of runs owing to maturity transformation is reduced.  Efforts to 

enhance the resolvability of systemic firms have promoted market discipline and reduced 

                                                 
1 Over the 12 quarters ending in the first quarter of this year, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector 

increased at an annual rate just above 6 percent, on average, and borrowing by households and nonprofit 

institutions rose at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent, on average; the corresponding average pace of increase 

in nominal gross domestic product was 3-3/4 percent.  Over the same period, lending by private depository 

institutions advanced at an annual rate of nearly 6-1/2 percent.
