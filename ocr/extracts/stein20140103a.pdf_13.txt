Specifically, we adopt the following reduced form:  ki = k(μi, φi), where μi is the 

fraction of asset i held by the shadow banking sector and φi is an index of asset 

illiquidity, with higher values of φi corresponding to less-liquid assets.  We assume that 

dki/dμi < 0, meaning that a greater shadow banking share results in a lower fire-sale price, 

and that d

ki/dμidφi < 0, meaning that this adverse price-pressure effect is amplified in 

more-illiquid assets.   

With all of this machinery in place, I can now state our main results, which 

characterize how banks’ equilibrium market shares depend on the two primitive asset-

level parameters, φi and zi.  First, we have that dμi/di < 0, which means that banks have a 

bigger share relative to shadow banks in more-illiquid assets, all else being equal.  

Second, we have that dμi/dzi < 0, which means that banks have a bigger share in assets 

that have less long-run solvency risk, all else being equal. 

Taken together, these two results suggest that banks have a comparative 

advantage in holding assets that can experience significant temporary price dislocations 

but, at the same time, have only modest fundamental risk.  Agency MBS might be a 

leading example of such an asset, since they are insured against default risk but are less 

liquid than Treasury securities and, for a given duration, have more price volatility, as the 

MBS-Treasury spread varies significantly. 

The model also explains why, even absent any institutional or regulatory 

constraints, banks would endogenously choose to avoid equities--they simply have too 

much fundamental risk.  Because their value can fall very far over an extended period of 

time--that is, because their zi is close to zero--equities cannot be efficiently used as 

backing to create safe two-period claims.  So they are not good collateral for bank
