issue stable-value demandable liabilities with no capital buffer or other explicit loss-

absorption capacityâ€”which make them highly vulnerable to runs by their depositors.  I 

welcome the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission on this front, particularly 

its focus on floating net asset values, and look forward to concrete action.  Another 

source of fragility arises from money funds investing in repo loans collateralized by 

assets that they are unwilling or unable to hold if things go bad.  This feature creates an 

incentive for them to withdraw repo financing from broker-dealers at the first sign of 

counterparty risk, even if the underlying collateral is in good shape.    

 In closing, I just want to acknowledge how much my own thinking about these 

complicated issues has benefited from the work of so many of you on the program at this 

conference.  I look forward to continuing the conversation.  Thank you.
