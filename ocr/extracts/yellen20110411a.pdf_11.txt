shock.  Beyond that horizon, however, total PCE inflation drops quickly to about 2-1/4 

percent and then declines gradually back to its longer-run rate of 2 percent.         

These fairly modest and transitory effects of an oil price shock are also consistent 

with the response of the U.S. economy to the dramatic run-up in commodity prices from 

2002 to 2008.  Indeed, while oil prices more than quadrupled over that period, measures 

of underlying inflation remained close to 2 percent.  In my view, that outcome was 

crucially dependent on the stability of longer-run inflation expectations, which in turn 

limited the pass-through of higher production costs to consumer prices.   

Risks to the Inflation Outlook 

I have argued that recent commodity price shocks are likely to have only a 

transitory effect on inflation.  But even if such a trajectory for inflation is most likely, 

some specific risks must be considered.  First, while futures markets suggest that 

commodity prices will stabilize near current levels, these prices cannot be predicted with 

much confidence.  For example, oil prices could move markedly higher or lower as a 

consequence of geopolitical developments, changes in production capacity, or shifts in 

the growth outlook of the EMEs.   

In addition, the indirect effects of the commodity price surge could be amplified 

substantially if longer-run inflation expectations started drifting upward or if nominal 

wages began rising sharply as workers pressed employers to offset realized or prospective 

declines in their purchasing power.   

Indeed, a key lesson from the experience of the late 1960s and 1970s is that the 

stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted.  At that time, 

the Federal Reserveâ€™s monetary policy framework was opaque, its measures of resource
