Downside risks to the outlook  

• Impending “fiscal cliff” 

• Potential for highly destabilizing developments in 
Europe and global financial markets. 

• Forecasters have repeatedly overestimated the 
strength of the recovery and may still be too 
optimistic.  

• Potential for cyclical unemployment to become 
structural if the recovery were to stall.
