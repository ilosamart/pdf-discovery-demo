The taper tantrum of 2013 

We should also expect spillovers when monetary policy is tightened.  Central 

bank communications can be a tricky business, but it has long been understood that 

shifting perceptions of policy can have an immediate effect on market prices and 

investors’ portfolio decisions.  Indeed, financial markets reacted strongly to the first 

statements by Chairman Bernanke in the spring of 2013 that the Fed’s asset purchases 

were likely to decelerate in the near future and come to an end not long after that.  Some 

market participants clearly understood these statements to be broadly in line with 

previous guidance about the eventual normalization of policy as recovery of the U.S. 

economy took hold.  But others may have grown accustomed to continuing asset 

purchases; the most recent purchase program, QE3, had been first announced less than a 

year before and was proceeding at a steady pace of $85 billion per month.   

The onset of the taper tantrum went well beyond a roiling of U.S. financial 

markets.  Spillovers to other advanced-economy financial markets included stock price 

declines, significant increases in sovereign yields, higher overnight interest swap rates in 

the United Kingdom and euro area, and rising credit spreads in some countries.  The ECB 

and Bank of England responded by using so-called forward guidance to push short-term 

yields back down in an effort to foster recovery.20  Spillovers to EME asset markets were 

significantly stronger.  Inflows to EME investment funds reversed sharply, EME 

currencies depreciated, and other asset prices declined.21  

20 See Draghi and Constâncio (2013) and Bank of England (2013).  The success of forward guidance, of 
course, depends crucially on the ability of policymakers to make informative statements about their 
intentions without a formal commitment device.   
21 Powell (2013) notes that EMEs with larger current account deficits experienced both greater 
depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields in mid-2013, suggesting that, 
while a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the retrenchment from EME assets, 
investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the reactions.
