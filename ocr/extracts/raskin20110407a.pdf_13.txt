The expectations that I have described for both banks and examiners are not just 

hypothetical.  You may have heard much more about the banks that faltered under intense credit 

and liquidity pressures, but the Federal Reserve has also been focused on the performance of 

those community banks that have remained in sound condition throughout the crisis.  Many of 

the community banks supervised by the Federal Reserve that entered the crisis with a supervisory 

rating of “1” or “2”--the highest ratings on the 1-to-5 scale used by bank supervisors--have 

managed to keep these ratings.  Most of these banks entered the crisis with moderate exposures 

to commercial real estate, and continued to report strong earnings and net interest margins 

throughout the crisis.  They reported very limited reliance on noncore funding and strong capital 

levels as they entered the crisis.  They earned solid, though not spectacular, returns and they 

reported steady performance.  And, while this is less quantifiable, many of these banks have 

effective boards of directors and strong and experienced management teams.  It is important that 

examiners keep this in mind as they evaluate and refine their supervisory processes in the wake 

of the crisis. 

Conclusion 

I certainly don’t claim to have all the answers when it comes to delineating the 

appropriate roles and responsibilities between management and examiners in a healthy bank, but 

I hope my remarks today will at least start a conversation about how best to structure a 

regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking system that effectively supports the real 

economy and encourages sound and sustained lending to creditworthy borrowers.  We know that 

those community banks that weathered the storm during the crisis are already doing this in their 

own communities and we can learn from their experience.  In order to sustain the economic 

recovery, we need strong, well-run community banks that operate in a framework of smart and
