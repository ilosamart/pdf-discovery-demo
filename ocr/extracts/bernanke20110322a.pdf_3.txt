decisions.  This advantage for community banks is fundamental to their effectiveness and cannot 

be matched by models or algorithms, no matter how sophisticated.  The IBM computer program 

Watson may play a mean game of Jeopardy, but I would not trust it to judge the creditworthiness 

of a fledgling local business or to build longstanding personal relationships with customers and 

borrowers. 

Given the important role that community banks play in their local economies, we at the 

Federal Reserve are keenly interested in their health and their collective future.  Local 

communities, ranging from small towns to urban neighborhoods, are the foundation of the U.S. 

economy and communities need community banks to help them grow and prosper.  As Iâ€™m sure 

you are all too aware, the financial crisis and its aftermath have hit some community banks 

especially hard, and those institutions will continue to need time to repair their balance sheets.  

Although we are not yet where we would like to be, the good news is that many community 

banks are recovering and reporting stronger performance.   

Indeed, despite some of the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression and 

their own strained balance sheets, community banks have already been doing their part to meet 

the credit needs of their customers, notably including small business customers.  We have been 

spending a lot of time at the Federal Reserve trying to understand and promote lending to small 

businesses, and one of the interesting things we have found is that while small business lending 

contracted overall from mid-2008 through 2010, this contraction was not uniform.  In fact, a 

majority of the smallest banks (in this case, those with assets of $250 million or less) actually 

increased their small business lending during this period.  And while banks with assets between 

$250 million and $1 billion showed a slight decline in small business lending over this period, 

the contraction was not nearly as sharp as it was for the largest banks.  This hard evidence
