It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the Federal Reserve System’s 

11th Community Development Research Conference, cosponsored by the community 

development offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  

These biennial conferences are one manifestation of the Federal Reserve’s deep 

commitment to supporting research that helps policymakers, community development 

practitioners, and researchers improve the economic well-being of families and 

communities.  These gatherings also inform the Federal Reserve System’s work in 

promoting consumer protection and community development, and I would like to thank 

all of you for your contributions to this conference. 

This year our conference focuses on pathways to the middle class.  While there 

are many definitions of “middle class,” I think we can agree that achieving a basic level 

of economic security is fundamental.  Surveys suggest that many Americans believe 

being middle class means having a secure job and the ability to save.1  In recent decades, 

income growth for middle-income households has lagged behind that for high-income 

households.2  In addition, economic resources differ markedly by race, education, 

occupation, geography, and other factors.  Those circumstances underscore a two-fold 

challenge for our country: fostering the conditions that will help lower-income families 

reach the middle class, while ensuring that middle-class status still provides the basic 

economic security that it has traditionally offered.
