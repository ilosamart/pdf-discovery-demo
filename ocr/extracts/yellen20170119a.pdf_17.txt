federal funds rate near zero for longer than two of the rules would have prescribed.  But 

as labor market conditions continued to improve over time, the rising trajectories for the 

federal funds rate prescribed by all three rules signaled that the time was drawing near to 

begin gradually reducing monetary accommodation.  Consistent with this advice, the 

FOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid-2014 and began raising the federal 

funds rate in late 2015.22   

To sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how 

monetary policy should be adjusted over time.  However, their prescriptions must be 

interpreted carefully, both because estimates of some of their key inputs can vary 

significantly and because the rules often do not take into account important 

considerations and information pertaining to the outlook.  For these reasons, the rules 

should not be followed mechanically, since doing so could have adverse consequences 

for the economy. 

Conclusion  

My remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now 

considers likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping 

inflation close to our 2 percent goal.  In concluding, it is important to emphasize the 

considerable uncertainty that attaches to such assessments and the need to constantly 

update them.     

In particular, the path of the neutral federal funds rate, which plays an important 

role in determining the appropriate policy path, is highly uncertain.  For example, 

productivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate, and while most forecasters
