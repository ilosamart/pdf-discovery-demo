careful judgments about both the measurement of the inputs to these rules and the 

implications of the many considerations the rules do not take into account. 

Consider first the well-known Taylor rule, which embodies key principles of good 

monetary policy.  The rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate 

relative to its expected longer-run neutral level in response to movements in inflation and 

the output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the 

economy’s productive potential.12  To implement the rule, one must decide on the 

appropriate definition and measurement of its inputs.  Should inflation be defined using 

the latest noisy quarterly reading on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to 

smooth through transitory price movements?  What technique should be used to 

approximate the output gap, given that different approaches often yield materially 

different estimates?  And what assumption should be made about the neutral value of the 

federal funds rate in the longer run?   

The Taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real, or inflation-

adjusted, value of the longer-run neutral interest rate--which I will call R* for 

                                                           
12 Formally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 +
0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋∗) + 0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real federal funds rate that on 
average is expected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and stable inflation in the 
longer run, π is current inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the 
Federal Reserve), and Y is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP 
and what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment.  Importantly, the rule 
embodies three key principles that central banks take into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation 
and the overall economy.  First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one-for-one 
response of the policy rate to stabilize inflation.  Second, monetary policy should raise real interest rates 
above their normal longer-run level whenever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is 
higher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds.  (Note that implementing this latter principle 
requires estimates of both the economy’s productive potential and the longer-run level of the real policy 
rate that would be consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.)  And, finally, 
policymakers should respond in a systematic manner to changes in economic conditions in order to help 
financial market participants and others better understand how policy is likely to respond over time to 
current and future events, thereby influencing expectations in a way that promotes economic stability.
