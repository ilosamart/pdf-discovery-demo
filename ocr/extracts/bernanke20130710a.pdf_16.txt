Moderation.  These features include the emphasis on preserving the Fed’s inflation 

credibility, which is critical for anchoring inflation expectations, and a balanced approach 

in pursuing both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate in the medium term.  We have also 

continued to increase the transparency of monetary policy.  For example, the 

Committee’s communications framework now includes a statement of its longer-run 

goals and monetary policy strategy.

  In that statement, the Committee indicated that it 

judged that inflation at a rate of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price 

index for personal consumption expenditures) is most consistent over the longer run with 

the FOMC’s dual mandate.  FOMC participants also regularly provide estimates of the 

longer-run normal rate of unemployment; those estimates currently have a central 

tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  By helping to anchor longer-term expectations, this 

transparency gives the Federal Reserve greater flexibility to respond to short-run 

developments.  This framework, which combines short-run policy flexibility with the 

discipline provided by the announced targets, has been described as constrained 

discretion.

  Other communication innovations include early publication of the minutes 

of FOMC meetings and quarterly postmeeting press conferences by the Chairman.  

 The framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved further in recent 

years, reflecting both advances in economic thinking and a changing policy environment.  

Notably, following the ideas of Lars Svensson and others, the FOMC has moved toward a 

framework that ties policy settings more directly to the economic outlook, a so-called 

forecast-based approach.

  In particular, the FOMC has released more detailed

 In a forecast-based approach, monetary policymakers inform the public of their medium-term targets--

say, a specific value for the inflation rate--and attempt to vary the instruments of policy as needed to meet
