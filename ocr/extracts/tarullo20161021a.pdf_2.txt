Let me begin with the most prosaic of observations:  The events of 2007-09 will be 

remembered not as a banking crisis, but as a financial crisis.  Neither the origins nor the 

transmission of stress were limited to the traditional banking system of commercial banks and 

thrifts.  While Wachovia and Washington Mutual failed, and other large depository institutions 

survived only because of government support, the more spectacular failures were those of 

nonbank financial firms--including American International Group (AIG), Bear Stearns, Lehman 

Brothers, and the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Repurchase 

agreement (repo) and commercial paper markets depended on government liquidity to continue 

operating, as did money market funds. 

It is thus unsurprising that, in approaching regulatory reform after the crisis, both the 

official sector and academics have focused more on the financial system as a whole.  The shift is 

apparent in the very diction of post-crisis regulatory initiatives.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) refers dozens of times to “financial 

stability” and “systemic risk.”  A special regulatory structure has been developed for “G-SIBs”--

that is, banks of global systemic importance--and a new category of designated systemically 

important nonbank financial companies has been created.  This shift is also reflected in the titles 

and intellectual approaches of the two books that were discussed at this conference earlier this 

morning--that is, financial regulation.  The authors of both books have eschewed the traditional 

concentration on banking or securities law alone, and have even moved beyond the more 

innovative pre-crisis casebooks that focused on the differential regulation of various forms of 

financial institutions.1
