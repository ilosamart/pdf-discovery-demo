both the private and public sectors.  Clearly, if we do not want to put all our trust in 

continued good fortune, we will have to continue to be proactive in identifying and 

remedying weaknesses in these critical infrastructures. 

Clearinghouses and Financial Reform 

 Broadly speaking, the recent financial reform legislation bears on the future 

structure and role of clearinghouses in two different ways.  First, it aims to increase the 

resilience of these critical institutions against severe financial shocks, the issue that I have 

emphasized thus far.  Second, it also encourages the greater development and use of 

clearinghouses to address weaknesses identified in other parts of the financial system.  Of 

course, increased reliance on clearinghouses to address problems in other parts of the 

system increases further the need to ensure the safety of clearinghouses themselves.  As 

Mark Twain’s character Pudd’nhead Wilson once opined, if you put all your eggs in one 

basket, you better watch that basket. 

The theme of expanded use of clearinghouses as a tool to address other problems 

in the system is perhaps best illustrated by the derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank 

Act.  Prior to the crisis, some of the same economic forces that had led to the 

development of clearinghouses for other instruments were already pushing industry 

participants toward greater use of clearinghouses for OTC derivatives transactions.  For 

example, as one response to the growth of the market for interest rate swaps in the early 

1990s, a clearinghouse was created in London in 1999 that, by the onset of the financial 

crisis, was handling a major portion of interdealer activity in those swaps.14  Also, in the
