designations, the council will need to determine criteria for identifying firms whose 

financial distress would impose the greatest risks to financial stability.  Of course, this 

task requires continued development of an analytical framework for understanding 

systemic risk and its sources.

height of the crisis--is clearly a systemic issue, not just an industry issue.  The SEC, 

which has already issued rules to increase the stability of money market mutual funds, is 

appropriately taking the lead in investigating whether further steps are necessary.  Under 

the aegis of the council, however, the SEC has consulted with other agencies, including 

the Federal Reserve, which have provided their own analyses and perspectives.  In 

particular, interagency consultation has helped clarify the potential systemic implications 

of instability in the money market mutual fund industry.  The Federal Reserve will be 

among the agencies participating in a roundtable on money fund regulation sponsored by 

the SEC later this month.

both structural problems and risks arising from ongoing economic or financial 

developments.  However, no one’s interests are served by the imposition of ineffective or 

burdensome rules that lead to excessive increases in costs or unnecessary restrictions in 

the supply of credit.  Increased coordination and cooperation among regulators, under the
