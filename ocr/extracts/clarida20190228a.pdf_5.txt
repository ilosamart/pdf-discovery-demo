Finally, in November, we announced a review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary 

policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.  In this review, we will listen 

carefully to a broad range of stakeholders offering a full range of perspectives from 

across the country, and we will draw on these insights as we assess how best to achieve 

and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion 

possible.  Taking these viewpoints on board, the FOMC will begin its own discussions 

this summer on how we might refine our framework and will provide a public assessment 

after the review is completed.4 

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to our conversation.
