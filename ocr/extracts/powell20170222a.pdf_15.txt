prescription is closer to FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy.  

Although many FOMC participants believe that r* has fallen, they also believe that it will 

rise toward a longer-term level of 1 percent over time, and the better fit of the inertial rule 

in part captures this assessment. 

I would offer several takeaways from this overview.  There is general agreement 

that these simple policy rules do provide interesting and useful insights into policy.  To 

gain the benefit of those insights, it is helpful to look at a range of rules.  But there is no 

consensus that any one rule is best, let alone that it would be desirable to require the 

FOMC to pick and mechanically follow one rule to the exclusion of others.29 

Simple rules also leave out critical considerations for the path of policy.  One 

such consideration of great importance is that, with the secular decline in interest rates 

over the past 35 years, policy is now far more likely to hit the ELB than had been 

thought, which may present severe challenges.  Research suggests that, as a precautionary 

matter, policy should be more aggressive in providing accommodation as rates move 

closer to the ELB.30  But there is no consensus today on whether or how to incorporate 

ELB-related risks into a simple policy rule of the type that I have discussed here.  

Another such consideration is that simple policy rules include no consideration of 

financial stability.  But monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between 

macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.  Recent business cycles show that

Donald Sull (2001), “Strategy as Simple Rules,” Harvard Business Review, January,

employed simple rules were Enron, AOL, and Yahoo.
