is an important mechanism through which agencies can cooperate in responding to 

practices or firms that migrate outside of traditional regulatory perimeters.   

Second:  securitization reform.  A regulation that is now in the process of 

implementation requires securitizers to retain some of the risk of the securities that they 

create.  That should incentivize them to structure securitizations in ways that better 

protect the holders of senior tranches from credit risk, although qualifying residential 

mortgages are exempt from the requirement.   

A third area is derivative reforms.  To reduce complexity and pro-cyclicality, 

these reforms include moving standardized derivatives to central counterparties (CCPs) 

and requiring initial and variation margin for noncleared derivatives.  Relatedly, as CCPs 

have gained prominence, regulators have become more focused on and concerned with 

their resilience, recovery, and resolution.  In addition, regulators are working to improve 

the quality and standardization of data reported to swap data repositories, and are actively 

participating in international efforts to develop uniform identification standards to 

facilitate the aggregation of such data.9  A key issue is to understand how and to what 

extent market participants who use derivatives are exposed to each other. 

Besides the new money market mutual fund rules that I have already mentioned, a 

fourth example is additional data collection on specific holdings of money funds, which 

has enhanced stability by providing investors with more information to better evaluate 

risks.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated the establishment of the Office of 

Financial Research in order to help promote financial stability through the measurement 

9 Due to the critical nature of overseas derivatives data and the need to standardize these data for regulatory 
analysis, the CFTC and the OFR in 2014 formed a partnership to standardize and enhance the quality of the 
data collected by CFTC-registered swap data repositories.  Important work on standardizing derivatives 
data is also under way at the international level.
