It’s an honor and a pleasure for me to be here with you to mark Women’s History Month, 

which itself has some history behind it.  

March 8, 1911 was the first International Women’s Day, and it was 1980 when President

One reason America’s example is influential elsewhere is because progress toward these 

ideals has been accompanied by great success in broadly raising living standards.  And I think 

our economic success has been due in substantial part to the fuller participation and contribution 

of women to the economy.  Their increasing participation in the workforce, particularly after
