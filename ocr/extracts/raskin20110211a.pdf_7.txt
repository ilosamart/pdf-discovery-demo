consumers find themselves captive to practices that have emphasized speed and 

aggressive timeframes over responsiveness, accuracy, and completeness.    

 So something is wrong.  Here we are in 2011, looking at high levels of 

foreclosures on the horizon, looking at significant failures in process, and nothing much 

has changed since 2007.  I always thought this dysfunction was going on for too long--

but I’m someone who thought the successive waves of foreclosures in 2007 amounted to 

a virtual tsunami.  In my mind, massive foreclosures were always a sign of an equally 

massive market failure.  Well, now it seems to me we have reached a point where this 

sign of failure is hindering our economy’s ability to rebound.   

In addition to improvements that individual servicers need to make, we also have 

to find a way to fix broader problems in the industry and make it functional. 

In my November remarks, I began the conversation about a flawed business 

model that creates misaligned incentives in ways that are more difficult for any one 

company to change on its own.   So let’s talk now a little bit about how a better-

functioning servicing industry would be structured. 

 One step the industry could take that would have an enormous payoff for 

consumers and market participants would be to change its pricing model.  The economic 

incentives and pressure points of the current servicing model cause problems at multiple 

levels.   

 In addition to float income and ancillary fees, servicers earn money through an 

annual fee on each loan.  This annual servicing fee is an important income source that has 

to cover some wildly varying costs.  On a performing loan for which costs to servicers 

are minimal, the revenue stream from ancillary fees and float may itself be nearly enough
