these measures helped end the acute phase of the financial crisis, although, five years 

later, the economic consequences are still with us. 

Once the fire is out, public attention turns to the question of how to better 

fireproof the system.  Here, the context and the responses differed between 1907 and the 

recent crisis.  As I mentioned, following the 1907 crisis, reform efforts led to the 

founding of the Federal Reserve, which was charged both with helping to prevent panics 

and, by providing an “elastic currency,” with smoothing seasonal interest rate 

fluctuations.  In contrast, reforms since 2008 have focused on critical regulatory gaps 

revealed by the crisis.  Notably, oversight of the shadow banking system is being 

strengthened through the designation, by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, 

of nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) for consolidated 

supervision by the Federal Reserve, and measures are being undertaken to address the 

potential instability of wholesale funding, including reforms to money market funds and 

the triparty repo market.7  

As we try to make the financial system safer, we must inevitably confront the 

problem of moral hazard.  The actions taken by central banks and other authorities to 

stabilize a panic in the short run can work against stability in the long run, if investors 

and firms infer from those actions that they will never bear the full consequences of 

excessive risk-taking.  As Stan Fischer reminded us following the international crises of 

the late 1990s, the problem of moral hazard has no perfect solution, but steps can be
