factors should ease as the economic recovery gains steam and the trajectory for house 

prices appears more certain. 

Although house price declines have moderated notably, the continuing effects on 

house prices of the large number of underwater mortgages and of the mortgages still in 

the foreclosure pipeline remain unclear.  Even professional forecasters diverge widely in 

their views about the future path of house prices:  In one recent survey, house price 

forecasts for 2012 ranged from a decline of 8 percent to an increase of 5 percent. 

Uncertainty about house prices and the high volume of distressed sales make the 

job of residential appraisers and lenders more difficult.  In the current market, appraisers 

may tend to have a more conservative view of a homeâ€™s market value and, as long as 

house prices continue to decline, lenders may lean toward more conservative 

underwriting.  Taken together, these factors could discourage or even disrupt sales that 

might otherwise happen smoothly.  Like you, we have been hearing such reports. 

While macroeconomic uncertainty is likely an important contributing factor to 

tight mortgage credit conditions, we also observe that lenders have tended to be 

conservative in making some mortgages that are guaranteed by government-sponsored 

enterprises (GSEs)--loans in which lenders do not bear the credit risk in the event of 

borrower default--which suggests that issues other than macroeconomic risk are affecting 

lending decisions.  Indeed, analysis by Federal Reserve staff suggests that only about half 

of lenders currently offer mortgages to borrowers whose credit metrics fall into the lower 

range of GSE purchase parameters. 

In the April SLOOS, lenders were asked targeted questions about the likelihood, 

compared with 2006, that they would originate mortgages with specific credit profiles.
