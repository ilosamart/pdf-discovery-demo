borrowers who may be creditworthy but may not exactly fit the criteria of the GSEs or 

the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). 

Potential first-time homebuyers have been disproportionately affected by the very 

tight conditions in mortgage markets.  Lending to potential first-time homebuyers has 

dropped precipitously, even in parts of the country where unemployment rates and 

housing conditions are better than the national average.  Indeed, the propensity of 

younger households--headed by adults aged 29 to 34--to take out their first mortgage has 

been much lower recently than it was 10 years ago, a period well before the most recent 

run-up in home prices.

  First-time homebuyers are typically an important source of 

incremental housing demand, so their smaller presence in the market affects house prices 

and construction quite broadly.

  Moreover, the lack of demand from first-time 

homebuyers may prevent current homeowners from moving up to larger homes, for 

example, to accommodate growing families.      

An additional issue is the implication of tight mortgage credit conditions for 

monetary policy.  Because some creditworthy households are finding it difficult to obtain 

mortgage credit or to refinance, the strong actions taken by the Federal Reserve to put 

downward pressure on longer-term rates and to improve financial conditions have had 

less effect on the housing sector and overall economic activity than they otherwise would 

have had.

 For example, consumer credit record data show that the share of 29- to 34-year-olds obtaining their first 

mortgage was significantly lower in the past two years (mid-2009 to mid-2011) at 9 percent than it was 

10 years earlier (mid-1999 to mid-2011) at 17 percent.
