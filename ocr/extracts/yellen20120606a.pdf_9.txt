valuable, for it has freed the FOMC to take strong actions to support the economic recovery 

without greatly worrying that higher energy and commodity prices would become ingrained in 

inflation and inflation expectations, as they did in the 1970s. 

While my modal outlook calls for only a gradual reduction in labor market slack and a 

stable pace of inflation near the FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, I see substantial risks 

to this outlook, particularly to the downside.  As I mentioned before, even without any political 

gridlock, fiscal policy is bound to become substantially less accommodative from early 2013 on.  

However, federal fiscal policy could turn even more restrictive if the Congress does not reach 

agreement on several important tax and budget policy issues before the end of this year; in fact, 

the CBO recently warned that the potential hit to gross domestic product (GDP) growth could be 

sufficient to push the economy into recession in 2013.7  The deterioration of financial conditions 

in Europe of late, coupled with notable declines in global equity markets, also serve as a 

reminder that highly destabilizing outcomes cannot be ruled out.  Finally, besides these clearly 

identifiable sources of risk, there remains the broader issue that economic forecasters have 

repeatedly overestimated the strength of the recovery and so still may be too optimistic about the 

prospects that growth will strengthen.  

Although I view the bulk of the increase in unemployment since 2007 as cyclical, I am 

concerned that it could become a permanent problem if the recovery were to stall.  In this 

economic downturn, the fraction of the workforce unemployed for six months or more has 

climbed much more than in previous recessions, and remains at a remarkably high level.  

Continued high unemployment could wreak long-term damage by eroding the skills and labor
