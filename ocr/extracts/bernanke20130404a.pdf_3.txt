  The site offers 

educational games, classroom lesson plans, online publications, and multimedia 

tools.  Federal Reserve Banks offer professional development opportunities for teachers 

to improve their ability to present lessons on personal finance topics.  A number of 

Reserve Banks also organize personal finance essay, video, and academic competitions 

for students.  And we encourage students and teachers to visit Federal Reserve Bank 

learning centers and museums, which feature interactive exhibits about many aspects of 

banking, the financial system, and the economy.  

Among the lessons of the recent financial crisis is the need for virtually 

everyone--both young and old--to acquire a basic knowledge of finance and economics.  

Such knowledge is necessary for anyone who will be faced with managing a household 

budget, making financial investments, finding reliable information about buying a car or 

house, and preparing financially for retirement and other life goals.  Accordingly, in 

addition to ensuring that students graduate with the financial literacy skills they need to 

navigate in the modern financial world, we, as a society, must also make sure that adults 

have opportunities to gain these skills or to refresh what they have learned.  Many of you 

are, or will be, practitioners in the financial services industry--perhaps serving retail 

clients--and in that capacity I hope you will make the promotion of financial and 

economic education a part of your mission as well.  These skills not only help people 

provide a better life for themselves and their families, but, by deepening their 

understanding of the world economy, having such skills also helps equip them to be 

engaged citizens and informed voters.
