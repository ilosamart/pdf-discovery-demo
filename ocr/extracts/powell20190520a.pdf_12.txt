Conclusion 

Let me wrap up with three thoughts.  First, business debt is near record levels, and 

recent issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments.  As a result, some 

businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates.  A highly 

leveraged business sector could amplify any economic downturn as companies are forced 

to lay off workers and cut back on investments.  Investors, financial institutions, and 

regulators need to focus on this risk today, while times are good.   

Second, today business debt does not appear to present notable risks to financial 

stability.  The debt-to-GDP ratio has moved up at a steady pace, in line with previous 

expansions and neither fueled by nor fueling an asset bubble.  Moreover, banks and other 

financial institutions have sizable loss-absorbing buffers.  The growth in business debt 

does not rely on short-term funding, and overall funding risk in the financial system is 

moderate. 

Third, we cannot be satisfied with our current level of knowledge about these 

markets, particularly the vulnerability of financial institutions to potential losses and the 

possible strains on market liquidity and prices should investors exit investment vehicles 

holding leveraged loans.  We are committed to better understanding the areas where our 

information is incomplete.  This commitment includes coordination with other domestic 

and international agencies to understand who is participating in business lending and how 

their behavior could potentially amplify stress events.
