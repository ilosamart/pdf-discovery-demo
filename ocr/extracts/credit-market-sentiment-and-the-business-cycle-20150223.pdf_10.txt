Possible Mechanism

• Why might an increase in credit spreads (not related to default risk) be 
expected to reduce economic growth?

• Explore hypothesis that widening of credit spreads leads to a 
broad-based reduction in credit supply.

• Not just through the banking sector but also through capital markets.

• Mechanism:
• W id e r  s p r e a d s  \( \Rightarrow \) d r o p  in  H Y  i s s u a n c e ;  n o t  s o  f o r  I G  is s u a n c e .
• W id e r  s p r e a d s  \( \Rightarrow \) c h a n g e s  in  f i r m s ’ f in a n c in g  m ix :  e q u i ty  i s s u a n c e  \( \uparrow \), 

w h i le  d e b t  i s s u a n c e  \( \downarrow \)

• W id e r  s p r e a d s  \( \Rightarrow \) d r o p  in  in v e s tm e n t  o f  l o w e r - q u a l i ty  f i rm s  r e la t iv e  to  th a t  

o f  h ig h e r - q u a l i ty  f irm s .

• D ecline in  investm ent and the reduction  in  debt relative to equity  \( \Rightarrow \) 
increase in  the relative cost o f  debt finance.
