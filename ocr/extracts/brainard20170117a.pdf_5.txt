vary as well as their implications for monetary policy.  In addition to the critical size and 

timing issues, there are four key dimensions:  (1) the composition of policy changes and 

their relative effects on aggregate demand and aggregate supply, (2) the distance of the 

economy from full employment and 2 percent inflation, (3) the divergence in the cyclical 

position of the U.S. economy relative to foreign economies, and (4) the amount of fiscal 

policy space. 

Different types of policies can generate very different economic responses and 

have implications regarding both the amount of aggregate economic stimulus per fiscal 

dollar and also whether the effect is predominantly to raise aggregate demand or also to 

expand the supply potential of the economy.  Generally, fiscal stimulus that expands 

spending and investment directly or is targeted to households and businesses that have 

the greatest propensity to spend rather than save can be expected to generate the largest 

response in aggregate demand.5     

Focusing first on policies that affect only aggregate demand, temporary demand-

based fiscal expansions can speed recovery when the economy is some distance from full 

employment and target inflation, particularly if conventional monetary policy is 

constrained by the effective lower bound.  But when the economy is either close to or at 

full employment and inflation is converging to or at its target, additional fiscal demand 

will more likely result in inflationary pressures.  Thus, fiscal expansions that affect only 

aggregate demand and are enacted when the economy is near full employment and 

2 percent inflation are relatively less likely to sustainably boost economic activity and 

relatively more likely to be accompanied by increases in interest rates.
