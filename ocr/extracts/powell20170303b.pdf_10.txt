Second, firms are still grappling with the business case for upgrading and 

streamlining payment, clearing, settlement, and related functions with DLT.  

Promoters of DLT offer a vision of streamlined processes that lead to faster 

processing, reduced reconciliation, and lower long-run operating costs.  Some 

argue that in certain markets, faster and more predictable processing will also 

reduce the capital and liquidity costs of operations.  But upgrades are often costly, 

lengthy, and risky, particularly if the technology is still being proven, as is the case 

for DLT.  Network effects can also affect adoption, since multiple firms may all 

need to adopt a particular implementation of DLT in order to justify its use in a 

specific market. 

Third, technical issues remain.  Practical issues such as whether a particular 

version of DLT will work for the intended purpose are still being explored.  Issues 

of reliability, scalability, and security remain very important.  Beyond these issues, 

standardization and interoperability across different versions of DLT will need to 

be addressed to allow technology integration and avoid market fragmentation. In 

general, industry members and technology providers recognize these important 

issues and have taken initial steps to address problems.  It will be important to keep 

these challenges firmly in mind as we move beyond experimentation and into the 

development and deployment of new products and processes.
