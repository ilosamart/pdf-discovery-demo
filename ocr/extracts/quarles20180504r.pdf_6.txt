(HQLA)--in terms of both quantity and quality--to cover potential outflows over a 30-day 

period of liquidity stress.  The LCR rule allows firms to meet this requirement with a 

range of cash and securities and does not apply a haircut to reserve balances or Treasury 

securities based on the estimated liquidity value of those instruments in times of stress.  

Further, firms are required to demonstrate that they can monetize HQLA in a stress event 

without adversely affecting the firm’s reputation or franchise.        

The rules have resulted in some changes in the behavior of large banks and in 

market dynamics.  Large banks have adjusted their funding profiles by shifting to more 

stable funding sources.  Indeed, taken together, the covered banks have reduced their 

reliance on short-term wholesale funding from about 50 percent of total assets in the 

years before the financial crisis to about 30 percent in recent years, and they have also 

reduced their reliance on contingent funding sources.  Meanwhile, covered banks have 

also adjusted their asset profiles, materially increasing their holdings of cash and other 

highly liquid assets.  In fact, these banks’ holdings of HQLA have increased significantly, 

from fairly low levels at some firms in the lead-up to the crisis to an average of about 15 

to 20 percent of total assets today.6  A sizable portion of these assets currently consists of 

U.S. central bank reserve balances, in part because reserve balances, unlike other types of 

highly liquid assets, do not need to be monetized, but also, importantly, because of the 

conduct of the Fed’s monetary policy, a topic to which I will next turn.
