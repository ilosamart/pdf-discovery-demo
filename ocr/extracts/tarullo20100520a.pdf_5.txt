 Another set of initiatives addresses market liquidity.  Specifically, the European Central 

Bank (ECB) announced that it was prepared to purchase government and private debt securities to 

ensure the depth and liquidity of euro area debt markets that were considered dysfunctional.  In 

addition, the ECB expanded its liquidity provision facilities, including offering full-allotment 

operations for three- and six-month loans.  Finally, as I will discuss in more detail later, to 

forestall an emerging shortage of dollar liquidity, the Federal Reserve reopened temporary U.S. 

dollar liquidity swap lines with the ECB and other major central banks. 

 The effect of the announcement on bond markets was immediate.  Bond spreads for the 

peripheral European countries narrowed substantially, at least partly reflecting purchases of 

government securities by euro-area central banks.  The ECBâ€™s enhanced liquidity provisions, 

including dollar credit from the liquidity swaps, have contained stresses in the European interbank 

market and provided an important backstop for these markets.  Stock markets also initially 

rebounded strongly following the announcement of the European package; however, their declines 

over the past week serve as a reminder that investors are aware that this package cannot ultimately 

relieve the need for real, and likely painful, fiscal reforms in some euro-area countries.    

Potential Ramifications for the U.S. Economy 

Financial markets in the United States have been buffeted by the European problems.

meeting to craft the most recent package, broad U.S. stock price indexes declined and implied 

volatility on equities rose sharply, reflecting some increased aversion to risk.  The flight to quality 

also showed through to U.S. Treasury yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, with the 

10-year Treasury yield declining 50 basis points over the four-week period and the dollar climbing 

more than six percent against the euro.  Following the announcement of the May 10 package,
