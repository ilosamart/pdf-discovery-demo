financial institutions or mortgage investors but may be in the best interest of local 

communities.  For these markets, it may be useful to consider the possible role of new 

incentives and, if so, what form those incentives might take. 

While existing statutes and regulations do not prohibit financial institutions from 

renting REO properties, supervisors encourage sales as the primary disposition tool.  In 

light of the relative weakness of the owner-occupied market and strength of the rental 

market along with the potential for a GSE-FHA program to solve the problem of 

insufficient scale in some markets, conditions are unusual enough that it might also make 

economic sense to clarify existing expectations to recognize that in some cases 

converting a portion of residential REO to rental may be a reasonable option for financial 

institutions.  Depending upon the conditions in their individual markets, I believe having 

such an option could allow for better outcomes for institutions--that is, a superior net 

present value compared with traditional disposition approaches--and could at the same 

time contribute to market healing.  However, to be effective in promoting better 

outcomes, such an approach would require supervisors to clarify current supervisory 

guidance to address how existing standards might apply to the valuation of real estate 

converted to rental, the time limits applicable to such holdings, and other aspects of 

managing those properties.  Financial institutions with large portfolios might be able to 

achieve scale in some markets on their own or possibly leverage the scale of a GSE-FHA 

program if such a program was created; smaller institutions should also have the 

flexibility to act in accordance with the conditions in their local markets.
