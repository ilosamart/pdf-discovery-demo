banking organizations such as streamlining the Call Report for small, less complex community 

banks, increasing appraisal thresholds for CRE loans, and reducing the frequency of exams in 

certain circumstances, there is more we should do.   

Conclusion 

History and experience show that stable economic growth is aided by strong regulatory 

buffers that bolster the resilience of our large banking organizations and help reduce the severity 

of downturns.  At a time when cyclical pressures are building, and asset valuations are stretched, 

we should be calling for large banking organizations to safeguard the capital and liquidity buffers 

they have built over the past few years.  Maintaining resilience over the cycle can be 

accomplished through a combination of structural and countercyclical buffers whose calibrations 

are inherently linked.  While we should carefully consider how to make our regulations more 

effective and better tailored, we must take great care to ensure that we do not inadvertently 

contribute to pro-cyclicality that would exacerbate financial conditions that are, on some 

dimensions, somewhat stretched.  Although I believe it is too early today to reassess the 

calibration of existing capital and liquidity buffers because they have yet to be tested through a 

full economic cycle, I look forward to efforts that are planned in future years in the international 

standard-setting bodies to assess the framework quantitatively.
