    Figure 3.  Labor Market Slack and Core Inflation Rate

      Note:  Labor market slack is the unemployment rate minus the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate of the natural rate of          
unemployment as of August 2018.  The CBO provides data for both the historical and projection periods.  Core inflation is the four−quarter percent          
change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) less food and energy.  The shaded areas indicate periods when the slack is 
negative—that is, when labor markets are tight.  Projections are as in figure 2.
