of different justifications for this approach.  One view was that less disclosure would 

reduce the risk and tamp down suspicions that some could take advantage of disclosures 

more readily than others.  Some believed that markets would overreact to details about 

monetary policy decisions.  And there was a widespread belief that communicating about 

how the FOMC might act in the future could limit the Committee’s discretion to change 

policy in response to future developments.  In sum, the conventional wisdom among 

central bankers was that transparency was of little benefit for monetary policy and, in 

some cases, could cause problems that would make policy less effective.  

While communication and transparency steadily increased elsewhere in 

government and society, change came slowly to the FOMC.  It wasn’t until February 

1994 that the Committee issued a postmeeting statement disclosing a change in monetary 

policy.  Even then, it only alerted the public that the Committee had changed its policy 

stance, with scant explanation.4   

Something big was changing, however, and it would soon be the force driving 

major enhancements in the FOMC’s communication.  By the early 1990s, a growing 

body of research challenged widespread assumptions about the how central banks, such 

as the Federal Reserve, affected the economy.  The reevaluation starts with a question 

that puzzled many of my students when I was a professor:  How is it that the Federal 

Reserve manages to move a vast economy just by raising or lowering the interest rate on 

overnight loans by 1/4 of a percentage point?  

The question arises because significant spending decisions--expanding a business, 

buying a house, or choosing how much to spend on consumer goods over the year--

markets.
