 There are some obvious weaknesses with such an assortment of international

crisis and ensuing domestic reform efforts. 

 Yet there are also some strengths derived from the crowded international field of 

organizations and committees.  One such virtue is that issues not falling squarely within the remit

requirements for derivatives that are not centrally cleared.  Another is that different perspectives 

are frequently brought to bear on a single set of problems.   

 At some point, it likely will be beneficial to rationalize somewhat the overlapping,

 First, initiatives should be prioritized.  One point of emphasis should be completing, and
