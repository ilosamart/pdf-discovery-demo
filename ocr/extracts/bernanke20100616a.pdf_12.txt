Report could be enacted in the next few weeks.  Like you, we will be following 

legislative developments closely as we continue to plan for and implement reform.  

 Once again, I appreciate the valuable contribution this group has made to 

articulating an intellectual framework for transforming the lessons of the recent financial 

crisis into practical recommendations.  I look forward to discussing these issues with 

many of you in the future.
