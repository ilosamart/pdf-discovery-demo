participants continue to estimate that the longer-run normal unemployment rate lies in a 

range of 5.2 to 6 percent, and the Committee continues to believe an inflation rate of 

2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures) is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, the 

Committee reaffirmed these longer-run goals, first adopted in January 2012, just last 

month.18  Of course, our control over the economy is imperfect, and so temporary 

deviations from the FOMC’s specific longer-term goals will sometimes occur.  

Importantly, these quantitative goals are neither ceilings nor floors for inflation and 

unemployment, and the Committee will take a balanced approach to returning both 

measures to their objectives over time.    

I believe the policy steps we have taken recently are in accord with this balanced 

approach.  With employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation currently 

running, and expected to continue to run, at or below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-

term objective, it is entirely appropriate for progress in attaining maximum employment 

to take center stage in determining the Committee’s policy stance.  

While the Committee’s longer-term goals remain unchanged, what has changed is 

that the FOMC is now providing more information about how it expects to pursue its 

inflation and employment goals.  In particular, we will employ our policy tools, as 

appropriate, to raise aggregate demand and employment in the context of continued price 

stability, consistent with our balanced approach.  That’s good news for workers, because 

I believe that these steps will increase demand, and more demand means more jobs.
