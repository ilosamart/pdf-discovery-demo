5.   Migration of Financial Activities Outside the Regulatory Perimeter Must be 

Closely Monitored.  Whenever increased regulation of similar activities applies only to 

some firms, incentives increase for the unregulated actors to step up their engagement in 

those activities.  The very considerable strengthening of capital, liquidity, and other 

regulations in the wake of the financial crisis has presumably created commensurately 

significant opportunities for just such a shift of activities toward firms not subject to 

prudential regulation.  As more macroprudential regulations applicable to large financial 

firms come into effect, one can expect that market actors will be exploring possibilities 

for regulatory arbitrage.   

In the short term, the potential for migration outside the perimeter of regulated 

firms may be somewhat limited, precisely because of the dominance of large commercial 

banks in certain lending markets, of large broker-dealers in intermediation in securities 

markets, and the absence of ready alternatives to the major clearing and custody banks.  

But, if the arbitrage gains promise to be high enough, over time, unregulated market 

actors may find ways to, for example, deal directly with one another in some forms of 

securities financing.  New kinds of firms, perhaps acting solely as agents, might be 

formed to facilitate these direct transactions between unregulated firms.  

It is for this reason that the Federal Reserve and our counterparts in other member 

countries of the Financial Stability Board have been evaluating ideas for market-wide 

measures even as we move forward with steps directed principally at prudentially 

regulated firms.  Interest in broader, if not universal, regulatory charges on securities 

financing transactions has developed in recognition of the systemic risks that may
