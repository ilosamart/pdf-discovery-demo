Other labor market indicators also show moderate progress, including aggregate hours 

worked, initial unemployment insurance claims, the duration of unemployment, and the 

share of long-term unemployment.   

Conclusion 

There are many signs that the economy is healing.  If the Committee’s economic 

outlook is broadly realized, and we do see the first moderation in the pace of purchases 

later this year, that would be good news.  The first reduction in purchases, when it comes, 

will be an acknowledgement of the economy’s progress and a sign of the Committee’s 

confidence in the path to full recovery. 

In all cases, the path of policy will remain fully data-dependent.  If economic 

growth, unemployment, or inflation do not meet the Committee’s expectations, or if 

financial conditions evolve in a way that is inconsistent with continued recovery, the 

Committee will respond. 

Thanks, and I am happy to take your questions.
