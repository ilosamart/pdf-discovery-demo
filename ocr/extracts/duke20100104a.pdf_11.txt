An important element of a sustained economic recovery will be an improvement 

in labor market conditions.  Employment gains typically lag the recovery in sales and 

production in the early months of an economic upturn.  In many cycles, the lag occurs 

because businesses need to restore productivity and are reluctant to hire until they are 

more confident that any pickup in sales will be maintained.  In this cycle, the reductions 

in jobs and hours of work have been so deep, and the pressure to cut costs has been so 

strong, that businesses in the aggregate have already realized solid gains in productivity.  

As a result, I expect that businesses will begin to add jobs this year, but I anticipate that 

they will do so cautiously in order to hang on to their cost savings and efficiency gains. 

Even as the unemployment rate begins to decline later this year, it likely will 

remain high by historical standards.  Based on the experience of the last two economic 

recoveries, net gains of roughly 100,000 payroll jobs each month are needed to reduce the 

jobless rate by 0.1 percentage point.  Currently, at 10 percent, the unemployment rate is 

almost 4 percentage points higher than its peak after the 2001 recession, and a sustained 

recovery will be required to reduce it significantly.  Similarly, other measures of resource 

utilization are likely to show considerable, albeit diminishing, margins of slack for some 

time.  In that environment, product markets will be highly competitive, businesses will 

have little pricing power, and the incentives to control costs will remain strong.   

  Both overall consumer price inflation and the core rate, which excludes food and 

energy costs, look to have been about 1-1/2 percent in 2009 after having been closer to 

2 percent in 2008.  To be sure, recent readings on overall consumer price inflation have 

been boosted by another run-up in energy prices.  But those increases marked a reversal 

of some of the large declines that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009.  More
