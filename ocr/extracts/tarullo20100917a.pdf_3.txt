the collapse of the subprime housing market, participants’ lack of information about the 

collateral they held led to a shattering of confidence in all the collateral. 

In the absence of the regulation and government backstop that have applied to the 

traditional banking system since the Depression, a run on assets in the entire repo market ensued.  

The resulting forced sale of assets into an illiquid market turned many illiquid institutions into 

insolvent ones.  The fallout has been such that, to this day, the amount of repo funding available 

for non-agency, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, high-yield 

corporate bonds, and other instruments backed by assets with any degree of risk remains 

substantially below its pre-Lehman levels. 

The second Gorton insight on which this paper builds is the importance of statutory 

franchise value for the business model viability of at least some kinds of regulated financial 

entities.  Where competition from unregulated entities is permitted, explicitly or de facto, capital 

and other requirements imposed on regulated firms may shrink margins enough to make them 

unattractive to investors.  The result, as we have seen in the past, will be some combination of 

regulatory arbitrage, assumption of higher risk in permitted activities, and exit from the industry.  

Each of these outcomes at least potentially undermines the original motivation for the regulation. 

The G-M paper provides a concrete, though in some respects not fully elaborated, 

proposal to remedy the information problem in the repo market through creation of statutory 

franchise value for what G-M calls Narrow Funding Banks (NFBs).  These banks would be 

“narrow” in that their only assets would be asset-backed securities (ABS) and very high quality 

instruments such as Treasuries.  They would, it appears, make their money from the income 

streams associated with the ABS.  They would raise the funds to purchase ABS through debt 

issuance and, most significantly for the proposal, the repo market, in which the collateral offered
