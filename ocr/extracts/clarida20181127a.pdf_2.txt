I am delighted to be speaking at this annual conference of the Clearing House and 

the Bank Policy Institute.  Today I will discuss recent economic developments and the 

economic outlook before going on to outline my thinking about the connections between 

data dependence and monetary policy.  I will close with some observations on the 

implications for U.S. monetary policy that flow from this perspective.1 

Recent Economic Developments and the Economic Outlook 

U.S. economic fundamentals are robust, as indicated by strong growth in gross 

domestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside for 

nearly two years.  Smoothing across the first three quarters of this year, real, or inflation-

adjusted, GDP growth is averaging an annual rate of 3.3 percent.  Private-sector forecasts 

for the full year--that is, on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis--suggest that 

growth is likely to equal, or perhaps slightly exceed, 3 percent.  If this occurs, GDP 

growth in 2018 will be the fastest recorded so far during the current expansion, which in 

July entered its 10th year.  If, as I expect, the economic expansion continues in 2019, this 

will become the longest U.S. expansion in recorded history. 

Likewise, the labor market remains healthy.  Average monthly job gains continue 

to outpace the increase needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force over the 

longer run, with payrolls rising by 250,000 in October.  And, at 3.7 percent, the 

unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since 1969.  In addition, after remaining 

stubbornly sluggish throughout much of the expansion, nominal wage growth is picking
