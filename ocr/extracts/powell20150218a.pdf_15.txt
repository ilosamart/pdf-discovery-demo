It hardly needs saying that we must to be alert to the buildup of risks in the credit 

markets that could undermine the safety, soundness, or solvency of the G-SIBs or the 

broader system.  If deterioration in one or more of the key credit markets would credibly 

raise such threats, the Fed and the other supervisors should react preemptively.  An object 

lesson in this regard is the damage done by the accumulation of excessive exposures to 

high-risk MBS and other mortgage-related assets in the years leading up to the 

crisis.  The originate-to-distribute model of mortgage lending on its face promised a 

social-welfare-enhancing distribution of mortgage credit risk away from banks and 

toward stable capital market investors.  But the banks remained profoundly exposed 

through contractual putback rights, mortgage and MBS litigation, residual balance sheet 

holdings, and implicit support to sponsored investment vehicles. 

Since the crisis, there have been significant and eminently justified legislative and 

regulatory actions to assure that mortgage originators follow minimum underwriting 

standards and that banks are better protected from exposure to high-risk 

mortgages.  These efforts include the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules and ability-to-pay 

standards, much higher capital and liquidity requirements, stricter accounting rules that 

limit off-balance-sheet treatment for sponsored vehicles, and a much greater supervisory 

focus on litigation and reputational risk.   

Second, is there use of run-prone financing by other investors that can lead to 

damaging fire sales? 

Supervisors should be highly alert to the reemergence in the markets--that is, not 

on the balance sheets of the large banks--of structures that are prone to runs and 

damaging fire sales triggered by sharp declines in asset values.  As I mentioned earlier,
