employment relationship, this enhanced flexibility could have benefits and costs that 

accrue to workers and employers very differently.   

Although they have always been a feature of the American economic landscape, 

there has been a sharp increase in the prevalence of contingent working arrangements 

over the past decade, and it is too early to tell how much of this acceleration is a cyclical 

phenomenon associated with the Great Recession or reflects a structural trend.  The 

growing share and variety of contingent work has important implications for policy and 

puts a premium on data and research exploring this topic.  For monetary policy, the 

growth of contingent work affects the way we assess maximum employment and the way 

we interpret important labor market outcomes, such as the level of part-time employment 

and aggregate hours worked.  Depending on the contractual arrangements, it may also 

have important implications for economic security and the behavior of households as 

consumers and savers.  Richer and timely data and analysis could help guide employers, 

workers, and public officials toward outcomes where benefits and risks are better 

understood and managed.   

What Do We Know about Contingent Work? 

Official measures of the changing nature of work have not kept pace with the 

evolution of the economy.  But thanks to some cutting-edge researchers, several of whom 

are present today, there is a growing foundation of analysis.   

Last year, Larry Katz and Alan Krueger conducted a version of the Contingent 

Worker Survey (CWS) to track alternative and nonstandard work arrangements using the 

RAND American Life Panel.2  Their findings are striking:  Over the past decade,

alternative and nonstandard work.  The survey was last fielded in 2005.
