The Need for Fiscal Sustainability  


Let me return to the issue of longer-term fiscal sustainability.  As I have 

discussed, projections by the CBO and others show future budget deficits and debts rising 

indefinitely, and at increasing rates.  To be sure, projections are to some degree only 

hypothetical exercises.  Almost by definition, unsustainable trajectories of deficits and 

debts will never actually transpire, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a 

country in which the fiscal debt relative to the national income is rising without limit.  

Herbert Stein, a wise economist, once said, “If something cannot go on forever, it will 

stop.”9

  One way or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federal budget 

will certainly occur at some point.  The only real question is whether these adjustments 

will take place through a careful and deliberative process that weighs priorities and gives 

people plenty of time to adjust to changes in government programs or tax policies, or 

whether the needed fiscal adjustments will be a rapid and painful response to a looming 

or actual fiscal crisis.  Although the choices and tradeoffs necessary to achieve fiscal 

sustainability are difficult indeed, surely it is better to make these choices deliberatively 

and thoughtfully.
