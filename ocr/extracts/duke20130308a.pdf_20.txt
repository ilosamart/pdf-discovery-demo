transmitted to the economy, as the difference between MBS yields and mortgage rates is 

still somewhat wide and, as I discussed earlier, tight credit has prevented many 

households from accessing the low rates.  Any improvement in credit conditions would 

thus act to improve the efficacy of MBS purchases.  Similarly, policies that constrain 

mortgage lending or increase its cost would reduce efficacy. 

I think the additional impetus to housing from MBS purchases is appropriate for 

at least three reasons.  First, the housing market has suffered extraordinary damage 

during the past few years.  Second, even with the recent positive signs, housing 

investment has contributed far less to economic growth than in a typical recovery.  And, 

third, even as terms and standards on other types of credit have eased, standards for 

mortgage credit remain quite tight.  

While the purchase of agency MBS has some special efficacy in supporting 

housing markets, the peculiarities of the MBS market itself present some potential market 

functioning issues that bear monitoring.  The MBS market is not as deep or as liquid as 

the Treasury market, and the total size of the market is not growing as quickly.  As 

refinancing activity slows, the gross pace of new MBS issuance could slow as well, and 

Federal Reserve purchases at the current level could leave an even larger footprint in the 

secondary mortgage market.  So it is entirely possible that it might be appropriate at some 

point to adjust the pace of MBS purchases in response to developments in primary or 

secondary mortgage markets.  Within the context of the Committeeâ€™s judgment about the 

appropriate overall level of monetary accommodation, such an adjustment could result in 

an increase or decrease in the pace of total asset purchases, or it could lead to a change in 

the composition of purchases.
