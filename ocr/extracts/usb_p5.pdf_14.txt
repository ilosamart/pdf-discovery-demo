Review of Regulatory Reports
Effective date July 1997 Section 5060.1

The regulatory agencies rely on the timely and
accurate filing of regulatory reports by domestic
and foreign financial institutions. Data collected
from regulatory reports facilitate early identifi-
cation of problem situations. The Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement
Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) amended various banking statutes to
enhance the Federal Reserve’s authority to assess
civil money penalties against state member
banks, bank holding companies and FBOs that
file late, false, or misleading regulatory reports.
The civil money penalties also can be assessed
against individuals who cause or participate in
such filings including those who sign officially
submitted reports.

FILING

The Federal Reserve has identified a late regu-
latory report as an official copy of a report that
is not received by the Reserve Bank or its
designated electronic collection agent in a timely
manner. The filing of a completed original
report is timely in the following cases:

• The report is received by the Reserve Bank at
the end of the reporting day on the submission
deadline, including reports filed electronically;

• The report is mailed first class and is post-
marked no later than the third calendar day
preceding the submission deadline, no matter
when the report is received by the district
Federal Reserve Bank. In the absence of a
postmark, an institution may be called upon to
provide proof of timely mailing, if the report
has been received after the submission dead-
line; or

• The completed original report is delivered to
an overnight package delivery service on the
day before the submission deadline. An insti-
tution may be called upon to provide proof of
timely delivery to the service, if the report has
been received after the submission deadline.

The filing of a false report generally involves
the submission of mathematically incorrect data,
such as addition errors or transpositions, the
submission of call reports without appropriate
schedules, or the inadvertent filing of inaccurate
information. Conversely, the filing of a mislead-

ing report involves some degree of knowing or
reckless behavior on the part of the filer and the
intentional or negligent submission of inaccu-
rate information to the Federal Reserve.

FEDERAL RESERVE
REGULATORY REPORTS
MONITORING SYSTEM

The Federal Reserve System has a Regulatory
Reports Monitoring Program (program) to iden-
tify those banking institutions under its supervi-
sion that file late and false reports. Each Reserve
Bank maintains records of late and false report-
ers and submits summary reports of these records
to Board staff after every reporting period.

To promote consistent treatment under the
program, the Reserve Banks may not grant grace
periods or extensions of the submission dates of
regulatory reports. In addition, the program
requires Board staff responsible for enforcement
actions to consult with Reserve Bank staff to
ensure that appropriate follow-up supervisory
actions are taken, and that the Federal Reserve
addresses all instances of chronic late and false
regulatory reporting through civil money penal-
ties or other enforcement proceedings.

REVIEW OF REGULATORY
REPORTS

Review of regulatory reports involves determin-
ing whether the management of the branch has
submitted all required reports to the Federal
Reserve in a timely and accurate manner. The
examiner assigned to a specific department in
the branch is responsible for reviewing those
reports relating to that department and verifying
that the reports are accurate, meet statutory and
regulatory requirements, and agree with the
branch’s financial records. The examiner-in-
charge is to consolidate the findings of the
examination team and submit a list of regulatory
reporting errors to the appropriate Reserve Bank
staff, who will determine the extent to which the
branch will be required to file amended reports.

Examiners should discuss with Reserve Bank
staff any regulatory report that is considered
misleading as such a report could lead to the
issuance of suspicious activities report(s) against
