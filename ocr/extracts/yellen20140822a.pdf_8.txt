less to declining participation in the period ahead than would otherwise be expected 

based on the aging workforce.11     

A second factor bearing on estimates of labor market slack is the elevated number 

of workers who are employed part time but desire full-time work (those classified as 

“part time for economic reasons”).  At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of 

such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical 

historically, providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate 

may understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market.  Again, however, 

some portion of the rise in involuntary part-time work may reflect structural rather than 

cyclical factors.  For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from goods 

production and toward services, a sector which historically has used a greater portion of 

part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs.  Likewise, the continuing 

decline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part-time jobs, may 

raise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12  Despite these challenges in 

assessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in 

                                                 
11 The effects of the Great Recession on retirements are difficult to identify.  During the recession and 

immediately after, the losses in wealth may have put upward pressure on labor force participation; the 

persistently weak labor market may have subsequently contributed to more retirements and thus put 

downward pressure on participation.  Perhaps as a result of these confounding forces, early research on the 

effects of the Great Recession on retirement finds unclear results.  For example, see Alan L. Gustman, 

Thomas L. Steinmeier, and Nahid Tabatabai (2011), “How Did the Recession of 2007-2009 Affect the 

Wealth and Retirement of the Near Retirement Age Population in the Health and Retirement Study?”

October).  For a discussion of these developments, see Richard W. Johnson (2012), “Older Workers, 

Retirement, and the Great Recession” (Stanford, Calif.:  Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Center
