  The proposed rules, in conjunction with other 

elements of the Dodd-Frank Act, are designed to make these firms safer and to force 

large firms to take into account the costs that their potential failure could impose on the 

broader financial system.  

These new standards are not meant to apply to, and clearly would not be 

appropriate for, community banks.  Indeed, the Dodd-Frank Act explicitly exempts 

community banks from these new enhanced standards.  Community banks express 

concern that the more stringent requirements for larger institutions will eventually find 

their way to smaller firms; that, however, is not our intent, and we will work to ensure 

that it does not happen.  An example that predates the Dodd-Frank Act is the interagency 

guidance issued in June 2010 covering incentive compensation.

  In that guidance, we 

were careful to note simplified expectations for community banks that did not make 

extensive use of incentive compensation.  We intend to continue this practice for other 

policies and guidance and to continue to speak with community bankers to respond to 

their questions and concerns and to clarify our supervisory expectations. 

Given the ongoing supervisory and regulatory changes, the Board and its senior-

level staff members have made it a priority to work with other regulators to increase the 

coordination and consistency of regulation across a banking industry that has multiple 

regulators and charters.  We regularly consult on these matters with the Consumer 

Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other
