The Economic Outlook 

The United States has been through a severe recession--a consequence of the correction 

of excesses that had accumulated in the economy and financial markets.  Today, I would like to 

take stock of where we are in that correction by discussing the outlook for the economy.  To 

summarize in a sentence:  We have worked through a lot of the problems that initiated and 

deepened the downturn, but not all of them, and thus the pace of the recovery is likely to be 

restrained.   

I last spoke on the economic outlook in October, and my views since then remain largely 

unchanged--though, I should hasten to add, not because I am too lazy to update my forecast!  

Rather, the data since last fall have been broadly in line with my earlier expectations and suggest 

that a moderate recovery is under way, accompanied by low inflation.  Of course, things could 

well have turned out differently:  Given the extraordinary events of the past few years, by now 

we could be experiencing a relapse into recession or, alternatively, a strong rebound.  The fact 

that conditions evolved largely as had been expected last fall suggests that the future may, just 

may, be a bit less uncertain than before.  Even if that is the case, considerable uncertainty about 

the outlook remains, and at the conclusion of my remarks I will touch on some of the 

implications of that uncertainty for monetary policy.      

Before proceeding, I should emphasize that my remarks today reflect my own views and 

not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).1 

Recent Developments  

After declining for a year and a half, economic activity bottomed out in the middle of last 

year and subsequently turned up.  A number of factors have fostered the recovery.  The steps
