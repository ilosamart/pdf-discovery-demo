assets and reduce lending rapidly when that funding source evaporated, thereby compounding 

risks to U.S. financial stability.     

Although the United States did not suffer a destabilizing failure of foreign banks, many 

rode out the crisis only with the help of extraordinary support from home- and host-country 

regulators.  Following national treatment practice, the Federal Reserve itself provided substantial 

discount window access to U.S. branches and the opportunity to participate in the Primary Dealer 

Credit Facility to U.S. primary-dealer subsidiaries of foreign banks.  Moreover, the potential for 

funding disruptions did not disappear with the waning of the global financial crisis.  In 2011, for 

example, as concerns about the euro zone rose, U.S. money market funds suddenly pulled back 

their lending to large euro area banks, reducing lending to these firms by roughly $200 billion 

over just four months.

  While there has been some reduction in operations and some change in funding patterns 

by foreign banking organizations in the United States since the crisis, particularly by European 

firms reacting to euro zone financial stress, the basic circumstances have not changed.

  The 

proportion of foreign banking assets to total U.S. banking assets has remained at about one-fifth 

since the end of the 1990s.  But the concentration and complexity of those assets have changed 

noticeably from earlier decades, and have not reversed in recent years despite the global financial 

crisis and subsequent events.  Ten foreign banks now account for more than two-thirds of foreign 

bank third-party assets held in the United States, up from 40 percent in 1995.

 The significant funding pressures experienced by a number of European firms in 2011, highlighted by a quiet run 

by money market funds and other short-term funders, were mitigated by the liquidity-support measures undertaken 

by the European Central Bank.  As a result, many of the U.S. operations of these firms are currently receiving net 

funding from their parents.  A parallel development has been a shift in lending activity from a number of European 

firms to non-European firms, even as the total proportion of U.S. lending accounted for by foreign banks has 

remained roughly constant in the last few years.
