I would like to thank Bill Dudley and Sara Horowitz for inviting me to participate 

in today’s conference.  The subject we are tackling today--the evolution of work--is a 

particular interest of mine and is a matter of great importance to the Federal Reserve.  

The Congress has mandated the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy so as to 

promote maximum employment and stable prices.  Our dual mandate recognizes the 

importance of work in enabling people to contribute to the financial security of their 

family and the prosperity of their community and the country overall.  Moreover, there is

flexibility than long-term employment contracts, allowing workers and employers to 

move in and out of work relationships easily.  Depending on the nature of the 

                                                 
I am grateful to Stephanie Aaronson, Dave Buchholz, Andrew Figura, Joseph Firschein, Arturo Gonzalez, 

Barbara Lipman, Barbara Robles, Marysol Weindorf, and Alison Weingarden for their assistance in 

preparing this text.
