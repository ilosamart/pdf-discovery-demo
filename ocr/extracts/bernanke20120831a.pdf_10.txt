Now I will turn to our use of communications tools.   

Communication Tools 

Clear communication is always important in central banking, but it can be 

especially important when economic conditions call for further policy stimulus but the 

policy rate is already at its effective lower bound.  In particular, forward guidance that 

lowers private-sector expectations regarding future short-term rates should cause longer-

term interest rates to decline, leading to more accommodative financial conditions.18    

The Federal Reserve has made considerable use of forward guidance as a policy 

tool.19  From March 2009 through June 2011, the FOMC’s postmeeting statement noted 

that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 

funds rate for an extended period.”20  At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee made 

its guidance more precise by stating that economic conditions would likely warrant that 

the federal funds rate remain exceptionally low “at least through mid-2013.”21  At the 

beginning of this year, the FOMC extended the anticipated period of exceptionally low 

rates further, to “at least through late 2014,” guidance that has been reaffirmed at 

subsequent meetings.22  As the language indicates, this guidance is not an unconditional 

promise; rather, it is a statement about the FOMC’s collective judgment regarding the 

                                                            
18 See Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Levin and others (2010) for discussions of the role of 
communication at the zero lower bound. 
19 As with asset purchases, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in using forward policy guidance.  The 
Bank of Canada, for example, announced in April 2009 its intention to hold the overnight policy at 25 basis 
points through the second quarter of 2010; this conditional guidance was subject to the bank’s assessment 
of future inflation trends.  The Bank of Japan has long provided forward guidance linking policy to 
economic developments.  In March 2001, for example, the Bank of Japan committed to maintain its policy 
rate at zero until Japanese consumer prices stabilized or exhibited a year-on-year increase.  The Riksbank 
and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in recent years have made statements about the future course of the 
policy rate similar to those provided by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada.
