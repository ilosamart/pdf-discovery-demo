regulatory costs that are not necessary to achieve a given set of regulatory aims, thereby lowering 

the cost of the underlying economic activity.  But it is also motivated by the advantage to be 

gained if supervisory resources can be deployed where their payoff in achieving well-specified 

regulatory aims will be highest.   

Community banks.  I will begin again with community banks.  Community bankers often 

argue that they are subject to a range of rules and requirements that are not really necessary 

given the relevant regulatory aim which, as previously suggested, is quite straightforward.  That 

regulatory aim needs to be implemented with an eye to the context in which community banks 

operate.  One obvious point of context is that any regulatory requirement is likely to be 

disproportionately costly for community banks, since the fixed costs associated with compliance 

must be spread over a smaller base of assets.   

A second important point of context is the business model of community banks.  As is 

well-known, over the past few decades they have substantially reduced their presence in lines of 

business such as consumer lending in the face of competition from larger banks benefiting from 

economies of scale.  Today, as a group, their most important forms of lending are to small- and 

medium-sized businesses.  Smaller community banks—those with less than $1 billion in assets—

account for nearly a quarter of commercial and industrial lending, and nearly 40 percent of 

commercial real estate lending, to small- and medium-sized businesses, despite their having less 

than 10 percent of total commercial banking assets. 

This state of affairs is not surprising when one considers that credit extension to smaller 

firms is an area in which the relationship lending model of community banks retains a 

comparative advantage.  It means that community banks are of special significance to local 

economies.  It also means that, particularly in rural areas, the disappearance of community banks
