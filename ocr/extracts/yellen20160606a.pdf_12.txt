development spending, and the start-up of new firms, and that these factors have, in turn, 

lowered productivity growth.  With time, I expect this effect to ease in a stronger 

economy.11  I also see no obvious slowdown in the pace or the potential benefits of 

innovation in America, which likewise may bear fruit more readily in a stronger 

economy.  In the meantime, it would be helpful to adopt public policies designed to boost 

productivity.  Strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment, public 

and private, will support longer-term growth in productivity and greater gains in living 

standards.  

A fourth important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly 

inflation will move back to 2 percent.  As long as oil prices do not resume their earlier 

declines and the dollar does not rise substantially further, my expectation is that inflation 

will move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years.  But oil prices and the dollar 

can move unpredictably.  In addition, a further strengthening of labor market conditions 

would typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next 

couple of years; but such estimates are inherently imprecise, and the effect on inflation 

could turn out to be significantly different, either upward or downward, than I expect.   

Uncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects, in part, uncertainty 

about the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting.  For 

two decades, inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to 

temporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices.  The most convincing 

explanation for this stability, in my view, is that longer-term inflation expectations have 

remained quite stable.12  So it bears noting that some survey measures of longer-term
