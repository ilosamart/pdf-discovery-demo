I want to thank the Brookings Institution for inviting me to comment today on 

Martin Wheatleyâ€™s presentation on the Fair and Effective Markets Review (Review). 1 

The Review is an ambitious and important initiative.  Although London is perhaps the 

leading center for many fixed-income, currency, and commodities (FICC) markets, these 

markets are global, and the United States and the largest U.S. firms play key roles in 

them.  So the Review addresses issues that affect our markets as well.   

The Review looks to identify further steps that should be taken to restore public 

confidence in FICC markets in the wake of the depressingly numerous instances of 

serious misconduct in these markets in recent years.  That misconduct has been, and will 

continue to be, addressed through substantial fines and criminal prosecution of the firms 

and individuals involved.  The Federal Reserve continues to take part in these 

enforcement actions in cooperation with other U.S. agencies.    

The design of the Review is not only to advance the enforcement process, but also 

to look carefully at markets and firms and ask whether there are structural vulnerabilities 

or incentives for bad conduct that have not been well addressed by reforms to date.  I will 

offer comments on a few specific areas and discuss some of our parallel efforts here in 

the United States.   

First, as the Review notes, there is a perception that FICC markets and their 

participants are highly sophisticated and do not need protection.  While that may be 

generally true, the perspective is too narrow, because the importance of these markets 

extends far beyond the largest participants in them.  The market mechanism allocates 

credit and determines the borrowing costs of households, companies and governments.

Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.
