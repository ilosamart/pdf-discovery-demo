Reserve generally find that the securities purchase programs have provided significant 

help for the economy.  For example, a study using the Board’s FRB/US model of the 

economy found that, as of 2012, the first two rounds of LSAPs may have raised the level 

of output by almost 3 percent and increased private payroll employment by more than 2 

million jobs, relative to what otherwise would have occurred.15  The Bank of England has 

used LSAPs in a manner similar to that of the Federal Reserve, so it is of interest that 

researchers have found the financial and macroeconomic effects of the British programs 

to be qualitatively similar to those in the United States.16 

To be sure, these estimates of the macroeconomic effects of LSAPs should be 

treated with caution.  It is likely that the crisis and the recession have attenuated some of 

the normal transmission channels of monetary policy relative to what is assumed in the 

models; for example, restrictive mortgage underwriting standards have reduced the 

effects of lower mortgage rates.  Further, the estimated macroeconomic effects depend on 

uncertain estimates of the persistence of the effects of LSAPs on financial conditions.17  

Overall, however, a balanced reading of the evidence supports the conclusion that central 

bank securities purchases have provided meaningful support to the economic recovery 

while mitigating deflationary risks.  

                                                            
15 See Chung and others (2012) for details of assumptions and simulation results.  Focusing only on the 
second LSAP program, Fuhrer and Olivei (2011) find comparable effects, attributing to that program a bit 
less than a 1 percent increase in output and 700,000 new jobs.  Using different methodologies, Kiley (2012) 
finds significantly smaller effects and Baumeister and Benati (2010) find larger effects.   
16 Joyce, Tong, and Woods (2011) summarize a range of estimates of the macroeconomic effects of the 
Bank of England’s quantitative easing program, which, relative to size of the U.K. economy, is roughly 
equivalent in scale to the Federal Reserve’s two LSAP programs.  Those estimates suggest a peak effect of 
1-1/2 to 2 percent for real output and between 3/4 and 1-1/2 percent for inflation in the United Kingdom.  
See also Baumeister and Benati (2010) and Christensen and Rudebusch (2012). 
17 For example, while the macroeconomic effects reported by Chung and others (2012) are consistent with 
the persistence of financial effects as estimated by Li and Wei (2012), Wright (2012) finds much less 
persistence using a different methodology.  Kiley (2012) also provides arguments and evidence for why 
LSAPs may have been less stimulative than found in Chung and others (2012) and Fuhrer and Olivei 
(2011).
