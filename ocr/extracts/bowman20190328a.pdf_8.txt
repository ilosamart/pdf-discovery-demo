commercial banks.  As I noted earlier, farm income has declined by approximately  

50 percent since 2013, yet agricultural loans have steadily increased.  Additionally, 

agricultural banks have more challenging funding structures given the seasonal funding 

needs of their agricultural customers and the difficulty of attracting deposits at rural 

institutions.  This combination of a cyclical deposit base, lower inflows of deposits into 

rural community banks, and growing loan demand from agricultural borrowers has 

resulted in a greater dependence on borrowed funds to support the recent growth in 

agricultural lending.  

Approximately one-third of all agricultural banks are highly concentrated 

agricultural banks, and the number of these banks has declined slightly over the past 

several years--from 479 in December 2016 to 449 in September 2018.  Although there 

are some unique risks and challenges for highly concentrated agricultural banks and their 

supervisors, these banks also generally remain in sound financial condition.  And capital 

levels and liquidity metrics at most ag banks are generally in line with other banks that do 

not share these concentrations. 

While concentrated agricultural banks are currently operating with adequate 

capital ratios, regulators continue to closely monitor capital levels and to encourage 

prudent capital planning and concentration risk management, given the potential for 

unforeseen challenges and emerging risks associated with agricultural lending. 

With respect to liquidity, as previously noted, rapid asset growth can strain a 

bankâ€™s liquidity position if its funding sources turn out to be unstable.  As supervisors, we 

work with bankers to understand their liquidity planning process, their challenges around 

attracting deposits, and the risks associated with potentially relying too heavily on
