The number of part-time workers who want full time work remains above pre-

crisis levels, which suggests that there may be some remaining slack there as well.  In 

addition, we should expect to see stronger wage increases as the labor market tightens.  

There are welcome signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average 

hourly earnings, which are rising faster than the sum of inflation and productivity growth. 

After several years of improving labor market conditions, recent data have been 

sending mixed signals on the level of momentum in the economy.  Business investment 

has weakened, even outside the energy sector.  Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 

is estimated to have slowed to a rate of only 1-1/4 percent on an annualized basis over the 

fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.  Incoming data do point to a 

rebound.  For example, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which bases its projection on 

a range of incoming monthly data, estimates growth of 2.6 percent in the second quarter.  

In contrast, the labor market data, especially the monthly increase in payroll jobs, after 

displaying considerable strength for several years right through the first quarter of 2016, 

weakened significantly in April and May.  While I would not want to make too much of 

two monthly observations, the strength of the labor market has been a key feature of the 

recovery, allowing us to look through quarterly fluctuations in GDP growth.  So the 

possible loss of momentum in job growth is worrisome.        

Turning to the inflation part of the mandate, the Fed’s preferred measure of 

inflation has consistently run below our 2 percent objective since the end of the financial 

crisis, with the exception of the “Arab Spring” period in 2011, when oil prices 

temporarily spiked.  For the 12 months ending in April, total inflation was only 1 percent, 

while core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was 1-1/2 percent.  Core inflation
