to them over the next two years.  In contrast, for nonprime borrowers, more than half of 

the respondents thought that standards would remain tighter through at least 2013 or 

would not return to longer-run norms for the foreseeable future.    

In addition to reductions in existing credit lines, new credit card account 

solicitations also fell considerably during the recession.  By early 2009, offers to 

households for new credit cards had dropped to around one-fifth of their count in 2006.  

Card solicitations have turned up over the course of 2010, but they remain well below 

their pre-crisis levels.  In addition, consistent with the SLOOS, the data on credit card 

offers show that solicitations to borrowers with lower credit scores are rebounding more 

slowly than those to borrowers with higher scores.  

Interest rates may have caused some households to reduce their credit card usage 

even if unused credit lines remained available.  Although credit card interest rates 

declined in line with broader interest rates early in the financial crisis, card rates diverged 

from the broader rate environment by reversing this decline during 2009.  Some of the 

rate increase likely reflects a rise in charge-offs, which increases card issuers’ costs of 

providing credit.  However, the divergence from rates on other forms of credit that also 

experienced higher charge-offs indicates that a portion of the increase may have been in 

anticipation of regulatory changes, which I will discuss a bit later, that will restrict some 

card issuers’ ability to reprice credit. 

Overall, then, the available data lead me to conclude that, in large part, the decline 

in revolving consumer credit outstanding is due to a combination of higher charge-offs, 

tighter credit, and less consumer willingness to take on debt, but probably not to 

widespread increases in discretionary paydowns of existing debt.
