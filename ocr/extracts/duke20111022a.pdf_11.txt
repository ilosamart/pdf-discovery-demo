Conclusion 

 It has been my pleasure to share my thoughts with you on this important topic.  As you 

plan for your financial future, please keep in mind that planning is a process.  You have taken the 

important first step in this process simply by being here to learn more about tools and resources 

available to help you and your family.  But putting those tools to use is not necessarily easy.  I 

know from first-hand experience that understanding the basics of nutrition doesnâ€™t make it any 

easier to stay on a diet.  But I also know from experience that making a plan and sticking to it 

brings real success whether in the form of a healthier lifestyle or in the form of a more secure 

financial future.   

And as I said at the outset, as we all work to improve our individual financial stability, 

we will ultimately build a stronger economy.  I wish you all great success.
