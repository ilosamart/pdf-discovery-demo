financial shocks were largely outside the emerging markets, the international 

transmission of these disturbances was extraordinarily rapid.  In the emerging market 

economies, these disturbances manifested themselves principally in terms of volatile 

capital flows, with capital outflows earlier in the crisis and capital inflows today each 

creating significant financial and economic challenges.  Strengthening the international 

financial system and ensuring that financial institutions are carefully regulated, well 

capitalized, liquid, and transparent will require extensive international cooperation.  On a 

global level, the leadership of the Group of Twenty (G-20)--which Korea is currently 

chairing--will be essential in ensuring that reforms are not only strong and effective but 

also consistent and coordinated across countries. 

Two important features of the crisis were the increased use of unconventional 

policies and enhanced cooperation among central banks, including between the Federal 

Reserve and the Bank of Korea.  Yet another challenge for central banks will be to make 

good use of what we learned during the crisis--to determine whether and how the toolkit 

of central banks can be expanded, and to find ways to build on central bank cooperation 

during the crisis to develop stronger working relationships and collaboration in the future.  

Taking such steps now will improve our ability to respond effectively to any future crisis.  

But even as central banks develop new tools to address new challenges, they must 

continue to place great weight on the factors that have been shown to enhance the 

credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy:  central bank independence, 

accountability and transparency, and effective communication.  Together with strong 

financial reforms, monetary policy built on these principles will assist the recovery and 

promote future growth and stability.
