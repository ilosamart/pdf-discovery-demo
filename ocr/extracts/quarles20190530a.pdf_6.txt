we do not fully understand the cost–benefit tradeoff and whether monetary policy 

adjustments for financial stability reasons may be appropriate at some times. 

Whither Macroprudential Policy? 

Of course, there is one additional and critical factor to consider when weighing 

adjustments to the stance of monetary policy for financial stability reasons:  the 

availability and efficacy of other instruments to promote financial stability.  After all, the 

pursuit of multiple goals—full employment, price stability, and financial stability, for 

example—likely requires multiple tools.  This is just common sense.  Economists have a 

name for this common-sense notion:  the Tinbergen principle. 

Effective supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential policy tools appear to be 

well placed to address financial vulnerabilities.  In particular, these tools may be used to 

increase the resilience of the financial sector against a broad range of adverse shocks and, 

perhaps, lean against the buildup of specific financial vulnerabilities.  At the Federal 

Reserve, we have emphasized a set of structural, or through-the-cycle, regulatory and 

supervisory policies as our primary macroprudential tools to promote financial stability.  

These measures include strong capital and liquidity requirements for banks, especially the 

largest and most systemic institutions.  In addition, our supervisory stress tests evaluate 

the ability of large banks to weather severe economic stress and the failure of their largest 

counterparty as well as examining the risk-management practices of the firms.  Moreover, 

the stress-test scenarios are designed to generally be more severe during buoyant 

economic periods when vulnerabilities may build.  Furthermore, our stress tests consider 

the potential effects of specific risks we have identified in our financial stability 

monitoring work.  For example, the tests in recent years have included hypothetical
