in the past, we all owe it to the global community to seek out opportunities for improved 

cooperation and engagement. 

To improve FSB transparency, we will be taking a number of important steps.  For 

example, on February 12, 2019, the FSB published a comprehensive work program on its 

website for the year ahead.1  This is the first time in the FSB’s history that the work program was 

disseminated publicly.  Over the term of my chairmanship, I will continue to look for steps that 

will allow all stakeholders to have a more open window into the FSB’s decisionmaking process 

and products.  I believe improved transparency into the FSB process is critical to our mission. 

I’m reminded of Lord Hewart’s famous--and oft-quoted--remark concerning the importance of 

jurisprudence to the public: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.”  We 

should be able to apply this concept to the field of global financial standard setting. 

Rigorous Vigilance 

The second principle I would like to discuss concerns how we assess and mitigate 

vulnerabilities in the global financial system.  The post-crisis reforms addressed the fault lines 

that led to the crisis and the contagion effects felt around the world, but they will never replace 

the need for vigilance.  If we are not rigorously vigilant, we still risk another crisis.  What we 

need are forward-looking methodologies that use the most advanced analytical tools to spot 

vulnerabilities well in advance before they lead to widespread financial distress and economic 

costs.  Here the academic community can continue to contribute with cutting-edge and robust 

modeling techniques. 

We can only mitigate financial vulnerabilities if we identify them accurately and in a 

timely manner.  As such, the FSB’s Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities under
