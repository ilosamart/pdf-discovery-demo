 Clearly, the recent mortgage crisis has highlighted the potential ramifications of a 

mortgage market that is not functioning well.  HMDA data do not create the market or 

solve all market problems, but they do help us understand what is happening in the 

market.  The time is certainly ripe for reviewing and revising the data elements, 

standards, and reporting formats.   

 HMDA has three purposes.  One is to provide the public and government officials 

with data that will help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of the 

neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.  A second is to help 

government officials target public investment to promote private investment where it is 

needed.  A third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory 

lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, such as the 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

 Todayâ€™s hearing is intended to serve as a venue to discuss whether or not the 2002 

revisions to Regulation C provided useful and accurate information about the mortgage 

market, to gather information that will help assess the need for additional data elements 

or improvements, and to identify emerging issues in the mortgage market that may 

require additional research.  As I said earlier, we are also interested in any comments on 

the implementation of the HMDA elements of the regulatory reform legislation. 

 We have gathered this morning an impressive array of panelists representing a 

broad spectrum of vantage points, and we look forward to their comments.  This input, 

together with the input of the preceding hearings and written comments submitted from 

the public, will be carefully weighed as we consider changes to Regulation C.
