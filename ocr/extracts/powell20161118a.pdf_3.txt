Documenting the Global Trade Slowdown and Its Likely Causes 

To set the scene, I will review the main features of the recent global trade slowdown.  As 

you can see on the first slide, growth in world trade rebounded after the Great Recession but has 

slowed substantially since 2011.  On a real inflation-adjusted basis, world imports have grown at 

an average annual rate of less than 3-1/2 percent since 2011, about half the 7 percent pace seen in 

the eight years prior to the Global Financial Crisis.3  As illustrated in the next slide, trade is no 

longer outpacing GDP growth.  The share of real world imports in world GDP has been flat at 

just under 30 percent since 2011 after nearly doubling between 1985 and 2007.4  This sustained 

slowing of real trade relative to GDP is quite unusual:  Since 1870, trade has generally grown 

faster than production, outside of wartime and recessionary periods.   

Trade has been sluggish almost everywhere.  Real trade growth has been lower over the 

2011-15 period compared with the 2000-07 period for every G-20 country outside of Japan, 

where trade growth was constant.  The third slide shows that the fall in real import growth in 

emerging Asia has been particularly pronounced from over 10 percent in the first period to just 

about 3 percent in the second.  But import growth has declined in Latin America and the 

advanced economies as well.  

The next slide shows the differential between real import growth and real GDP growth 

for the same two periods.  For emerging Asia, the differential went from positive to substantially 

negative, indicating that real import growth slowed to well below real GDP growth.  In advanced 


3 In principle, data on either world exports or world imports could be used to study global trade, though the two 
differ in practice.  My remarks here focus on import data, which are generally regarded as more reliable at the 
country level. 
4 The share of nominal world imports to nominal GDP has actually been declining since 2011, with a particularly 
sharp drop in 2015, reflecting steep declines in commodity prices.
