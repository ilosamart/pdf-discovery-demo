the specific, sophisticated character of the kind of stress test we ran this year is surely neither 

necessary nor suitable for smaller banking organizations.  For firms with more than $10 billion 

but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the nature of any stress testing requirements 

will be quite different from that used in the CCAR.  For banks with assets of $10 billion or less, I 

would not expect any kind of supervisory stress testing requirements.
