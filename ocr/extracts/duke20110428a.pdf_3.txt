faced by communities and targeted strategies to deal with them.  Everyone has heard 

about the foreclosure crisis, but it helps to see what it really looks like.  So, we’re 

featuring three very different cities in a series of video reports that will be accessible on 

the Federal Reserve’s website.  These “Reports from the Field” showcase three promising 

stabilization efforts that highlight grassroots innovation and collaboration.   

Cleveland 

Cleveland neighborhoods face five decades of population loss, outmigration of 

jobs, and urban sprawl, in addition to the more recent wave of foreclosures.  Despite 

these persistent challenges, city leaders have responded with dynamic leadership.  In 

Cleveland, public and private partners have created an innovative stabilization strategy 

that uses targeted data to help community leaders focus scarce resources on the 

neighborhoods that have the best chance for success.  This is a model that has great 

potential to be replicated in other cities.  Let’s watch Cleveland’s story.

As the video highlights, Cleveland’s success is built around both on-the-ground 

community outreach and intensive data collection that helps to identify block-level and 

community-level trends.  It showcases strong collaboration among city and county 

officials; nonprofits like Neighborhood Progress, Inc.; local foundations; and universities.  

The Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing (NEO CANDO) 

provides cutting-edge analytical mapping tools, and these data help steer resources into 

neighborhoods where the money will have the greatest impact.  This “tipping point” 

strategy relies on the comprehensive investment of public and private resources for 

sustained stabilization.
