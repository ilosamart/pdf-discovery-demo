including housing construction and manufacturing, are important to the Rhode Island 

economy.1  

The Federal Reserve took action to help stabilize the financial system during the 

crisis, and we have supported the economic recovery with monetary policy actions 

designed to hold down longer-term interest rates.  With this help, the economy has made 

significant strides.  The pace of job gains has gradually strengthened, and payrolls 

expanded by more than 3 million in 2014 alone.  The unemployment rate has come down 

steadily to 5.4 percent in April.  One sign of a stronger labor market is that the number of 

job openings has risen impressively, and another is that more workers are quitting their 

jobs, signaling greater confidence in their ability to find a new job.   

Rhode Island is sharing in this recovery, but I am well aware that economic 

conditions remain difficult here.  Rhode Island’s unemployment rate improved very 

slowly during the recovery, and, for a time, it was the highest of any state.  The jobless 

rate has come down a lot over the past year or so, but at 6.3 percent in March, 

unemployment here remains above the national average, and payroll employment has yet 

to regain its pre-recession peak.   

In recent months, some economic data have suggested that the pace of 

improvement in the economy may have slowed, a topic I will address in a moment.  And 

even with the significant gains of the past couple years, it is only now, six years after the 

recession ended, that the labor market is approaching its full strength.
