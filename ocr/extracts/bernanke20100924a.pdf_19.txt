the complex interactions of risk-taking, liquidity, and capital in our financial system and 

the implications of these factors for economic growth and stability.14

It would also be fruitful, I think, if “closed-economy” macroeconomists would 

look more carefully at the work of international economists on financial crises.  Drawing 

on the substantial experience in emerging market economies, international economists 

have examined the origins and economic effects of banking and currency crises in some 

detail.  They have also devoted considerable research to the international contagion of 

financial crises, a related topic that is of obvious relevance to our recent experience.   


Finally, macroeconomic modeling must accommodate the possibility of 

unconventional monetary policies, a number of which have been used during the crisis.  

Earlier work on this topic relied primarily on the example of Japan; now, a number of 

data points can be used.  For example, the experience of the United States and the United 

Kingdom with large-scale asset purchases could be explored to improve our 

understanding of the effects of such transactions on longer-term yields and how such 

effects can be incorporated into modern models of the term structure of interest rates.15
