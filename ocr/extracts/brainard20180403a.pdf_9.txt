By design, the Fed’s stress test is intended to incorporate some elements to make 

the tests more stringent when the economy and financial markets are heating up.  These 

countercyclical features are intended to give the stress tests some utility as a 

macroprudential tool--that is, to mitigate the financial system’s inherent pro-cyclicality. 

The most prominent countercyclical feature of the stress-test scenario architecture is the 

setting of the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenario.  The general rule is to 

increase the unemployment rate by 4 percent unless the baseline unemployment rate 

starts at levels below 6 percent, in which case the ultimate level of the unemployment rate 

reached in the severely adverse scenario is fixed at 10 percent.  In addition, last 

December, the Board put out a proposal for comment to introduce a systematically 

countercyclical mechanism in the component of the scenario that shocks house prices.8

Beyond these systematic elements, the assessment of vulnerabilities is a critical 

input in the development of scenarios for the stress tests each year to strengthen resilience 

against vulnerabilities that may be identified.  As I noted earlier, recent assessments have 

noted high levels of valuations across a broad set of asset markets and elevated business 

leverage in an environment where Treasury yields and term premiums have been 

relatively low by historical standards.  In such circumstances, asset prices might be 

particularly susceptible to an unexpected development that accentuates downside risks to 

the macroeconomic outlook.  For instance, a sharp increase in concerns about the
