The public’s expectations for inflation also importantly influence inflation 

dynamics.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally been stable in 

the wake of the financial crisis.  For example, in the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, the median projection for the annual 

average inflation rate for personal consumption expenditures over the next 10 years has 

remained close to 2 percent.  Surveys of households likewise show that longer-term 

inflation expectations have been relatively stable.  In the financial markets, measures of 

inflation compensation at longer horizons (computed from the spread between yields on 

nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities) have moved down, on net, this year 

but remain within their historical ranges.  With long-run inflation expectations stable and 

with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures, it seems likely that 

inflation trends will remain subdued for some time. 

The Objectives of Monetary Policy 

To evaluate policy alternatives and explain policy choices to the public, it is 

essential not only to forecast the economy, but to compare that forecast to the objectives 

of policy.  Clear communication about the longer-run objectives of monetary policy is 

beneficial at all times but is particularly important in a time of low inflation and uncertain 

economic prospects such as the present.  Improving the public’s understanding of the 

central bank’s policy strategy reduces economic and financial uncertainty and helps 

households and firms make more-informed decisions.  Moreover, clarity about goals and 

strategies can help anchor the public’s longer-term inflation expectations more firmly and 

thereby bolsters the central bank’s ability to respond forcefully to adverse shocks.4
