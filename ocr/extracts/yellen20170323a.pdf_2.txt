I would like to welcome all of you and thank you for joining us to discuss a set of 

topics of considerable importance to our country.  This is the Federal Reserve’s 10th 

biennial community development research conference, dedicated as always to issues of 

significance to people and communities around the country.  The conference is 

cosponsored by, and includes substantive contributions from, the community 

development offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as well as the Board of Governors.  

That united effort and level of commitment reflects how consequential we consider these 

issues to be.  This conference is intended to present and highlight rigorous research that I 

am confident will inform how you think about your own work, whether from the 

perspective of policymaking, community development practice, or research. 

Our last conference, two years ago, explored various aspects of economic 

mobility, largely among adults.  This year, we gather to discuss “The Economic Futures 

of Kids and Communities,” and, in part, I see this topic as an extension of that earlier 

conversation about mobility.   

Today and tomorrow, we focus on research about the foundation or building 

blocks for economic success that are laid even before young people enter the workforce 

and assume responsibility for their own finances.  

 We will hear from leading experts on a range of issues related to how children, 

youths, and young adults are shaped in ways that may ultimately affect their ability later 

to productively contribute to the economy and manage their finances.  We can learn from 

what the data and analysis tell us, and our hope is that making use of this information will 

lead to more effective programs and policies and thus better outcomes.
