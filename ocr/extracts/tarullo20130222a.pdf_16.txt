reviewed.  Similarly, since the settlement process for triparty repo that remains of concern is 

centered at two institutions, both of which are regulated American banks, the United States can 

take effective action without need of an international agreement   

 As to broader initiatives, proposals to require minimum haircuts for all securities 

financing transactions have been tentatively discussed in the FSB.  This is certainly a ripe subject 

for discussion, insofar as securities financing transactions facilitate leverage, enable maturity 

transformation, and produce the kind of interconnectedness that can spawn runs and contagion.  

At present, no set of generally applicable prudential standards governs these activities.  Even 

within regulated firms, microprudential risk-weighted capital standards have little effect, since 

they are calibrated against credit risk and most such transactions are short-term and fully (or 

over) collateralized.  Thus requirements that would attach to instruments and transactions, as 

opposed to firms that happen to be prudentially regulated for other reasons, have considerable 

attraction. 

 On the other hand, universal haircut requirements are the type of regulatory innovation 

that I suggested earlier was best developed internationally following some experience within 

financially significant countries.  One may, for example, have significant concern about some of 

the unintended consequences that would ensue.  My instinct, then, is that the analysis of this idea 

should continue within the FSB and, one hopes, in other venues both in and out of the official 

sector.  There should also be concerted efforts internationally to gather relevant data, some of 

which is at present uncollected.  But we are not going to be in a position to establish an 

international securities transaction financing regime in the near term. 

 However, one proposal already on the international agenda might be reconsidered, so as 

to address more directly the short-term funding problem.  Following completion of the LCR
