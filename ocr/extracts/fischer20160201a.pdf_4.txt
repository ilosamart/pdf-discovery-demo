the declines in the prices of oil and other commodities on commodity exporting nations, 

appeared early this year to have triggered volatility in global asset markets.  At this point, 

it is difficult to judge the likely implications of this volatility.  If these developments lead 

to a persistent tightening of financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global 

economy that could affect growth and inflation in the United States.  But we have seen 

similar periods of volatility in recent years that have left little permanent imprint on the 

economy.  As the FOMC said in its statement last week, we are closely monitoring global 

economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the labor 

market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.4 

Now, I expect that in a few minutes one of you will ask not about what we did at 

our last meeting, but rather what we are going to do at the next one.  I can’t answer that 

question because, as I have emphasized in the past, we simply do not know.  The world is 

an uncertain place, and all monetary policymakers can really be sure of is that what will 

happen is often different from what we currently expect.  That is why the Committee has 

indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent.  That is, we will adjust policy 

appropriately in light of economic and financial events to best foster conditions consistent 

with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives.   

As you know, in making our policy decisions, my FOMC colleagues and I spend 

considerable time assessing the incoming economic and financial information and its 

implications for the economic outlook.  But we also must consider some other issues, two 

of which I would like to mention briefly today.
