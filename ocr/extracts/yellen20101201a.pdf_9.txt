currency appreciation because it reduces inflation pressures and, over time, aids global 

rebalancing.  However, some of them have argued that unduly large and rapid capital 

inflows may lead to asset-price bubbles and expose the financial sectors in their 

economies to a subsequent reversal of these flows, while rapid currency appreciation 

could derail the growth of their export sectors.  A number of emerging market economies 

have accordingly attempted to counter the effects of financial inflows through a range of 

policies, including foreign exchange intervention and capital controls. 

The U.S. fiscal program that I discussed earlier might also moderate the pressures 

emerging market economies are experiencing at present.  Stronger U.S. growth would 

boost our demand for foreign goods and reduce the incentives for capital flows to 

emerging markets, thereby diminishing some of the upward pressure on emerging market 

currencies.  Thus, the U.S. fiscal program would lessen for a time the natural mechanisms 

pushing the emerging markets to rebalance their economies toward domestic demand, 

even as it helped put the global economy as a whole on a more solid footing.  However, 

such developments would in no way diminish the need for such rebalancing in the 

medium term.  It is also important for both advanced and emerging market economies to 

begin planning now for the structural reforms that will eventually be needed to promote 

rebalancing.  

Conclusion  

 As I hope Iâ€™ve made clear, the challenge for U.S. policymakers will be to craft a 

strategy that puts our fiscal policy on a sustainable path in the longer term while helping 

support the recovery in economic activity in the near term.  These goals are challenging 

to achieve but not inconsistent.  Moreover, making progress on them would not only
