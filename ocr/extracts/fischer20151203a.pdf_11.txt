many conditions across these episodes were very different, as were their end results in the 

falls of 1998 and 2008.   Because of those differences, distress at LTCM was resolved by 

a private-sector solution with little discernible effect on the U.S. macroeconomy, while 

the fall of 2008 culminated in the Great Recession.  But the commonalities across 

episodes illustrate similar data and conceptual gaps. 

Focusing on the conceptual gaps, the theoretical and empirical literature on 

interconnectedness sheds only partial light on the issues confronted in each of the 

highlighted episodes.14  In addition to direct connections, common exposures and 

contagion are important sources of interconnectedness and fragility, as emphasized by 

Bagehot nearly 150 years ago.15 On the empirical side, researchers have worked to 

construct networks of banks or broader sets of institutions based on direct connections or 

common holdings, but incomplete data and modeling challenges have typically implied a 

focus on only parts of institutions’ balance sheets or on a subset of market participants.16  

On the theoretical side, a strand of literature notes that the connections among institutions 

in each of the previous frameworks may be too small to explain the types of systemic 

distress witnessed during the crisis, and instead emphasizes that complexity within firms 

and in interconnections heightens the risk of correlated runs.17  This insight rings true:  

The complexity of Lehman’s, AIG’s, and even LTCM’s balance sheets and interactions 

with other institutions almost surely contributed to market spillovers during their distress.

(2012); and Kara, Tian, and Yellen (2015). 
15 Bagehot (1873 [1897]) has long been viewed as a classic reference describing panics in money markets 
and the proper response of the central bank to such panics. 
16 Duarte and Eisenbach (2015) examine interconnections associated with fire sales and common 
exposures.  Hale, Kapan, and Minoiu (2014) examine a bank network and discuss related approaches. 
17 Caballero and Simsek (2013) discuss complexity and network stability.  Research emphasizing direct 
connections and common holdings includes Allen, Babus, and Carletti (2012); and Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, 
and Tahbaz-Salehi (2015).
