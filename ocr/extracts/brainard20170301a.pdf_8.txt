is likely to remain below its historical average even once it reaches its new longer-run 

normal level.  The lower rate environment means there will be less room to cut the 

federal funds rate, so that if the economy experiences adverse shocks similar in severity 

and frequency to those in the past the likelihood of returning to and operating near the 

effective lower bound will remain elevated relative to historical experience.  Prudent risk 

management suggests that policy should take into account the asymmetry in risks posed 

by the greater likelihood of the economy being at the effective lower bound, where 

conventional policy is constrained.   

What about the Balance Sheet? 

Given the progress we have seen and the positive momentum in the incoming 

data, continued gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be appropriate.  But 

unlike in previous tightening cycles, the Federal Open Market Committee currently has 

two tools to remove accommodation:  the balance sheet as well as the federal funds rate. 

In December 2015, the Committee indicated that it would continue to reinvest 

principal payments until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is “well under 

way.”2  The decision to rely solely on the federal funds rate to remove accommodation 

initially until normalization is well under way serves an important purpose, in my view.3  

With asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks, 

there is a benefit to enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would be
