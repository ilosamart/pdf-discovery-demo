tight credit and a high degree of risk aversion have restrained economic growth in the 

United States and in other countries as well. 

Measures of the condition of U.S. financial markets and institutions suggest 

gradual but significant progress has been achieved since the crisis.  For example, credit 

spreads on corporate bonds and syndicated loans have narrowed considerably, and equity 

prices have recovered most of their losses.  In addition, indicators of market stress and 

illiquidity--such as spreads in short-term funding markets--have generally returned to 

levels near those seen before the crisis.  One gauge of the overall improvement in 

financial markets is the National Financial Conditions Index maintained by the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Chicago.  The index shows that financial conditions, viewed as a whole, 

are now about as accommodative as they were in the spring of 2007. 

In spite of this broad improvement, the harm inflicted by the financial crisis has 

yet to be fully repaired in important segments of the financial sector.  One example is the 

continued weakness in some categories of bank lending.  Banksâ€™ capital positions and 

overall asset quality have improved substantially over the past several years, and, over 

time, these balance sheet improvements will position banks to extend considerably more 

credit to bank-dependent borrowers.  Indeed, some types of bank credit, such as 

commercial and industrial loans, have expanded notably in recent quarters.  Nonetheless, 

banks have been conservative in extending loans to many consumers and some 

businesses, likely even beyond the restrictions on the supply of mortgage lending that I 

noted earlier.  This caution in lending by banks reflects, among other factors, their 

continued desire to guard against the risks of further economic weakness.
