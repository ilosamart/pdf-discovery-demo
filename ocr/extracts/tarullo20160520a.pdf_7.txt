creditor runs in turn suggests that capital and liquidity requirements for insurance companies 

should be calibrated differently than capital and liquidity requirements for dealer banks.  Because 

Congress modified the Collins Amendment in late 2014, we can now tailor capital requirements 

for insurance companies.   

However, it is important to add that the balance sheet of an insurance company can look 

quite different from the traditional picture I have just sketched.  For example, a life insurer may 

offer investment and retirement products with account values that can be withdrawn at the 

discretion of policyholders, sometimes with little or no surrender penalty.  The option to 

surrender creates the potential for increased claims that could strain the liquidity of the firm.  

Relatedly, the extensive involvement of an insurance firm in securities lending, repo, over-the-

counter derivatives, and other capital markets activities can create a balance sheet with much 

tighter connections to the rest of the financial system and greater liquidity risk in times of 

financial market stress.  As with other financial intermediaries, insurers then become subject to 

demands for posting additional collateral or closing out positions as unfavorable market 

conditions take hold.  In addition, if the positions of the insurance company are large enough, it 

could become a potential vehicle for transmitting distress at the company to other parts of the 

financial system.   

The foregoing considerations suggest that we should distinguish between insurance 

companies that we oversee solely because they own an insured depository institution and those 

that have been designated as systemically important by the FSOC.  This is precisely the path we 

are taking with regard to our supervision of these firms.  For the former group, our supervisory 

efforts to date have focused on ensuring that the companies have strong internal controls and 

effective corporate governance, as well as satisfactory risk identification, measurement, and
