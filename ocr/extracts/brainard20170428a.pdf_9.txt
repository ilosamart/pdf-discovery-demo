as “data aggregators.”  These banks may lack the budgets and expertise to create their own open 

APIs or may not see that as a key element in their business strategies.  Data aggregators collect 

consumer financial account data from banks, on the one hand, and then provide access to that 

data to fintech developers, on the other hand.17  Data aggregators organize the data they collect 

from banks and other data sources and then offer their own suite of open APIs to outside 

developers.  By partnering with data aggregators, banks can open their systems to thousands of 

developers, without having to invest in creating and maintaining their own open APIs.  This also 

allows fintech developers to build their products around the APIs of two or three data 

aggregators, rather than 15,000 different banks and other data sources.  And, if agreements 

between data aggregators and banks are structured as data aggregators performing outsourced 

services to banks, the bank should be able to conduct the appropriate due diligence of its 

vendors, whose services to those banks may be subject to examination by safety and soundness 

regulators.18  

Some banks have opted for a more “closed” approach to fintech developers by entering 

into individual agreements with specific technology providers or data aggregators.19  These

sources is collected via “structured feeds” under contractual agreements with financial institutions.  See Envestnet,
