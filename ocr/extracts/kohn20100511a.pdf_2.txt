As the global economy continues to heal from the devastation wrought by the financial 

crisis, we must not lose sight of our collective responsibility to ensure that the conditions that 

gave rise to the crisis are not repeated.  On this score, many efforts are under way to promote a 

more resilient global financial system, but clearly much more remains to be done.  In my remarks 

today, I will focus on global current account (or, external) imbalances, their role in contributing 

to vulnerabilities in the global economy, and polices that should be undertaken to ensure that the 

ongoing recovery is built on a solid and durable foundation.1

If we are to avoid repeating our mistakes, we must learn the right lessons from 

experience.  Sorting through the many complex factors that led to the global financial crisis is no 

easy task.  Although I will argue that global imbalances did contribute to the crisis, it is 

important to acknowledge that some countries run current account deficits for sound economic 

reasons while others run current account surpluses.  To the extent that global imbalances reflect 

the efficient allocation of capital and distribution of risk across countries, they support a well-

functioning global economy.  Thus, our policy actions and reactions should not seek to reduce 

imbalances for their own sake.  Rather, our aim should be to address the imbalances that emerge 

from or contribute to economic distortions or the mispricing of risks, which thereby foster 

vulnerabilities in the international financial system and threaten sudden and disruptive reversals.    


Large and growing global imbalances were a perennial topic in meetings of international 

policymakers for years prior to the crisis because they were seen as threat to the global economy. 

 From 1996 to 2006, the U.S. current account deficit widened dramatically, from about 1-1/2 

percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 6 percent.  This widening primarily reflected a fall in
