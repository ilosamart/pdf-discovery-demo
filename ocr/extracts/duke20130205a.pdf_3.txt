Just as the seeds of a crisis are often sown in earlier boom times, strength can be forged 

during the tough times that follow a crisis.  As we did in the early 1990s, bankers and regulators 

today have learned from the lessons of the crisis and are determined not to repeat the mistakes of 

the past.   

Credit metrics are now improving in most banks as problem loans have been addressed 

and resolved and new credit underwriting has been quite restrictive for a number of years.  

Deposit growth has outpaced loan demand and reliance on wholesale funding has been reduced.  

Capital positions are stronger.  The interest margin pressure banks face today is partly due to low 

interest rates and partly due to weak loan demand, both of which are consequences of a sluggish 

economy.  As the economic recovery gains momentum, however, both of these conditions should 

reverse and give bankers the opportunity to deploy the liquidity and capital they have amassed to

Community Bankers Are Being Heard  

Even as they anticipate economic recovery, however, community bankers worry that the 

burden of new regulations may inhibit their ability to lend in their communities or prohibitively 

increase the costs of such lending.  We certainly understand this concern.  Federal Reserve 

research over the years has confirmed that the burden of regulations falls disproportionately on 

smaller banks.  

Supervisors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis have recently tried to quantify 

this effect.  To do so, they used survey data to estimate the relative number of new employees 

that banks of different sizes might need to hire in response to the same regulatory requirement.  

Using Call Report data from 2011, they estimated in their preliminary analysis that hiring one 

additional employee would reduce the return on assets by 23 basis points for the median bank in
