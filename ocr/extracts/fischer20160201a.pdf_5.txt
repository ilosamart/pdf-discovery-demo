First, should we be concerned about the possibility of the unemployment rate 

falling somewhat below its longer-run normal level, as the most recent FOMC 

projections suggest?  In my view, a modest overshoot of this sort would be appropriate in 

current circumstances for two reasons.  First, other measures of labor market conditions--

such as the fraction of workers with part-time employment who would prefer to work full 

time and the number of people out of the labor force who would like to work--indicate 

that more slack may remain in labor market than the unemployment rate alone would 

suggest.  Second, with inflation currently well below 2 percent, a modest overshoot 

actually could be helpful in moving inflation back to 2 percent more rapidly.  

Nonetheless, a persistent large overshoot of our employment mandate would risk an 

undesirable rise in inflation that might require a relatively abrupt policy tightening, which 

could inadvertently push the economy into recession.  Monetary policy should aim to 

avoid such risks and keep the expansion on a sustainable track.   

In this context, I would point out that at our January meeting, we reaffirmed our 

Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy with an adjustment to 

clarify that our inflation goal is symmetric.5  That is, the Committee would be concerned 

if inflation were running persistently above or below our objective.  In my view, even if 

inflation was expected to return to 2 percent over time, persistent deviations from our 

goal in either direction could cause economic harm and could ultimately unmoor longer-

term inflation expectations.  Of course, whether the Committee would take action to 

address a persistent deviation from its inflation objective would depend on the
