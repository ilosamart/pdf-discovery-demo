bodies to organize a global response.  As such, the Heads of State and Government of the G20 

called for the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), a relatively small and unmuscular group, to 

expand its membership and to strengthen its institutional framework.  The result was the 

Financial Stability Board, which was designed as a mechanism for national authorities, global 

standards-setting bodies, and international authorities to identify and address vulnerabilities in 

the global financial system and to develop stronger regulatory and supervisory policies to create 

a more resilient global financial system.  This new group is more representative of the 

interconnected global economy and financial system and can more effectively mobilize to 

promote global financial stability than anything that existed before.  Whereas the FSF included 

only 11 jurisdictions (all of which were advanced economies), the FSB includes 24 jurisdictions 

and 73 representatives, which include all the members of the G20 and of which 10 are emerging 

market economies. 

In fostering global financial stability, the actions of the FSB have the potential to affect 

the global economy and financial system in important ways.  Success in promoting global 

financial stability should benefit everybody, through more sustainable and stronger economic 

growth.  At the same time, financial stability policy will also affect institutions and markets 

beyond the FSBâ€™s membership.  Recognizing the wide-reaching effects of its work, the FSB 

must seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom brings a different perspective 

to the issues under consideration.  While we are directly accountable to the G20, we are, through 

the G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our actions.  In my view, that means we 

must engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of these stakeholders, to a greater and more 

effective degree than we have in the past.
