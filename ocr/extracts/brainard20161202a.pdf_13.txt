Conclusion 

Current developments in the digitization of finance, including the establishment 

of new business models, are important and deserving of serious engagement on the part 

of policymakers and regulators.  As policymakers, we want to facilitate innovation where 

it has the potential to yield broad social benefit, while ensuring that risks are thoroughly 

managed.  In safeguarding the public interest, the first line of analysis and protection will 

always rest with the market participants closest to the new technologies and product 

innovations and to the organizations that consider adopting them.  But regulators also 

should seek to analyze the implications of technology developments through constructive 

and timely engagement.  We should be attentive to the potential social benefits of these 

new technologies, prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety 

and integrity are proven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest, and 

vigilant to ensure risks are well understood and managed.
