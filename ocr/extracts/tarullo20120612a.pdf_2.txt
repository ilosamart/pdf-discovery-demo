The three decades preceding the financial crisis were characterized in the United States 

by the progressive integration of traditional lending and capital markets activities.  This trend 

diminished the importance of deposits as a source of funding for credit extension in favor of 

capital market instruments sold to institutional investors.  It also altered the structure of the 

financial services industry, both transforming the activities of broker-dealers and fostering the 

emergence of large financial conglomerates.  Although the structure of foreign banking systems 

was less noticeably changed, many foreign banks drew increasingly on the resulting wholesale 

funding markets and made significant investments in the mortgage-backed securities that had 

proliferated in the first decade of this century. 

The financial crisis underscored the failure of the American regulatory system to keep 

pace with these developments and revealed the need for two reform agendas.  One must be 

aimed specifically at the problem of too-big-to-fail institutions.  The other must be directed at the 

so-called shadow banking system, which refers to credit intermediation involving leverage and 

maturity transformation that is partly or wholly outside the traditional banking system.  As I have 

noted on other occasions, most reforms to date have concentrated on too-big-to-fail institutions, 

though many of these reforms have yet to be fully implemented.  The shadow banking system, 

on the other hand, has been only obliquely addressed, despite the fact that the most acute phase 

of the crisis was precipitated by a run on that system.  Indeed, as the oversight of regulated 

institutions is strengthened, opportunities for arbitrage in the shadow banking system may 

increase. 

Today I want to focus on the development of a regulatory reform agenda for the shadow 

banking system.  As those who have been following the academic and policy debates know, 

there are significant, ongoing  disagreements concerning the roles of various factors contributing
