trading partners have suffered negative shocks.  Some have been relatively short lived, 

including the collapse in Japanese growth following the tragic earthquake in 2011.  

Others look to be more structural, such as the stepdown in Chinese growth compared to 

its double digit pre-crisis pace.  Most salient, not least for Sweden, has been the impact of 

the fiscal and financial situation in the euro area over the past few years.  Weaker 

economic conditions in Europe and other parts of the world have weighed on U.S. 

exports and corporate earnings; added to the risks that U.S. financial institutions,

The housing market, fiscal consolidation, and unexpectedly anemic foreign 

demand all play a significant role in explaining the weakness of aggregate demand in the 

U.S. economy, weakness that could not have been accurately predicted based on past 

recession experiences or by the fact that this recession started with a massive financial 

crisis.  But, turning to the aggregate supply side, we are also seeing important signs of a 

slowdown of growth in the productive capacity of the economy--in the growth in labor 

supply, capital investment, and productivity.  This may well reflect factors related to or 

predating the recession that are also holding down growth.   

How much of this weakness on the supply side will turn out to be structural--

perhaps contributing to a secular slowdown--and how much is temporary but longer-than-

usual-lasting remains a crucial and open question.    

Looking at the aggregate production function, we begin with labor supply.  The 

considerable slowdown in the growth rate of labor supply observed over the past decade 

is a source of concern for the prospects of U.S. output growth.  There has been a steady
