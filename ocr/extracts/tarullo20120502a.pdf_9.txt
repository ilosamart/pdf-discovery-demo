liquidity levels need not be maintained in the midst of a crisis.  As currently constituted, the LCR 

might have the unintended effect of exacerbating a period of stress by forcing liquidity hoarding. 

 I am often asked whether the reforms I have just described will "solve" the too-big-to-fail 

problem.  In response, I would say that too-big-to-fail is not a binary problem.  Expectations of 

government support for a particular firm can range from essentially zero to near certainty, and 

can also vary substantially depending on the degree of overall stress in the financial system at a 

given moment.  While it is probably unrealistic to expect that any set of reforms, no matter how 

far-reaching, will eliminate too-big-to-fail concerns entirely, I do think that full implementation 

of the reforms discussed today would go a considerable distance toward diminishing 

expectations of government support for large banking organizations, as well as the potential for 

damage to the financial system from the failure of a large banking firm.  Of one thing I am sure: 

If we do not complete rigorous implementation of this complementary set of reforms, we will 

have lost the opportunity to reverse the pre-crisis trajectory of increasing too-big-to-fail risks. 

Shadow Banking 

 While there is a well-defined set of regulatory measures to address too-big-to-fail, the 

same cannot be said for the second major challenge revealed by the crisis: the instability of the 

shadow banking system.  Although some elements of pre-crisis shadow banking are probably 

gone forever, others persist.  Moreover, as time passes, memories fade, and the financial system 

normalizes, it seems likely that new forms of shadow banking will emerge.  Indeed, the increased 

regulation of the major securities firms may well encourage the migration of some parts of the 

shadow banking system further into the darkness--that is, into largely unregulated markets.  And 

it bears reminding that, just as the fragility of major financial firms elicited government support
