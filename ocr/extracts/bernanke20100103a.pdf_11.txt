forecasts) that were prepared for each policy meeting.  Because Greenbook forecasts for 

the period after 2004 are not yet publicly available, from 2005 on the forecasts are 

constructed from the publicly released, contemporaneous projections of FOMC 

participants, using methods developed by Athanasios Orphanides and Volker Wieland 

(2008).9  In addition, consistent with the practices of the FOMC, inflation is measured by 

the PCE price index as was available in real time, instead of by the CPI.10   

As Slide 4 shows, the alternative Taylor rule prescribes a path for policy that is 

much closer to that followed throughout the decade, including recent years.  In other 

words, when one takes into account that policymakers should and do respond differently 

to temporary and longer-lasting changes in inflation, monetary policy following the 2001 

recession appears to have been reasonably appropriate, at least in relation to a simple 

policy rule. 

Which version of the Taylor rule--the standard version, that uses current values of 

inflation, or the alternative version, that employs inflation forecasts--is the more reliable 

guide?  I have explained my preference for using inflation forecasts rather than actual 

inflation in the policy rule:  Monetary policy works with a lag, and therefore policy 

decisions must be forward looking.  One might still prefer the simplicity of the standard 

Taylor rule that uses current inflation values.  However, note from Slide 4 that a 

                                                       
9 FOMC projections between 2005 and 2007 are obtained from Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, 
published in February and July (available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm); 
projections for core inflation are converted to projections for headline inflation based on staff calculations 
that in turn rely on energy futures prices.  Starting in 2008, FOMC inflation forecasts, for both core and 
headline inflation, become available four times each year in the Summary of Economic Projections (see, for 
example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Minutes of Federal Open Market 
Committee, January 9, 21, and 29-30, 2008,” press release, February 20, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080220a.htm). 
10 In the same spirit, we also replace the output gap as measured retrospectively by the FRB/US model with 
the output gap from that model as measured in real time.  This change has no significant effect on the 
policy prescriptions over most of the period.
