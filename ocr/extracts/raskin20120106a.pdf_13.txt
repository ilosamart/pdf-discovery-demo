systemic risk considerations that could arise from the failure of these banks.  This 

circumstance requires regulators to make capital, liquidity, and risk-management 

standards more stringent for large banks than for community banks.  These standards not 

only are being established internationally, but also are required for the largest institutions 

under the Dodd-Frank Act.  A critical part of this supervisory process is rigorous capital 

planning and stress testing to ensure that the largest institutions are capable of absorbing 

unforeseen shocks.  The Federal Reserve, for example, requires the largest top-tier bank 

holding companies to submit annual capital plans and conduct rigorous stress tests as part 

of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise.8  In recognition of their 

systemic importance, the largest firms also are required to plan for their own orderly 

resolution in the event that they should fail.   

Because of their complexity and risk characteristics, these firms require intensive 

and continuous on-site supervision; the Federal Reserve has dozens of full-time 

examiners on site at the largest banks to monitor their risk-management systems, 

strategies, and operations on an ongoing basis.  In the years since the crisis began, our 

supervision of these firms has become arguably much more intensive, which I believe is 

perfectly appropriate given the effect that problems at the largest firms had on the 

financial system and the broader economy.   

You may be asking, What does this have to do with community banks?  Not very 

much--which is precisely my point.  The community banking model is very different 

from that of the largest banks.  Community banks are local by their very nature.  They 

have deep roots in their communities.  Their value proposition is that they are able and
