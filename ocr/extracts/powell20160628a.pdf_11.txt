provides ample ground for humility.  This summer, many will be carrying Robert 

Gordon’s massive The Rise and Fall of American Growth to the beach (or perhaps to the 

lake, here in the Midwest), which argues the pessimistic view. 7  For balance, maybe 

bring along Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s The Second Machine Age, which take a more 

optimistic view and is a great deal shorter.8 

One factor that may contribute to low productivity growth is the notable decline 

in recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy.  Entrepreneurs start new 

firms; most of them fail, but a few of them succeed, grow very rapidly, and account for 

significant amounts of job formation.  Older firms shrink or go out of business if they fail 

to keep up with innovation and advances in productivity.  Workers change jobs and move 

around the country (or the world) as their careers evolve and as companies grow and 

shrink.  These processes can be painful and messy for both workers and firms, but they 

are essential to the allocation of resources to their highest, most productive uses.  The 

high levels of innovation and fluidity of our economy have long been thought to be 

among the principal reasons for our high and rising living standards.   

The slowdown in essentially all of these processes is seen in declining rates of 

creation and destruction of both firms and jobs. 

Start-ups:  Start-ups are a key driver of productivity growth.  Although it may feel 

that we are living in an age of disruption, the birthrate of startups has actually been in 

decline since the 1970s.9  New firms can be loosely grouped into two categories:  those
