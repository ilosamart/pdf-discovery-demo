the sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio 

are inherently imprecise.4   

In the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market 

conditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared 

by most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).5  Overall 

economic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by 

substantial gains in household income and wealth.  Business investment, in contrast, has 

been soft.  But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are 

consistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year; 

another positive factor is that oil drilling, which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply 

back in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up.  As we look to broader trends, gross 

domestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces 

depressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth, 

weak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis.  Although I am 

cautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that they 

will continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term, likely holding down the 

level of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.   

Turning to inflation, we are now much closer to the FOMCâ€™s 2 percent objective 

than we were just a year ago.  Prices, as measured by the index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE), rose nearly 1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as 

                                                           
4 In addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part-time 
workers, or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the 
sidelines.  However, evidence on these sorts of endogenous supply-side effects is rather limited, as I noted 
in a recent speech (see Yellen, 2016).
