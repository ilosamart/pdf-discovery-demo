macroeconomic effects of house price declines were shaped by the apparent analogy to 

the bursting of the dot-com bubble a few years earlier.  That earlier bust also involved a 

large reduction in paper wealth but was followed by only a mild recession.  In the event, 

of course, the bursting of the housing bubble helped trigger the most severe financial 

crisis since the Great Depression.  It did so because, unlike the earlier decline in equity 

prices, it interacted with critical vulnerabilities in the financial system and in government 

regulation that allowed what were initially moderate aggregate losses to subprime 

mortgage holders to cascade through the financial system.  In the private sector, key 

vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage, excessive dependence on unstable short-

term funding, deficiencies in risk measurement and management, and the use of exotic 

financial instruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways.  In the public sector, 

vulnerabilities included gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some systemically 

important firms and markets to escape comprehensive supervision, failures of supervisors 

to effectively use their existing powers, and insufficient attention to threats to the stability 

of the system as a whole.   

The Federal Reserve responded forcefully to the liquidity pressures during the 

crisis in a manner consistent with the lessons that central banks had learned from 

financial panics over more than 150 years and summarized in the writings of the 19th 

century British journalist Walter Bagehot:  Lend early and freely to solvent institutions.6  

However, the institutional context had changed substantially since Bagehot wrote.  The 

panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries typically involved runs on commercial banks 

and other depository institutions.  Prior to the recent crisis, in contrast, credit extension

which the Federal Reserveâ€™s actions during the crisis followed traditional prescriptions regarding the proper 
response to liquidity strains, see Madigan (2009).
