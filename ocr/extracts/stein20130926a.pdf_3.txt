path of the federal funds rate over the following several quarters--is associated with a 

42 basis point increase in the 10-year forward overnight real rate, extracted from the 

yield curve for Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).

On the one hand, this finding is at odds with standard New Keynesian macro 

models, in which the central bank’s ability to influence real variables stems from goods 

prices that are sticky in nominal terms.  In such models, a change in monetary policy 

should have no effect on forward real rates at a horizon longer than that over which all 

prices can adjust, and it seems implausible that this horizon could be on the order of 

10 years.  On the other hand, the result suggests that monetary policy may have more 

kick than is implied by the standard model, precisely because long-term real rates are the 

ones that are most likely to matter for a variety of investment decisions. 

So what is going on?  How, in a world of eventually flexible goods prices, is 

monetary policy able to exert such a powerful influence on long-term real rates?  A first 

clue is that the movements in distant forward real rates that we document appear to 

reflect changes in term premiums, as opposed to changes in expectations about short-term 

real rates far into the future.  Said differently, if the Fed eases policy today and yields on 

long-term TIPs go down, this does not mean that the real short rate is expected to be 

lower 10 years from now--but rather that TIPs have gotten more expensive relative to the 

expected future path of short rates.  These changes in term premiums then appear to 

reverse themselves over the following 6 to 12 months.

 Our findings can be illustrated with the events of January 25, 2012.  On that date the FOMC changed its 

forward guidance, indicating that it expected to hold the federal funds rate near zero “through late 2014,” 

whereas it had previously only stated that it expected to do so “through mid-2013.” In response to this 

announcement, the expected path of short-term nominal rates fell significantly from two to five years out, 

with the 2-year nominal yield dropping 5 basis points and the 5-year nominal yield falling 14 basis points.  

More strikingly, 10-year and 20-year real forward rates declined by 5 basis points and 9 basis points, 

respectively.
