in demand for short-term financing by certain borrowers—notably financial intermediaries 

looking to fund longer-term assets—played important, probably reciprocally reinforcing roles. 

Examples of investor demand for safe, liquid assets are not hard to identify.  One source 

has been foreign official investors, mostly emerging market countries, which invested about $1.6 

trillion in the United States in the four years preceding the crisis, largely in U.S. Treasury and 

agency securities.  Much of this activity arose from the investment of foreign exchange reserves 

by countries running large current account surpluses.  Some of these reserves were undoubtedly 

built up as a precautionary measure in light of the financial problems in emerging markets during 

the late 1990s, while others are attendant to policies of managed exchange rates.  This official 

sector demand for safe assets was largely if not entirely focused on U.S. government securities, 

rather than cash equivalents.  But this source of demand absorbed roughly 80 percent of the 

increase in U.S. Treasury and agency securities over the four-year period, potentially crowding 

out other investors and thereby increasing their demand for cash equivalents that appeared to be 

of comparable safety and liquidity. 

A second source of demand has been nonfinancial firms, which responded to the market 

disruptions associated with defaults by Enron and other firms more than a decade ago by 

boosting their holdings of cash.  The pressure to hold large amounts of cash likely increased 

when a major ratings agency began publishing liquidity risk assessments of nonfinancial firms.  

A third source of demand for cash equivalents resulted from the adoption of more 

elaborate investment strategies by many institutional investors.  For example, as more such 

investors used derivatives or short-selling as part of their overall strategies, they needed cash or 

cash-like instruments for margining and other collateral purposes.  Moreover, of course, as the 

amount of assets under professional management increased, the demand for safe, liquid
