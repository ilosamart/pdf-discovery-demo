3-1/2 percent over the past three years, in all cases about half the average pace recorded 

in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis.       

Regarding the second factor, as is well established by theory and supported by 

empirical experience, economic growth tends to decelerate as a country develops.  In a 

capital-poor developing economy, initial increases in investment generally have high 

returns, which then decline as capital accumulates.  Likewise, the initial phase of 

integration with the global economy is typically marked by strong gains in productivity 

as methods and technologies are adopted from more advanced economies.  Over time, the 

boost to growth from this catch-up in productivity fades.  Also, as incomes rise and 

consumption grows, there is a tendency for a relatively rapid increase in demand for 

services.  The shift of domestic resources toward the production of services, which are 

typically associated with lower productivity growth, tends to further lower trend growth. 

The factors that have tended to temper growth as economies develop appear to be 

at play in China.  Following years of exceptionally high investment, the return on capital 

appears to be moderating, and the ratio of investment to gross domestic product (GDP), 

after peaking near 50 percent of GDP in 2011, has begun to edge down.  As viewed in the 

context of the Lewis model, China could be reaching the stage at which the supply of 

labor from the subsistence agricultural sector becomes a constraint on growth.  Further, 

productivity growth, though robust by global standards, has been declining.   

This decrease is likely due, at least in part, to the rapid growth of services 

consumption.  One of the most noteworthy aspects of Chinaâ€™s recent GDP data has been 

the strength of services, with services now accounting for half of the value added in GDP, 

up from just over 40 percent in 2008.
