 Now, research in social science is hardly ever the final word, and a large body of 

more recent research has contested Easterlin’s results, finding that people in rich 

countries may, on average, be happier or more satisfied after all.  But this research still 

suggests that the increase in happiness flowing from greater wealth is moderate.  For 

example, reported levels of life satisfaction among Americans are similar to reported 

levels among Costa Ricans, who have about one-quarter the per capita income.6  So I am 

going to continue under the assumption that, although wealth and income do contribute to 

happiness and life satisfaction, other factors must also be very important.7  Or, as your 

parents always said, money doesn’t buy happiness.  Well, an economist might reply, at 

least not by itself. 

 What could explain Easterlin’s finding that, beyond a certain point, wealth and 

income don’t buy happiness?  Easterlin’s own view, taking an economic perspective, is 

that people’s happiness depends less on their absolute wealth than on their wealth 

compared with others around them.  If I live in a country in which most people have only 

one cow, and I have three cows, then I will have lots of social status and self-esteem and 

will thus feel happy.  But if everyone around me has a luxury car, and I am hung up on 

status, I won’t feel very special unless I have both a luxury car and an SUV.  This 

relative-wealth hypothesis can explain why rich people are happier than poor people in 

the same country, but also why people in richer countries are not on average much 

happier than people in poorer countries.  It’s the big fish in a little pond phenomenon.
