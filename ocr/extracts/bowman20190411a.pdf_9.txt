need to think about how our guidance sets expectations for the way banks should engage third 

parties. We should explore more effective ways to interact with banks, including through new 

types of outreach and education.  

To begin with, I recognize the need to ensure that our outsourcing risk management 

guidance appropriately reflects the present-day business realities of the banks that we supervise. 

For instance, regulators’ third-party risk management frameworks discuss particular types of 

contractual terms and, where appropriate, audit rights by a bank over its service providers. 

However, when a community bank is in negotiations with large vendors, such as cloud service 

companies and core service providers, they may not be in a position to make demands. As the 

largest vendors grow even larger, this will get even harder for small banks.22  

Concerns about compliance can also make it difficult for a community bank to work with 

small partners. A small fintech firm may lack a traditional financial history, raising questions 

about how a bank can evaluate the fintech firm’s status in the industry, corporate history, or 

financial condition. It certainly can be difficult for a small bank’s staff to evaluate a wide range 

of potential technology vendors. I am heartened to hear that small banks are increasingly 

collaborating to vet third-parties. Services are also emerging to help deliver due diligence 

information to banks and monitor their third-party relationships. Of course, the ultimate 

responsibility should always lie with bank management, as each relationship involves particular 

services, for particular needs, for a particular risk profile. However, it seems sensible that a large 

amount of the vetting, contracting, and onboarding process could be streamlined for banks by 

collaboration or specialized third-party services.
