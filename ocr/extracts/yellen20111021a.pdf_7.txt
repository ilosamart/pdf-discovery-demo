Financial Markets and Institutions 

Turning to financial markets, I noted that conditions have improved since the 

depths of the crisis, but obvious strains remain, some of which have intensified in recent 

months.  Since the early summer, financial markets have been experiencing an unusual 

amount of volatility, and investors have pulled back from risky assets on balance.  The 

result has been lower equity prices, wider risk spreads on corporate bonds and many 

other debt instruments, and greater pressures on financial institutions.  At the same time, 

heightened demand for safe assets has put downward pressure on Treasury yields and 

boosted the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  These developments partly reflect the 

response by investors to news about the U.S. outlook that has, on net, fallen short of their 

expectations, as well as a recognition that growth is slowing elsewhere in the global 

economy.  But they also reflect anxiety in financial markets about the fiscal problems in 

Greece and other euro-zone countries, along with greater sensitivity to the exposures of 

the European banking system to troubled sovereign debt.  European leaders are strongly 

committed to addressing these issues and have begun to make some progress on them, 

but the need to obtain agreement among a large number of euro-zone countries to be able 

to put in place necessary backstops, as well as difficulties involved in addressing the 

fiscal imbalances in some of these countries, has slowed the process of developing and 

implementing solutions.  At this time, it is difficult to know just how much these 

developments in global financial markets have affected U.S. economic activity thus far.  

But, looking forward, particularly worrisome is the possibility that U.S. financial 

institutions facing earnings or funding pressures, in part as a result of the problems in 

Europe, could cut back on lending, tighten credit terms, or attempt to delever by rapidly
