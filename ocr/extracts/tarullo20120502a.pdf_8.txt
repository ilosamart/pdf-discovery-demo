sheet that would be available to a resolution authority for loss absorption or conversion to equity.  

A good starting point will be the idea of using long-term unsecured debt, with appropriately 

tailored characteristics, as a gone-concern complement to going-concern common equity 

requirements.  

 A fifth reform is a proposed set of quantitative liquidity requirements.  As seen during the 

crisis, a financial firm--particularly one with significant amounts of short-term funding--can 

become illiquid before it becomes insolvent, as creditors run in the face of uncertainty about the 

firm's solvency.  While higher levels and quality of capital can mitigate some of this risk, it was 

widely agreed that quantitative liquidity requirements should be developed.  The Basel 

Committee generated two proposals: one, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) with a 30-day 

timeframe; the other, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) with a one-year timeframe.  

However, insofar as this was the first-ever effort to specify such requirements, the Governors and 

Heads of Supervision of the countries represented on the Basel Committee determined that 

implementation of both frameworks should be delayed while they are subject to further 

examination and possible revision.   

 The LCR has been actively reconsidered within the Basel Committee over the last year or 

so.  As this work proceeds, I think we should be considering three types of additional changes:  

First, some of the assumptions embedded in the LCR about run rates of liabilities and the 

liquidity of assets might be grounded more firmly in actual experience during the crisis.  The 

current LCR seems to me to overstate in particular the liquidity risks of commercial banking 

activities.  Second, it would be worthwhile to pay more attention to the liquidity risks inherent in 

the use of large amounts of short-term wholesale funding.  Third, the LCR should be better 

adapted to a crisis environment as, for example, by making credibly clear that ordinary minimum
