regulators will have to work to gain greater insight into the complex linkages among 

clearinghouses as well as those between clearinghouses and the financial firms that rely 

on and support them. 

 The Development of Clearinghouses and Their Economic Rationale  

 Clearinghouses have been around a long time and have been used for many types 

of transactions, yet virtually all clearinghouses perform certain basic functions.  Notably, 

by centralizing and standardizing specific classes of financial transactions, clearinghouses

to every trade--thereby helping to reduce counterparty credit and liquidity risks.  

However, the flip side of the centralization of clearing and settlement activities in 

clearinghouses is the concentration of substantial financial and operational risk in a small 

number of organizations, a development with potentially important systemic 

implications.  Because the failure of, or loss of confidence in, a major clearinghouse 

would create enormous uncertainty about the status of initiated transactions and, 

consequently, about the financial positions of clearinghouse participants and their 

customers, strong risk management at these organizations as well as effective prudential

 A historical perspective is helpful for understanding the economics of 

clearinghouses and the implications of their operations for financial stability.  The first 

important clearinghouse in the United States, the New York Clearing House, was 

founded by New York Cityâ€™s commercial banks in 1853 to streamline the clearing and
