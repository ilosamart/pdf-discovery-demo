level of 2 percent or a bit less than that, which most FOMC participants see as consistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s mandate.   

In contrast, I disagree with the notion that the large quantity of reserves resulting 

from our asset purchases poses some special barrier to removing policy stimulus when 

the right time comes.  The FOMC will be able to increase short-term rates by raising the 

interest rate that we pay on excess reserves--currently 1/4 percent.  That ability will allow 

us to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten policy when needed, 

even if bank reserves remain high. 

Given the very high level of reserve balances, changes in the interest rate on 

reserves might not be fully reflected in the federal funds rate and other short-term market 

rates.  In that event, the Federal Reserve can use tools it has developed and tested to drain 

or immobilize bank reserves, thereby enhancing our control over the federal funds rate.  

To build the capability to drain large quantities of reserves, the Federal Reserve has 

expanded the range of its counterparties for reverse repurchase operations beyond the 

primary dealers and has developed the infrastructure necessary to use agency MBS as 

collateral in such transactions.  The Federal Reserve has also put in place a Term Deposit 

Facility through which it can offer deposits to member institutions that are roughly 

analogous to the certificates of deposit that these institutions offer to their customers.  We 

have tested both of these tools by conducting several small-scale operations and have the 

ability to initiate them quickly if needed.  The use of reverse repurchase operations and 

the Term Deposit Facility would allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions 

of dollars of reserves from the banking system should conditions necessitate.  We don’t 

think that draining such large amounts of reserves will be necessary for a smooth exit, but
