As part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past 

communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.  For 

example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of 

policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability. 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

The review will have several components.24  The Board and the Reserve Banks 

are currently conducting town hall-style Fed Listens events, in which we are hearing from 

a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders, 

community development advocates, and academics.  The conference here at the 

Minneapolis Fed is one of these events, as was the “Community Listening Session” 

hosted by the Dallas Fed in February.  Several more Fed Listens events will follow in 

May. 

In addition, we are holding a System research conference on June 4-5, 2019, at 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  

The program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the 

review:  the FOMC’s monetary policy since the financial crisis, assessments of the 

maximum sustainable level of employment, alternative policy frameworks and strategies 

to achieve the dual mandate, policy tools, global considerations, financial stability 

considerations, and central bank communications.  Two sessions will feature panels of 

community leaders who will share their perspectives on the labor market and the effects 

of interest rates on their constituencies.
