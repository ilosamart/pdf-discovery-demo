financial crisis.  But an appropriately tailored response must begin by recognizing that the 

crisis arose following profound changes in both the organization and regulation of 

financial markets that began in the 1970s.   

Starting in 1933, the New Deal established a regulatory system that largely 

confined commercial banks to traditional lending activities within a circumscribed 

geographic area, with attendant limits on price competition and a federal deposit

The turbulent macroeconomic developments of the 1970s, along with

the traditional commercial banking business model.  The squeeze came on both the
