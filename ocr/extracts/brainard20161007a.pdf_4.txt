identities associated with the transactions, which in itself may be facilitated by the use of 

distributed ledgers, depending on their design.  

In securities markets, the industry is exploring activities ranging from the issuance 

of securities on a distributed ledger, to the clearing and settlement of trades, to tracking 

and administering corporate actions.  For securities clearing and settlement in particular, 

the potential shift to one master record shared “simultaneously” among users of a 

distributed ledger-based system could be compelling.  Sharing one immutable record may 

have the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for the reconciliation of multiple 

records linked to a single trade among and between dealers and other organizations.  In 

concept, such technology could lead to greater transparency, reduced costs, and faster 

settlement.  Likewise, distributed ledgers may improve collateral management by 

improving the tracking of ownership and transactions.  Nonetheless, as is frequently true 

in the complex arena of payments, clearing, and settlement, we can also expect that 

practical details covering a host of technical, business, and market issues will have an 

important role in determining how new technologies ultimately perform. 

For commodities and derivatives, there are projects to streamline some of the 

more antiquated corners of the markets.  In markets that are heavily paper-based and lack 

any central means for coordination, distributed ledger technology could potentially be 

leveraged to provide coordination that facilitates exchange, clearing, and settlement of 

obligations. 

A related development is the potential coupling of distributed ledger protocols 

with self-execution and possibly self-enforcement of contractual clauses, using so-called 

“smart contracts.”  To take a familiar example, for a corporate bond with a specified par
