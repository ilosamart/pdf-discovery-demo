communicating, and, potentially, deploying our policy tools independent of one another, 

we have the best chance to achieve the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of price stability

the conduct of operations going forward.  It is far and away the most powerful, its effects

rate.  In my view, the macroeconomic effects of these extraordinary holdings are less 

significant, their effects on financial market conditions less clear, and the markets’ 

understanding of our objectives less understood than our dominant tool. 

Still, if federal fiscal policy is approaching its political or economic limits, some 

believe that the Federal Reserve should do more, including expansion of its balance 

sheet.

strict scrutiny.  I would want to be convinced that the incremental macroeconomic 

benefits outweighed any costs owing to erosion of market functioning, perceptions of 

monetizing indebtedness, crowding-out of private buyers, or loss of central bank 

credibility.  The Fed’s institutional credibility is its most valuable asset, far more 

consequential to macroeconomic performance than its holdings of long-term Treasury
