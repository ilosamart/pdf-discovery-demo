U.S. banks were manageable.  Third, the Treasury stood ready to make capital available 

to any SCAP bank with capital needs through the CAP if they were unable to raise 

private capital.   

In retrospect, it is clear that the public release of the SCAP results played an 

important role in stabilizing the financial system, as has our supervisory follow-up on 

improving capital levels.  By November 2009, the 10 banks that required additional 

capital had increased their Tier 1 Common equity by more than $77 billion, primarily by 

issuing new common equity, converting existing preferred equity to common equity, and 

selling businesses or portfolios of assets.  None of the SCAP banks received CAP funds.3    

Many observers initially criticized the stress tests as overly optimistic. On the one 

hand, they noted that GDP growth was weaker and unemployment higher in 2009 than 

projected in the more adverse scenario.  On the other hand, house prices did not fall as 

much as assumed under the more adverse scenario.  As of the end of 2009, actual losses 

at the 19 banks were less than one-half of the two-year loss estimates under the more 

adverse SCAP scenario, and actual revenues were more than one-half of the two-year 

revenue estimates.  Nevertheless, there is wide variation across the firms, and it is too 

soon to tell whether firms will perform better over the full two years than the SCAP 

estimates.    

The Lessons of the SCAP  

 As I suggested at the outset of my remarks, I doubt that anything as ambitious as 

the SCAP would have been tried--at least as soon as it was--but for the exigencies of the 

financial crisis.  Yet the approach we took in the SCAP was informed by discussions that
