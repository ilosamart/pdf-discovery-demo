Monetary Policy 

The Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with two monetary policy 

objectives, known as our dual mandate--the achievement of maximum employment and 

price stability.  As I noted earlier, the financial crisis and severe recession left the 

economy far below levels of resource utilization consistent with maximum sustained 

employment.  And the wide margins of economic slack that have persisted have moved 

inflation below a level of 2 percent or a bit less, which is the rate that most FOMC 

participants see as consistent with our dual mandate.  In light of these disappointing 

results, monetary policy continues to be focused on ensuring that the economic recovery 

is sufficiently strong to sustain noticeable progress toward our mandated objectives.   

I would like to take a few minutes to offer some perspectives on how monetary 

policy has been meeting this challenge.  As you know, the Federal Reserve responded 

forcefully to the financial crisis by employing a range of measures and programs to 

provide badly needed liquidity to financial institutions and markets.  At the same time, 

the FOMC used both standard and less-conventional forms of monetary policy to 

promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.   

  The standard way in which the FOMC stimulates the economy is by reducing the 

target for the overnight federal funds rate and shaping expectations about future policy 

actions through the FOMCâ€™s statement and other communications.  Such policy actions 

typically lead to lower interest rates and a broader easing of financial conditions that 

together boost business and household spending and net exports.  However, after the 

FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero in December 2008, that 

conventional policy tool was essentially no longer available.  To provide additional
