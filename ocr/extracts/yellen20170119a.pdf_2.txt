It is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting 

monetary policy to promote a healthy economy.  For more than 30 years, research from 

the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has informed economic policy, and 

events such as this one have helped foster debate among scholars, policymakers, business 

leaders, and members of the public on critical economic issues facing our nation.  I 

appreciate the opportunity to participate.   

In my remarks today, I will review the considerable progress the economy has 

made toward the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the 

Federal Reserve--maximum employment and price stability.  The upshot is that labor 

utilization is close to its estimated longer-run normal level, and we are closing in on our 

2 percent inflation objective.  I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary 

policy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and 

stable inflation.  Determining how best to adjust the federal funds rate over time to 

achieve these objectives will not be easy.  For that reason, in the balance of my remarks, I 

will discuss some considerations that will help inform our decisions, including the 

guidance provided by simple policy rules.  I will conclude by touching on some key 

uncertainties affecting the outlook.

depths of the Great Recession, about 15-1/2 million jobs have been added to the U.S. 

economy, on net.  In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the 

pace of 75,000 to 125,000 per month that is probably consistent with keeping the
