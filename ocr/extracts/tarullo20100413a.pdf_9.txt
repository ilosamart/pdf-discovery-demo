unprecedented, step of releasing publicly the methodology and findings of the SCAP, including 

the capital needs and loss estimates for the 19 institutions.   

The decision to make this information public was made in the context of a systemic 

crisis, in which markets were hungry for information and in which the Treasury stood ready to 

inject capital into any of the 19 institutions that were found to need it.  Even so, it was much 

debated within the Federal Reserve, in part because of concerns that weaker banks might be 

significantly harmed by the disclosures.  But I think that regularizing both stress tests and the 

release of information relevant to them deserves serious consideration for at least two reasons. 

First, in line with my earlier discussion of market discipline, releasing such information 

could assist investors in the difficult task of valuing loan portfolios that at present are not very 

transparent.  Second, releasing details about assumptions, methods, and conclusions would 

expose our supervisory approach to greater outside scrutiny and discussion.  Whether the result 

is critique or validation of our approach, the reaction of informed investors and analysts to our 

assumptions and methods would be beneficial.  

I have previously identified several ways we might increase the transparency of our stress 

tests.2  There are doubtless additional possibilities.  There are, to be sure, countervailing 

concerns.  In economic times more normal than those prevailing when we conducted the SCAP, 

market participants will not be fearing the worst and banks will not have access to government 

capital injections as a backstop.  At such a moment, the revelation that some major banks may 

have capital needs under a stress scenario might be unnecessarily destabilizing, though the 

possibility of this kind of market reaction may be lower if such information is released 

frequently.  Major unpleasant surprises would be less likely with frequent, detailed disclosures.
