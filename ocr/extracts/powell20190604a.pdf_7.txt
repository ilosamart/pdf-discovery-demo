The first question raises the issue of whether the FOMC should use makeup 

strategies in response to ELB risks.  By the time of the 1999 conference, research was 

beginning to show that—in models, at least—such strategies could substantially reduce 

the unemployment and other costs of ELB spells.8  The simplest version goes like this:  

Suppose that a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of 

inflation relative to the central bank’s goal.  But what if the central bank promised 

credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the 

economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target?  In the models, the 

prospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could 

greatly reduce the pain of being at the ELB.9  Policymakers discussed this reasoning in 

the wake of the crisis, but neither the Fed nor any other major central bank chose to 

pursue such a policy.10  Why?  For makeup strategies to work, households and businesses 

must go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn.  In 

theory, they would do this based on their confidence that the central bank will deliver the 

makeup stimulus at some point—perhaps years in the future.  In models, great confidence 

in central bankers is achieved by assumption.  Despite the flattering nature of this

9 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a commitment 
to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions.  See also Wolman (2005) for a discussion 
of the effectiveness of price-level targeting at the ELB.  For a discussion of the relationship between price-
level targeting and average-inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005).  The strategy in 
Reifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a Taylor rule modified 
to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes.  Kiley and Roberts (2017) study a 
strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during normal times to compensate 
for below-target inflation during ELB episodes.  Also see Bernanke (2017) for a strategy in which low 
inflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB.  See also Bernanke, 
Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019). 
10 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation-overshooting 
commitment” (p. 1).  The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or 
duration of overshoot.
