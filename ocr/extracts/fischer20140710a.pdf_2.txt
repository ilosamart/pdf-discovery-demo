Although the recession in the United States that started in December 2007 ended 

in June 2009, the impact of the Great Recession, which began when Lehman Brothers 

filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, continues to be felt in the United States, 

Europe, and around the world.1  After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, policymakers, 

working through the G-20, quickly reached agreement on the macroeconomic policies 

needed to minimize the damage done by the crisis.  For their part, central bankers and 

supervisors of financial systems, working through the newly established Financial 

Stability Board (FSB) and the newly enlarged Basel Committee, rapidly developed a 

program for reform of the financial sector and its supervision. 

In this lecture I will ask how much has been achieved so far in implementing the 

ambitious financial sector reform program that was widely agreed at the early stages of 

the global financial crisis.  From among the range of topics in which financial sector 

reforms have been instituted since 2008, I focus on three: capital and liquidity for banks 

and other financial institutions, macroprudential supervision, and the problem of too big 

to fail (TBTF). 

What Happened?  

The 2007-09 crisis was both the worst economic crisis and the worst financial 

crisis since the 1930s.  Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, many thought that we 

were about to witness a second Great Depression.  That did not happen, in large part 

because policymakers had learned some of the lessons of the Great Depression.
