I would like to thank Hal Scott for inviting me to address this conference.1  

The financial system is built on trust, which, history shows, from time to time 

breaks down as a financial panic develops.  Fortunately, major panics are relatively rare, 

but as we all know following the Great Financial Crisis, when they do occur they can be 

extremely destructive of economic activity. 

During the Great Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve System worked together 

with the Treasury and other parts of the U.S. government to limit the damage caused by 

the crisis.  Although the financial crisis inflicted massive damage on the economy and on 

the public, the damage would have been far greater had the Fed not deployed its lender of 

last resort powers to deal with the incipient breakdown of the functioning of the U.S. 

monetary and credit systems.   

Changes in Regulation and Supervision 

In the wake of the crisis, acting within the framework of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 

Federal Reserve and the other supervisory agencies have taken a number of steps that 

reduce the likelihood that lender-of-last-resort loans will be needed.  First and foremost, 

banks and bank holding companies are much better capitalized.  Regulatory requirements 

have been made more stringent, global systemically important banks are subject to 

substantial additional capital requirements, and capital planning and supervisory stress 

testing make capital regulation more forward looking--and the importance of the stress 

tests bears emphasis.
