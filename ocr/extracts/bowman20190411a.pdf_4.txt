The most interesting possibilities emerged in survey responses about small banks 

working together with fintech firms as partners. The community bank respondents to the CSBS 

survey included numerous anecdotes and observations about the important opportunities fintech 

offered community banks to diversify their products, extend their reach, and offer more efficient 

services for their customers.7  

Indeed, fintech firms may complement the activities of community banks well. For 

example, while small businesses may value the relationships that local bankers offer, they don’t 

like the lengthy process of filling out loan applications, waiting for credit decisions, and the time 

it takes small banks to make funds available.8 Those are precisely the types of issues that data-

driven, smartphone-based fintech firms are good at addressing.9  

At the same time, community banks’ particular advantages, mainly their strong 

relationships with their small business customers, would be difficult for smartphone-based 

fintech apps to replicate. Let me give you an example: During last year’s community bank 

research conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,10 a community bank based in 

Santa Barbara described the harrowing months around the end of 2017. As you know all too 

well, a massive wildfire, followed by a deadly series of mudslides, caused devastating damage 

                                                 
7 One Missouri bank described how it uses new technologies (and partnerships) to be one of the first banks in its 
market to offer video banking services. See also CSBS Community Bank Survey in note 5.

and at least $200,000 but less than $2 million in revenue. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
