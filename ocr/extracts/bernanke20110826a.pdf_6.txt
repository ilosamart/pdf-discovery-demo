developments create a virtuous circle of rising incomes and profits, more supportive 

financial and credit conditions, and lower uncertainty, allowing the process of recovery to 

develop momentum. 

These restorative forces are at work today, and they will continue to promote 

recovery over time.  Unfortunately, the recession, besides being extraordinarily severe as 

well as global in scope, was also unusual in being associated with both a very deep slump 

in the housing market and a historic financial crisis.  These two features of the downturn, 

individually and in combination, have acted to slow the natural recovery process.   

Notably, the housing sector has been a significant driver of recovery from most 

recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time--with an overhang of 

distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for builders and potential 

homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about 

continued house price declines--the rate of new home construction has remained at less 

than one-third of its pre-crisis level.  The low level of construction has implications not 

only for builders but for providers of a wide range of goods and services related to 

housing and homebuilding.  Moreover, even as tight credit for some borrowers has been 

one of the factors restraining housing recovery, the weakness of the housing sector has in 

turn had adverse effects on financial markets and on the flow of credit.  For example, the 

sharp declines in house prices in some areas have left many homeowners “underwater” 

on their mortgages, creating financial hardship for households and, through their effects 

on rates of mortgage delinquency and default, stress for financial institutions as well.  

Financial pressures on financial institutions and households have contributed, in turn, to 

greater caution in the extension of credit and to slower growth in consumer spending.
