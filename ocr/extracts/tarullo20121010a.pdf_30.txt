Act lists, the new factor is simply “risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.”  In the 
Bank Holding Company Act §3(c)list, the factor is “greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United 
States banking or financial system.”  While the import of this different wording does not seem great, it is unclear 
why it was chosen in this provision and not in the Bank Merger Act, which also covers bank acquisitions.

26 See, e.g., United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S. 290 (1897). 
27 Section 165 (b)(3) adds two additional considerations: 1) whether the firm owns an insured depository institution 
and 2) the nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the firm. 
28 For example, if the loss to the financial system from the failure of a systemically important firm would be five 
times that resulting from failure of the non-systemic firm, then the firm would have to hold additional capital 
sufficient to make the expected probability of failure one-fifth that of the non-systemic institution.  
29 Among the useful efforts along these lines are a measure of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) (See Tobias 
Adrian and Markus Brunnermeier (2011), CoVaR, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports 348 (New 
York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, September) and a measure of systemic risk based on each firm’s 
contribution to the expected capital shortfall of the entire financial system in a crisis (See Christian T. Brownlees 
and Robert F. Engle (2011), “Volatility, Correlation and Tails for Systemic Risk Measurement,” New York 
University Working Paper (New York: New York University, June).  The concept behind the latter measure is also 
described in Viral V. Acharya, Christian Brownlees, Farhang Farazmand, and Matthew Richardson, “Measuring 
Systemic Risk,,” in Regulating Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance 
(Wiley Publishers, 2011) , .,pp. 87-119.  Updated systemic risk rankings are maintained by the authors at

Andrew W. Lo, and Loriana Pelizzon (2010), “Measuring Systemic Risk in the Finance and Insurance Sectors,” 
MIT Sloan School Working Paper 4774-10 (Cambridge, MA: MIT Sloan School of Management, March). 
30 It is worth noting, in this regard, that in developing systemic risk capital requirements one early idea was to 
construct a continuously varying function for calculating a systemic risk surcharge.  That is, a formula for 
calculating a firm's "systemic footprint" based on relevant characteristics such as size of assets, liabilities, 
counterparty exposures, and the like would yield a specific capital surcharge for each firm with more than $50 
billion in assets.  While the difficulties with this approach went beyond the false precision that it would have given 
the surcharge, that was certainly one consideration in declining to adopt this approach. 
31 Another important provision requiring interpretation of financial stability as a legal standard is the designation of 
systemically important nonbank institutions by the FSOC.  As noted earlier, this is an instance in which an 
evaluation of financial stability effects is the direct test for action.  In implementing this authority the FSOC took a 
methodical, comparative approach.  Details can be found in Financial Stability Oversight Council (2012), “Authority 
to Require Supervision and Regulation of Certain Nonbank Financial Companies,” Federal Register, vol. 77 (April 
11), pp. 21637.  In the first stage of the process it has established, the FSOC applies a purely quantitative screen in 
order to identify nonbank financial companies that merit further consideration.  In Stage 2, the Council conducts an 
in-depth analysis of each firm that has been identified through the Stage 1 screens, based on information that is 
either publicly available or already in the possession of financial regulators.  After this analysis is complete, firms 
that the Council believes merit further consideration will be moved into Stage 3, during which information will also 
be collected directly from the firms.  On the basis of this review, the Council may vote by the necessary two-thirds 
majority to designate the firm as systemically important.  The Council has also elaborated, in general terms, the
