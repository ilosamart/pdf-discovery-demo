research identified some of the barriers to economic progress shared by these 

communities, including inadequate schools and workforce skills, lack of investment in 

infrastructure and business development, and limited institutional capacity.  Not 

surprisingly, these communities were particularly ill-equipped to deal with the recession.  

 Of course, economic conditions in a given community both affect and are affected 

by the economic status of the individuals and families in that community.  One of the 

most valuable sources of data on family finances is the Federal Reserve Board’s triennial 

Survey of Consumer Finances.2  To better understand the effects of the crisis on 

households, the Board, in a special update to its 2007 survey, asked the participants about 

their financial and personal circumstances two years later, in 2009.3  The findings help 

illustrate the challenges facing families and communities.  

According to this special survey, lower-income households continued to 

experience significantly more unemployment than higher-income households.  In 2009, 

nearly one-fourth of the families in the bottom half of the income distribution had at least 

one member who was out of work for some portion of the year prior to the survey; this 

rate was about double that of higher-income households.   

 Declines in the values of homes and stocks sharply reduced the wealth of many 

Americans during the crisis.  Three-fifths or more of families across all income groups 

reported a decline in wealth between 2007 and 2009, and the typical household lost 

nearly one-fifth of its wealth, regardless of income group.  Moreover, one in eight of the
