I am pleased to join you for the eighth biennial Federal Reserve System 

Community Affairs Research Conference.  The work you are doing here--sharing 

research and exchanging ideas on how best to further the development of low-income 

communities--is vitally important.   

As this year’s theme, “Resilience and Rebuilding,” reflects, low-income 

communities were particularly hard hit by the Great Recession.

  And, while employment 

and housing show signs of improving for the nation as a whole, conditions in lower-

income neighborhoods remain difficult by many measures.  For example, an analysis by 

Federal Reserve staff reveals that long-vacant housing units tend to be concentrated in a 

small number of neighborhoods that also tend to have high unemployment rates, low 

educational levels, and low median incomes.

  While some of these neighborhoods are in 

the inner cities, others are in suburbs.   

This analysis and others like it illustrate the close interconnections of housing 

conditions, educational levels, and unemployment experience within neighborhoods.  

Moreover, as this work confirms, poverty is no longer primarily an urban phenomenon 

but has increasingly spread to suburban areas, many of which lack the social and 

community development services needed to mitigate poverty and its effects.

  The 

implications of these trends for community development are profound.  Successful

 For example, the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data show that the average wealth of individuals in 

low- and moderate-income areas declined on a percentage basis more than that in higher-income areas 

(21 percent versus 17 percent).  See the 2007-09 SCF panel data, available at
