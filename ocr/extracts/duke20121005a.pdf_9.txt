 Phoenix, Arizona, is a good example of an area with many census tracts that fit into the 

“housing boom” typology.  Phoenix was one of the areas hit hard during the housing bust, with a 

peak-to-trough decline in prices of more than 50 percent.14  More recently, however, prices in 

Phoenix have rebounded with a double-digit increase over the 12 months ending in July.15  

Reportedly, much of this demand is driven by investors who are converting vacant homes into 

rental properties.  Direct statistical evidence on investor activity at the local level is not available. 

However, since investors tend to finance their purchases with cash or other non-mortgage 

financing, the level of cash purchases can provide an indicator of investor activity.  In the past 

two years, the fraction of home purchases financed with cash in the Phoenix area was much 

higher than the national average.16  This is an example of the private market stepping in to 

purchase vacant units and in turn increasing housing values.   

As encouraging as this trend may be, it is not a panacea. For example, it is possible that 

aggressive investor activity could crowd out potential homeowners, especially low- to moderate-

income households.  In addition, investors are not interested in all markets; therefore, there will 

still be some areas where private investment will not step in to curb the problems associated with 

vacant properties.   

The problem of investors crowding out local homebuyers could be addressed through 

“first look” programs that provide a window, usually 15 days, during which time only 

prospective homebuyers and nonprofits may bid on a property.  In Phoenix, non-profit 

organizations and local government officials used Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) 

funding and enlisted local real estate professionals to match vacant homes with eligible
