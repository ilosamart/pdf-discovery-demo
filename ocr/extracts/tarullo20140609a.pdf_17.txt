substituting a dynamic for a static capital calculation, there is an important macroprudential 

motivation, reflected in the design of scenarios and the required levels of post-stress capital.   

The efficacy of the CCAR process is substantially enhanced as the information systems 

and internal risk-management capacities of the firm improve.  Beyond this important, but 

discrete regulatory measure, well-developed processes for determining risk appetite give 

supervisors better insight into risks specific to the activities and strategic decisions of each firm.  

As a result, supervisors should be better able to identify points at which a firmâ€™s risk-taking may 

diverge from that which is consistent with microprudential and macroprudential objectives.  

This, in turn, should permit more timely supervisory or regulatory responses. 

Regulatory Objectives and Fiduciary Duties 

 The regulatory focus on risk in corporate governance will produce additional examples of 

each of the three kinds of measures I have just described.  For instance, the Office of the 

Comptroller of the Currency has recently proposed guidance for risk governance at large national 

banks.16  Still, particularly with an audience half composed of corporate law professors, it is 

natural to ask whether corporate law tools might usefully supplement regulatory measures.  

Specifically, the question arises as to whether the fiduciary duties of the boards of regulated 

financial firms should be modified to reflect what I have characterized as regulatory objectives.  

Doing so might make the boards of financial firms responsive to the broader interests implicated 

by their risk-taking decisions even where regulatory and supervisory measures had not 

anticipated or addressed a particular issue.  And, of course, the courts would thereby be available 

as another route for managing the divergence between private and social interests in risk-taking.
