the importance of the United States in the global economy, it is hard to believe that any 

foreign country would gain if our economy were to fall back into another recession.  Over 

the longer term, the health and vitality of the global economy will depend importantly on 

the sustained, vigorous recovery in the United States that our asset purchase program is 

intended to support. 

Conclusion 

 In closing, let me reiterate that the program of asset purchases initiated by the 

Federal Open Market Committee in November is intended to support economic recovery 

from an exceptionally deep recession and to restore inflation to, but not above, levels that 

FOMC participants consider consistent with price stability.  It will not be a panacea, but  

I believe it will be effective in fostering maximum employment and price stability.Â
