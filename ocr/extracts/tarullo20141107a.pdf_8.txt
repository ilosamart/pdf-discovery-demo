community bankers that many regulations could be tailored more appropriately for community 

banks.  I encourage you to participate in the EGRPRA process by giving us specific examples of 

regulations that should be modified in this way and, even more helpfully, by suggesting specific 

ways in which they might be usefully be tailored. 12 

As to exempting community banks entirely from certain regulations, I should note first 

that many of the statutory requirements introduced by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act do not by their own terms apply to community banks.  So, for example, 

the extensive enhanced prudential standards required by section 165 of Dodd-Frank for bank 

holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets do not apply to smaller banks.  Nor do 

the requirements for stress testing and resolution planning.13  Similarly, the banking agencies 

have used their discretion to exclude community banks from the coverage of some new 

regulations adopted following the crisis.  For example, we recently approved a final rule 

implementing in the United States a Basel agreement that establishes a quantitative minimum 

liquidity requirement, but limited its coverage to banking organizations with more than $50 

billion in assets.14  We excluded community and smaller regional banks, which generally have 

relatively simple funding profiles and do not pose a significant potential risk to the financial 

system. 

However, some statutory requirements by their terms apply to all banks.  Even if we do 

not believe that they actually advance safety and soundness aims for community banks, or 

produce only a small benefit at a disproportionately large compliance cost, we must still enforce
