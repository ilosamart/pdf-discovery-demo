both cases, workers and firms are able to achieve a good outcome with less turnover and 

presumably no loss of productivity.   

While it seems possible that improved information could be a force behind the 

reduction in geographic mobility and labor turnover, there are less benign possibilities as 

well.  For instance, an increase in the costs to firms of hiring and firing individuals or an 

increase in the costs to individuals of changing jobs could lead to fewer productivity-

enhancing job changes.  Alternatively, the reduction in churning could itself be a function 

of slower productivity growth, as slower productivity growth implies lower benefits to 

forming new matches.   

One recent trend that is particularly disturbing is stagnation in the formation of 

new firms.  Statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that the number of 

establishments in operation for less than one year rose between the mid-1990s, when the 

data start, and the early 2000s.  But, smoothing through the ups and downs of the 

business cycle, new firm formation has been roughly flat since then.  Moreover, the 

number of individuals working at such firms stands almost 2 million below its peak in 

1999.  Given the role of innovation by entrepreneurs and the well-documented 

importance of successful young firms in creating jobs, these trends are disheartening.   

The lagging share of national income accruing to workers 

A second adverse development in recent years has been the apparent reduction in 

the share of overall national income that accrues to workers.  Here I will be brief and 

suggestive because the scholarship is far from settled.  But the basic trends in the data are 

troubling.  Laborâ€™s share of total income generated in the nonfarm business sector has 

been on a downtrend since the 1980s and has fallen sharply since the turn of the
