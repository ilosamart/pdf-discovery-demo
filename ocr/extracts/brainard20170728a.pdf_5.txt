economics.  I am glad I did.  I enormously value the intellectual framework associated 

with economics, and my career has provided terrific opportunities both to range far afield 

and to work within the field.  In short, I hope you will think of economics not as shutting 

doors on other opportunities, but rather as equipping you to pursue a whole new set of 

opportunities. 

Given the benefits I have described to the profession and society from increasing 

diversity in the ranks of economists, as well as the opportunity a degree in economics 

affords to individuals who pursue the field, it makes sense to look closely, as the AEA 

and others continue to do, at the reasons more women and minorities do not concentrate 

in economics in college or depart from economics as they move toward graduation.  To 

the undergraduates in the audience today who are participating in the Summer Program, I 

would be interested to hear what you believe may be discouraging women and minorities 

from choosing economics in school and careers, so that we can take steps to reduce any 

barriers. 

The AEA and other groups are rightly focused on what universities and other 

institutions can do to promote diversity in economics.  Let me now direct my attention to 

diversity at my institution, the Federal Reserve, because it is both one of the largest 

employers of PhD economists in the country and a prominent public institution.  The 

share of women and minorities among economists at the Fed is similar to the numbers for 

the profession at large, and these numbers have likewise improved fairly little since 2009.  

Something that has changed over that time, however, is the elevation in importance of 

diversity efforts, including recruitment.  The Board of Governors is making considerable 

effort to recruit and retain economists who are women and minorities.
