was simply the person or entity that recognized the importance of preventing further 

deterioration in the local economy and agreed to take responsibility for the effort to turn 

things around.  The leader helped facilitate local collaboration, which was essential not 

only because economic development is complicated and multidimensional, but also for 

the more prosaic reason that outside funders typically require that all interested 

stakeholders commit to a strategic direction.  

The specific avenues to recovery varied among the resurgent cities identified in 

the Boston Fed study.  Some built on traditional strengths, while others created new 

business clusters from scratch.  For example, Grand Rapids, Michigan, was once known 

for its furniture manufacturing.  As those jobs disappeared, Grand Rapids worked to 

become a major medical center in the region, partnering with Michigan State University 

and Grand Valley State University to form the Medical Education and Research Center.  

Similarly, Jersey City has successfully transformed itself from a manufacturing-based 

economy to a financial center.  Its proximity to New York City makes this transformation 

seem obvious in hindsight, but other similarly situated cities have not made comparable 

strides. 

Most of the cities in the study made significant investments in infrastructure and 

people to aid the transition to a knowledge-based economy.  For example, Greensboro, 

North Carolina, worked with the nearby cities of Winston-Salem and High Point to build 

a regional airport and to replace its manufacturing economy with one based on high-tech 

research and production.  In a common pattern, Greensboro drew on local resources in 

post-secondary education, with community colleges providing courses to enhance job 

skills and universities partnering with businesses to develop innovative products--in
