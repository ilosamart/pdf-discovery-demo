decline in participation during the recovery is due to slack, another sign that help from 

the Fed can still be effective.  

Since late 2008, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to revive the economy.  At 

the height of the crisis, we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial 

system, which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people

the labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly.  Earlier this
