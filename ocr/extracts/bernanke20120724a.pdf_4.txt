evaluations, long-term benefits were demonstrated for a full-day early childhood 

education program starting before age 1 and for a nurse-based home visiting program.5 

 Economically speaking, early childhood programs are a good investment, with 

inflation-adjusted annual rates of return on the funds dedicated to these programs 

estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6  Very few alternative investments can promise 

that kind of return.  Notably, a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children 

themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority 

of the benefits, reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers 

make to the economy.7  

The Federal Reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for 

children, including the youngest.  Federal Reserve Banks have published articles and 

convened community forums on early childhood issues.  For school-age children, we 

sponsor financial literacy and economic education programs.  For these programs, we 

make a special effort to reach schools with high proportions of minorities and lower-

income children.
