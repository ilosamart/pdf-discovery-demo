arrangements (and the “gig” economy).22 23  Unpredictable income and dangerously low 

emergency savings raise the strain on households and, over time, have pushed them to 

rely on other means, such as borrowing and government transfers, to try to meet their 

spending needs.24  

Education and homeownership have long been key paths to opportunity, but the 

Great Recession has raised some important questions about asset building strategies.  The 

sharp decline in house prices and the substantial rise in student loan debt have made it 

clear that investments in homeownership and education are not without risk, and the 

payoff can vary depending on the circumstances.25 

Homeownership for many has been a way to turn a regular expense into an asset-

building investment in the future, which is especially important given the wide and 

persistent disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity.  But the experience of the past 

decade suggests that owning a home can, in some circumstances, exacerbate financial 

difficulties for vulnerable families in a downturn.  The lesson that even a moderate 

decline in house prices can erase home equity applies broadly, along with the importance 

of sound underwriting and servicing, but the painful consequences in the recession were 

greater among minority and low-income homeowners.26  The fact, discussed earlier, that

23 Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2012) documented a rise in household income volatility from the early 
1970s to late 2008.  In contrast, studies such as Celik and others (2012) do not find a rise in household 
income volatility in the 2000s.  Koo (2016) shows a rise in earnings volatility in the Great Recession.  
Studies of annual income may even understate the volatility, as the financial diaries showed considerable 
month-to-month fluctuations in income among low- and middle-income households.

26 Bhutta and Ringo (2015) and the studies discussed therein argue that the Community Reinvestment Act, 
and its encouragement of lending in low- and moderate-income communities, was not a significant 
contributor to the financial crisis. Well-serviced and correctly-structured mortgages performed well for 
low-income borrowers even during a decline in house prices.
