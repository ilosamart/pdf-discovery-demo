decline in foreign growth reduced demand for American exports, as well as profits and 

investment at U.S. firms, which were also adversely affected by declines in the price of 

oil. Over the twelve months ending in April, manufacturing output increased only 0.4

easing in financial conditions since mid-February and the recent firmness in oil prices 

were to continue, along with stabilization of the dollar, business investment and exporters 

would benefit.

Of course, there are risks to the projection that future GDP growth will be strong 

enough to deliver progress on inflation and employment.  Most immediately, there is 

important uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s June 23 “Brexit” referendum on 

whether to leave the European Union (EU).  The International Monetary Fund has noted 

that a vote in favor of Brexit could unsettle financial markets and create a period of 

uncertainty while the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU is 

renegotiated.  Although the economic effects of this uncertainty and the costs of adjusting 

to altered trade and financial ties are difficult to quantify, we cannot rule out a significant 

adverse reaction to such an outcome in the near term, such as a substantial jump in
