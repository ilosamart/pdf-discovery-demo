interconnectedness, sensitivity to market risk, and funding and liquidity exposures.  

These efforts will help us focus not only on risks to individual firms, but also on 

concentrations of risk that may arise through common exposures or sensitivity to 

common shocks.  For example, we are now collecting additional data in a manner that 

will allow for the more timely and consistent measurement of individual bank and 

systemic exposures to syndicated corporate loans.  In addition, supervisors are mining 

detailed data from banks' risk-management systems and aggregating, where possible, the 

largest exposures to other banks, nonbank financial institutions, and corporate borrowers.  

That effort can reveal banks’ common exposures to individual borrowers and help assess 

the effect of a failure of a large financial institution on individual banks or the system 

more broadly. 

Last year’s stress assessment was a one-time event in the sense that circumstances 

may not again call for a simultaneous evaluation of institutions holding two-thirds of the 

banking system’s assets.  But we are incorporating elements of the assessment into our 

ongoing supervision of capital adequacy.  We are developing and refining the tools 

necessary to better gauge appropriate capital buffers for our largest firms.  As a follow-on 

effort to last year’s stress assessment, we are now conducting a horizontal examination to 

evaluate whether these banks can effectively estimate their capital needs and identify 

resources to meet those needs.  

 Bankers need to conduct their own stress tests as well.  Two years ago at this 

conference, before the SCAP had been conceived, I discussed, among other topics, the
