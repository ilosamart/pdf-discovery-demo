investment through various channels.  But low rates may also perversely induce some 

households to save more in order to meet their targets for retirement.  And low rates have 

clearly not produced a boom in corporate investment, although standard accelerator 

models suggest that investment has largely been consistent with the weak pace of 

economic growth.  Nonetheless, there is good reason to think that low rates have 

provided significant support for demand, and my view is that they have done so.2  As you 

can see in slide 1, we are now close to meeting our dual mandate--a reasonable summary 

statistic for the effects of policy.  While growth has been frustratingly slow, employment 

gains have been solid. This is a reasonably good outcome considering the scope of the 

crisis and the relatively poorer performance of other major advanced economies.   

Other Factors Are Holding Down Rates 

There are also many factors other than monetary policy that are holding down 

long-term interest rates.  Long-term nominal and real rates have been declining for over 

30 years.  The next slide decomposes long-term nominal yields into expected future 

short-term real rates, expected future inflation, and a term premium.  These estimates are 

based on one of the Board’s workhorse term structure models.3  All three components 

have contributed to the downward trend in long-term nominal yields.   

The downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower 

inflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchored, nominal bonds have 

become an increasingly good hedge against market risk.  That has made bonds a more 

                                                 
2 See Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).  The most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, 
such as consumer durables and residential investment, have exhibited higher growth than other sectors 
since the second round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.  And, for example, Mian, Rao, and 
Sufi (2013) conclude that the decline in house prices during the recession had a substantial effect on 
consumption; by the same argument, if low rates supported house prices, then they would have supported 
consumer spending as well.
