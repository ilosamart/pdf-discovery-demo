Broad macroeconomic policies have not changed direction in the past several years.  But 

change they must, if we are to prosper.  In my remarks, I will first venture outside the realm of 

monetary policy.  I do this not in the hope of expanding further the remit of the Federal Reserve.  

To the contrary--I do this because of the heavy burdens being heaped upon monetary policy.  To 

give monetary policy a chance to be more effective, other key macroeconomic policies--fiscal, 

regulatory, and trade policy--cannot be working at cross-purposes.  So, let me discuss how these 

policies--some long-in-the-making--might be reformed to restore the purpose and promise of our 

prosperity.  Then, I will return to the conduct of monetary policy. 

Sharing the Burden 

We can no longer afford to tolerate economic policies that are preoccupied with the here-

and-now.  Chronic short-termism in the conduct of economic policy has done much to bring us 

to this parlous point.  Think of your businesses in the public markets--and the harm that can be 

done to long-term prospects--if you were to do nothing but yield to the whims of analysts and the 

tyranny of quarterly measures.  The best of your firms most surely deliver on your promises to 

your stakeholders, but your strategic judgments are made with a focus on the long term.  You 

should accept no less from your country’s policymakers. 

By now, policymakers should be skeptical of the long-term benefits of temporary fixes-- 

one-off Band-Aids and short-cuts--to do the hard work of resurrecting the world’s great 

economic power.  Consider the fiscal impulse.  No doubt aggregate demand fell dramatically 

during the recession, and its weakness continues to mark the economic landscape.  Since early 

2008, the fiscal authorities sought to fill the hole left by the falloff in demand through large, 

temporary stimulus--checks-in-the-mail to spur consumption, temporary housing rebates to raise
