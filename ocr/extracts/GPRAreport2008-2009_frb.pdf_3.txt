Government Performance and Results Act
Biennial Performance Report
2008–2009

INTRODUCTION

About This Biennial Performance Report

The Government Performance and Results Act

(GPRA) of 1993 requires that federal agencies, in con-

sultation with the Congress and outside stakeholders,

prepare a strategic plan covering a multiyear period

and submit an annual performance plan and perfor-

mance report. Although the Board of Governors of the

Federal Reserve System (Board) is not covered by

GPRA, the Board of Governors voluntarily complies

with the spirit of GPRA and, like federal agencies, pre-

pares these regular plans and reports.

Consistent with the requirements of GPRA, this Per-

formance Report is based on two earlier Board docu-

ments covering the same period—the Government Per-

formance and Results Act Strategic Planning Document,

2008–2011 and the Government Performance and

Results Act Biennial Performance Plan, 2008–2009,

both published in 2008.1 This report covers two years

rather than just one because the Board operates under

a biennial budget.

Like the Biennial Performance Plan 2008–2009, this

report focuses on four areas: the Board’s monetary

policy function, its bank supervision and regulation

function, its operations in overseeing Federal Reserve

System (the System) activities, and its management

activities to improve e�ectiveness and e�ciency.

Although a discussion of the Federal Reserve System

and its structure is provided below to help explain the

performance measures used by the Board, this perfor-

mance report focuses solely on Board operations.

As required by GPRA, this report is issued indepen-

dently of other Board documents submitted to the

Congress. However, considering the report in conjunc-

tion with other Board documents gives a more detailed

understanding of Board planning, budgeting, opera-

tions, and performance. As required by the Federal

Reserve Act, the Board annually submits a report to the

Congress describing in detail the operations of the Sys-

tem for the previous year. Since 1985, the Board has

also provided the Congress with a supplement, the

Annual Report: Budget Review, which describes in

detail the plans and resources discussed in the approved

budgets of the Board and the Reserve Banks. The most

recent versions of these two documents were provided

to the Congress in 2010.2

Overview of the Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the

United States, established by the Congress to provide

the nation with a safer, more �exible, and more stable

monetary and �nancial system. Over the years, its role

in banking and the economy has expanded, and today

the Federal Reserve’s duties fall into �ve general areas:

1. conducting the nation’s monetary policy by in�u-

encing money and credit conditions in the economy

in pursuit of maximum employment and stable

prices

2. supervising and regulating banking institutions to

ensure the safety and soundness of the nation’s

banking system, maintaining the stability of the

�nancial system, and containing systemic risk that

may arise in �nancial markets

3. protecting the credit rights of consumers and

encouraging banks to meet the credit needs of con-

sumers, including those in low- and moderate-

income neighborhoods

4. playing a major role in operating the nation’s pay-

ment systems
