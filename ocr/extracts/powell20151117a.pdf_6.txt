regimes.  As the reform process moves forward, this will be an important area of 

focus.  

All of these efforts are directly aimed at strengthening FMIs.  But the 

strength and resilience of a CCP ultimately depends on the strength and resilience 

of its clearing members.  Iâ€™d now like to shift focus to the relationship between 

these market utilities and the institutions that use them.   

 Barring an operational event, CCPs only face credit or liquidity risk when 

one of their members fails to make a payment when due.  Thus, one effective way 

to make a CCP safer is to make its members safer.  In that sense, the post-crisis 

reforms that have greatly strengthened our largest and most systemically important 

banking institutions have directly benefitted CCPs and other FMIs.  

 While requiring bank holding companies and their associated broker-dealers 

to be better capitalized and hold more liquid assets has unquestionably made them 

safer, it has also raised their balance sheet costs and thereby created incentives to 

scale back on less profitable business lines.  Clearing has traditionally been a low 

margin business, and broker-dealers have often offered these services to clients in 

the belief that doing so may lead to more profitable business.  In the new 

environment, broker dealers are reconsidering this model, and may reduce services 

to smaller clients or move to an agency model with higher fees.
