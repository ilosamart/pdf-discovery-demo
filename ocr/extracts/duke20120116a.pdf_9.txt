been engaged in a conversation about how we might better explain our framework for 

decisionmaking.  In designing its communications, the FOMC faces complexities that 

make clear communication more difficult than you might think. 

First, we need to explain the way we think about both parts of our dual mandate.    

Establishing a target for inflation is a tool used by many central banks to anchor inflation 

expectations.  Central banks can establish such a target because, over the longer run, 

inflation is determined primarily by monetary policy.  By contrast, the level of 

unemployment that would be considered to be consistent with maximum employment is 

influenced by factors other than monetary policy that may vary over time.  The difficulty 

for the Federal Reserve lies in communicating clearly about the employment portion of 

the mandate without creating an impression that the Committee is either establishing an 

unemployment target or ignoring that part of the mandate altogether. 

  I do not believe that establishing an inflation target is inconsistent with a 

commitment to both parts of the dual mandate.  On the contrary, it can help with thinking 

about and achieving both of our mandated objectives.  For example, if having an explicit 

numerical target for inflation helps anchor inflation expectations over the longer run, then 

monetary policy will have greater flexibility to pursue the goal of maximum employment 

in the shorter term.   

The second complexity in our communication has to do with the nature of 

Committee decisionmaking and the unusual voting structure of our Committee.  For 

example, when preparing for a Committee meeting, I formulate my own outlook for the 

economy and opinions about the best policy path to follow.  But I also rely on the 

Committee discussion to help me decide whether or not to support the policy favored by
