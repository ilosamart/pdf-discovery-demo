selling assets, liabilities, or business units of the firm; transferring the systemically 

significant or viable operations of the firm to a new bridge entity that can continue these 

operations; and repudiating burdensome contracts of the firm, subject to appropriate 

conditions and compensation. 

Third, there should be a clear expectation that the shareholders and creditors of 

the failing firm will bear losses to the fullest extent consistent with preserving financial 

stability.  Shareholders of the firm ultimately are responsible for the organization’s 

management (or, more likely, mismanagement) and are supposed to be in a first-loss 

position upon failure of the firm.  Shareholders, therefore, should pay the price for the 

firm’s failure and should not benefit from a government-managed resolution process.  

To promote market discipline on the part of the creditors of large, interconnected 

firms, unsecured creditors of the firms must also bear losses.  Here is where the potential 

conflict of policy goals is obvious.  While losses imposed on creditors will increase 

market discipline in the longer term, the immediate effect could be to provoke a run on 

other firms with broadly similar positions or business strategies.  Thus the extent of these 

losses and the manner in which they are applied may need to depend on the facts of the 

individual case.  At the very least, however, subordinated debt, or other financial interests 

that can qualify as regulatory capital, should be fully exposed to losses. 

Fourth, the ultimate cost of any government assistance provided in the course of 

the resolution process to prevent severe disruptions to the financial system should be 

borne by the firm or the financial services industry, not by taxpayers.  The scope of 

financial institutions assessed for these purposes should be appropriately broad, reflecting 

that a wide range of financial institutions likely would benefit, directly or indirectly, from
