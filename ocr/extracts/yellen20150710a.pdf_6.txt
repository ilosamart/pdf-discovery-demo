workforce and other demographic trends.  Cyclical and structural factors both have 

affected a number of measures of labor market outcomes that bear on our assessment of 

slack, including labor force participation (that is, how many people are working or are 

actively looking for work), the number of people working part time who would rather 

work full time, the pace of hiring, and the rate at which people are quitting jobs.   

Let’s first consider the labor force participation rate.  It continued to decline 

substantially after the recession ended, with the pace of those declines slowing only over 

the past year or so even as the unemployment rate has continued to fall.  Many working-

age people who are not in the labor force have chosen that status voluntarily; examples 

would include retirees, teenagers and young adults in school, and people staying home to 

care for children and other dependent family members.  Even in a stronger job market, it 

is likely that many of these individuals would prefer not to work.  And, indeed, a 

noticeable portion of the decline in labor force participation seen over the past decade or 

so clearly relates to the aging of baby boomers and their ongoing retirements.2  However, 

the pace of decline in the participation rate accelerated during the recession, as some 

individuals who lost their jobs became discouraged and stopped looking for work.  It 

appears that, despite a drop in the participation rate reported in June, the pace of this 

decline has slowed since early last year.  Nevertheless I think a significant number of 

individuals still are not seeking work because they perceive a lack of good job 

opportunities, and that a stronger economy would draw some of them back into the labor 

force.
