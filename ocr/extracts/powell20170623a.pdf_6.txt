underlying assets being cleared or non-cash collateral into cash.  For this reason, CCPs should 

carefully consider liquidity when launching new products and only offer clearing of products that 

can be sold quickly, even in times of stress.  Liquidity problems can occur in central clearing 

even if all counterparties have the financial resources to meet their obligations, if they are unable 

to convert those resources into cash quickly enough.  The amount of liquidity risk that CCPs face 

can sometimes dwarf the amount of credit or market risk they face.  This is particularly true for 

the clearing of cash securities such as Treasuries.  In that case, the securities being cleared are 

extremely safe and likely to rise in value in times of stress.  But in contrast to most cleared 

derivatives, the cash payments involved are very large because counterparties exchange cash for 

the delivery of the security on a gross basis. 

I will look at these risks from two perspectives, first in terms of the payments that CCPs 

must make, and then in terms of the payments they expect to receive. 


Payment Flows from CCPs  

In the case of a member’s default, a CCP must be equipped to make the cash payments 

owed to non-defaulting counterparties when due.  This requirement can be met as long as there is 

sufficient margin, mutualized resources such as the guarantee fund, or the CCP’s own resources 

held in cash and in the required currency.  But if those funds are held in securities, then the CCP 

will need to convert them to cash, either by entering into a repurchase agreement, or using them 

as collateral to draw on a line of credit.  And if the CCP holds either cash or securities 

denominated in a currency different from the one in which payment must be made, it will need to 

either engage in a spot FX transaction or in an FX swap.
