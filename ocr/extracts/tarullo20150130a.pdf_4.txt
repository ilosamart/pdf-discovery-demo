measures might realistically be implemented and take effect, and the right calibration of 

measures that will be efficacious in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing well-

underwritten credit flows in the economy. 

 Even if these issues could be addressed and a time-varying macroprudential measure 

developed and applied, there is some reason to believe that regulatory relaxation of such a 

requirement may not have much effect on the downside of an economic or financial cycle.  

Market discipline, which may have been lax in boom years, tends to become very strict when 

conditions deteriorate rapidly.  At that point, counterparties and investors may look unfavorably 

at a reduction in capital levels or margins or other protective measures, despite their formal 

elimination by regulators and despite the potential benefits for the economy as a whole. 

 None of this is to say that analysis of possible time-varying macroprudential tools should 

not continue.  Indeed, some are clearly appropriate for near-term use.  For example, since good 

prudential supervision must always be time-varying, we should continue to adapt oversight with 

a view to changing conditions.  And we will be working with the other banking regulators to 

build out the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer regime, which takes effect in the United 

States next year.  But as a realistic matter, the role of time-varying macroprudential tools is 

probably limited for the immediate future.    

At the same time, there is both considerable need and potential for completing or 

developing in the near- to medium-term what I have termed structural macroprudential measures.  

Of course, there are intellectual and practical challenges here as well, including the need to 

assess the impact of the measures on economic and financial activity in non-stress times.  But 

unlike time-varying measures, which often must be adopted swiftly to be effective, structural 

measures can be developed through a full and careful process, including normal administrative
