Updating U.S. Dollar LIBOR 

Let me first address the efforts the Federal Reserve is considering, in cooperation 

with the LIBOR administrator and U.K. authorities, to update the mechanics of U.S. 

dollar LIBOR.  Our aim is to make LIBOR more robust and more representative of 

current bank funding costs.  In this regard, we have considered two important attributes 

of LIBOR--its definition and the data used to produce it.   

While the current definition of LIBOR is limited to unsecured borrowing between 

banks, LIBOR is actually intended to represent the overall cost of banks’ unsecured 

borrowing.  At the time LIBOR was created, a substantial amount of that unsecured 

borrowing was in the interbank market, but that is no longer the case.  Broadening the 

definition to include the unsecured borrowing from nonbanks would make the rate more 

representative of current funding practices.  Changing the definition of LIBOR, as has 

been done in the past, would acknowledge the fact that a reference rate must adapt to 

continue to represent what it is meant to measure.9   

Updating the definition of U.S. dollar LIBOR could also allow other sources of 

transactions data to be incorporated into it.  Potentially, we could even move away from 

the current panel-based method of calculating U.S. dollar LIBOR to a rate that is fully 

transactions based.  In April, the Federal Reserve began collecting data from banks on a 

                                                 
9 For a reference to a past change in LIBOR, see the British Bankers’ Association’s website “BBA LIBOR” 

at www.bbalibor.com/disclaimer/explained/historical-perspective.  The design of BBA LIBOR has seen 

one significant change since its inception.  Up until 1998, banks submitted quotes to the BBA LIBOR 

process in line with the question “At what rate do you think interbank term deposits will be offered by one 

prime bank to another prime bank for a reasonable market size today at 11 am?”  During 1998, this 

question changed and has, up until today, been as follows:  “At what rate could you borrow funds, were 

you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 

11 am?”  This decision was made after consultation with the markets and was implemented due to a view 

that a universal definition of a prime bank could no longer be given.  It also links the figures submitted by 

banks to their own market activity rather than a hypothetical entity.  For a reference to the usefulness of the 

adaptability of reference rates, see Board of IOSCO, Principles for Financial Benchmarks, p. 12, in note 2.
