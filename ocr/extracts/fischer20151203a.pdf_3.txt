want, as my colleague Daniel Tarullo emphasized a few weeks ago, “to pursue a policy 

of case-by-case assessment that permits healthy forms of nonbank intermediation while 

protecting the financial system.”2  Doing so will require further development of the 

economic models that we use to understand interconnections across our complex 

financial system, along with better data. 

The Current State of the Financial System 

Factors promoting greater structural resilience 

Returning to the current state of vulnerabilities, it is well known that a range of 

structural improvements mandated by the Congress and undertaken by the Federal 

Reserve and other regulatory agencies have strengthened financial stability over the past 

five years.  Important changes in regulation and supervision include (1) requirements for 

more and higher-quality capital and other loss-absorbing capacity at banks; (2) new 

requirements for liquidity buffers at banks; (3) more stringent capital and liquidity 

requirements at the largest, most systemically important firms; (4) stress-testing of the 

largest banks; (5) the shift of the clearing of some derivatives to central counterparties 

(CCPs); (6) new margin requirements for uncleared derivatives transactions; (7) the 

designation of systemically important nonbank financial institutions by the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council; and (8) enhanced sharing of information among regulators 

and monitoring of risks to financial stability, in which the OFR has played a leading 

role.3  This is an impressive list.4

banking activities that I will highlight. 
3 The OFR reports its monitoring efforts regularly, including in its annual reports (available on the OFR 
website at http://financialresearch.gov/annual-reports).  Research by OFR staff members on similar issues 
includes Flood and others (2015).
