shrinking at a time when the FOMC thought it was appropriate to cut the federal funds 

rate.   

After holding the size of the balance sheet roughly flat since mid-2014, once the 

normalization of the federal funds rate was deemed well under way in October 2017, the 

Committee started to allow the size of the balance sheet to shrink in line with the pledge 

to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and 

effectively.”16  We have made substantial progress, as demonstrated by the level of 

reserves.  Reserves are already down by 40 percent since their peak and are likely to be 

down by more than half this summer.  In my view, asset redemptions should come to an 

end later in the year, which would provide a sufficient buffer of reserves to meet demand 

and avoid volatility.  We have gathered information from market contacts and have 

surveyed banks to assess their demand for reserves.17  I would want to see a healthy 

cushion on top of that to avoid unnecessary volatility and ensure that the federal funds 

rate will be largely insulated from daily swings in factors affecting reserves. 

With regard to the composition of the balance sheet, I favor moving eventually to 

a portfolio of only Treasury securities--that is, without any agency mortgage-backed 

securities remaining.  It is important to do so in a way that continues to avoid market

17 The Senior Financial Officer Survey, which was undertaken in September 2018 and is being undertaken 
again, gathered views systematically from a number of banks concerning their reserve balance management 
strategies and practices.  The survey is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at
