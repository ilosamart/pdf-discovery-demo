example, corporate investment reacts only weakly to further changes in term premiums, 

there may be more “kick” to be had by focusing efforts on a sector that is more 

responsive. 

Moreover, it seems plausible that households’ spending behavior will in fact be 

more strongly affected by changes in the mortgage rate.  As compared with many of the 

large firms that are active in the corporate bond market, one might expect a greater 

proportion of households to behave as if they are financially constrained.  Hence, a 

reduction in the cost of mortgage borrowing might be expected to allow households to 

spend more, either on a new home or by using the proceeds from a mortgage refinancing 

for non-housing consumption.   

The bottom line is that I suspect that mortgage purchases may confer more 

macroeconomic stimulus dollar-for-dollar than Treasury purchases.  This is of course, not 

to say that Treasury purchases have no effect on the real economy; research has found 

that in addition to moving bond prices, they are associated with increases in stock prices, 

which in turn can have wealth effects on consumption and investment.   

Interestingly, however, to the extent that Treasury purchases trigger a financing 

response on the part of firms, as opposed to an investment response, they may have 

something of an unintended benefit for financial stability.  A major source of problems 

during the recent crisis was the excessive maturity transformation undertaken by financial 

firms.  Put simply, these firms were relying too much on short-term debt.  One of the 

thrusts of regulatory reform has been to attack this problem--for example, via the 

constructs of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio that are a 

part of Basel III.  However, a complementary way to deal with the problem is to
