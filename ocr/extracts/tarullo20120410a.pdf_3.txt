Tools for Dynamic Capital Supervision 

 The potential utility of comprehensive stress testing had been much discussed among 

academics, analysts, and regulators in the years preceding the financial crisis, but it was only 

during the crisis that this tool was used across large firms at the same time.  In February 2009, 

the federal banking agencies -- led by the Federal Reserve -- created a stress test and required the 

nation’s 19 largest bank holding companies to apply it as part of our Supervisory Capital 

Assessment Program (SCAP).  The test involved two scenarios -- one based on the consensus 

forecast of professional forecasters, and the other based on a severe, but plausible, economic 

situation -- with specified macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment, and 

house prices.  Each participating institution was asked to supply, in a standardized format, 

detailed information on portfolio risk factors and revenue drivers that supervisors could use to 

estimate losses and revenues over a two-year period.  These data allowed supervisors to make 

consistent estimates across all 19 firms.  

 The immediate motivation for the 2009 stress test was to determine how much additional 

capital a bank holding company would need to ensure that it would remain a viable financial 

intermediary even in the adverse scenario.  The Treasury Department stood ready to provide 

capital to any bank that could not raise the required amount from private sources.  But the 

Federal Reserve’s decision to disclose the results of the test on a firm-specific basis served a 

second purpose -- to provide investors, and markets more generally, with information that would 

help them form their own judgments on the condition of U.S. banking institutions.  This decision 

proved to be an important step in establishing market and public confidence that the U.S. 

financial system would weather the crisis.
