consider the overall state of the U.S. economy as well as the influence of foreign 

economies on the U.S. economy as we reach our judgment on whether and how to change 

monetary policy.  That is why we follow economic developments in the rest of the world 

as well as the United States in reaching our interest rate decisions.  At this moment, we

the stance of monetary policy.  For the purpose of meeting our goals, the entire path of

not wait until inflation is back to 2 percent to begin tightening.  Should we judge at some 

point in time that the economy is threatening to overheat, we will have to move 

appropriately rapidly to deal with that threat.  The same is true should the economy 

unexpectedly weaken. 

Finally, while I have been talking today about some international influences on 

economic conditions in the United States, I am well aware that, when the Federal Reserve
