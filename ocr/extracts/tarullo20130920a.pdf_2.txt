Real world crises have a way of shaking up the intellectual foundations of policy 

disciplines.  Elements of received wisdom are undermined, while certain heterodox or 

less mainstream views are seen as more valid or important than had been widely 

recognized.  The financial crisis of 2007–2009 was no exception.  Some ideas, such as 

the efficient markets hypothesis, have taken some hits, as others have risen to 

prominence.  An example of the latter is the view that financial stability must be an 

explicit economic policy goal.  A corollary of this view is that a “macroprudential” 

perspective—generally characterized as focused on the financial system as a whole as 

opposed to the well-being of individual firms—should be added to traditional prudential 

regulation. 

A single speech cannot hope to touch on, much less do justice to, the many 

theoretical and policy issues encompassed by the term macroprudential.  In my remarks 

this afternoon I will focus principally on the project of recasting the regulation and 

supervision of large financial firms so as to realize the macroprudential objective of 

reducing systemic risk.  Specifically, I will offer five propositions that I think should 

guide this project over the next couple of years.  In so doing, I will explain some of the 

key steps that have already been taken and identify some priorities that remain, though 

even here I do not pretend to comprehensiveness.  Before addressing the macroprudential 

dimension of regulating large financial firms, however, let me provide some context by 

briefly reviewing the evolving idea of macroprudential policy.

Although the crisis and its aftermath have created a broader consensus for the 

proposition that financial stability should be a more explicit objective of economic
