appear to have made some progress in deleveraging, but many still face elevated debt 

burdens and reduced access to credit.  Moreover, consumer sentiment dropped markedly 

over the summer and has remained low since then, reflecting households’ concerns about 

the broader economy as well as their own financial situations.  

Weak consumer spending, unsurprisingly, increases concerns among businesses 

about the prospects for sustained growth in the demand for their products and services.  

As a consequence, many businesses have been reluctant to significantly expand their 

payrolls.  Indeed, the average pace of hiring during the past several months has been 

quite a bit slower than earlier in the year.  As a result, the unemployment rate has 

continued to hover in the vicinity of 9 percent since early this year.  Furthermore, recent 

surveys have shown some deterioration in firms’ hiring plans, and new claims for 

unemployment insurance by workers who have been laid off remain relatively high.  

Such indicators are consistent with job gains remaining tepid in the coming months. 

A sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the recent recession, and this 

sector continues to weigh on the recovery.  Robust increases in housing activity have 

helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions in the past 50 years.  This time, in 

contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed 

and distressed properties, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, 

concerns about further declines in home prices, and the substantial number of 

homeowners whose mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes.  As a result, 

new home construction currently is at only about one-third of its average pace in recent 

decades.
