The longer-run federal funds rate estimated by FOMC participants in their 

Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) meets the definition of a longer-run 

equilibrium rate of interest.5  It is worth highlighting that the longer-run federal funds 

rate is the only neutral interest rate reported in the FOMC projections.  But the shorter-

run neutral rate, rather than the longer-run federal funds rate, is the relevant benchmark 

for assessing the near-term path of monetary policy in the presence of headwinds or 

tailwinds.   

Estimating the Neutral Rate of Interest 

Similar to other equilibrium macroeconomic concepts such as potential gross 

domestic product (GDP) and the natural rate of unemployment, the shorter- and longer-

run levels of the neutral rate are not directly observable, so they must be estimated or 

inferred from the movements of variables that are observed, such as market interest rates, 

inflation, the unemployment rate, and GDP.6  In recent years, considerable work has 

derived estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate, in some cases using statistical 

techniques that can be thought of as capturing the highly persistent component of the 

neutral rate.  The central tendency of those estimates suggests that the longer-run trend 

rate is in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in nominal terms.7  This range lines up well with 

the most recent median estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate in the FOMC SEP, 

                                                   
5 As defined in the FOMC SEP, “Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate 
to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the 
absence of further shocks to the economy.”  See the most recent SEP, an addendum to the minutes of the
