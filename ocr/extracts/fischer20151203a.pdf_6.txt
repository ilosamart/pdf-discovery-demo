finance investments in securities like commercial mortgage-backed securities or 

corporate bonds.  In recent years, the SCOOS has suggested relatively stable use of 

leverage across hedge funds and other counterparties--but this qualitative assessment 

provides only a high level, and very partial, view.7 

An important risk factor during the mid-2000s was the growth in securitization 

and the creation of so-called high quality collateral.  Currently, the volume of 

securitization is far below mid-2000s levels, with much of the decline reflecting the 

collapse in private residential mortgage-backed securities.  Further, the low level of 

activity probably understates the improvement in risk, as pre-crisis securitization was 

highly reliant on short-term wholesale funding through vehicles such as asset-backed 

commercial paper programs to finance the highest-rated tranches. 

More generally, wholesale short-term liabilities have declined across the board.  

For example, the gross volume of repos (repurchase agreements) fell from its peak of 

nearly $5 trillion in early 2008 to about $3 trillion by early 2009, while total assets of 

money market mutual funds contracted from approximately $3.75 trillion at the end of 

2008 to about $2.5 trillion in recent years.8  The decline in the volume of repos is part of 

a more general pullback from risk among broker-dealers and their clients, and dealer 

balance sheets are much smaller, on balance, than pre-crisis. 

Some, perhaps even the lion’s share, of the retreat in securitization, money market 

mutual fund shares, and repos is probably due to investors’ memory of the financial 

crisis.  Institutions and individuals burned by runs and losses from fire sale conditions
