exigent circumstances as long as at least five governors--all we currently have on the 

Board--approve.  The circumstances were certainly unusual and exigent, and for the most 

part, the authority was used to target critical markets that performed the same function as 

bank lending but were outside the banking system.  Initially, 13(3) was used to establish
