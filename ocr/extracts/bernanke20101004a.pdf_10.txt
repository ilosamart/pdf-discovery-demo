spending, which is spending that continues automatically without an annual 

reauthorization; entitlement spending such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security 

makes up most of this category.  The PAYGO rule required that any tax reduction or 

mandatory spending increase be “paid for” with offsetting tax hikes or spending cuts, so 

that projected deficits over the 5- and 10-year horizons would not be worsened.  

Supported importantly by the strong economic growth of the 1990s, these rules are seen 

by many observers as having helped put the deficit on a declining path; indeed, the 

federal government generated a few annual surpluses.  The discretionary spending caps 

and the PAYGO rule were allowed to expire after the 2001 fiscal year, in part because 

concerns about deficits were waning at the time. 

Currently, the Congress operates under more-limited PAYGO rules.  The rules 

require that offsets for spending increases or tax cuts must be found within a 10-year 

budget horizon, but they also exempt a number of significant tax and spending programs.  

Putting aside these details of implementation, given current budgetary challenges, the key 

question is whether the traditional PAYGO approach is sufficiently ambitious.  At its 

best, PAYGO prevents new tax cuts and mandatory spending increases from making 

projected budget deficits worse; by construction, PAYGO does not require the Congress 

to reduce the ever-increasing deficits that are already built into current law. 

 Many other countries have experience with fiscal rules.  The European Union, by 

treaty, established fiscal rules in the early 1990s, with the goal of ensuring that all 

members would maintain sustainable fiscal policies.  The rules specified that countries 

should keep their government deficits at or below 3 percent of their gross domestic 

products (GDP), and that government debt should not exceed 60 percent of GDP.  Even
