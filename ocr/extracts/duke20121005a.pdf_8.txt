efficient. Doubtless there will be costs associated with solving these problems, but it is important 

to also consider the costs of doing nothing.  For example, it costs local taxpayers to let vacant 

buildings decline, it costs money to tear them down, and it costs money to convert them to a 

better use. Ultimately, a policy of neglect will be just as--or even more--costly than finding and 

implementing constructive solutions to the vacancy issue.  We must ask ourselves, can we create 

policies that fairly distribute those costs?  What are the limitations?  What innovations can create 

more effective, scalable solutions?  With funding scarce, how can we identify solutions that will 

ultimately be most cost effective?  

To begin to answer some of these questions, I return to the typology of vacant properties 

introduced earlier.   

“Housing Boom” Locations 

The first type, “housing boom” areas, has relatively high median incomes and new 

housing stock.  These characteristics are attractive to investors, and many investors are 

reportedly purchasing vacant homes and converting them to rental.  Given the recent tightening 

of the rental market, such a strategy could be a win-win scenario for communities that need more 

affordable rental homes and suffer from an excess of single-family vacant units.  In fact, in 

January, the Federal Reserve released a staff paper on housing issues12 that went into some detail 

about the potential benefits of converting foreclosed properties to rental, and in April, the Board 

released a policy statement that outlines supervisory expectations for residential rental activities 

for certain banking organizations.13
