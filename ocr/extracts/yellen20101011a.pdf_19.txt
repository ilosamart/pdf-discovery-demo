Monetary Fund, and other institutions.13  

Finally, we must not forget that macroprudential policies will entail some costs as 

well as benefits.  The magnitude of these costs remains a subject of debate.  But, as with 

all forms of regulation, we must find the right balance between overly strict supervision 

and laissez faire.  I don’t know exactly where on the continuum that balance lies.  But I 

do know that, before the crisis, we had veered disastrously too far in the direction of 

laissez faire, with consequences we know too well. 

Interaction with Monetary Policy 

One of the most challenging issues relating to systemic risk management is the 

appropriate interactions between macroprudential and monetary policy.  To what extent, 

if at all, should monetary policy be used to mitigate systemic risk?  And to what extent, if 

at all, should monetary policy be coordinated with macroprudential supervision?  These 

issues are the subject of intense debate among policymakers across the globe.  Of course, 

the question of whether monetary policy should lean against asset price bubbles is hardly 

new.14  What has changed is the sense of urgency surrounding this and related questions.
