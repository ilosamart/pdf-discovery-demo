Qualitative Evidence at a More Micro Level 

As I previewed at the beginning of my remarks, data and averages often do not 

tell the whole story.  At the end of the day, we care about bank branch locations because 

we care about the people and communities that they are serving or, in some cases, not 

serving adequately.  So even if the data tell us that most rural markets are well served, we 

need to focus our attention on those markets that may not be as well served and how that 

is affecting the people who bank, or cannot bank, there.  That is why the Federal Reserve 

Systemâ€™s Community Development function has undertaken a national series of listening 

sessions to assess the real effects of bank closures on rural communities.  Reserve Bank 

staff members are conducting the sessions around the country to gather information from 

consumers and small business owners in rural communities that have been directly 

affected by bank closures.   

To identify where to conduct these sessions, we used data to identify rural towns 

that have experienced bank branch closures; in some cases, these towns lost the only 

bank in town and now have no remaining banks.  Then we convened local residents and 

small business owners to ask them about what the loss of a bank meant to them and their 

community. 

For some residents, the closure has not been much of a problem.  Most, if not all, 

of the listening session participants in Clark, South Dakota, noted that they do most of 

their routine banking online.  Some in Clark even noted that they did not think ATMs 

(automated teller machines) were necessary, as most of the retail businesses in town offer 

cash back with debit card purchases.  Nonetheless, residents of Clark spoke positively 

about the importance of the personal touch a local bank can provide.  Residents liked
