A particularly important consideration regarding spillovers from accommodative 

monetary policies in the advanced economies is the extent to which such policies 

contribute to financial stability risks in the EMEs.  Because many EMEs have financial 

sectors that are relatively small, large capital inflows may foster asset price bubbles and a 

too-rapid expansion of credit.  These are serious concerns, irrespective of the relative 

importance of monetary policies in the advanced economies in driving these flows.  

While the picture is a mixed one and some markets show signs of froth, indicators of 

financial stability do not seem to show widespread imbalances.12   

For example, EME equity prices, shown in chart 5, plunged during the global 

financial crisis, rebounded thereafter, but then generally flattened out or even declined.  

There are exceptions, of course, such as Indonesia, whose stock market soared until 

earlier this year.  But in aggregate, EME stock prices remain below their pre-crisis peak, 

whereas the S&P 500 is well above its own pre-crisis peak.   

Chart 6 portrays the rise in credit to the domestic nonfinancial private sector as a 

share of GDP from its pre-crisis level.  For some EMEs, the rise in credit does not seem 

out of line with historical trends, but some economies have experienced potentially 

worrisome increases.  Credit growth in China is particularly noteworthy, but this does not 

seem to be the result of accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies.  

Much of the rise took place in the aftermath of the crisis, in large part reflecting policy-

driven stimulus to support economic recovery.  In addition, Chinaâ€™s relatively closed 

capital account limits the extent to which domestic credit conditions are influenced by 

developments abroad, including changes in advanced economy monetary policy.  

Increases in credit in some other economies, notably Brazil, have also been driven to a
