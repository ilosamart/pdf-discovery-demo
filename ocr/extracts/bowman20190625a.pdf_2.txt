 Thank you, Makada.  Good morning and let me also welcome everyone to the 

Seidman Center.  I am very pleased to join you today for this discussion, which 

highlights the important role that minority depository institutions (MDIs) and Community 

Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) play in their communities.  It is your 

presence in these communities and the services you offer that support local businesses, 

jobs, and economic growth.   

 I know this because before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community 

banker in a small rural town and more recently served as Kansas’ State Bank 

Commissioner.  I understand what it means to try to meet the financial needs of a 

community, whose needs are varied and can present unique challenges to a credit 

underwriter.  I remember working with a customer on a mortgage loan for less than 

$20,000 with a first-time homebuyer’s credit to purchase a mobile home.  It was one of 

the most complicated and time consuming loans that I made during my time as a banker.  

Some larger banks might not be able or even be interested in putting that together, but 

community bankers know how important this kind of service is to their lower-income 

customers.  I’m proud to bring that perspective to the Federal Reserve Board as the first 

governor to fill the role designated for someone with community banking experience.  

 One way to fulfill my responsibilities is by meeting with and listening closely to 

minority and community bankers, consumers, small business owners, and local leaders—
