A second important determinant is the type of educational program, as there is 

wide variation in rates of return across different programs.  For example, recent research 

has shown that for-profit colleges, on average, tend to provide a lower rate of return for 

educational investment than public or not-for-profit colleges and universities.  Young 

adults who attended for-profit colleges are also more likely to default on their student 

loans, even after completing four or more years of education.16  Unfortunately, the 

students who are the first in their family to attend college are more likely than others to 

attend for-profit colleges.17     

Despite the apparent lower likely average return to education at for-profit schools, 

attendance at these schools has increased faster since the financial crisis than at other 

institutions.  Attendance at for-profit schools increased over 50 percent between 2007 and 

2012--far outpacing the 10 percent growth in enrollments seen over this period at not-for-

profit and public institutions.  This rapid growth, and the fact that for-profit colleges 

disproportionately attract first-generation college students as well as students relying on 

debt to fund their education, bears careful scrutiny.18 

Overall, the added educational investments made by the Great Recession 

generation could be a positive legacy of the crisis over the long term.  But for some, the 

returns may not turn out to be worth the cost.  For this group, the burden associated with
