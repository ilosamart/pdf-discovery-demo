A prominent risk at present--and a major source of financial headwinds over the 

past couple of years--is the fiscal and financial situation in Europe.  This situation, of 

course, was not anticipated when the U.S. recovery began in 2009.  The elevated levels of

the adverse effects of tight budget conditions for state and local governments.  In
