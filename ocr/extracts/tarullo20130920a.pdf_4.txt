macroprudential policies and also complicates the task of testing financial stability 

theories and proposed policies.   

Yet even against the backdrop of what is still a comparatively underdeveloped 

understanding of financial stability,
3
 commentators and policymakers have compiled and, 

in some cases, developed so-called “toolkits” of possible macroprudential measures.  

These measures are thought available for use against one or both of two frequently 

identified dimensions of systemic risk: procyclicality and interconnectedness.

  Of 

course, the attractiveness of many of these tools will depend on one’s views of a variety 

of theoretical, institutional, and practical questions. 

The tools identified can be variously categorized.  One useful distinction is 

between measures designed to prevent systemic risk from building (often termed “lean-

against-the-wind” measures) and those designed to increase the resiliency of the financial 

system should systemic risk nonetheless build sufficiently that broad-based stress ensues.  

Another distinction is between time-varying and time-invariant measures, with the former 

based on a response—either discretionary or in accordance with a rule—to some 

measured increase in risk.

 There is actually quite a rich history of policy measures in the United States that we would today call 

“macroprudential.” See Douglas J. Elliott, Greg Feldberg, and Andreas Lehnert (2013), “The History of 

Cyclical Macroprudential Policy in the United States,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-29 

(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May), 

www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201329/201329pap.pdf.   It is notable that the enactment and use 

of a number of tools waned as the integration of capital markets with traditional lending functions 

accelerated in the last quarter of the 20
th

 century, though even if there is a causal relationship between these 

two phenomenon, it is not clear which way the causality runs (perhaps in both directions).

 The terminology may differ among commentators.  For example, “cross-sectional” is sometimes used in 

place of interconnectedness, a term that may have some appeal to the extent it moves away from the 

traditional domino image of one failing firm knocking down another, and also embraces dynamics such as 

contagion across the financial system arising from correlated asset holdings and sources of funding.
