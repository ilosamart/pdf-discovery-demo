Extent to Which Consumers Use the Available 
Mechanisms to Avoid Receiving Written Offers 

The second issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is “the 
extent to which consumers are currently utilizing existing statutory and voluntary 
mechanisms to avoid receiving offers of credit or insurance.” 

Little information has been available regarding the frequency at which consumers opt out 
of receiving prescreened solicitations for credit and insurance products using provisions 
in section 604 of the FCRA. Likewise, little information has been available about the 
credit or other characteristics of consumers who have placed their names on the opt-out 
list. To learn more about consumers’ use of consumer credit generally as well as their 
use of the opt-out provision provided by the FCRA, the Board engaged one of the three 
national CRAs to supply the credit records of a large, nationally representative sample of 
individuals as of June 30, 2003. The credit record data include all information found in 
the credit files of the approximately 300,000 individuals in the sample except that they 
exclude all identifying information about the individuals and the creditors. 

The sample data do not contain any addresses of individuals but do include the state, 
county, and census tract location of their residence. This information allows comparisons 
with the 2000 decennial census information on census tract population characteristics 
(such as income and geographic distribution, including urban, suburban, and rural 
delineations) and other regional and state classifications. 

Each credit record in the Board sample contains as many as 350 distinct items describing 
the consumer’s past and ongoing experiences with credit, collection-agency actions, and 
various types of so-called “public records,” which consist of bankruptcies, foreclosures, 
tax liens (local, state, or federal), garnishments, and other civil judgments. Many 
thousands of creditors and other entities reported information contained in the credit 
records, including more than 92,000 reporters overall and 23,600 currently providing 
credit-related data at the time of the sample.13 In the aggregate, the sample contains 
information on about 3.7 million credit accounts, more than 318,000 collection-related 
actions, approximately 65,000 public record actions, and about 913,000 creditor 
inquiries. The credit record of each individual did not necessarily contain each kind of 
information (table 2). 

The sample data also contains credit scores for about 250,000 individuals (about 83 
percent of the sample), each constructed using the CRA’s proprietary credit-risk-scoring 

13 The latter figure is the number of reporters providing information to the CRA within three months of 
the time the sample was drawn.
