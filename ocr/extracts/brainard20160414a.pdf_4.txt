equities markets.  Following the recent financial crisis, the United States--along with 

many other countries--expanded the scope of central clearing to help address problems in 

the bilateral clearing of derivatives contracts.   

Today, the possible development and application of distributed ledger technology 

has raised questions about potentially far reaching changes to multilateral clearinghouses 

and the roles of financial institutions as intermediaries in trading, clearing, and settlement 

for their clients.  In the extreme, distributed ledger technologies are seen as enabling a 

much larger universe of  financial actors to transact directly with other financial actors 

and to exchange assets versus funds (that is, to “clear” and settle the underlying 

transactions) virtually instantaneously without the help of intermediaries both within and 

across borders.  This dramatic reduction in frictions would be facilitated by distributed 

ledgers shared across various networks of financial actors that would keep a complete 

and accurate record of all transactions, and meet appropriate goals for transparency, 

privacy, and security.   

At this stage, such a sea-change may sound like a remote possibility, particularly 

for the high volume and highly regulated clearing and settlement functions of the 

wholesale financial markets.  But profound disruptions are not unprecedented in this 

arena.  In the early 1960s, the use of computerized book-entry securities systems to 

streamline custody, clearing, and settlement in the securities markets may have seemed 

like a technologist’s pipe dream.  But these technologies became an important part of 

industry-wide changes in the 1970s.  Today we rely on these types of systems for the 

daily operation of the markets.
