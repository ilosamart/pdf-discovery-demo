too much into these introductory points, let me also note that an emphasis on a firm’s liabilities is 

related to, but not synonymous with, an emphasis on its activities.  Thus, for example, simply 

deciding that an intermediary provides mostly commercial banking services or insurance 

products does not fully answer the question of what its capital requirements should be. 

My purpose today is not to offer specific proposals, or even a comprehensive conceptual 

framework, but instead to propose an approach for thinking about the purposes of capital 

regulation across types of financial intermediaries that will suggest appropriate starting points for 

shaping--or reshaping--applicable capital regulation.  This seems to me a particularly important 

effort at a time when the financial system is undergoing significant change. 

Liability Structure and Capital Regulation 

 To begin, we should remind ourselves that capital regulation of private corporations is 

unusual.  Generally, market actors with actual or contemplated claims on a nonfinancial 

corporation are left to their own devices in protecting their interests, though various features of 

contract, securities, and insolvency law are designed to help them make these judgments more 

efficiently.  In many kinds of financial intermediaries, on the other hand, capital levels are 

regulated, usually because of market failures attributable to some combination of information 

problems, moral hazard, collective action problems, and systemic risk.  Scrutiny of the liability 

side of the balance sheet reveals whether and how these various justifications are present for 

different financial intermediaries.  Let me start with a couple of straightforward examples, well-

established in regulatory practice. 

 The first example arises from the fact that, by the very nature of their business, many 

intermediaries have substantially more customer-facing liabilities1 on their balance sheets than 

                                                 
1 By “customer facing liabilities,” I mean liabilities to households, retail investors, and businesses.  In financial 
intermediaries, these liabilities are not only greater than in similarly sized balance sheets of non-financial firms.
