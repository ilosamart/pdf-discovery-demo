environment to stronger, longer-term growth in both emerging and advanced economies.6  

In particular, many emerging market economies in the 1990s emulated the success of the 

advanced economies in the 1980s in controlling inflation.  Over the years, the emerging 

market economies have also improved their fiscal management to the point that their 

fiscal positions are now often more favorable than those of some advanced economies.  

Improvements in macroeconomic management have been particularly striking in Latin 

America, where large budget deficits and high inflation rates had produced costly swings 

in economic activity in previous decades.  Brazil, for example, suffered hyperinflation 

from 1986 to 1994, with several years of inflation well in excess of 500 percent, but has 

maintained an average annual inflation rate of about 5 percent since 2006, while (not 

coincidentally) reducing the ratio of its budget deficit to its gross domestic product.  

Disciplined macroeconomic policies have also supported growth in emerging markets by 

fostering domestic savings, stimulating capital investment (including foreign direct 

investment), and reducing the risk of financial instability. 

The second group of recommendations listed by Williamson emphasized the need 

for greater reliance on markets:  the freeing up of the economy through privatization, 

deregulation, and liberalization.  The basic idea here has held up pretty well; most 

observers today would agree that carefully managed liberalization--the substitution of 

markets for bureaucratic control of the economy--is necessary for sustained growth.  For 

example, trade liberalization measures, such as the reduction of tariffs and the removal of 

                                                            
6 Fischer (1993) and Easterly (2001) document that poor growth is associated with high inflation, large 
budget deficits, and distorted foreign exchange markets.  Durlauf, Kourtellos, and Tan (2008), emphasizing 
techniques that take into account model uncertainty, also find considerable support for the importance of 
stable macroeconomic policies.  Fatas and Mihov (2009) establish that stability of policy is a relevant and 
robust determinant of cross-country differences in growth.  Easterly and Levine (1997) link much of the 
plight of Africa to macroeconomic instability.
