discuss Treasury market structure.  In fact, that is one of the recommendations in the October 15 

report released last month.  The conference will take place this fall at the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, the Board of Governors, the Securities 

and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  My hope and 

expectation is that it will bring market participants and regulators closer to an understanding of 

whether there are changes in trading and risk management practices, regulation and market 

structure that could make our Treasury markets even more liquid and more resilient.
