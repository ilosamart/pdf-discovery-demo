year in conjunction with the FOMC minutes.  The SEP provides summary statistics and 

an accompanying narrative regarding the projections of FOMC participants--that is, the 

Board members and the Reserve Bank presidents--for the growth rate of real gross 

domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate, core inflation, and headline inflation 

over the next several calendar years.  Since early 2009, the SEP has also included 

information about FOMC participants’ longer-run projections for the rates of economic 

growth, unemployment, and inflation to which the economy is expected to converge over 

time, in the absence of further shocks and under appropriate monetary policy.  Because 

appropriate monetary policy, by definition, is aimed at achieving the Federal Reserve’s 

objectives in the longer run, FOMC participants’ longer-run projections for economic 

growth, unemployment, and inflation may be interpreted, respectively, as estimates of the 

economy’s longer-run potential growth rate, the longer-run sustainable rate of 

unemployment, and the mandate-consistent rate of inflation.   

The most recent release of the SEP was in June, and I will refer to those 

projections here, noting that new projections will be released with the minutes of the next 

FOMC meeting, in early November.   

The longer-run inflation projections in the SEP indicate that FOMC participants 

generally judge the mandate-consistent inflation rate to be about 2 percent or a bit below.  

In contrast, as I noted earlier, recent readings on underlying inflation have been 

approximately 1 percent.  Thus, in effect, inflation is running at rates that are too low 

relative to the levels that the Committee judges to be most consistent with the Federal 

Reserve’s dual mandate in the longer run.  In particular, at current rates of inflation, the 

constraint imposed by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is too tight (the
