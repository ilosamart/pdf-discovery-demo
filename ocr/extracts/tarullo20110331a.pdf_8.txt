very dry tinder of financial markets.  At some point of sufficiently high stress, the conceptual 

distinctions among the first three kinds of effects may in practical terms elide, since even a 

smaller firm could be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.  For purposes of 

designating firms under section 113, it makes little sense to hypothesize all such crisis moments, 

since under this reasoning virtually all firms pose systemic risk.  But it may be appropriate to 

assume a moderate amount of stress in financial markets when considering the first and second 

kinds of effects that would follow a firm’s failure. 

One additional issue bears mention here.  During the legislative debate, a question was 

raised as to whether identification of institutions as systemically important would itself 

exacerbate moral hazard.  The worry was that markets would regard such identification as 

confirmation that the government did indeed regard a firm as too-big-to-fail.  Part of the rationale 

for setting the statutory standard of $50 billion in assets for bank-affiliated firms was that the 

failure of some of these firms, while likely to cause some noticeable disruptions in financial 

relationships, would not be regarded as necessarily endangering the financial system.  Any link 

between the list of firms and TBTF is thereby attenuated.  There is a reasonable concern that 

designating a small number of nonbank-affiliated firms would increase moral hazard concern.   

There is no complete answer to this concern, but the possible alternative approaches 

would likely be more problematic.  Doing nothing would mean allowing the presence and 

growth in markets of large unregulated firms, creating the potential for large negative effects on 

the financial system should they follow the path trodden by some such firms in the years 

preceding the crisis.  On the other hand, as already suggested, treating financial firms of all sorts 

as banks could be both ineffective and inefficient.  The Dodd-Frank Act does provide discretion 

to the Federal Reserve to apply other, “similarly stringent” capital requirements where bank
