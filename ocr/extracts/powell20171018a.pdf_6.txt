patterns and help prevent fraudulent transactions.  Both security and convenience are 

crucial elements for successful payments innovation.  Consumers will not store their 

funds in a system that is not secure and will not want to transfer funds out of an otherwise 

secure system if the process is cumbersome.  

The Role of Banks in Payments Innovation 

The examples I have highlighted so far illustrate payments innovations from 

fintech firms and banks alike.  I want to spend a moment highlighting the special role of 

banks in the payments process, and how banks are needed in order to create innovations 

that can be used broadly across the economy.  

The traditional role of banks in the payments process has been to hold deposits 

and enable their transfer from one individual or business to another.  A depositor might 

withdraw cash from the bank’s ATM to pay a friend or write a check to make a payment.  

Over time, we have moved from ATMs and paper checks toward electronic payments and 

online payments through banking platforms—payment methods for which banks are still 

perceived as essential.  More recently, consumer-facing technology has become front and 

center.  At times, the payments process is so seamlessly integrated that one can forget 

that there is even a bank in the process, as with the Uber and Lyft example.  But despite 

this shift in focus, payments innovation is still fundamentally about how, when, and 

where an individual’s deposits can be held, transferred, and packaged with other 

information.  And banks are still important players in making that happen.  Even where 

this reality is obscured by several layers of technology, there is almost always a bank 

involved in consumer transactions.
