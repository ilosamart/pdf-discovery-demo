important that any future policy decisions we may consider in 2019 be consistent with 

both pillars of our dual mandate. 

I will also be monitoring closely the incoming data on labor supply and 

productivity.3  Not only has aggregate demand growth been robust, but so, too, has been 

the growth in realized aggregate supply.  Over the first three quarters of 2018, hours 

worked in the nonfarm business sector were up 2.0 percent (at an annual rate), and 

productivity was up 1.8 percent.  Realized productivity growth over the past eight 

quarters has averaged 1.3 percent, which is up from the 0.7 percent average recorded 

between 2011 and 2016.  Strong growth supported by supply-side gains in hours worked 

and productivity is not inflationary, as the experience of 2018 confirms.  With labor 

supply and productivity growth in 2018 having surprised on the upside, some mean 

reversion in 2019 is not unreasonable to forecast.  But right now, that is just a forecast, 

and if the positive developments on the supply side of the economy continue in 2019, 

they would need to be factored into the inflation outlook and thus the appropriate settings 

for monetary policy.   

As I have indicated previously, I believe we may have seen the bottom on the 

productivity slowdown, but how much of the recent welcome uptick in productivity 

growth can be sustained or extended is hard to judge at this point.  It will depend in part 

on how much business investment spending adds to the stock of capital in the economy.  

We saw a welcome pickup in investment in the first half of last year, but growth of 

                                                 
3 For an analysis of the effect of a positive boost to productivity in the FRB/US model, see Jean-Philippe 
Laforte (2018), “Overview of the Changes to the FRB/US Model (2018),” FEDS Notes (Washington:  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 7), fig. 4, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/overview-of-the-changes-to-the-frb-us-model-
2018-20181207.htm.  In the model, higher productivity lowers inflation, which calls for a flatter path for 
policy normalization than would otherwise be the case.
