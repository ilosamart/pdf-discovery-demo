attorneys general will prove to be a vehicle for resolving the underlying problems.  The 

coordination and expertise at the state level in these matters is an essential corrective.  To 

the extent that legal settlements are structured in such a way as to generate a broader 

underlying reform of servicing processes, it will be more likely that we can assure 

consumers that they will not encounter other mortgage harms moving forward.   

 The complex challenges faced by the loan servicing industry right now are 

emblematic of the problems that emerge in any industry when incentives are 

fundamentally misaligned, and when the race for short-term profit overwhelms 

sustainable, long-term goals and practices.  Responsible parties within the industry are no 

doubt already scrambling to fix some of the problems that have surfaced.  However, 

because so much is riding on getting these systems right, and because consumers have 

such little measure of individual choice or recourse, reliance on pledges from market 

participants will not be enough.  Many of you have been doing your part for years to 

point out problems in the industry and to give consumers some protection and redress 

when wronged.  The public sector too is stepping up its efforts to monitor firmsâ€™ actions 

and systems.  Until a better business model is developed that eliminates the business 

incentives that can potentially harm consumers, there will be a need for close regulatory 

scrutiny of these issues and for appropriate enforcement action that addresses them.  

 Thank you.
