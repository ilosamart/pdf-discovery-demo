mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve recently adjusted its program for reinvesting its 

securities holdings.   

The Federal Reserve continues to provide highly accommodative monetary 

conditions to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.   

Moreover, the scope remains to provide additional accommodation through enhanced 

guidance on the path of the federal funds rate or through additional purchases of longer-

term financial assets.   

Challenges for U.S. Fiscal Policy 

Turning now to U.S. fiscal policy, with the onset of the recent recession and 

financial crisis, the federal budget deficit widened significantly and has remained wide.  

Exhibit 2 shows that, as a result, federal debt held by the public has increased relative to 

our national income to a level not seen in the past half-century.  These budget 

developments have reflected both the weak economy, which has depressed revenues and 

pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the 

recession and support the recovery.  So long as the economy continues to recover, the 

deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues 

and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus 

continue to wind down.  Even so, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) will 

continue to edge higher over the next decade unless the Congress and the Administration 

are able to agree on a program of deficit reduction that is more ambitious than the targets 

incorporated in last summerâ€™s Budget Control Act.  Looking yet further out, it is apparent 

that, absent significant policy shifts, budget pressures resulting from the aging of the U.S. 

population and fast-rising health-care costs will continue to push the federal debt ratio
