The FOMC has also acted to improve market functioning and to push longer-term 

interest rates lower through its large-scale purchases of agency debt, agency mortgage-

backed securities (MBS), and longer-term Treasury securities, of which the Federal 

Reserve currently holds more than $2 trillion.  The channels through which the Fed’s 

purchases affect longer-term interest rates and financial conditions more generally have 

been subject to debate.  I see the evidence as most favorable to the view that such 

purchases work primarily through the so-called portfolio balance channel, which holds 

that once short-term interest rates have reached zero, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of 

longer-term securities affect financial conditions by changing the quantity and mix of 

financial assets held by the public.  Specifically, the Fed’s strategy relies on the 

presumption that different financial assets are not perfect substitutes in investors’ 

portfolios, so that changes in the net supply of an asset available to investors affect its 

yield and those of broadly similar assets.  Thus, our purchases of Treasury, agency debt, 

and agency MBS likely both reduced the yields on those securities and also pushed 

investors into holding other assets with similar characteristics, such as credit risk and 

duration.  For example, some investors who sold MBS to the Fed may have replaced 

them in their portfolios with longer-term, high-quality corporate bonds, depressing the 

yields on those assets as well.   

The logic of the portfolio balance channel implies that the degree of 

accommodation delivered by the Federal Reserve’s securities purchase program is 

determined primarily by the quantity and mix of securities the central bank holds or is 

anticipated to hold at a point in time (the “stock view”), rather than by the current pace of 

new purchases (the “flow view”).  In support of the stock view, the cessation of the
