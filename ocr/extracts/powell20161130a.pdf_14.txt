office to speak to outside groups.  We appear to enjoy talking to print journalists, and 

some of us like going on television.  With the proliferation of media of all kinds, there is 

a need for content, and we have been willing suppliers.  In my view, these public 

appearances are mostly not about gaining leverage in a negotiation.  There is a single 

FOMC participant who has most of the leverage in our policy discussions.  Observers 

would be well advised to listen carefully to what she says. 

I strongly agree with Jon that it is wise not to read too much about the path of 

policy into all of this communication.  FOMC participants other than the Chair speak 

only for themselves and customarily make that clear at the beginning of their remarks. 

Their commentary is not intended to express the consensus or to predict its evolution. 

As Jon notes, during the Greenspan era, there was very little discussion of the 

likely path for the policy rate by FOMC participants, including the Chairman.  The 

proliferation of forward policy guidance during the crisis utterly broke that equilibrium.  

Many of us seem to be trained to a new habit, which is to offer oneâ€™s views about the 

near-term path for policy, typically at the end of a speech on the outlook.  While such 

communication can serve a useful purpose, I have come around to the view that focusing 

too much on the precise timing of policy moves may be adding to confusion and 

frustration about our communications.  I am trying to avoid this problem in my own 

remarks. 

Uncertainty 

All economic forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty.  There is always a 

wide range of plausible outcomes for important economic variables, including the federal 

funds rate.  In her remarks at Jackson Hole in August, Chair Yellen showed the median
