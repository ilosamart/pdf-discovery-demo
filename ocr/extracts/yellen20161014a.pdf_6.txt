and then adding up the separate actions of a large number of different households, a 

macro model might instead assume that the behavior of a single “average” household can 

describe the aggregate behavior of all households. 

Prior to the financial crisis, these so-called representative-agent models were the 

dominant paradigm for analyzing many macroeconomic questions.  However, a 

disaggregated approach seems needed to understand some key aspects of the Great 

Recession.  To give one example, consider the effects of negative housing equity on 

consumption.  Although households typically reduce their spending in response to wealth 

declines, the many households whose equity positions in their homes were actually 

driven negative by the reduction in house prices may have curtailed their spending even 

more sharply because of a markedly reduced ability to borrow.  Such a development, in 

turn, would shift the relationship between housing equity (which remained solidly 

positive in the aggregate) and consumer spending for the economy as a whole.  Such a 

shift in an aggregate relationship would be difficult to understand or predict without 

using disaggregated data and models. 

More generally, studying the effects of household and firm heterogeneity might 

help us better account for the severity of the recession and the slow recovery.  At the 

household level, recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of 

adverse shocks, a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that 

sharply increase their savings in a recession.9  At the firm level, there is evidence that 

financial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at small firms 

and the start-up of new firms, factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great
