recovery in the housing industry.  But until the overhang of vacant homes is reduced 

significantly and home values begin to firm, new residential construction is likely to 

remain at low levels.  Similarly, time will be required to absorb the currently large 

amount of vacant office and commercial space before construction in that sector begins to 

turn up noticeably.   

 One important element of the outlook is my expectation that financial market 

functioning and lending conditions will continue to improve, providing additional support 

for a further pickup in consumer and business spending.  During the financial crisis, 

banks reported on our quarterly survey an extraordinary tightening of their lending 

standards.  To date, only a small part of that tightening appears to have been reversed.  As 

banks continue to repair their balance sheets and develop greater confidence in the 

economic outlook, I anticipate that standards will improve further over coming quarters.  

Nonetheless, I expect loan volumes, especially real estate loan volumes, to recover only 

slowly as both borrowers and lenders proceed cautiously.   

One notable exception to my forecast for gradual improvement in financial 

markets is my expectation that residential mortgage markets could take a number of years 

to repair as policymakers and market participants grapple with the role of government in 

housing finance, adapt to changing regulation, and look for ways to better manage and 

price the risks associated with mortgage lending and servicing.  Whatever the structure of 

housing finance is to become, the large overhang of problem loans and weak housing 

markets will necessitate a gradual transition. 

 Based on all of these assumptions, I expect a gradual decline in unemployment 

this year and little change in the underlying rate of inflation.
