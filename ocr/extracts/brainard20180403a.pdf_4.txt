By contrast, prices of single-family homes appear to be closer to historical norms. 

House prices have risen at a robust pace, and the price-to-rent ratio is high in absolute 

terms, but it does not appear to be far out of line with its longer-run trend. This broad 

national trend belies significant variation among local markets, however.4

One area that the Federal Reserve is monitoring is the extreme volatility 

evidenced by some cryptocurrencies.  For instance, Bitcoin rose over 1,000 percent in

2017 and has fallen sharply in recent months.5 These markets may raise important 

investor and consumer protection issues, and some appear especially vulnerable to

money-laundering (BSA/AML, or Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering) concerns.  

As in other highly speculative markets, individual investors should be careful to 

understand the possible pitfalls of these investments and the potential for losses.  But it is 

less clear how the valuations of cryptocurrencies currently could pose a threat to financial 

stability.  For instance, it is hard to see evidence of substantial leverage used in the 

purchase of the cryptocurrencies, or a material degree of use in payments, although our 

assessment of these markets is limited by their opacity. Nonetheless, we will continue to 

study them.

In the assessment of elevated asset valuations, the relatively low level of Treasury 

yields is a mitigating factor; many asset valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings 

ratios, corporate bond yields, and property capitalization rates, appear notably less 

stretched when judged relative to low Treasury yields. That said, Treasury yields reflect 

historically low term premiums--the compensation investors demand to hold assets over a 

4 For example, the price-to-rent ratios in Los Angeles, Miami, and Denver are 10 to 20 percent above their 
long-run trends, compared with 4 percent at the national level.
