stricter terms and at higher rates than they expected.  In some cases, they deemed the terms so 

onerous that they declined the credit that was offered. 

In response to the changes in credit availability as well as in their individual 

circumstances, businesses and consumers stopped spending and hunkered down.  As businesses 

reduced inventory levels and capital spending during the past few years, they tended to pay down 

debt and build cash positions, meaning they have less need to borrow.  Many consumers are in

preceding the crisis.   In response to questions in the Federal Reserve’s survey of senior loan 

officers, banks have continued to report weaker borrower demand for mortgages and for 

consumer loans.  But demand for business loans may be improving.  When asked if they had 

seen an increase in inquiries about new credit lines or increases in credit lines from potential 

business borrowers, the percentage of banks reporting increased inquiries rose to 18.2 percent in 

the April survey from 10.5 percent in the survey taken in October 2009, while the percentage of 

banks reporting decreased inquiries declined to 16.3 percent in April from 35.1 percent in 

October.4

demand for credit remains sluggish for quite a while.  During the crisis, household net worth 

declined about 25 percent from peak to trough.5  Although some net worth was restored as stock 

markets recovered, recent retrenchment in those markets demonstrates the volatility that remains.  

Roughly 20 percent of mortgage borrowers are underwater in their mortgages, leaving them
