Before the crisis, the Federal Reserve adjusted the liquidity it provided to the financial system 

through daily operations with a relatively small set of broker-dealers against a very narrow set of 

collateral--Treasury debt, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities.  Those 

transactions had the effect of changing the quantity of reserve balances that banks hold at Federal 

Reserve Banks, and that liquidity was distributed by interbank funding markets through the 

banking system in the United States and around the world.  In addition, the Federal Reserve 

stood ready to lend directly to commercial banks and other depository institutions at the 

“discount window.”  At their discretion, banks could borrow overnight at an above-market rate 

against a broad range of collateral when they had a need for very short-term funding.   

But this structure proved inadequate in the crisis.  Interbank markets stopped functioning 

as effective means to distribute liquidity, increasing the importance of direct lending through the 

discount window.  At the same time, however, banks became extremely reluctant to borrow from 

the Federal Reserve for fear that the borrowing would become known and thus cast doubt on 

their liquidity condition.  Importantly, the crisis also involved major disruptions of important 

funding markets for other institutions.  Commercial paper markets no longer served as sources of 

funds to lenders or to nonfinancial businesses; investment banks could not borrow for even a 

short term on a secured basis when lenders began to have doubts about some of the underlying 

collateral; banks overseas could not reliably exchange their currency in swap markets to fund 

their dollar assets beyond the very shortest terms; and investors pulled out from money market 

mutual funds.  These disruptions posed the same threats to the availability of credit to households 

and businesses as did runs on banks in a more bank-centric financial system.  Intermediaries 

unable to fund themselves were forced to sell assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the 

crisis; they were unwilling to make markets necessary to allow households and businesses to
