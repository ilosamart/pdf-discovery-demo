today will make the economy more resilient to financial shocks and help reduce the risk 

of another crisis, while properly balancing these important benefits against the necessary 

costs.   

In striking this balance, government has been guided by new research that has 

added to our understanding of systemic risk.  And this work continues.  I have no doubt 

that some of you here today will perform that research and make those discoveries.  So, 

allow me to close by offering my thanks, in advance, for those contributions.  I hope my 

talk today has made it clear that the work of safeguarding our financial system will 

depend on these efforts and insights, which will empower policymakers to make the right 

decisions.
