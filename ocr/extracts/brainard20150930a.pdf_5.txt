To understand the continued strong role played by community banks, it is helpful 

to look at the differences in small business lending between large and small banks.  

Although large banks and small banks now provide about equal dollar volumes of small 

loans to businesses, they tend to provide different types of loans to different types of 

borrowers, using different underwriting methods.  On the one hand, large banks generally 

have some advantages in the provision of transaction-based lending--that is, lending that 

relies on hard or quantitative information such as financial ratios, collateral, or credit 

scores.  Small banks, on the other hand, have advantages in the provision of relationship-

based lending--lending based on context-specific or qualitative information, such as the 

owner’s character and reliability and the needs of the community.  

When we use Call Report data to break down commercial banks’ loans to 

businesses by loan size, it is striking that most of the erosion in community banks’ share 

over the past decade has been concentrated among the very smallest loans--those with 

initial principal amounts less than $100,000.  Among these so-called micro loans, the 

share held by large banks grew from 42 percent in 2005 to 67 percent in 2015.  In 

contrast, large banks’ share of larger outstanding small loans to businesses--those with 

initial principal amounts between $100,000 and $1 million--grew much more modestly, 

from 39 percent to 43 percent, over the same time period.  Business micro loans are 

typically underwritten based, primarily or exclusively, on credit scores because the small 

loan size makes it unprofitable to produce such loans using more costly traditional 

underwriting methods.  Thus, the growth in large banks’ share of micro business loans is 

                                                 
Examination Council.  Data on banks’ small loans to businesses are widely used to proxy for bank loans to 

small businesses because data on the latter are not collected.
