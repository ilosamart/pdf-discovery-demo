rather than implicit, and the costs should be balanced against the benefits, including 

greater liquidity in housing finance engendered through a uniform, guaranteed 

instrument.  

Third, a capital regime that takes the possibility of severe stress seriously is 

important to calm markets and restart the normal process of intermediation should a crisis 

materialize.  A well-capitalized banking system is a necessary condition for stability in 

bank-based financial systems as well as those with large nonbank sectors.  This necessity 

points to the importance of having resilient banking systems and also stress testing the 

system against scenarios with sharp declines in house prices.  

Fourth, rules and expectations for mortgage modifications and foreclosure should 

be clear and workable.  Past experience suggests that both lenders and borrowers benefit 

substantially from avoiding costly foreclosures.  Housing-sector reforms should consider 

polices that promote efficient modifications in systemic crises.  

In the United States, as around the world, much has been done.  The core of the 

financial system is much stronger, the worst lending practices have been curtailed, much 

progress has been made in processes to reduce unnecessary foreclosures, and the actions 

associated with the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created some 

improvement over the previous ambiguity surrounding the status of government support 

for Fannie and Freddie.  

But there is more to be done, and much improvement to be preserved and built on, 

for the world as we know it cannot afford another pair of crises of the magnitude of the 

Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis.
