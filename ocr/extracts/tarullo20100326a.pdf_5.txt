 As you know, unlike other countries that conducted stress exercises, we took the 

highly unusual step of publicly reporting the findings of the SCAP, including the capital 

needs and loss estimates for each of the 19 banks.2  This departure from the standard 

practice of keeping examination information confidential was based on the belief that 

greater transparency of the process and findings would help restore confidence in U.S. 

banks at a time of great uncertainty.  Supervisors released the methodology and 

assumptions underlying the stress test first and then, two weeks later, the results for 

individual institutions.  The results showed that under the more adverse scenario, 10 of 

the 19 SCAP banks would need to raise a total of $75 billion in capital in order to have 

the capital buffers that were targeted under the SCAP--Tier 1 capital in excess of 

6 percent of risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 Common capital in excess of 4 percent of 

risk-weighted assets at the end of the two-year horizon.   

 The merits of publicly releasing firm-specific SCAP results were much debated 

within the Federal Reserve.  In particular, some feared that weaker banks might be 

significantly harmed by the disclosures.  In the end, though, market participants 

vindicated our decision.  They appeared to be reassured for three reasons.  First, the 

results were deemed credible by most market participants, owing in part to the release of 

details about our assumptions and methods, as well as the variation in assessment of the 

banks.  Second, the results were released at a time when uncertainty about bank 

conditions was very high, and some market participants feared the worst.  That is, 

perceptions of tail risk were very high, and the SCAP results helped reassure market 

participants that under a severe but plausible scenario, the capital needs of the largest
