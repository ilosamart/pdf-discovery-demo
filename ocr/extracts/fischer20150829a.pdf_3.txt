objective.  Moreover, these measures of core inflation have been persistently below 

2 percent throughout the economic recovery.  That said, as with total inflation, core 

inflation can be somewhat variable, especially at frequencies higher than 12-month 

changes.  Moreover, note that core inflation does not entirely “exclude” food and energy, 

because changes in energy prices affect firms’ costs and so can pass into prices of non-

energy items. 

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) generally sends the same 

broad message as does the PCE price index (chart 3).  That similarity should not be 

surprising, because the CPI is the most important input used for constructing PCE prices.  

On average, CPI inflation tends to run a few tenths higher than PCE inflation, and, 

because the CPI has a modestly larger weight on energy prices, fluctuations in the CPI 

measure tend to be a bit larger.     

Of course, ongoing economic slack is one reason core inflation has been low.  

Although the economy has made great progress, we started seven years ago from an 

unemployment rate of 10 percent, which guaranteed a lengthy period of high 

unemployment.  Even so, with inflation expectations apparently stable, we would have 

expected the gradual reduction of slack to be associated with less downward price 

pressure.  All else equal, we might therefore have expected both headline and core 

inflation to be moving up more noticeably toward our 2 percent objective.  Yet, we have 

seen no clear evidence of core inflation moving higher over the past few years.  This fact 

helps drive home an important point:  While much evidence points to at least some 

ongoing role for slack in helping to explain movements in inflation, this influence is
