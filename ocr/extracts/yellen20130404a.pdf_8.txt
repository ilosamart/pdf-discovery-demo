higher costs--and this helped fuel actual inflation.  The FOMC’s occasional efforts to 

reduce inflation in the 1970s were ineffective partly due to the expectation that it 

ultimately wouldn’t do enough. 

By contrast, most of you probably know about the Federal Reserve’s successful 

inflation fighting in the early 1980s.  The FOMC raised the federal funds rate very high, 

causing a deep recession but also convincing the public that it was committed to low and 

stable inflation.  Anchoring inflation expectations at low levels helped ensure that jumps 

in commodity prices or other supply shocks would not generate persistent inflation 

problems. This was illustrated by the effect of another escalation in oil prices starting in 

2005.  Unlike in the 1970s, these price shocks did not result in a broad and lasting 

increase in overall inflation because the public believed the Federal Reserve would keep 

inflation in check.  The FOMC wasn’t forced to raise interest rates--which softened the 

blow of higher fuel costs on households and businesses--because of the credibility the 

Federal Reserve had built since the 1980s. 

If the public’s expectations have always been important, you might wonder how 

monetary policy had any effect prior to the transparency revolution.  As it turns out, with 

the notable exception of the late 1960s and 1970s, the FOMC usually responded in a 

systematic way to economic conditions.  In 1993, economist John Taylor documented 

that FOMC policy changes since the mid-1980s had fairly reliably followed a simple rule 

based on inflation and output.  Changes in the federal funds rate were usually made in 

several small steps over a number of months.  In practice, the Federal Reserve’s approach 

was “never explain, but behave predictably.”
