relatively scarce.  Starting in late 2007, faced with acute financial market distress, the 

Federal Reserve created programs to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.6  

The loans extended under those programs helped stabilize the financial system.  But the 

additional reserves created by these programs, if left unchecked, would have pushed 

down the federal funds rate, driving it well below the FOMC’s target.  To prevent such an 

outcome, the Federal Reserve took several steps to offset (or sterilize) the effect of its 

liquidity and credit operations on reserves.7  By the fall of 2008, however, the reserve 

effects of our liquidity and credit programs threatened to become too large to sterilize via 

asset sales and other existing tools.  Without sufficient sterilization capacity, the quantity 

of reserves increased to a point that the Federal Reserve had difficulty maintaining 

effective control over the federal funds rate.   

Of course, by the end of 2008, stabilizing the federal funds rate at a level 

materially above zero was not an immediate concern because the economy clearly needed 

very low short-term interest rates.  Faced with a steep rise in unemployment and 

declining inflation, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero, a 

reduction of roughly 5 percentage points over the previous year and a half.  Nonetheless, 

a variety of policy benchmarks would, at least in hindsight, have called for pushing the

7 Reserves were initially taken out of the banking system by not reinvesting principal payments from 

maturing securities and later by selling portions of securities holdings.  In September 2008, the Department 

of the Treasury announced the temporary Supplementary Financing Program, in which the proceeds of a 

series of Treasury bill auctions, separate from Treasury’s routine borrowing, were maintained in an account 

at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The funds in this account served to drain reserves from the 

banking system.
