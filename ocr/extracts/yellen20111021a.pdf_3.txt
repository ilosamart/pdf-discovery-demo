exports have grown at a robust pace.  In addition, financial market functioning is much 

better than in the depths of the crisis; the quantity and quality of capital and the size of 

liquidity buffers in the banking system have improved significantly; nonfinancial 

business balance sheets are mostly in solid shape; and credit conditions, although still 

tight, have eased somewhat for many businesses and households.     

Despite these improvements, the pace of the economic recovery has been less 

vigorous than any of us would have desired and than most forecasters had anticipated.  

Indeed, recent revisions of economic data by the Commerce Departmentâ€™s Bureau of 

Economic Analysis indicate that the recession was deeper, and the recovery weaker, than 

previously estimated.  Since the beginning of the recovery in the third quarter of 2009 

through the second quarter of this year, the most recent quarter for which an estimate is 

available, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of about 

2-1/2 percent, a slower pace than during the first two years of most U.S. recoveries in the 

past half-century.  As a consequence, aggregate output in the second quarter still had not 

reached its peak level just prior to the recession.  Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate 

has declined only 1 percentage point from its high of about 10 percent near the end of 

2009, and the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the 

peak level reached in early 2008.  The fraction of those now jobless who have been 

without work for six months or more stands at a very high level.  And, in addition to 

those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or 

have dropped out of the labor force entirely.   

U.S. economic growth was particularly anemic in the first half of this year, when 

real GDP rose at an average annual rate of less than 1 percent.  Two factors, both largely
