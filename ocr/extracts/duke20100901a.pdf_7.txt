foreclosures continue to grow, they will hinder the ability of communities to heal and ultimately 

to thrive.  So it only makes sense that we focus our research, data analysis, outreach, and 

community development expertise on better understanding the market dynamics of the 

communities impacted by foreclosures and identify solutions to help speed their recovery. 

Lessons Learned 

This summit brings together people who have been on the front lines of addressing vacant 

and abandoned properties throughout this crisis--local government officials, community 

development practitioners, lenders, servicers, and researchers--to share their experiences for the 

common good.  Thanks to the work of Community Affairs staff at the Boston and Cleveland 

Reserve Banks and here at the Board, we have been able to document many of these lessons in 

the conference publication.  While I donâ€™t want to spoil the plot, I do want to use the remainder 

of my time to preview some of the most important lessons about community stabilization.  

First, we have learned that effective interventions emerge when there is a full 

understanding of mortgage markets, their dynamics, and incentives.  Several articles describe the 

steep learning curve that policymakers have navigated in order to effectively implement the NSP 

created by Congress and to utilize the $6 billion in funds made available through the first two 

rounds of the program.  These funds were provided to help stabilize neighborhoods through the 

acquisition, rehabilitation, financing, demolition, and land banking of properties that are 

blighting communities. While NSP funds were intended to provide an aggressive response to the 

forces destabilizing communities, time limits, such as the requirement that grantees obligate 

funds within 18 months, often underestimated the time needed to navigate the property 

disposition process, especially when paired with the myriad other requirements and limitations 

on uses of the funds.
