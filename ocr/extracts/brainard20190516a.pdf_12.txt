experience with actual inflation, and that this responsiveness varies over time.15  We can use 

such an approach to get an idea of how much, and how quickly, underlying inflation might 

respond to any particular path for actual inflation.  It provides some reassurance that our goal 

may be achievable if inflation moves only slightly above 2 percent for a couple of years.  The 

SEP inflation projections of Committee members suggest that many have, over the past year or 

so, envisaged a few years of a mild overshoot.16   

Of course, it is not entirely clear how to move underlying trend inflation smoothly to our 

target on a sustained basis in the presence of a very flat Phillips curve.  One possibility we might 

refer to as “opportunistic reflation” would be to take advantage of a modest increase in actual 

inflation to demonstrate to the public our commitment to our inflation goal on a symmetric 

basis.17  For example, suppose that an unexpected increase in core import price inflation drove 

overall inflation modestly above 2 percent for a couple of years.  The Federal Reserve could use 

that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals 

and to align policy with that statement.  Such an approach could help demonstrate to the public 

that the Committee is serious about achieving its 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained 

basis.

Forecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 39 (February), pp. 3–33.  Their model allows the 
responsiveness of underlying inflation to actual inflation to vary over time and suggests that responsiveness—the 
“gain”—has been lower in recent years than in the 1970s and 1980s.
