financial risk premiums.  Because international financial markets are tightly linked, an 

adverse reaction in European financial markets could affect U.S. financial markets, and, 

through them, real activity in the United States. 

In addition, we should not dismiss the possible reemergence of risks surrounding 

China and emerging market economies (EMEs) more broadly.  In recent months, capital 

outflows in China have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased.  Should 

exchange rate pressures reemerge, we cannot rule out a recurrence of financial stress, 

which would affect not only China but also other emerging markets that are linked to 

China via supply chains or commodity exports and, ultimately, conditions here.  China is 

making a challenging transition from export- to domestic demand-led growth, and the 

cost of reallocating resources from excess capacity sectors to more dynamic sectors could 

further impair growth in the near term.  While China has taken policy steps to limit the 

extent of the slowdown, there is an evident tension in policy between reform and 

stimulus, and the effect of the stimulus may already be waning.  Vulnerabilities--such as 

excess capacity, elevated corporate debt, and risks in the shadow banking sector--appear 

to be building, and could pose continued risks over the medium term.   

The fragility of the global economic environment is unlikely to resolve any time 

soon.  Growth in the advanced economies remains dependent on extraordinary 

unconventional monetary policy accommodation, while conventional policy continues to 

be constrained by the zero lower bound.  Conventional policy, whose efficacy is more 

tested and better understood than unconventional policies, can respond readily to upside 

surprises to demand, but presently would be constrained in adjusting to downside
