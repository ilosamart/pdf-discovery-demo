So, we do need to take account of HVCRE risks, given that commercial real estate 

lending accounts for a significant percentage of the assets of many community banks.  But we 

can look for ways to simplify the specific capital requirements while ensuring that appropriate 

capital buffers exist.  For example, it might be possible to determine applicable capital 

requirements by reference to the proportion of a bank’s real estate loans that are HVCRE, as 

defined more simply, rather than requiring more elaborate loan-by-loan calculations. 

More generally, it is worthwhile for the bank regulatory agencies to consider possibilities 

for a broader simplification of capital requirements for smaller community banks.  As important 

as it was to make the Basel I risk-based requirements more risk sensitive, it is also important to 

recognize that the greater detail of the new rules requires a degree of categorization, 

recordkeeping, and reporting that may be particularly costly, in relative terms, for smaller 

community banks.  So we should explore whether we can achieve the safety and soundness 

purposes of capital regulation in a simplified way.  

In doing so, of course, we must be mindful of the Collins Amendment, which requires 

that minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements be established for all insured 

depository institutions and bank holding companies, and that the minimum applicable 

requirements not be less than “generally applicable” requirements.9  Still, there are some 

possibilities that may be consistent with the Collins Amendment.  For example, one idea I have 

heard is to allow smaller community banks to opt into a simpler set of risk-weighted capital 

requirements in exchange for a higher minimum required ratio than under the more risk-

sensitive, but more complicated, standardized risk-weighted requirements finalized in 2013.  I 

 
9 Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, popularly known as the Collins Amendment, requires that the federal banking 
agencies establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all banking organizations that are not less than 
“generally applicable” risk-based capital requirements.
