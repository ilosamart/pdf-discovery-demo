easing of these conditions will be a slow and gradual process.  In particular, I expect 

demand to come from a pickup in new household formation, but I also recognize that 

these households may be the very population that faces especially tight credit conditions.  

I will return to the subject of mortgage credit later in my talk. 

Housing Market Overview and Outlook 

Last year’s house price gains were achieved in an environment largely defined by 

historically unusual factors:  a large number of underwater homeowners, which have 

effectively reduced the supply of properties for sale; the fact that foreclosed properties 

continue to represent an outsized, although gradually decreasing, share of sales 

transactions; and strong demand on the part of investors.   

Turning first to underwater homeowners, although the actual number of these 

homeowners is unknown--plausible estimates range fairly broadly from 7 million to 

14 million--it seems clear that some are unable or unwilling to sell their homes because 

they lack the funds to carry out the transactions or are reluctant to realize losses.  As a 

result, some potential sellers have not responded to the signs of housing market recovery 

by putting their properties on the market.  The number of single-family homes for sale 

has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, which has likely contributed to the recent house 

price gains.  Indeed, cities that started 2012 with an outsized share of underwater 

homeowners have seen some of the largest price increases. 

Next, sales of properties from lenders’ real estate owned (REO) inventories 

represented 14 percent of sales transactions in 2012, down from 21 percent in 2010.5  

These sales have damped house prices by increasing the supply of homes for sale and, in

obtains legal control of a property.  Percentages are from staff calculations based on data provided by
