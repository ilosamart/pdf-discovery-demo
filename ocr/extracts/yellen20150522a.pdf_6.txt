A number of economic headwinds have slowed the recovery, and to some extent 

they continue to influence the outlook.  These headwinds include, first, the fact that the 

housing crash left many households with less wealth and higher debt, weighing on 

consumer spending.  Many homeowners lost their homes, and many more ended up 

“underwater,” owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.  Economists 

have noted that areas of the country that saw a larger boom and bust in housing have 

subsequently fared worse economically than other areas of the country.3  Rhode Island is 

one such place.  While the housing bust was not as large here as in Florida, Nevada, and 

parts of California, it was larger than average, and the largest in New England.  This 

factor likely has contributed to the fact that the overall recovery here in Rhode Island has 

lagged.4  

In some respects, this headwind has diminished.  Home prices have moved up 

appreciably in many areas of the country, alleviating the burden for many homeowners, 

though the improvement in some areas, including Rhode Island, has lagged.  Nationally, 

the share of mortgages that are underwater fell by about one-half between 2011 and 

2014.5  And credit availability for mortgages has improved as well, although mortgages 

are still very hard to obtain for would-be homeowners without pristine credit records.  So 

I would score this headwind as still a concern, but one that is likely to continue to fade.  

A second headwind, also quite important here in Rhode Island, has come from 

changes in fiscal policy to reduce budget deficits.  At the federal level, the fiscal stimulus

5 The share varies by source of data.  According to Zillow’s October 2014 Real Estate Market Overview, 
the share of mortgages in negative equity positions declined from about 30 percent in 2011 to 17 percent in 
2014.  According to CoreLogic’s 4th quarter 2014 Equity Report, the share declined from about 25 percent 
to 11 percent over that period.
