community banks have struggled to survive, especially during the last five or six years.  

Although improving overall economic conditions have begun to provide some relief to these 

struggling banks, they continue to face significant challenges.  The burden of regulatory 

compliance can be particularly daunting for small banks.  And competition, from large banks and 

credit unions as well as other nonbank financial service providers, is always a concern.   

My colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and I are committed to making sure that we 

understand the challenges faced by community banks.  One way that we further our 

understanding is by talking to the bankers themselves.  The entire Board of Governors meets 

twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, which includes 

representatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve 

Districts.3  Individual governors also take advantage of opportunities to meet with community 

bankers from time to time.  During last yearâ€™s conference I met with a group of St. Louis area 

community bankers to hear what was on their minds.  I will conduct a nationwide webinar with 

community bankers next month.  In fact, I speak regularly to a number of bank executives, 

including those who run smaller institutions.  I find these types of conversations--with people 

who live and work in the world outside the Capital Beltway and far from Wall Street--to be 

particularly enlightening.  And, of course, this conference, which was conceived as the result of a 

successful collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank 

Supervisors, provides an annual opportunity for community bankers, bank regulators, and 

academic researchers to come together to share ideas and insights surrounding the issues that 

matter most to community bankers.
