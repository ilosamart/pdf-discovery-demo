 The required standards include capital 

requirements, liquidity requirements, stress testing, single-counterparty credit limits, an 

early remediation regime, and risk-management and resolution-planning requirements.  

These requirements are to increase in stringency in accordance with the relative systemic 

importance of the companies.   

The capital surcharges that we will apply under this authority provide a clear 

example of this kind of macroprudentially motivated regulation.  A microprudential 

requirement is informed by asking what level of capital would be necessary to allow the 

firm to remain a viable financial intermediary even after absorbing losses that, within a 

fairly high level of confidence, might be encountered over some relevant timeframe.  A 

macroprudential capital requirement should take account of the fact that there would be 

very large negative externalities associated with the disorderly failure of any systemically 

important financial institution (SIFI), distinct from the costs incurred by the firm, its 

stakeholders, and the federal deposit insurance fund.  

As already suggested, the failure of such a firm, especially in a period of stress, 

significantly increases the chances that other financial firms will themselves experience 

great stress, for two reasons.  First, direct counterparty impacts can lead to a classic 

domino effect.  Second, because losses in a tail event are much more likely to be 

correlated for firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, and other capital 

market instruments, all such firms are vulnerable to accelerating losses as troubled firms 

sell their assets into a declining market.  Enhanced capital requirements should take into
