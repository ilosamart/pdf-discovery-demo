investors, and requirements that many derivatives be centrally cleared have decreased the 

opacity and interconnectedness that contributed to the chaos of 2008. 

In addition to these through-the-cycle measures, the Federal Reserve actively 

monitors for the buildup of financial stability vulnerabilities and can require large banks 

to increase their loss-absorbing capacity through increases in the CCyB when systemic 

vulnerabilities are sufficiently large.  While such countercyclical tools are new, their goal 

is to mitigate the buildup of vulnerabilities during buoyant periods, since experience has 

proven time and again that vulnerabilities can build during good times as risk appetite 

grows and memories of earlier instability fade. 

Effectively mitigating the buildup of risk through the CCyB requires a systematic 

framework for analyzing vulnerabilities and a mapping of such changes in financial-

sector risks into the appropriate level for the CCyB.  The Board developed its framework 

outlining the objectives of the tool and the factors that would influence the determination 

of its appropriate level through a process of public consultation.5  

Under our policy, the primary objective for activating the CCyB is to build 

financial-sector resilience during periods when the risks to financial stability have risen to 

meaningfully above normal levels and there is an elevated possibility of potential losses 

within the banking sector that could place strains on the supply of credit or otherwise 

substantially impede economic and financial activity.  A secondary objective for using

framework that the Board would use to set the amount of the U.S. CCyB.  See Regulation Q--Capital
