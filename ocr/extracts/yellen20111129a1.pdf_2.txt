Good morning.  I’m delighted to return “home” to the Federal Reserve Bank of 

San Francisco and honored to kick off the Bank’s second Asia Economic Policy 

Conference.  

In my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened 

international policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the 

global economy--a theme that received emphasis at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Leaders’ 

Summit in Cannes earlier this month.  The global economy is facing critical challenges.  

The recovery in the United States and other advanced economies has been proceeding too 

slowly to provide jobs for millions of unemployed people.  There have also been clear 

signs of slowing growth in emerging market economies over the past year.  In effect, we 

face a dearth of aggregate demand, not just among the advanced economies, but also for 

the global economy as a whole.

In ordinary times, policymakers in the advanced countries would address such a 

demand shortfall with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.  But these are no 

ordinary times.  Central banks in a number of advanced economies, including the United 

States, have brought short-term interest rates close to zero, so that further monetary 

accommodation can be provided only through unconventional tools, such as securities 

purchases and forward policy guidance.  Meanwhile, the scope for fiscal stimulus is 

limited by concerns about sizable budget deficits and longer-term sustainability.   

At the G-20 summit earlier this month in Cannes, the United States and other 

advanced economies--including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United

Joseph Gruber, Steven Kamin, Michael Leahy, Andrew Levin, Trevor Reeve, and David Wilcox for their 

assistance in preparing these remarks.
