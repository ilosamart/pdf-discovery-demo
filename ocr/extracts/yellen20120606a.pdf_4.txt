reversed.  A critical question for monetary policy is the extent to which these numbers reflect a 

shortfall from full employment versus a rise in structural unemployment.  While the magnitude 

of structural unemployment is uncertain, I read the evidence as suggesting that the bulk of the 

rise during the recession was cyclical, not structural in nature. 

Consider figure 1, which presents three indicators of labor market slack.  The black solid 

line is the unemployment gap, defined as the difference between the actual unemployment rate 

and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate of the rate consistent with inflation 

remaining stable over time.  The red dashed line is an index of the difficulty households perceive 

in finding jobs, based on results from a survey conducted by the Conference Board.  And the red 

dotted line is an index of firms’ ability to fill jobs, based on a survey conducted by the National 

Federation of Independent Business.  All three measures show similar cyclical movements over 

the past 20 years, and all now stand at very high levels.  This similarity runs counter to claims 

that the CBO’s and other estimates of the unemployment gap overstate the true amount of slack 

by placing insufficient weight on structural explanations, such as a reduced efficiency of 

matching workers to jobs, for the rise in unemployment since 2007.  If that were the case, why 

would firms now find it so easy to fill positions?  Other evidence also points to the dominant role 

of cyclical forces in the recent rise in unemployment:  job losses have been widespread, rather 

than being concentrated in the construction and financial sectors, and the co-movement of job 

vacancies and unemployment over the past few years does not appear to be unusual.2   

As I mentioned, I expect several factors to restrain the pace of the recovery and the 

corresponding improvement in the labor market going forward.  The housing sector remains a
