International Banking Facilities
Effective date July 1997 Section 5050.1

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System amended Regulations D and Q effective
December 3, 1981, to permit U.S. depository
institutions, Edge and Agreement Corporations
and U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs to
establish International Banking Facilities (IBFs)
in the United States.

The Board’s objective was to enhance the
international competitive position of banking
institutions in the United States by permitting,
through an institution’s IBF, similar deposit
reserve and tax treatment afforded to offshore
banking offices. As a result, an IBF was permit-
ted to maintain a lower rate of reserves on IBF
liabilities maintained in excess of IBF assets.
When adjustments to the deposit reserve require-
ments were made in September 1990, an IBF’s
relative advantage with respect to deposit
reserves was effectively eliminated. However, in
some states, there still remain tax advantages to
maintaining IBFs. Furthermore, many FBOs
continue to use their IBFs as funding vehicles on
the assumption that former reserve requirements
may be reestablished.

Examinations of IBFs are ordinarily con-
ducted in conjunction with examinations of the
branches operating those facilities, and follow
the same supervisory procedures.

While a branch is not required to establish a
separate organization for IBF operations, it is
required to segregate on its books, the asset and
liability accounts included in the IBF.

In general, IBFs may accept deposits from
and extend credit to non-U.S. residents or other
IBFs. The Board’s rules impose various restric-
tions and limitations on the type of business in
which an IBF can engage. These restrictions
were designed to avoid complicating the con-
duct of domestic monetary policy and insulate
U.S. economic activity from IBF transactions.
As outlined in Regulation D, Section 204.8,
these restrictions include:

• Prohibiting the lending to or accepting of
deposits from a U.S. resident, other than the
branch establishing the IBF or other IBFs;

• Prohibiting the acceptance of transaction
accounts;

• Prohibiting the issuance of negotiable or bearer
instruments;

• Requiring nonbank deposits to carry a mini-
mum maturity or required notice period of two
business days; bank deposits can be made
with overnight maturities;

• Subjecting nonbank customer transactions to a
minimum deposit or withdrawal amount of
$100,000, except to close out an account or
withdraw accumulated interest;

• Requiring the IBF to notify its nonbank cus-
tomers, in writing, at the time an account
relationship is first established that the depos-
its received by the IBF may be used only to
support its non-U.S. operations, and exten-
sions of credit by the IBF may be used only to
finance the customers’ non-U.S. operations. In
the case of customers that are foreign affiliates
of U.S. residents, the IBF is required to obtain
acknowledgment of the receipt of such notice.

Branches may book off-balance-sheet items
in the IBF, provided the customer and the
transactions comply with applicable regulations.
Generally, off-balance-sheet items are booked at
an IBF to take advantage of favorable tax rates
or to hedge IBF assets and liabilities. Examiners
should review the reasons for booking such
items in the IBF and determine the appropriate-
ness of such action.

In addition, certain states impose further
restrictions and requirements governing the
establishment and maintenance of IBFs. The
examiner should review these restrictions and
requirements prior to establishing the scope of
the review.
