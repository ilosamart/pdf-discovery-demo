(Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), or absorbed into a bank holding company (Bear Stearns 

and Merrill Lynch).   

 The other designation authority granted the FSOC is for financial market utilities, defined 

as multilateral transfer, clearing, or settlement systems for payments, securities, or other financial 

transactions among financial institutions.14  Once designated as systemically important,15 

financial market utilities are subject to prudential standards established by the Federal Reserve, 

the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission 

for the purpose of reducing systemic risk and supporting financial stability.16  Here, in addition 

to providing considerations for the FSOC in making its determination,  the statute elaborates the 

standard of “systemically important” a bit, defining that term to mean a situation “where the 

failure of or a disruption to the functioning of a financial market utility or the conduct of a 

payment, clearing or settlement activity could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity 

or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the 

stability of the financial system of the United States.”17  In July, the FSOC designated eight 

financial market utilities as systemically important and they are now subject to special risk-

management standards.18 

 In addition to these designation authorities, Dodd-Frank grants the FSOC very broad 

scope for dealing with a large bank holding company or designated nonbank financial company 

that “poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States.”19  Upon the 

recommendation of the Board of Governors, the FSOC may limit mergers, products, or activities 

of the firm.  If these actions are inadequate to mitigate the grave risk, the FSOC may require the 

firm to divest assets or off-balance sheet items.
