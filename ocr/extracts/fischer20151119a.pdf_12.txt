has been supported by an improved macroeconomic policy framework, including a 

strengthening of the framework for conducting monetary policy, as well as legal and 

regulatory reform.  And the authorities have embarked on an ambitious program to 

improve the business environment.  

That said, significant roadblocks need to be overcome for India to reach its full 

potential.  The economy continues to suffer from a number of infrastructure bottlenecks 

that will be alleviated only through a pronounced increase in investment rates, a process 

that would likely be helped by a relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment.  

Likewise, efforts at difficult reform will have to be sustained.  There is much hard work 

ahead if India is to come closer to fulfilling the potential that it so manifestly has.    

Concluding Remarks 

The performance of the Asian economies--notably those of East Asia, particularly 

China, Japan, and Korea--especially in the past six or seven decades, is an outstanding, if 

not unique, episode in the history of the global economy.   

What lies ahead?  In the relatively near future probably some major central banks 

will begin gradually moving away from near-zero interest rates.  The question here is 

whether the emerging market countries of Asia—and, indeed, of the world--are 

sufficiently prepared for these decisions, to the extent that potential capital flows and 

market adjustments can take place without major macroeconomic consequences.  While 

we continue to scrutinize incoming data, and no final decisions have been made, we have 

done everything we can to avoid surprising the markets and governments when we move, 

to the extent that several emerging market (and other) central bankers have, for some 

time, been telling the Fed to “just do it.”
