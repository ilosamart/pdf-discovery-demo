restricted capital mobility, and more-limited monetary policy independence.  Many of 

these latter economies also have current account surpluses, in part because authorities 

have been able to resist currency appreciation, and thus inhibit external adjustment, for 

prolonged periods.  This feature of the international system inhibits the process of global 

rebalancing and could restrain the current recovery. 

 Thus, at most, capital controls should be seen as just one of many tools that can be 

used to manage capital inflows, and one to be used only in particularly challenging 

situations.  The IMF work that I mentioned earlier concludes that capital controls may be 

appropriate in conjunction with other policy tools as long as countries meet certain 

conditions.  Foreign currency reserves should already be adequate, and exchange rates 

should not be undervalued.  Controls should not be used as a substitute for necessary 

macroeconomic policy adjustments; for example, if the economy is overheating, controls 

should only be used along with a suitable monetary-fiscal policy mix.  Moreover, 

controls should be lifted once these prerequisites no longer apply.11 

 In addition, the IMFâ€™s work encourages countries to turn to macroprudential tools 

before making use of capital controls.  Although admittedly no bright line differentiates 

these two types of policies, macroprudential tools generally are designed to enhance the 

resilience of the financial system, a broader and more enduring objective than directly 

managing capital flows.  Operationally, macroprudential tools typically do not 

discriminate between residents and nonresidents, nor differentiate by currency.  Examples 

of such prudential policies would include guidance on loan-to-value ratios, capital 

adequacy standards, and limits on net open foreign exchange positions.12
