regarding the costs of an expanding balance sheet, it seemed prudent to preserve some 

flexibility.  Of course, the flip side of this flexibility is that it entailed providing less- 

concrete information to market participants about our reaction function for asset 

purchases.    

Where do we stand now, nine months into the program?  With respect to the 

economic fundamentals, both the current state of the labor market, as well as the outlook, 

have improved since September 2012.  Back then, the unemployment rate was 

8.1 percent and nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 

97,000 over the prior six months; today, those figures are 7.6 percent and 194,000, 

respectively.  Back then, FOMC participants were forecasting unemployment rates 

around 7-3/4 percent and 7 percent for year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively, in our 

Summary of Economic Projections; as of the June 2013 round, these forecasts have been 

revised down roughly 1/2 percentage point each.  While it is difficult to determine 

precisely, I believe that our asset purchases since September have supported this 

improvement.  For example, some of the brightest spots in recent months have been 

sectors that traditionally respond to monetary accommodation, such as housing and autos.  

Although asset purchases also bring with them various costs and risks--and I have been 

particularly concerned about risks relating to financial stability--thus far I would judge 

that they have passed the cost-benefit test. 

However, this very progress has brought communications challenges to the fore, 

since the further down the road we get, the more information the market demands about 

the conditions that would lead us to reduce and eventually end our purchases.  This 

imperative for clarity provides the backdrop against which our current messaging should
