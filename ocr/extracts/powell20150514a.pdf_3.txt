economies of scale.  At the same time, historically thin net interest margins have 

constrained profitability, and, although not aimed at community banks, new post-crisis 

regulations meant to strengthen the financial system are coming into place that require 

additional management attention. 

The Federal Reserve recognizes the importance of a healthy community banking 

sector for our nation’s prosperity, and we are committed to understanding the challenges 

faced by community banks and to carefully considering the effects of new regulations on 

these institutions.  Our mandate is to protect the safety and soundness of the nation’s 

financial system, and we aim to do so in a manner that promotes a level playing field for 

all institutions while taking into account the risks those institutions could pose to our 

financial system.  As you know, the Federal Reserve tiers its regulations to be 

commensurate with the risks presented by different institutions.  The risks presented by an 

institution with $300 million in assets are very different from those presented by an 

institution with $300 billion in assets.  Although the credit that a community bank extends 

to households and businesses within its local area may be difficult to replace, the failure of 

a community bank would not cause a widespread contraction in credit or have any other 

systemic consequences.  For that reason, community banks are not subject to the same 

regulations that are applied to the most systemically important banking organizations. 

The Federal Reserve’s 2013 capital guidelines are a good example of how we have 

taken into account the effect of our regulations on community banks.  The recession made
