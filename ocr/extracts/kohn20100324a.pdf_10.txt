Federal Reserve can and will tighten policy well in advance of any threat to price stability, and 

successful execution of this exit will demonstrate that these emergency steps need not lead to 

higher inflation. 

Monetary Policy and Financial Imbalances 

The past few years have illustrated two lessons about the relationship between 

macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  First, macroeconomic stability doesn’t 

guarantee financial stability; indeed, in some circumstances, macroeconomic stability may foster 

financial instability by lulling people into complacency about risks.  And second, some shocks to 

the financial system are so substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of 

intermediaries, that decreases in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or 

easily remedied by conventional monetary policy. 

Given the heavy costs of the financial crisis, the question naturally arises as to how it 

could have been avoided.  My third assignment is to reexamine whether conventional monetary 

policy should be used to lean against financial imbalances as well as aim for the traditional 

medium-term macroeconomic goals of maximum employment and price stability.  One key 

question is whether we are likely to know enough about asset price misalignments and the effects 

of policy adjustments on those misalignments to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away 

for a time from exclusive pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives.  Obviously, reducing the 

odds of financial crises would be very beneficial, but we need to balance that important objective 

against the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary policy for that 

purpose.   

One type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument.  Increases in 

interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be
