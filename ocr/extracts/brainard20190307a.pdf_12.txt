The FOMC recently affirmed that it would continue to operate the current 

framework.15  This approach makes sense for a variety of reasons.  The current 

framework has been effective in providing good control of the policy rate and ensuring 

effective transmission to other money markets and the financial system.  Not only is the 

demand for reserves likely to remain much higher than it was before the crisis, but it is 

also likely that there will be fluctuations in reserves, along with other elements of the 

Fedâ€™s liabilities, such as the deposits the Treasury holds with the Fed.  Accommodating 

those swings with scarce reserves would require much larger daily open market 

operations than was the case before the crisis. 

By remaining in a regime with ample reserves, the Fed is able to control short-

term interest rates without the need to conduct daily open market operations.  Because 

there are ample reserves, the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates are 

determined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.  As a result, the system 

can absorb swings in the demand and supply of reserves with limited need for open 

market operations.  The alternative of pushing reserves close to the transition point 

between the flat and steep parts of the demand curve would likely lead to active 

intervention as an ongoing feature, along with volatility in rates. 

Given that the Committee is now operating with two instruments, it is important 

to note that the Committee clarified that it would seek to use only one tool actively at a 

time, and that the preferred active tool would be the federal funds rate when it is above 

the effective lower bound.  I want to make it clear that we would not want our two tools 

to be working at cross-purposes.  For instance, we would not want the balance sheet to be
