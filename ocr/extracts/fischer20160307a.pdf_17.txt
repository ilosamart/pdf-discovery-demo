challenging.16  And while unconventional policy tools such as forward 

guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful and effective, all 

central banks would prefer a situation with positive interest rates, restoring 

their ability to use the more traditional interest rate tool of monetary policy.17   

The answer to the question “Will the equilibrium interest rate remain at 

today’s low levels permanently?” is also that we do not know.  Many of the 

factors that determine the equilibrium interest rate, particularly productivity 

growth, are extremely difficult to forecast.  At present, it looks likely that the 

equilibrium interest rate will remain low for the policy-relevant future, but 

there have in the past been both long swings and short-term changes in what 

can be thought of as equilibrium real rates. 

Eventually, history will give us the answer.  But it is critical to emphasize that 

history’s answer will depend also on future policies, monetary and other, 

notably including fiscal policy.   

Concluding Remarks 

Well, are the answers all different than they were 50 years ago?  No.  The basic 

framework we learned a half-century ago remains extremely useful.  But also yes:  Some 

of the answers are different because they were not on previous exams because the 

problems they deal with were not evident fifty years ago.  So the advice to potential 

policymakers is simple:  Learn as much as you can, for most of it will come in useful at
