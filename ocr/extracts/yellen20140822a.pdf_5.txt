reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the FOMC’s view that policy decisions will not 

be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide range of 

information on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.5 

Interpreting Labor Market Surprises:  Past and Future 

The assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially 

challenging recently.  Estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the 

magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables, 

including labor force participation, the extent of part-time employment for economic 

reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits.  A considerable body 

of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variables has 

changed since the Great Recession.6  Along with cyclical influences, significant structural 

factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other 

demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor 

market, and the phenomenon of “polarization”--that is, the reduction in the relative 

number of middle-skill jobs.7   

                                                 
5 The central role of labor market conditions in monetary policy deliberations has also been apparent 

abroad.  Last year the Bank of England announced its intention not to raise its policy rate at least until the 

unemployment rate reached 7 percent, subject to conditions on inflation and financial stability.  Since that 
time, the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom has dropped unexpectedly rapidly, prompting 

policymakers to consider data beyond this single indicator when assessing the extent of spare capacity in 

the U.K. economy.  As in the United States, an unexpectedly swift decline in unemployment has raised 

questions about the structural and cyclical effects of a severe recession. 
6 For a discussion of important differences in the evolution of labor market conditions during the Great 

Recession relative to typical postwar patterns, see Henry S. Farber (2011), “Job Loss in the Great 

Recession:  Historical Perspective from the Displaced Workers Survey, 1984-2010,” NBER Working Paper 

Series 17040 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, May). 
7 For convenience, the analysis here is presented as if cyclical factors and structural factors can be neatly 

delineated.  In reality, the line between the two may be indistinct.  Moreover, what begins as cyclical 

weakness may evolve into structural damage.  For a discussion of the strategic issues that arise when 

policymakers believe such evolution from cyclical to structural to be an important feature of the economy, 

see Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United 

States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and 

Economics Discussion Series 2013-77 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 

November), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html.
