typically estimated to be modest in magnitude, and can easily be masked by other 

factors.2  

In the first instance, as already noted, core inflation can to some extent be 

influenced by oil prices.  However, a larger effect comes from changes in the exchange 

value of the dollar, and the rise in the dollar over the past year is an important reason 

inflation has remained low (chart 4).  A higher value of the dollar passes through to lower 

import prices, which hold down U.S. inflation both because imports make up part of final 

consumption, and because lower prices for imported components hold down business 

costs more generally.  In addition, a rise in the dollar restrains the growth of aggregate 

demand and overall economic activity, and so has some effect on inflation through that 

more indirect channel.3   

To get a sense of the timing and magnitude of these exchange rate effects, chart 5 

shows dynamic simulations of a 10 percent real dollar appreciation, based on one of the 

                                                 
2 Among the many papers finding a role for resource utilization in affecting inflation based on evidence 

from macroeconomic time-series data, see Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well:  

Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series19390 (Cambridge, 

Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, August); or Douglas O. Staiger, James H. Stock and Mark 

W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Christina D. 

Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of 

Chicago Press), pp. 195-246.  For similar results based on cross-sectional evidence, see Michael T. Kiley 

(2014), “An Evaluation of the Inflationary Pressure Associated with Short- and Long-Term 

Unemployment,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2014-28 (Washington: Board of Governors of 

the Federal Reserve System, March), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201428/201428pap.pdf; or, 

for wages instead of prices, Christopher L. Smith (2014), “The Effect of Labor Slack on Wages: Evidence 

from State-Level Relationships,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System, June 2), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/effect-of-labor-slack-on-

3 There has also been debate regarding other potential channels through which global factors could affect 

domestic inflation--for example, whether measures of foreign resource utilization play an important 

independent role.  For evidence supporting such global factors, see Claudio Borio and Andrew Filardo 

(2007), “Globalisation and Inflation:  New Cross-Country Evidence on the Global Determinants of 

Domestic Inflation,” BIS Working Papers 227 (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for International Settlements, 

May), www.bis.org/publ/work227.pdf.  For a more skeptical take, see Jane Ihrig, Steven B. Kamin, 

Deborah Lindner, and Jaime Marquez (2007), “Some Simple Tests of the Globalization and Inflation 

Hypothesis,” International Finance Discussion Papers 891 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 

Federal Reserve System, April), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2007/891/ifdp891.pdf.
