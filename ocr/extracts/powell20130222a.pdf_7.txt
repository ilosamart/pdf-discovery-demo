metrics. 

We may have more room than other economies around the globe, but I do not

message seems just right to me:  We don’t know where the tipping point is; wherever it 

is, we are clearly getting closer to it, and the costs of misestimating its location are 

enormous and one-sided.  The benefits to long-term fiscal consolidation--conducted at the 

right pace, and without jeopardizing the near-term economic recovery--would be 

substantial.  

Balance Sheet Losses and Remittances 

The authors’ work on Federal Reserve income and remittances to the Treasury 

overlaps with a paper published last month by Federal Reserve Board staff members Seth 

Carpenter, Jane Ihrig, Beth Klee, Daniel Quinn, and Alexander Boote.9  Both papers 

provide a basis for public discussion of these matters, which is a highly positive 

development.  Some of the assets acquired through the Federal Reserve’s large-scale 

asset purchases (LSAPs) may be sold at a loss, and it is important to be transparent about 

this possibility.   

Thus far, the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases have greatly increased our income 

and remittances to the Treasury.  Indeed, remittances have run at an annual level of about 

$80 billion from 2010 to 2012.  Both papers show that remittances are likely to decline 

substantially from these elevated levels as interest rates rise and the Fed balance sheet
