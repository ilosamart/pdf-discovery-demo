 The problems that led to the mortgage crisis and the potential policy solutions to 

those problems are numerous and varied.  Even though time does not permit a full 

discussion of them here, I do believe that forceful and effective housing policies have 

the potential to significantly influence the speed and strength of our economic 

recovery.  The Federal Reserve has already acted to reduce mortgage rates by 

purchasing longer-term assets, in particular through the purchase of agency mortgage-

backed securities.  Indeed, low rates combined with falling house prices have 

contributed to historically high levels of housing affordability (chart 26).  At the same 

time, rents have been rising, which should make homeownership a more attractive 

option relative to rental housing (chart 27).   

Despite this record affordability, home purchase and mortgage refinancing 

activity remains muted.  The failure of home sales to respond to conditions that would 

otherwise seem favorable to home purchases indicates that there are other factors 

weighing on demand for owner-occupied homes.  High levels of unemployment and 

weak income prospects are likely precluding many households from purchasing 

homes.  In addition, some potential buyers may be delaying house purchases out of 

fear of purchasing into a falling market.  Weak prices also contribute to the reportedly 

large number of purchase contracts that are canceled due to appraisals that come in too 

low to support financing. 

 Finally, many households are unable to purchase homes because of mortgage 

credit conditions, which are substantially tighter now than they were prior to the 

recession.  Some of this tightening is appropriate, as mortgage lending standards were
