withdrawal limits.  They then distribute counterfeit cards to “cashing crews” around the 

world who make the withdrawals. 

These well-known payment fraud schemes were perpetrated in different eras, and 

juxtaposing them highlights how the payment security landscape has changed. Frank

social engineering.  In contrast, the ATM thieves relied on rapid transmission of data to 

remotely steal account information and alter withdrawal limits, all without interacting 

with bank employees.  Today, fraud can be executed quickly, perpetrated on a massive 

scale, and carried out remotely. 

In light of this new environment, I will suggest four things that all of us ought to 

be doing with respect to payment security.  Some are already being done.  Too often, 

though, such efforts are overlooked or inconsistently applied. 

1. Safe Innovation 

This is an exciting time for the payment system.  Technology companies are 

creating new methods to pay with mobile phones and even wearable devices.  Banks are 

building faster payment capabilities into their deposit account systems. Banks, payment 

card networks, and merchants are rolling out Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) chip 

cards and using compatible point-of-sale terminals.  Many of the newest products in the 

market are impressive, incorporating new technologies like biometrics and tokenization. 

End users and the media have taken notice. 

History shows that we should embrace innovation.  Technological innovation has 

continually pushed the payment system forward.  Payment cards, both credit and debit, 

are an example.  Thirty years ago, everyone carried cash.  Today, young adults
