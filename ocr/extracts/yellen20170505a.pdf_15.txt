discrimination, attitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an absence 

of mentors. 

Recent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools 

in numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest 

echelons of their professions.30  For instance, 47 percent of students at top-50 law schools 

are female, and women obtain 40 percent of M.B.A.’s from top programs.  Nonetheless, 

women are still poorly represented among corporate CEOs, as partners in top law firms, 

and as executives in finance.31  Even in my own field of economics, women constitute 

only about one-third of Ph.D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two 

decades.32  This lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to 

explain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings 

distribution.33   

One of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled 

women to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields 

such as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off.  This 

would have a disproportionately large effect on women, who continue to bear the lion’s 

share of domestic and child-rearing responsibilities.34  Within academia, the short 

timeframe in which assistant professors have to prove themselves good candidates for
