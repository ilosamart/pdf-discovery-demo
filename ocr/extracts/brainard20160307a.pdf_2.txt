 This is a fitting moment to take stock of economic and financial developments, 

following a volatile start to the year.  I will begin by reviewing the outlook, then provide 

a brief recap of how financial market liquidity has fared, and finish by commenting on 

the resilience and resolvability of the large interconnected banks.1 

Outlook for the United States 

I am heartened by the continued strong progress on employment and the resilience 

of American consumers, which stand out against a considerably more challenging global 

backdrop.  I am pleased with the continued strength in the U.S. labor market, which is 

drawing people back into the labor force.  In February, the unemployment rate was 4.9 

percent--a level that is one-half its peak during the depths of the recession in 2009.  Last 

Friday, we learned that employment growth has averaged 223,000 per month over the 

past 12 months.  And there likely is some room to go:  The prime-age employment-to-

population ratio remains 1-3/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to the 

financial crisis, while a relatively large share of employees who are working part time 

would prefer to work full time.  In addition, wage growth remains relatively slow.  

Domestic activity continues to grow at a moderate pace.  The pace of consumer 

spending, after slowing some at the end of last year, looks to have picked up in January, 

and auto sales remained strong in February.  Over the past two years, consumption has 

increased at about a 3 percent pace, on average, and I expect to see growth to continue at 

close to this pace based on solid job and income growth--together with elevated readings
