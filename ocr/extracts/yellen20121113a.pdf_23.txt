Another alternative that deserves serious consideration would be for the 

Committee to provide an explanation of how the calendar date guidance included in the 

statement--currently mid-2015--relates to the outlook for the economy, which can and 

surely will change over time.  Going further, the Committee might eliminate the calendar 

date entirely and replace it with guidance on the economic conditions that would need to 

prevail before liftoff of the federal funds rate might be judged appropriate.  Several of my 

FOMC colleagues have advocated such an approach, and I am also strongly supportive.  

The idea is to define a zone of combinations of the unemployment rate and inflation 

within which the FOMC would continue to hold the federal funds rate in its current, near-

zero range.  For example, Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, suggests that the 

FOMC should commit to hold the federal funds rate in its current low range at least until 

unemployment has declined below 7 percent, provided that inflation over the medium 

term remains below 3 percent.  Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis 

Fed, suggests thresholds of 5.5 percent for unemployment and 2.25 percent for the 

medium-term inflation outlook.  Under such an approach, liftoff would not be automatic 

once a threshold is reached; that decision would require further Committee deliberation 

and judgment.   

I support this approach because it would enable the public to immediately adjust 

its expectations concerning the timing of liftoff in response to new information affecting 

the economic outlook.  This market response would serve as a kind of automatic 

stabilizer for the economy:  Information suggesting a weaker outlook would 

automatically induce market participants to push out the anticipated date of tightening 

and vice versa.
