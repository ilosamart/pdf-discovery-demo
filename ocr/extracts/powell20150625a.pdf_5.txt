But, before we reach the finish line, the task forces will have to wrestle with some 

tough issues related to payment security.  I would now like to talk about building a safer 

payment system.  I’ll start with two brief stories. 

First, let me take you back to the 1960s, when paper checks were the dominant 

noncash payment method and were sent by plane or truck to be cleared. A man walks into 

a bank with a payroll check.  A teller cashes the check. A few days later, the man returns. 

The teller recognizes him, and is happy to cash more checks. The checks are fraudulent, 

but the teller doesn’t know that.  The man knows that the string of numbers encoded on 

the bottom of the check determine the geographic area where the check will be drawn. So 

he creates a fake check with a routing number that will send that paper check across the 

country.  Because the teller recognizes the man when he comes back, the teller feels

of you will recognize that man as Frank Abagnale, former con artist and now a security 

consultant. 

Now, fast-forward 50 years to 2013.  A man walks up to an ATM with a prepaid 

debit card.  He types in a PIN and withdraws a large amount of cash.  But it’s not just one 

man:  there are many individuals doing the same thing at thousands of ATMs in dozens 

of countries.  The cards are counterfeit, but no one has detected that yet.  Over the course 

of ten hours, the individuals withdraw $40 million in cash.  How does this happen?  

Before the thieves walk up to the ATMs, hackers break into a payment processor’s 

database, steal a small number of prepaid card account numbers, and raise the cards’
