Prior to the financial crisis, because reserve balances outstanding averaged only 

around $25 billion, relatively minor variations in the total amount of reserves supplied by 

the Desk could move the equilibrium federal funds rate up or down.  With the nearly 

$3 trillion in excess reserves today, the traditional mechanism of adjustments in the 

quantity of reserve balances to achieve the desired level of the effective federal funds rate 

may well not be feasible or sufficiently predictable.   

As discussed in the FOMC’s statement on its Policy Normalization Principles and 

Plans, which was published following the September 2014 FOMC meeting, we will use 

the rate of interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) as our primary tool to move the federal 

funds rate into the target range.5  This action should encourage banks not to lend to any 

private counterparty at a rate lower than the rate they can earn on balances maintained at 

the Fed, which should put upward pressure on a range of short-term interest rates.   

Because not all institutions have access to the IOER rate, we will also use an 

overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, as needed.  In an ON RRP 

operation, eligible counterparties may invest funds with the Fed overnight at a given rate.  

The ON RRP counterparties include 106 money market funds, 22 broker-dealers, 24 

depository institutions, and 12 government-sponsored enterprises, including several 

Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Farmer Mac.  This facility 

should encourage these institutions to be unwilling to lend to private counterparties in 

money markets at a rate below that offered on overnight reverse repos by the Fed.
