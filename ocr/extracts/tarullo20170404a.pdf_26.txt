There are a couple of ways to respond to bank concerns without courting these dangers.  

One would be to add some granularity in the definition of asset categories subject to a specific 

loss function.  At times, some banks have felt that the breadth of certain categories of assets used 

by the supervisory model means there is a good bit of divergence in the risks associated with 

assets within the same category.  The other would be for the Federal Reserve to publish a set of 

hypothetical portfolios with the model-implied losses on these portfolios.  To that end, staff have 

been working on “control portfolio” level disclosures.  These would permit a fairly accurate 

inference of the expected losses on any given set of assets.  At the same time, they would not 

permit participants to game the models by scrutinizing them for the precise points where they 

were weakest.22   

Conclusion 

Much as I would have liked to touch upon important topics such as the need for credible 

resolution mechanisms for large banks and for adaptable regulatory processes to respond to new 

forms of shadow banking, I needed to be selective in drafting this speech.  I concentrated on 

capital regulation because it is the single most important element of prudential financial 

regulation.  The new features of G-SIB surcharges and stress testing help guard against a severe 

new financial crisis and contain the too-big-to-fail problem.  As proposals for regulatory change 

swirl about, it is crucial that the strong capital regime be maintained, especially as it applies to 

the most systemically important banks.  Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to 

                                                 
22 The negative effects of such a disclosure regime are exemplified by the now-infamous cutoff of many 
securitization programs at FICO scores of 620.  Because of the transparency of the pre-crisis models used by credit 
rating agencies, loan originators understood that by getting their riskiest borrowers to improve their credit scores to 
620, they could be included in various securitization programs.
