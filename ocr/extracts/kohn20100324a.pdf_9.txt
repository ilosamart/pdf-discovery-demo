monetarist tradition in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to 

the money supply to economic activity and inflation.  Other central banks and some of my 

colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have emphasized this channel in 

their discussions of the effect of policy at the zero lower bound.  According to these types of 

theories, extra reserves should induce banks to diversify into additional lending and purchases of 

securities, reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, and so should spark an 

increase in the money supply and spending.  To date, that channel does not seem to have been 

effective; interest rates on bank loans relative to the usual benchmarks have continued to rise, the 

quantity of bank loans is still falling rapidly, and money supply growth has been subdued.  

Banks’ behavior appears more consistent with the standard Keynesian model of the liquidity 

trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic when short-term interest rates 

approach zero.  But portfolio behavior of banks will shift as the economy and confidence 

recover, and we will need to watch and study this channel carefully.   

 Another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale 

purchases of longer-term assets on expectations about monetary policy.  The more we buy, the 

more reserves we will ultimately need to absorb and the more assets we will ultimately need to 

dispose of before the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of interbank markets, and the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet can return completely to normal.  As a consequence, these types 

of purchases can increase inflation expectations among some observers who may see a risk that 

we will not reduce reserves and raise interest rates in a timely fashion. 

 In fact, longer-term inflation expectations generally have been quite well anchored over 

the past few years of unusual Federal Reserve actions.  And we are developing and testing the 

tools we need to remove accommodative monetary policy when appropriate.  I am confident the
