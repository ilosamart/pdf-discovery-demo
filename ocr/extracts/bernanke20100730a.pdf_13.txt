The states have the opportunity to serve as role models for effective long-term 

fiscal planning.  Given the size of long-term obligations and the importance of meeting 

commitments to employees and the public, I donâ€™t think these problems can be solved 

simply through across-the-board cuts in existing state programs.  Instead, states should 

intensively review the effectiveness of all of their programs and be willing to make 

significant changes to deliver necessary services at lower cost.  This willingness to look 

for new solutions seems especially important in the case of health programs, where costs 

are growing the most quickly. 

Conclusion 

Today I have highlighted the challenges that state legislators face, both in the 

South and in other regions.  In the past few years, the weak economy has significantly 

reduced state and local government revenues, which in turn has forced difficult decisions 

on spending and taxes.  An improving economy should help, but state finances will 

remain under pressure for some time.  In the longer term, like the federal government, 

state governments must respond to the aging of the population and the seemingly 

inexorable rise in health-care costs.  These are daunting challenges indeed, but I believe 

we can find constructive ways to meet them, and I suspect that many of these solutions 

will be found at the state level.  Dealing with the fiscal challenges at all levels of 

government will be essential to ensuring that our resilient and dynamic economy delivers 

rising living standards to the citizens of your states and to our nation as a whole.
