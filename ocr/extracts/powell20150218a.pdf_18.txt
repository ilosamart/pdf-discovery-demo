core of the financial system, and whether the institutions to which activity migrates rely 

on funding that is stable and robust to fire sale dynamics.   

Conclusion 

To wrap up, I believe that sustaining financial stability requires supervisors to 

consider financial markets, in addition to financial institutions and infrastructure.  That is 

most obviously so when conditions threaten the safety and soundness of the financial 

system through leverage, liquidity transformation, or deterioration of credit underwriting 

or other risk-management standards.  At the same time, financial stability need not seek 

to eliminate all risks.  We need to learn, but not overlearn, the lessons of the crisis.  I 

believe there should be a high bar for “leaning against the credit cycle” in the absence of 

credible threats to the core or the reemergence of run-prone funding structures.  In my 

view, the Fed and other prudential and market regulators should resist interfering with the 

role of markets in allocating capital to issuers and risk to investors unless the case for 

doing so is strong and the available tools can achieve the objective in a targeted manner 

and with a high degree of confidence.
