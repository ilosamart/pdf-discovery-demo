While prevention will remain the preferred approach, realistically, resiliency and 

recovery will also need to be high-priorities.  Indeed, many firms have suggested that the 

distributed data storage concept has the potential to increase the level of resiliency and 

data integrity.  The basic idea is it should be harder to corrupt multiple copies of the same 

data simultaneously such that digital ledgers could reduce the vulnerability associated 

with a single point of failure.  We must press firms and experts to identify the strengths 

and vulnerabilities of this concept, even as we all look for ways to make databases more 

secure and resilient.  In an interesting development, some financial institutions have also 

begun to consider using distributed ledgers to back up critical databases and enable quick 

recovery from potentially virulent cyberattacks.  We will be interested in whether such 

techniques can make new contributions to cybersecurity.   

 Overall, the public needs to have confidence that any system employing 

distributed ledgers will operate properly, particularly in stressed conditions, and know 

that when adverse scenarios do occur, there will be robust management and governance 

to respond effectively.  Recent events, such as thefts from accounts on distributed ledger 

platforms, highlight the challenge that distributed ledgers may have when adverse 

scenarios occur and there is uncertainty around what an appropriate response would be.  

Such uncertainty around management and governance can raise doubts about the integrity 

of a system employing distributed ledgers. 

Traditionally, financial regulators in the United States have been given licensing 

authority as a key way of ensuring that responsibility for managing risks is transparently 

assigned with appropriate oversight.  The development of new business models
