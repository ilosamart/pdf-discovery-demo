Bernanke provided further details in a speech.6  On December 16, the program was 

formally launched by the FOMC.7  On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced that the 

program would be expanded by an additional $850 billion in purchases of agency MBS 

and agency debt and $300 billion in purchases of Treasury securities.  As is evident from 

the table, these announcements were generally associated with a substantial decline in the 

10-year Treasury yield and the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities 

(TIPS) as well as in rates on agency MBS and corporate debt.   

Turning now to the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve’s securities 

purchases, there are several distinct channels through which these purchases tend to 

influence aggregate demand, including a reduced cost of credit to consumers and 

businesses, a rise in asset prices that boosts household wealth and spending, and a 

moderate change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that provides support to net 

exports.  The quantitative magnitude of these effects can be gauged using a 

macroeconometric model such as FRB/US--one of the models developed and maintained 

by Board staff and used routinely in simulations of alternative economic scenarios.   

Figure 3 depicts the results of such a simulation exercise, as reported in a recent 

research paper by four Federal Reserve System economists.8  For illustrative purposes, 

the simulation imposes the assumption that the purchases of $600 billion in longer-term 

Treasury securities are completed within about a year, that the elevated level of securities
