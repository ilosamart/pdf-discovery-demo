While estimates of the natural rate from DSGE models provide some 

information needed for the proper conduct of monetary policy, these estimates 

are closely tied to the structure of the DSGE models, and essentially ignore 

the possibility of long-term structural changes in the balance between saving 

and investment.  As a result, an alternative longer-run concept, the equilibrium 

rate of interest, has also played an important role in recent policy discussions.  

Estimates of this concept, which follow a statistical approach introduced by 

Thomas Laubach and John Williams24, have also fallen to quite low levels. 

A priority for researchers in the field is to develop improved 

estimates of the long-run equilibrium interest rate, and to develop policies that 

can influence it.  In that regard, one should recognize that in a more complete 

model than the basic three equation model laid out above, the natural and 

long-run equilibrium interest rates would be functions of many variables, 

among them fiscal variables--with respect to both infrastructure spending and 

taxation.  In particular, faster trend growth would increase the long-run 

equilibrium interest rate, and what we need most, now that we are near full 

employment and approaching our target inflation rate, is faster potential 

growth.  The neo-Wicksellian and Woodfordian approach to macroeconomics 

is well suited also to study that problem, which is critical to the future of the 

United States and global economies.
