However, the expected benefits of additional stimulus from further expanding the Fed’s 

balance sheet would have to be weighed against potential risks and costs.  One risk of 

further balance sheet expansion arises from the fact that, lacking much experience with 

this option, we do not have very precise knowledge of the quantitative effect of changes 

in our holdings on financial conditions.  In particular, the impact of securities purchases 

may depend to some extent on the state of financial markets and the economy; for 

example, such purchases seem likely to have their largest effects during periods of 

economic and financial stress, when markets are less liquid and term premiums are 

unusually high.  The possibility that securities purchases would be most effective at times 

when they are most needed can be viewed as a positive feature of this tool.  However, 

uncertainty about the quantitative effect of securities purchases increases the difficulty of 

calibrating and communicating policy responses.   

Another concern associated with additional securities purchases is that substantial 

further expansions of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed’s 

ability to execute a smooth exit from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time.  

Even if unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might lead to an undesired increase in 

inflation expectations.  (Of course, if inflation expectations were too low, or even 

negative, an increase in inflation expectations could become a benefit.)  To mitigate this 

concern, the Federal Reserve has expended considerable effort in developing a suite of 

tools to ensure that the exit from highly accommodative policies can be smoothly 

accomplished when appropriate, and FOMC participants have spoken publicly about 

these tools on numerous occasions.  Indeed, by providing maximum clarity to the public 

about the methods by which the FOMC will exit its highly accommodative policy
