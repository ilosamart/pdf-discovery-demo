supported and reinforced by management action, and which are generally regarded as window 

dressing.  The identifiable norms may well differ within an organization, especially a large one 

in which different functions are performed in pursuit of overall organizational ends.   

Debates over the sources and nature of these norms are the stuff of the academic 

literature to which I referred a moment ago.  I will not attempt to synthesize this learning, much 

less to fashion my own theory.  Again, though, I think one can pragmatically note that these 

norms are shaped by both internal choices and external influences and constraints.   

For a private, profit-making corporation the most important internal choices are 

obviously made by management under the oversight of the board of directors.  However, the 

revealed preferences and choices of employees will also affect a firm’s culture.  For a financial 

institution, external influences and constraints include shareholders and market analysts, 

regulators, prosecutors, elected officials, the media, and the public.  Market conditions and the 

actions of competitors can also be significant.   

Nature of Risk Management 

Financial risk-taking is arguably the fundamental activity of financial intermediaries.1  

Unlike most non-financial firms, a financial institution more or less continually makes risk 

decisions, whose implications can vary significantly based on the nature of the asset involved, 

market conditions, counterparty identity, and many other factors.  The processes by which risk 

appetites are set and activity managed so as to conform to these risk appetite decisions are central 

to determining outcomes, and thus the firm’s near-term profitability and longer-term stability. 

For these reasons, there is considerable regulatory interest in these processes, an interest 

that has been formalized in the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 

                                                 
1 Intermediaries without sizeable balance sheets of their own, such as mutual funds, may not themselves be 

assuming risk, but they are creating it for their investors.
