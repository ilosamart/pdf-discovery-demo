between the recent changes in the unemployment rate and in real GDP relative to the 

predictions of Okun’s law (figure 8).  As illustrated by the position of the square labeled 

“2011” relative to the Okun’s law relationship, represented by the line, the decline in the 

unemployment rate over the course of 2011 was greater than would seem consistent with 

GDP growth over that period.  Indeed, with last year’s real GDP growth below 2 percent, 

less than what most economists would estimate to be the U.S. economy’s potential rate of 

growth, one might have expected little change in the unemployment rate last year or even 

a slight increase.  What is this confluence of the significant decline in the unemployment 

rate and the modest recent increase in real GDP telling us about the state of the economy, 

and how will the Okun’s law puzzle be resolved?  

The apparent failure of Okun’s law could reflect, in part, statistical noise.  For 

example, it may be that future data revisions will show that real GDP grew more quickly 

over the past year than currently estimated.  However, although it is certainly possible 

that revised data will ultimately explain part of the puzzle, at this point we have no 

specific evidence suggesting that such a revision might be in the offing.  For example, 

gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity constructed using 

source data that are mostly different from the data used in estimating GDP, provides 

some check on the information provided by the better-known GDP measure.  However, 

gross domestic income is currently estimated to have increased less quickly than GDP in 

2011 and so does not point to an explanation of the drop in the unemployment rate.  

Another logical possibility is that the decline in the unemployment rate could be 

overstating the improvement in the job market.  For example, potential workers could be 

giving up on looking for work to an unusual extent.  Because a person has to be either
