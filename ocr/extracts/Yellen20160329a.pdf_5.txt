the drag coming from abroad.  Looking forward however, we have to take into account 

the potential fallout from recent global economic and financial developments, which have 

been marked by bouts of turbulence since the turn of the year.  For a time, equity prices 

were down sharply, oil traded at less than $30 per barrel, and many currencies were 

depreciating against the dollar.  Although prices in these markets have since largely 

returned to where they stood at the start of the year, in other respects economic and 

financial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time of the December 

FOMC meeting.  In particular, foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker 

this year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined.  By 

themselves, these developments would tend to restrain U.S. economic activity.  But those 

effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations 

for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer-term interest 

rates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support spending.  For these reasons, I 

anticipate that the overall fallout for the U.S. economy from global market developments 

since the start of the year will most likely be limited, although this assessment is subject 

to considerable uncertainty. 

All told, the Committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the 

medium term accompanied by further labor market improvement.  Consistent with this 

assessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth, 

unemployment, and inflation made by all of the FOMC participants for our March 

meeting are little changed from December.2  A key factor underlying such modest

point and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the 
longer run were unrevised.  The median projection for the unemployment rate in late 2016 was unrevised, 
while the projections for late 2017, late 2018, and the longer run were revised down slightly.  Finally,
