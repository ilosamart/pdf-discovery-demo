The Federal Reserve is also considering other steps.  First, we are developing an 

interpretation of our rules in connection with the movement of some centrally cleared derivatives 

to a “settled-to-market” approach.  Under this approach, daily variation margin is treated as a 

settlement payment rather than as posting collateral.  Under our capital rules, this approach 

reduces the need for a bank to hold capital against these exposures under risk-based and 

supplementary leverage ratios.  Second, we are also working to move from the “current exposure 

method” of assessing counterparty credit risk on derivative exposures to the standardized 

approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR).  The current exposure method generally treats 

potential future credit exposures on derivatives as a fixed percentage of the notional amount, 

which ignores whether a derivative is margined and undervalues netting benefits.  SA-CCR is a 

more risk-sensitive measurement of exposure, which would appropriately recognize the 

counterparty risks on derivatives, including the lower risks on most centrally cleared derivatives.  


Central Clearing and Liquidity 

CCPs are different from most other financial intermediaries in the sense that the CCP 

stands between two parties to a cleared transaction whose payment obligations exactly offset 

each other.   A CCP faces market or credit risk only in the event that one of its members defaults 

and its required initial margin or other pre-funded financial resources are insufficient to cover 

any adverse price swings that occur during the period between the time of default and the time 

that the CCP is able to liquidate the defaulting party’s positions. 

However, like most other financial intermediaries, CCPs do face liquidity risks.  Their 

business model is based on timely payments and the ability to quickly convert either the
