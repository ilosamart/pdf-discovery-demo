Good afternoon.  I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the 

Rockefeller Institute for inviting me to participate in this important discussion of distressed 

residential real estate.   

The boom and bust in housing that is a hallmark of the recent economic cycle has 

resulted in an unprecedented volume of foreclosures that has, in turn, left us with an 

extraordinary level of vacant and distressed properties.  Even after the official end of the 

recession, home sales and house prices continued to decline for several years, and residential 

investment languished.1 All of this has resulted in a slow recovery in housing, which is one of 

the primary reasons why our overall economic recovery has been so sluggish.  In order to see the 

robust economic recovery we all want, we need to deal effectively with the large volume of 

vacant and distressed properties throughout the country. 

Our housing crisis has many dimensions and will require a full spectrum of policy actions 

to restore health to the housing market, our economy, and most importantly, to neighborhoods 

and communities across the country.  The Federal Reserve System has been active in studying 

various aspects of the crisis, bringing together community leaders and market participants to 

share experiences in forums such as this, and using data to identify areas of particular need.  I 

have spoken in the past about credit availability, preventing foreclosures, converting foreclosed 

properties to rental properties, and strategies for neighborhood stabilization.  Today, I would like 

to focus on the problems posed by an elevated level of vacant properties.  I plan to draw on 

research conducted by Federal Reserve Board staff and would especially like to thank Raven 

Molloy, an economist in our macroeconomic analysis group, for her work in this area.

                                                 
1 In the two years after the end of the most recent recession (Q2:2009), existing home sales rose only 4 percent, 
house prices fell by 4 percent, according to the CoreLogic price index, and residential investment averaged only 2Â½ 
percent of gross domestic product (GDP)--half of the average GDP between 1949 and 2006.
