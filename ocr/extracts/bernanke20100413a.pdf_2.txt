 It is a distinct pleasure to visit with the National Bankers Association Foundation 

this evening.  I am very pleased to be among your honorees.  The foundation does 

important work, including helping consumers make wise financial choices, connecting 

the “unbanked” with mainstream providers of financial services, and providing assistance 

and support to minority bankers and entrepreneurs.   

 April is Financial Literacy Month, and so it is fitting that you are hosting this 

event.  I note that you also plan to hold a Financial Literacy Summit later this year on the 

Howard University campus.  The summit will bring scholars, bankers, community 

activists, and others together to brainstorm strategies for educating consumers of financial 

products. 

  Many American families are struggling in the aftermath of the financial crisis, 

which reinforces the need for reliable and useful information to facilitate good financial 

choices.  Helping people better understand how to borrow and save wisely and how to 

build personal wealth is one of the best things we can do to improve the well-being of 

families and communities.  The foundation is making great contributions to this effort, 

for example, through your online library of personal finance educational materials.1 

 The Federal Reserve very much shares your abiding interest in helping consumers 

successfully navigate the financial marketplace.  Our approach is two-pronged.  First, we 

work actively to foster financial and economic education.  Second, recognizing that basic 

financial knowledge is not sufficient to keep people safe from fraud and deceptive 

practices, we are committed to developing and enforcing strong rules to protect 

consumers.
