government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal.  The applied research built 

on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future.7  

Consequently, the decline in government-funded R&D is disturbing. 

To raise productivity and economic well-being, firms must adopt innovations that 

emerge from R&D as quickly as possible.  This adjustment may occur as start-ups 

introduce innovation to the market, as existing innovative firms expand, or as competing 

firms imitate the innovators.  Recent research suggests that all three of these channels, 

which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses, have been operating sluggishly of 

late:  New firms are not created as often as in the past, innovative firms are not hiring or 

investing as aggressively as they once did, and the diffusion of innovations is weak from 

frontier firms to trailing firms.8   

It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in 

dynamism.  Broadly speaking, however, government policymakers should carefully 

consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers, capital, and 

ideas. 

Investment 

In recent years, the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has 

declined.  Business fixed investment rose roughly 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, 

from 2004 to 2016, compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003.9  Some bright 

                                                 
7  Mohnen and Hall (2013) survey the empirical literature pointing to a link between R&D and 
productivity. 
8 Decker and others (2016) highlight the decline in entrepreneurship and worker mobility; Andrews, 
Criscuolo, and Gal (2015) emphasizes that productivity for firms at the global frontier continues to advance 
rapidly even as global aggregate productivity growth has slowed. 
9 Pinto and Tevlin (2014) note that in the context of a long-run growth model, a slow pace of investment is 
not surprising in light of the slow growth in effective labor inputs--which equals the sum of labor quality 
and total factor productivity growth.  Fernald and others (2017) raise a related point--the ratio of capital to
