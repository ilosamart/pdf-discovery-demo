women who protect the security of our country are themselves protected from predatory 

lending and other abusive financial practices.  I will also share a few thoughts about what 

each of you can do to give yourself the best shot at a promising financial future. 

Federal Reserve Efforts to Improve the Economy’s Performance 

 At the Federal Reserve, we are working hard--both as central bankers and as 

financial regulators--to help restore our nation’s prosperity.  In 2008 and early 2009, the 

world suffered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis which, had it 

been left unchecked, would have resulted in a global financial meltdown and an 

economic collapse.  Working with policymakers around the world, the Federal Reserve 

acted creatively and forcefully to help stabilize the financial system and halt the 

economic slide.  Our economy has been growing and adding jobs for more than two years 

now.  But for a lot of people, I know, it doesn’t feel like the recession ever ended.  The 

unemployment rate remains painfully high, and more than two-fifths of the unemployed 

have been out of work for longer than six months, by far the highest ratio since World 

War II.  These problems are very serious, and we at the Federal Reserve have been 

focusing intently on supporting job creation.  Supporting job creation is half of our 

marching orders, so to speak; the other half is controlling inflation.  Or, in the language 

of the law that sets the mandate for monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is required to 

seek both maximum employment and price stability.   

We pursue those two important goals by influencing the level of interest rates and 

other financial conditions.  My colleagues and I on the Federal Reserve’s monetary 

policymaking committee equate price stability with inflation being at 2 percent or a little 

less.  That rate is low enough that people and businesses can make financial decisions
