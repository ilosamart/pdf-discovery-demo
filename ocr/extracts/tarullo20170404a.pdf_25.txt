correlations in asset holdings among the larger banks--a trend that increases systemic risk, since 

everyone will be exposed should those asset classes suffer reversals.20 

Releasing the computer code used in the model projections would repeat a serious error 

made a quarter century ago.  In 1992, Congress established revised capital standards for the 

Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 

Corporation (Freddie Mac), the centerpiece of which was a stress test.  However, for reasons that 

foreshadowed many of the arguments adduced today, all the details of the model were made 

public and any changes went through the standard notice and comment process.  As a result, the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and the public clearly understood the model.  With the 

model in the hands of the GSEs, even a scenario of the severity of the 2006 to 2008 experience 

produced only mild losses for them.  Of course, this result stands in stark contrast to the actual 

losses, which were sufficient to drive them into conservatorship in September 2008.     

In short, we should recognize that what might appear to be a reasonable transparency 

measure in publishing the models will in fact result in less protection for the financial system.  

Thus, if the model were to be published, I would suggest that the minimum required capital 

levels would need to be materially increased in order to take account of the dynamics I just 

described.21 

                                                 
20 Incentives toward greater asset correlations can be a concern even with a non-disclosed supervisory stress test 
model, since banks can approximate relevant risk loss functions based on their experience and observation of 
supervisory results.  That is why the stress test and scenarios need to be regularly modified to take account of 
changing risks and correlations.  It is also another reason why development of macroprudential features of the stress 
test is important.  Finally, it is a reason to continue to require firms to conduct their own internal stress tests. 
21 Some have also suggested that the stress tests have caused banks to change the way they allocate credit to various 
types of borrowers.  At one level, this could be said of any risk-based capital standard including the old Basel I 
standards.  However, this criticism fundamentally mischaracterizes the nature and purpose of stress tests, which is to 
determine whether a bank can remain a going concern and continue to make loans through a severe recession, like 
the one we experienced from 2007 to 2009.  To achieve these goals, the Federal Reserveâ€™s projections of stressed 
losses are highly sensitive to the full range of risks posed by the underlying assets, especially the risk that the asset 
will perform poorly during a downturn.  The standard in stress testing is therefore whether lending practices are 
sustainable during tough times or not, as was the case in the 2007 to 2009 recession and other credit crises.
