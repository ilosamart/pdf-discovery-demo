V.B. Firm-level SCAP Buffers 

As shown in table 3, for 9 of the 19 BHCs, the indicated SCAP buffer is zero. That is, existing 

capital, including that provided by the U.S. Treasury, and estimated resources that will be available to 

cover estimated losses in the more adverse scenario are sufficient for the firms to meet the 4 percent 

Tier 1 Common capital and 6 percent Tier 1 capital ratios without any additional capital or changes to 

the composition of capital. Nonetheless, most of these firms have taken actions since year-end 2008 to 

strengthen their capital positions, as illustrated in the "capital actions" row of table 3. 

For 10 of the participating BHCs, supervisors expect these firms to raise additional capital or 

change the composition of their capital. As noted above, much of this need is for additional Tier 1 

Common. For all of these firms, a raise of new common equity of the amount indicated would be 

sufficient to ensure they will also have at least a 6 percent Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2010. The ratio of 

the indicated SCAP buffer to risk-weighted assets for these 10 firms ranges f rom 0.9 percent to 9.3 

percent at year-end 2008. After considering Q1 2009 operating performance and capital actions for 

these firms, the SCAP buffer to risk-weighted assets ranges f rom 0.6 percent to 6.6 percent.
