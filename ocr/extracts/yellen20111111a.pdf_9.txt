financial market perceptions of the risk such a firm could impose on the broader financial 

system were it to become stressed.  Such measures are based on firms’ stock prices, 

credit default swap premiums, and stock price volatility, as well as the correlation in asset 

prices across firms.    

In addition, we use regular stress tests of the nation’s largest banking 

organizations to evaluate the ability of these firms to withstand worse-than-expected 

outcomes for the economy.  These tests are based on detailed confidential data about the 

balance sheets of the large banks and provide a comprehensive and rigorous assessment 

of how their financial conditions would evolve over a multiyear period if economic and 

financial conditions were to deteriorate.  The stress tests started in 2009 with the 

Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), and they continued with the 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) in late 2010 and early 2011, in 

which we evaluated the capital planning processes of the firms and responded to requests 

to resume or increase shareholder payouts. 

In a couple of weeks, we will begin CCAR 2012, building on the previous CCAR, 

and roughly a year from now, we will conduct the annual supervisory stress tests 

mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank tests will involve a larger group of 

banking organizations than the 19 firms covered in the SCAP and will be extended to 

include any financial institution the FSOC designates as systemically important.  As 

additional data are collected on significant credit exposures, stress tests may evolve into 

an effective way to identify linkages across systemically important institutions that could 

lead them to fall into financial distress at the same time.
