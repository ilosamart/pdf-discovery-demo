For example, mortgage originators appear to be reluctant to extend credit to some 

potential borrowers who could meet the underwriting standards currently set by the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  Indeed, fewer than half of lenders are 

offering mortgages to borrowers with a FICO score of 620 and a down payment of 

10 percent, even though such loans could be within the GSE purchase parameters.

  A 

number of possibilities could explain this reluctance to lend.  In some cases, borrowers 

cannot obtain private mortgage insurance required by the GSEs.  Thus, the weakened 

finances of private mortgage insurers could be damping mortgage credit availability for 

some potential borrowers.  In other cases, lenders may be concerned about high servicing 

costs if mortgages become delinquent.  Another set of concerns relates to so-called 

representations and warranties, which are contractual commitments by an originator 

concerning the quality of the loan.  These contracts were designed to protect the GSEs or 

other purchasers of loans, but originators appear uncertain about how they will be 

enforced going forward and thus have been very cautious about making loans that could 

be viewed as less than perfect from an underwriting perspective.  Learning from our 

experience with securitizations over the past decade, lenders and regulators alike should 

look carefully at rules and practices that may unduly diminish the origination of 

prudently underwritten mortgages. 

Another reason for tight lending standards is that private-label mortgage 

securitizations have virtually disappeared.  The difficulty of funding loans in the private-

label securitization market may have discouraged lenders from originating loans to some

 FICO scores are based on information that a credit bureau (for example, Experian, TransUnion, and 

Equifax) keeps on an individual.  The higher the score, which ranges from 300 to 850, the lower the credit 

risk.  Credit scores are used to inform lenders when they assess an individual’s credit risk.  See Board of 

Governors, “The U.S. Housing Market,” p. 6 (see note 1).
