Reserve Banks also played key roles in providing public information in their Districts, 

through programs, publications, speeches, and other media.  

The crisis has passed, but I think the Fed’s need to educate and explain will only

financial news channels on cable TV, no Bloomberg screens, no blogs, no Twitter.  

Today, news, ideas, and rumors circulate almost instantaneously.  The Fed must continue

As I have observed on other occasions, the crisis bore a strong family resemblance to a 

classic financial panic, except that it took place in the complex environment of the 21st 

century global financial system.5  Likewise, the tools used to fight the panic, though 

adapted to the modern context, were analogous to those that would have been used a 

century ago, including liquidity provision by the central bank, liability guarantees, 

recapitalization, and the provision of assurances and information to the public. 

The immediate trigger of the crisis, as you know, was a sharp decline in house 

prices, which reversed a previous run-up that had been fueled by irresponsible mortgage 

lending and securitization practices.  Policymakers at the time, including myself, 

certainly appreciated that house prices might decline, although we disagreed about how 

much decline was likely; indeed, prices were already moving down when I took office in 

2006.  However, to a significant extent, our expectations about the possible
