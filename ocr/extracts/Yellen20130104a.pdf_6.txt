The Economics of Interconnectedness and Systemic Risk 

Academic research that explores the relationship between network structure and 

systemic risk is relatively new.  Not surprisingly, interest in this field has increased 

considerably since the financial crisis.  A search of economics research focusing on 

“systemic risk” or “interconnectedness” since 2007 yields 624 publications, twice as 

many as were produced in the previous 25 years.

  That’s not to say that economists were 

blind to the importance of networks before the financial crisis.  In 2000, Franklin Allen 

and Douglas Gale, for example, developed an important model of financial networks that 

provides insight into how networks can influence systemic risk.

In the model studied by Allen and Gale, systemic risk arises through liquidity 

shocks that can have a domino effect, causing a problem at one bank to spread to others, 

potentially leading to failures throughout the system.  In their model, interbank deposits 

are a primary mechanism for the transmission of liquidity shocks from one bank to 

another.  Allen and Gale compare two canonical network structures:  a “complete” 

network, in which all banks lend to and borrow from all other banks, and an “incomplete” 

network, in which each bank borrows from only one neighbor and lends to only one other 

neighbor.  Figure 2, panel A, presents an example of a complete network, and figure 2, 

panel B, an example of an incomplete network.  

In the case of the complete network, banks benefit from diversified funding 

streams.  A liquidity shock at one bank is less likely to cause the bankruptcy of another

 A search for either “interconnectedness” or “systemic risk” in article abstracts of academic research 

cataloged by EconLit results in 311 entries from 1988 to 2006.  The same search conducted for the period 

from 2007 through the present yields 624 entries.  Restricting the search to articles that have appeared in 

peer-reviewed journals reduces the number of entries between 1988 and 2006 to 186 and the number of 

entries between 2007 and the present to 375.
