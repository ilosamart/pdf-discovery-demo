Importantly, resource utilization rates have been so low since late 2008 that a 

variety of simple rules have been calling for a federal funds rate substantially below zero, 

which of course is not possible.  Consequently, the actual setting of the target funds rate 

has been persistently tighter than such rules would have recommended.  The FOMC’s 

unconventional policy actions--including our large-scale asset purchase programs--have 

surely helped fill this “policy gap” but, in my judgment, have not entirely compensated 

for the zero-bound constraint on conventional policy.  In effect, there has been a 

significant shortfall in the overall amount of monetary policy stimulus since early 2009 

relative to the prescriptions of the simple rules that I’ve described.   

Analysis by some of my Federal Reserve colleagues suggests that monetary 

policy can produce better economic outcomes if it commits to making up for at least 

some portion of the cumulative shortfall created by the zero lower bound--namely, by 

maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for longer than a simple rule would 

otherwise prescribe.

  This consideration is one important reason that the optimal control 

simulation generates a more accommodative path than the Taylor (1999) rule. 

Risk-management considerations strengthen the case for maintaining a highly 

accommodative policy stance longer than might otherwise be considered appropriate.  In 

particular, the FOMC has considerable latitude to withdraw policy accommodation if the 

economic recovery were to proceed much faster than expected or if inflation were to 

come in higher.  In contrast, if the recovery faltered or inflation drifted down, the 

Committee could provide additional stimulus using its unconventional tools, but doing so 

involves costs and risks.  Given the unprecedented nature of the current economic
