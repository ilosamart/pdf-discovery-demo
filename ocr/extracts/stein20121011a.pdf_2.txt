It’s a pleasure to be here at Brookings.  And it’s a special thrill and honor for me 

to be here alongside Don Kohn.  One of my only regrets about coming to the Fed is my 

timing.  I wish I had had the good fortune to arrive a few years earlier, so I could have 

had the privilege of being Don’s colleague, and of learning from him.  Now I can only do 

so indirectly.  Several of the best bits of advice I’ve gotten since joining the Board have 

been preceded by words like:  “Here’s what Don Kohn would have done in this 

situation….”  So Don, thank you, and I look forward to our discussion. 

I’d like to take this opportunity to describe the framework I have been using to 

think about monetary policy in the current environment, focusing primarily on the role of 

large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs).  But before doing so, please note the usual 

disclaimer:  The thoughts that follow are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the 

views of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

There is a considerable diversity of views within the FOMC, and among 

economists more generally, about the use of LSAPs and other nonconventional policy 

tools.  This diversity is both inevitable and healthy given the unprecedented 

circumstances in which we find ourselves.  To be clear on where I stand, I support the 

Committee’s decision of last month--namely, to initiate purchases of mortgage-backed 

securities (MBS) at a rate of $40 billion per month, in tandem with the ongoing maturity 

extension program (MEP) in Treasury securities, and to plan to continue with asset 

purchases if the Committee does not observe a substantial improvement in the outlook for 

the labor market.  Given where we are, and what we know, I firmly believe that this 

decision was the right one.
