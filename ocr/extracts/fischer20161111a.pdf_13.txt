spreads, especially if their central banks were called on to tighten monetary policy to 

keep inflation at bay.  

While such uncertainty is a constant feature of the landscape we confront as 

policymakers, both the U.S. and global economies will be served best if we keep our own 

houses in order and ensure that policy rates are adjusted as appropriate to achieve our 

inflation and employment objectives.  In my view, the prospects of a continued steady 

expansion in the U.S. economy are maximized to the extent that we proceed with a 

gradual removal of accommodation.  Such a gradual approach to tightening policy will 

also help mitigate the risk of undesirable spillovers abroad--including by reducing the 

risk of having to tighten more abruptly later on--and in turn promote a stronger global 

economy.
