SCB approach promotes an important macroprudential aim, since the surcharges are calibrated to 

force large, interconnected banks to internalize the additional costs their distress would impose 

on the financial system.  The surcharges are thus at least a partial surrogate for inclusion of 

various macroprudential features in the stress test.  

We are also considering a couple of relatively modest revisions we are considering to the 

Board’s “Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing”16 that are 

motivated by the macroprudential consideration of reducing procyclicality.  The first would be to 

make the severity of the change in the unemployment rate less severe during downturns.  The 

second would be to replace the current judgmental approach to setting the hypothesized path of 

house prices by tying this variable to disposable personal income.  The result would be a more 

countercyclical path of house prices and increased transparency into how we determine the 

severity of this very important element of the scenario.  

 Beyond these steps, we heard many ideas during our review on how we might pursue our 

macroprudential objective by adding new features to the stress test, especially from official 

sector representatives and academics.  We also reviewed the growing academic literature on this 

topic.  We concluded that, to this point, even the most conceptually promising of the ideas are a 

good ways from being realized in specific and well-supported elements of our economic models.  

Many macroprudential risks involve the spread of stress from one firm or market to others.  As 

such, macroprudential elements of stress tests often must estimate not just first-round losses, but 

also the knock-on effects, which depend significantly on the vulnerabilities and responses of all 

other major actors in the financial system, including many that we do not regulate.  Modelling
