want to see inflation coming in around target on a sustained basis after seven years of 

below-target readings.  

As I have noted before, the persistence of subdued inflation, despite an 

unemployment rate that has moved below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests 

some risk that underlying inflation--the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and 

price setting--may have softened.5  For example, some survey measures of longer-run 

inflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are 

most estimates based on statistical filters.  Inflation compensation has moved up recently 

but is still running somewhat below levels that prevailed before the crisis.   

Re-anchoring underlying inflation at the Federal Open Market Committee’s 

(FOMC) 2 percent objective is an important goal.  Recent research has highlighted the 

downside risks to inflation and inflation expectations that are posed by the effective 

lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it underscores the importance of ensuring 

underlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s new normal.6  In that regard, if 

we were to see a mild, temporary overshoot of the inflation target, this could well be 

consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and may help nudge underlying 

inflation back to target.7   

In short, it is reassuring to see core PCE inflation moving up, along with market-

based measures of inflation compensation retracing earlier declines.  After seven years of 

below-target inflation, it will be important to see inflation coming in around target on a 

sustained basis to be confident that underlying trend inflation is running at 2 percent.
