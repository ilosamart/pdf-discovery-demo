I look forward to the day when we have moved far beyond all the firsts, when we can see 

with satisfaction that the people of the Federal Reserve fully reflect the characteristics of 

the American people. We are working hard to get there, but we still have a long way to 

go. 

Of course, getting to that point in the future starts with people like you and the 

paths you choose today.  You should choose the path where you feel you will make your 

greatest contribution--the one that is right for you.  But if economics seems like a great 

fit, then choose it with the confidence that you have the capacity to make an important 

contribution that will be valued.    

So with that, I will be glad to respond to your questions.
