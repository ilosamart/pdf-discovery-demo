First, we have greatly increased our macroprudential oversight, with a particular 

focus on potential systemic vulnerabilities, including buildups of leverage and unstable 

funding patterns as well as interest rate risk.

  Under the umbrella of our 

interdisciplinary Large Institutions Supervision Coordinating Committee, we pay special 

attention to developments at the largest, most complex financial firms, making use of 

information gathered in our supervision of the institutions and drawn from financial 

market indicators of their health and systemic vulnerability.  We also monitor the shadow 

banking sector, especially its interaction with regulated institutions; in this work, we look 

for factors that may leave the system vulnerable to an adverse “fire sale” dynamic, in 

which declining asset values could force leveraged investors to sell assets, depressing 

prices further.  We exchange information regularly with other regulatory agencies, both 

directly and under the auspices of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Throughout 

the Federal Reserve System, work in these areas is conducted by experts in banking, 

financial markets, monetary policy, and other disciplines, and at the Federal Reserve 

Board we have established our Office for Financial Stability Policy and Research to help 

coordinate this work.  Findings are presented regularly to the Board and to the FOMC for 

use in its monetary policy deliberations. 

Second, recognizing that our monitoring of the financial sector will always be 

imperfect, we are using regulatory and supervisory tools to help ensure that financial 

institutions are sufficiently resilient to weather losses and periods of market turmoil 

arising from any source.  Indeed, reflecting expectations embodied in the new Basel III 

and Dodd-Frank standards, the largest and most complex financial firms have 

substantially increased both their capital and their liquidity in recent years.  Our current
