One additional challenge of the proposed framework is specifying a path for the 

policy rate immediately following liftoff that smoothly and gradually eases inflation back 

down to target and facilitates a gradual adjustment of the labor market.  In the proposed 

framework, once the cumulative average rate of inflation during the lower-bound period 

has reached the target of 2 percent, policy would revert to a standard policy rule.11  This 

implies that a standard policy rule would kick in at a point when inflation is above target 

and the economy is at or beyond full employment.  Even with a smoothing (inertial) 

property, a standard policy rule could result in a relatively sharp path of tightening, and 

the anticipation of the steep post-liftoff rate path itself could undo some of the benefits 

associated with the framework.  Thus, there would likely need to be a transitional 

framework to guide policy initially post-liftoff that might make both communications and 

policy somewhat more complicated. 

Integrating the Policy Rate and the Balance Sheet 

The temporary price-level targeting framework proposed by Bernanke is 

appealing on a conceptual level because it proposes a simple and clear mechanism to help 

policymakers deal with the challenges posed by the lower bound on the policy rate in an 

environment of uncertainty.  The reality is more complicated, however, especially if, as 

the paper suggests, many central banks in advanced economies are likely to operate with 

an additional tool when the policy rate is constrained.  In the paper, Bernanke cites Chair 

Yellenâ€™s 2016 Jackson Hole speech, which suggests that in a recession, the FOMC could 

be expected to turn to large-scale asset purchases as well as forward guidance after the 

federal funds rate is lowered to zero.12
