a broad range of reforms to mitigate systemic risk.

  With respect to the large financial 

institutions that it supervises, the Federal Reserve is using a variety of supervisory tools 

to assess their exposure to, and proper management of, interest rate risk.   

To the extent that investors are reaching for yield, I see the low interest rate 

environment and not the FOMC’s asset purchases, per se, as a contributing factor.  It is 

true that asset purchases put downward pressure on the term premium component of 

longer-term rates, and that discontinuing purchases would likely cause term premiums to 

rise.  But ending asset purchases before observing a substantial improvement in the labor 

market might also create expectations that the amount of accommodation provided would 

not be sufficient to sustain the improvement in the economy.  This weakening in the 

economic outlook might bring down the expected path of the federal funds rate, with the 

result that longer-term interest rates might not rise appreciably, on net.  Moreover, a 

weakening of the economic environment could also create significant financial stability 

risks.  That said, financial stability concerns, to my mind, are the most important potential 

cost associated with the current stance of monetary policy.   

Conclusion 

In these remarks, I have reviewed recent FOMC policy actions--actions I have 

supported because I believe they will help foster a stronger recovery and keep inflation 

close to the Committee’s longer-run target.  I recognize that the Federal Reserve’s highly 

accommodative policy entails some costs and risks.  It will be important both to monitor 

them and to continue strengthening our financial system. 

However, insufficiently forceful action to achieve our dual mandate also entails 

costs and risks.  There is the high cost that unemployed workers and their families are
