Meanwhile, the FOMC has continued to enhance its communication about how it 

would use the federal funds rate to return inflation and unemployment to its longer-run 

objectives.  Last December, the Committee replaced its calendar guidance for the federal 

funds rate with quantitative measures of economic conditions that would warrant 

continuing that rate at its current very low level.  Specifically, the Committee said it 

anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate “at 

least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between 

one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the 

Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue 

to be well anchored.”12   

I consider these thresholds for possible action a major improvement in forward 

guidance.  They provide much more information than before about the conditions that are 

likely to prevail when the FOMC decides to raise the federal funds rate.  As for the date 

at which tightening of monetary policy is likely to occur, market participants, armed with 

this new information about the Committee’s “reaction function,” can form their own 

judgment and alter their expectations on timing as new information accrues over time.   

These thresholds will, as a consequence, allow private-sector expectations of the 

federal funds rate to fulfill an important “automatic stabilizer” function for the economy.  

If the recovery is stronger than expected, the public should anticipate that one or both of 

the threshold values will be crossed sooner and, hence, that the federal funds rate could 

be raised earlier.  Conversely, if the outlook for the economy unexpectedly worsens, the
