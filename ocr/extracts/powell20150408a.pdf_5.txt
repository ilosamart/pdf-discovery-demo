All else equal, a decision to return interest rates to more-normal levels implies 

that the economy is nearing its capacity.  The financial crisis did significant damage to 

the productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent, and 

duration that cannot be fully known today.  Given this uncertainty, it is even more 

difficult than usual to assess how much slack remains.  It seems plausible that at least part 

of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained 

growth.4  To encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing 

accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are 

tightening or other supply-side constraints are binding.  Of course, if the effects of the 

crisis prove difficult to reverse and, as a result, inflation pressures do emerge, the Federal 

Reserve will use its tools to contain them. 

Let us take a brief look at the implications of severe financial crises for economies 

generally.  Studies document that severe financial crises around the world have typically 

left behind large and sustained reductions in the level of output.5  The recent crisis is no 

exception, and figure 1 shows such an effect for the U.S., U.K., euro-area and Canadian
