which is just below 3 percent.  By these estimates, the longer-run neutral rate has fallen 

considerably from the estimated range in earlier decades of 4 to 5 percent.8  

Turning to the shorter-run neutral rate, although the estimates are model 

dependent and uncertain, we can make some general inferences about its recent evolution 

that are largely independent of the details of specific models.9  Estimates suggest the 

shorter-run neutral rate tends to be cyclical, falling in recessions and rising during 

expansions, and our current expansion appears to be no exception.10   

Last year, the unemployment rate returned to pre-crisis levels, which required real 

interest rates that were below zero for nearly 10 years.11  This year, the unemployment 

rate has fallen further, and job market gains have gathered strength, at the same time that 

the federal funds rate has increased.  This combination suggests that the short-run neutral 

interest rate likely has also increased.  If, instead, the neutral rate had remained constant 

as the federal funds rate increased, we would have expected to see labor market gains 

slow.  That inference is consistent with the formal model estimates, which indicate that 

the shorter-run neutral rate has gone up as the expansion has advanced.  This is also 

suggested by the observation that overall financial conditions, as measured by a variety of 

indexes, have remained quite accommodative during a period when the federal funds rate 

has been moving higher.   

In the latest FOMC SEP median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds 

rate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a 

                                                   
8 A variety of hypotheses have been advanced to explain this decline, including slower labor force growth, 
slower productivity growth, and an increase in savings propensities.  See Kiley (2015) and Brainard (2015).
