greater than expected.  In response to the drop in oil prices, drilling activity is reported to 

have fallen at an annual rate of nearly 50 percent in the first quarter, and data on drilling 

rigs in operation suggest another large decline this quarter.   

At the same time, the dollar’s rise is reducing net exports, and perhaps restraining 

investment in areas sensitive to foreign demand, with greater force than anticipated. Net 

exports subtracted 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter and a 

whopping 1.9 percentage points in the first quarter.  This large decline likely reflects 

more than exchange rate appreciation alone, but some drag on net exports from exchange 

rate appreciation is likely to persist.  Indicators of business equipment spending--such as 

orders and shipments of capital goods, as well as business sentiment--have also been 

weak, suggesting that overall business investment will change little over the first half of 

the year.   

Other indicators also suggest a negative effect on manufacturing activity from 

foreign headwinds.  The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) national manufacturing 

diffusion index of new export orders has been in contractionary or neutral territory for 

four of the past five months.  Manufacturing production declined at an annual rate of 

1 percent in the first quarter, and the outlook for internationally oriented firms has 

worsened appreciably recently.  

Of course, there is a danger in reading too much into these data.  Indicators, such 

as the ISM’s nonmanufacturing composite index, suggest that activity has remained solid 

in the private services sector, which accounts for the bulk of economic activity.  It is 

possible that we will soon see the stronger trend in domestic economic activity that was
