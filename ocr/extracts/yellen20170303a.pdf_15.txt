the income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007, 

whereas families at the 90th percentile earned about 4 percent more.  In addition, the 

economic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics, while improved since the depths of the 

recession, remain worse, on average, that those of whites or Asians. 

 These unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that 

lie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy.  Monetary policy cannot, for 

instance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would 

boost real GDP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income 

inequality.  And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers.  

Fiscal and regulatory policies--which are of course the responsibility of the 

Administration and the Congress--are best suited to address such adverse structural 

trends. 

Conclusion 

To conclude, we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our 

congressionally mandated goals.  The economy has essentially met the employment 

portion of our mandate and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective.  This 

outcome suggests that our goal-focused, outlook-dependent approach to scaling back 

accommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well.   

This same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and 

years ahead.  With that in mind, our policy aims to support continued growth of the 

American economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives.  We do that, 

as I have noted, with an eye always on the risks.  To that end, we realize that waiting too 

long to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly
