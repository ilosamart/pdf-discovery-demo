(BHCs).15   

Data from Call Reports and FR Y-9C filings show a pattern in originations for sale that is 

similar to the shares of overall originations revealed by the HMDA data.  In the first quarter of 

2007, small BHCs accounted for less than 10 percent of mortgage loan sales by bank holding 

companies.  However, by the second quarter of 2012, these institutions had almost doubled their 

share, accounting for nearly 20 percent of sales.  

And, indeed, the net income from selling mortgage loans is attracting some new entrants. 

The number of banks reporting any income from sales, securitization, or servicing of mortgage 

loans has shown a substantial increase since 2007, with much of the entry occurring as the 

recession ended in the first half of 2009.  Recent quarters have seen the entry of about 30 

additional banks.  But since the new entrants are all small, it will take a lot of them to make up 

for any pullback from the larger banking organizations.  

Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the community bank share of the 

mortgage market is not large, it is significant.  Thus, I would conclude from this evidence that 

the additional capacity provided by smaller lenders is important, especially at the margin, and 

could contribute to lowering mortgage rates and loosening lending standards. 

How important is mortgage lending to the community banking model? 

The same data that were used to examine the role of community banks in the mortgage 

market can also be used to analyze the importance of mortgage products to community banks. 

Overall, community banks accounted for approximately one-fifth of closed-end, first-lien 

mortgages retained in portfolio by all banks as of June 2012.  Mortgage lending appears to be
