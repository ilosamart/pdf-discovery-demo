costs of requiring a move to some non-U.S. GAAP form of consolidated approach may well not 

be worth the incremental safety and soundness benefits of doing so.  Together, these 

considerations are leading us to what we refer to as the building block approach (BBA), which is 

likely the approach that we will put forth for comment in the ANPR for this group of firms.   

The BBA would aggregate capital resources and capital requirements across the different 

legal entities in the group to calculate combined, group-level capital resources and requirements.  

A firm’s aggregate capital requirements generally would be the sum of the capital requirements 

at each subsidiary.  The capital requirement for each regulated insurance or depository institution 

subsidiary generally would be based on the regulatory capital rules of that subsidiary’s lead 

regulator--whether a state or foreign insurance regulator or a federal banking regulator for 

depository institutions.  The regulatory capital requirement for any non-insurance, non-banking 

subsidiaries--which at present are relatively minor parts of these firms--would probably be 

determined under the standardized risk-based capital rules applicable to affiliates of bank holding 

companies.  

Should we adopt this approach, we will need to develop a formula or scalar to put the 

different regulatory regimes on a comparable basis.  With an eye towards the kind of issues that 

are usually addressed by a consolidated capital approach, we will also need to fashion standards 

for adjustments to address inter-company transactions and possibly some other exposures.  An 

example of the latter would be potential adjustments to harmonize permitted accounting practices 

that vary across states.     

The BBA would efficiently leverage existing legal-entity-level regulatory capital 

frameworks that already apply to the various units of the supervised insurance group.  As such, 

it would involve relatively low regulatory burden for these entities, even as it produces
