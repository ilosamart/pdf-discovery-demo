Government agencies, including the Fed, failed to recognize the extent of the risks or 

how severely they could damage the financial system and the economy.  Investors failed 

to anticipate and understand the risks of large financial institutions’ activities that 

materialized during the crisis.   

Background on Financial Regulation and Supervision 

Before I turn to the Fed’s actions to improve oversight of large financial 

institutions, let me be clear about what I mean by “large institutions.”  Generally, I have 

in mind those firms whose financial distress would pose a significant risk to financial 

stability--firms that are, in that sense, “systemically important.”  This would include U.S. 

banking organizations with large, complex, and often international operations; foreign 

banking organizations with extensive U.S. operations; and other large and complex 

financial firms.  Today the Federal Reserve subjects 16 of those firms to significantly 

higher levels of oversight than are applied to other institutions.2  To put the scale and

Supervision Coordinating Committee” at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-
supervision.htm.  This list may evolve based on changes in firms’ relative systemic importance.  Financial 
Stability Oversight Council determinations of nonbank financial institutions subject to Federal Reserve 
oversight are available on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s website at 
www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/designations/Pages/default.aspx.

holding companies and savings and loan holding companies.  To access the report, see the Board’s
