research and development and other capital investments that increase the productive 

capacity of the nation. 

There is already a well-known list of investments that have been shown to be 

successful.  For instance, early childhood education can increase the educational 

attainment of children from low-income families as well as improve other outcomes.16  In 

addition, recent innovations in job training programs, which more tightly link the training 

to the needs of employers in sectors of the economy with a demand for workers, have 

been shown to increase both the employment and wages of participants.17 

Investment in basic research by the federal government is another area in which 

greater investments could yield significant returns and in which a public policy role is 

warranted because of externalities.  Econometric studies suggest that the rates of return to 

this type of investment can be very high.18  And a range of policy commentators agree 

that there is a continuing role for government investment in infrastructure, including 

various forms of transportation, as a way to enhance productivity.  Not too long ago, the 

American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United States a rating of D+ on its roads
