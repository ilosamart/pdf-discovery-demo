Generally, the more complex a banking organization is, the greater the expense and time 

necessary to resolve it.  Similarly, financial institutions may be interconnected in many 

ways, as large banks commonly engage in transactions with other financial institutions 

that give rise to a wide range of contractual obligations.  Financial distress at a large bank 

may materially raise the likelihood of distress at other firms given the network of 

contractual obligations throughout the financial system.  

So how do we gauge the degree of complexity and interconnectedness of large 

firms?  Rather than formulating new and untested measures of these factors, I believe we 

would be well served to begin by looking to our body of post-crisis regulation as a 

source.  I will highlight a few factors that already reside in various areas of our regulatory 

framework that I am considering.  

The G-SIB surcharge indicators are likely to be a helpful source in this effort.  For 

example, one factor from that framework that we might consider for purposes of tailoring 

is cross-border activity.  This would measure assets and liabilities related to transactions 

with foreign banks, individuals, and companies, among others.  This factor measures both 

a firm’s complexity and resolvability, as foreign operations add operational complexity in 

normal times and complicate the ability of the firm to undergo an orderly resolution in 

times of stress. 

Another factor from the G-SIB surcharge framework that could be useful is a 

firm’s use of short-term wholesale funding, which may serve as a proxy for liquidity 

vulnerability.  Historically, reliance on short-term, uninsured funding from sophisticated 

funding sources has created vulnerability to large-scale funding runs and increased risks 

related to financial sector interconnectedness.  Specifically, this can lead to “fire sale”
