There are grounds for optimism that economic growth will be sufficient to 

promote further gains in labor market conditions.  Consumer spending should be helped 

by the earlier declines in oil prices because the boost to household incomes from the drop 

in oil prices is substantial.  Lower gasoline prices alone are estimated to be saving the 

typical household about $700 this year, thus providing households with the resources 

potentially to increase spending on other goods and services.  Moreover, consumer 

sentiment remains solid.  To be sure, with the U.S. now a major oil producer, lower oil 

prices have also had some negative effects on the U.S. economy.  Domestic oil drilling 

dropped sharply over the past few months, and sectors that support this activity have seen 

adverse effects.  But, on net, the United States should gain from the fall in oil prices, 

given that we are still a sizable importer of oil.  

On the negative side, the substantial appreciation of the dollar since last summer 

has been a significant headwind to the U.S. economy.  The weakness in industrial activity 

recently has been more pronounced in sectors that are highly exposed to international 

trade.  The first-quarter drop in net exports was very large, not only because of the 

appreciation of the dollar, but also in part reflecting--as mentioned above--port 

disruptions and possibly also some statistical noise.  Our analysis of the determinants of 

U.S. trade suggests that the recent appreciation of the dollar will restrain economic 

growth to some extent for a time even after these transitory factors have dissipated.   

Evaluating all of the indicators, the FOMC expects--as outlined in its June 17 

statement--that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand 

at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels 

consistent with the dual mandate.
