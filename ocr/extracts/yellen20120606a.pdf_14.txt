the effect depends less and less on the current elevated level of the balance sheet and 

increasingly on the level of holdings during and after the normalization of our portfolio.12 

The Rationale for Highly Accommodative Policy 

I have already noted that, in my view, an extended period of highly accommodative 

policy is necessary to combat the persistent headwinds to recovery.  I will next explain how I’ve 

reached this policy judgment.  In evaluating the stance of policy, I find the prescriptions from 

simple policy rules a logical starting point.  A wide range of such rules has been examined in the 

academic literature, the most famous of which is that proposed by John Taylor in his 1993 

study.13  Rules of the general sort proposed by Taylor (1993) capture well our statutory mandate 

to promote maximum employment and price stability by prescribing that the federal funds rate 

should respond to the deviation of inflation from its longer-run goal and to the output gap, given 

that the economy should be at or close to full employment when the output gap--the difference 

between actual GDP and an estimate of potential output--is closed.  Moreover, research suggests 

that such simple rules can be reasonably robust to uncertainty about the true structure of the 

economy, as they perform well in a variety of models.14  Today, I will consider the prescriptions 

of two such benchmark rules--Taylor’s 1993 rule, and a variant that is twice as responsive to 

economic slack.  In my view, this latter rule is more consistent with the FOMC’s commitment to

between the actual size of the balance sheet now and in the future and its normal size, where the latter is rising 
steadily over time, primarily as a result of the trend growth in currency.
