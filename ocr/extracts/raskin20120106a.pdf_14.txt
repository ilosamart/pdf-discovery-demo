willing to take the time and effort to know and work with their customers in a way that 

may not be possible for a larger, more distant institution.  This trait is particularly 

important when it comes to small business lending, where a local community bank may 

understand things about a prospective customer that cannot be captured in a more 

quantitative credit-scoring model that might be used by a larger institution.  Risks at 

community banks tend to arise from their lending activities, whether in the form of credit 

or interest rate risk, and a lack of diversification can exacerbate these risks.  Unlike large,  

complex banks, community banks typically do not rely on their investment portfolios or 

diversified business lines to offset low profits.  

All of these characteristics call for a very different model of examination and 

supervision than what is required for the largest banks.  Just as community banks have a 

deep understanding of their local communities, it is important that examiners also 

understand local market conditions to be able to put the bank’s management and credit 

decisions in the proper context.  For example, when I was commissioner here, there was 

an old joke among state examiners that you never dared set foot in a bank on the Eastern 

Shore if you didn’t know the latest monthly count of blue crabs.   

Strong lines of communication between examiners and community banks are 

vitally important.  Examiners are only on site periodically at most community banks, so it 

is essential that when they are on site, they communicate clearly with management about 

supervisory concerns in order to help bankers make improvements as appropriate.9  

Examiners need to listen carefully to management to understand their perspective where

12-month period, although this may vary depending on, among other things, the size and condition of the 
bank.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2000), Commercial Bank Examination
