and imprisoned for antitrust law violations, it is difficult to imagine a more effective deterrent to 

such conduct. 

Banking regulators do not have criminal enforcement powers, of course.  But we can, and 

do, require dismissal of employees as part of our enforcement actions against firms.  And we do
