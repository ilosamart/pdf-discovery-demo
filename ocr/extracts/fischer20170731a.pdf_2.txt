 I am very happy to be participating in this conference celebrating Arminio.  My 

tenure at the International Monetary Fund overlapped with the first two and a half years 

of Arminio’s time as president of the Central Bank of Brazil, and in our capacities at the 

time, we had frequent opportunities to interact and converse.  Of course, I watched with 

admiration the remarkable management of the economy by the Malan-Fraga team in the 

run-up to the election that brought Lula to power.  In particular, Arminio and his Central 

Bank team’s management of the exchange rate--which at one point reached 3.95 reais per 

dollar--was masterly and put in place a sound foundation for that essential part of Brazil’s 

economic machinery in the years that followed.   

Subsequently, as I was on the brink of transitioning to the world of central 

banking early in 2005--that is, prior to taking up my position as governor of the Bank of 

Israel--Arminio was able to turn the tables and offered me some hard-edged advice on 

how to be a central banker.  I have kept that advice close since then.  It comes in the form 

of six commandments on a small laminated piece of paper.  Needless to say, it very much 

reflects his values and his behavior.  Let me quote just three of his rules:  “Number 2.  Do 

[the job] in a way that shows you care, but in a way that shows you will serenely pursue 

your goals”--excellent advice, which is easier said than done; “Number 5.  Beware of a 

tendency to be overly conservative once you start wearing the central bank hat”; and 

“Number 6.  Remember, most people lose half their IQ when they take a job such as this 

one.”   

Now I will turn to the main topic of my discussion, the low level of global real 

interest rates, an important and distinguishing feature of the current global economic 

environment.  In the United States, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds is near all-time
