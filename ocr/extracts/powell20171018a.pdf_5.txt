sufficiently “frictionless” that consumers can now fit commerce into these brief 

interludes.  

This development has ushered in a world of multiple smartphone apps that allow 

for “instant” payments.  We can use a payments app to move funds instantly to anyone 

who has that app.4  Some banks have similarly collaborated to build faster payments 

applications that leverage their deposit account systems.  And we are already moving to a 

world in which we need not open a special app or go to our bank’s website in order to 

send money.  Many people here will have taken an Uber or Lyft, and then paid your 

driver without relaunching the app, much less reaching for your wallet.  Similarly, 

payment providers can now leverage the application programming interfaces (APIs)—

essentially the protocols—of smartphone messaging services to integrate their payment 

tools directly into messaging applications: Nowadays, consumers can simply “attach” 

money while messaging a friend.  

Innovation in retail payments can also offer tangible benefits to consumers 

beyond convenience.  Improvements in security, such as our ability to authenticate 

consumers and detect fraudulent transactions, are also possible through innovation.  For 

instance, mobile payments introduce a wide array of ways to authenticate a consumer’s 

identity, including  two-factor authentication codes sent via text message to the phone; 

biometrics, like a fingerprint or face scan; device identification information; IP address; 

and geolocation data.  Similarly, increased access to transaction data and cloud 

computing resources means that we have smarter, faster computational processes—like 

enhanced neural networks—to detect payments that do not match a consumer’s spending 

                                                 
4 Cashing the funds out of the app to use for other payments, however, has traditionally taken longer.
