to at least five or more.  And such long chains can create additional points of 

vulnerability in the financial system.   

Nonbanks also increase the amount of maturity transformation conducted in the 

financial system without the stability-enhancing backstops offered to banks.  Although 

some nonbanks are eligible to obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank 

System, nonbanks are not backed by federal deposit insurance, nor do they have direct 

access to a lender of last resort to stem runs on their short-term liabilities.  As a result, 

their funding can dry up rapidly should counterparties begin to believe the nonbank is in 

financial distress.   

The failure of nonbank financial institutions could directly reduce the availability 

of credit and could cause fire sales of assets leading to impaired market functioning.  In 

addition, because many nonbanks are connected to banks, a shock to the nonbank sector 

could in turn threaten the stability of the overall banking system â€“ as happened in the 

unfolding of the Global Financial Crisis. 

Nonbanks and the Start of the Global Financial Crisis 

Before discussing the role of non-banks in the Global Financial Crisis, let me 

briefly mention a previous episode involving a non-bank--the failure of Long-Term 

Capital Management (LTCM).  The New York Fed, under the leadership of then 

President William McDonough, dealt successfully with the LTCM problem.  However 

the episode was scary and a warning about problems that could arise in the nonbank 

financial system and spread wider.  

Now to the Global Financial Crisis:  Although there were many dimensions to the 

financial crisis, the poor performance of subprime mortgages was one of the triggers.
