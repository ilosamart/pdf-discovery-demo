2013 illustrated, even talk of prospective changes in our securities holdings can elicit 

unexpected abrupt changes in financial conditions.   

Given the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back 

monetary policy accommodation and the need to carefully calibrate the removal of 

accommodation, the FOMC opted to allow changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities 

holdings to play a secondary role in the Committee’s normalization strategy.  Rather than 

balance sheet shrinkage, the FOMC decided that its primary tool for scaling back 

monetary policy accommodation would be influencing short-term interest rates.   

As we explained in our “normalization principles” issued in September 2014, the 

FOMC decided to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at 

an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise short-term interest 

rates.8  Once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way” 

and the Committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further 

increases in short-term interest rates were likely to be warranted, the FOMC would 

gradually and predictably reduce the size of the balance sheet by allowing the Federal 

Reserve’s securities holdings to “run off”--that is, we would allow our balance sheet to 

shrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities.9

9 The FOMC announced in December 2015 that it anticipated maintaining its reinvestment policy until 
normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way.”  That announcement is available 
on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf.  
More recently, in June 2017, the FOMC provided additional details regarding its approach to reduce the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, indicating that once the balance sheet normalization plan began, 
principal payments received from securities held by the Federal Reserve would be reinvested only to the 
extent that those payments exceeded certain monthly caps.  The caps would rise gradually but would 
remain in place during the normalization process.  The June 2017 announcement, Addendum to the Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans, is available on the Board’s website at
