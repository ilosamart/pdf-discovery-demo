qualify for an 18-month examination cycle by raising the threshold from its current $500

those banks that pose more significant supervisory concerns. 

Volcker Rule 

Finally, EGRPRA may provide a good opportunity to reevaluate whether 

community banks should be subject to the Volcker rule.  Exempting banks with less than 

$10 billion in assets from its requirements would significantly help reduce burden on 

smaller institutions.7 

Conclusion 

The list that I have laid out here is meant to be suggestive, not comprehensive.  I 

look forward to hearing your views on these issues as well as any additional suggestions 

you believe to be worthy of consideration.  Each of the agencies will be using the 

information gathered at this outreach meeting and our other outreach efforts to support 

the review process, so we can reduce burden where possible, particularly for community 

banks.  I encourage everybody to speak frankly and to be as specific as possible.   

Thank you again for coming.
