actions to constrain credit to non-agricultural businesses.3  The Bank’s private ownership, 

intended to give it independence from government control, was a source of unpopularity.  

Ultimately, these disagreements undermined the Bank’s political support.  After 20 years, 

Congress chose not to renew the Bank’s charter.  A second Bank of the United States met 

a similar fate in 1836 when President Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill to extend its life 

(figure 4). 

These two short-lived experiments illustrate a theme in American history--of 

Americans from different regions holding distinct views about the structure and 

development of the financial system.  People in the newer western parts of the country 

saw themselves as starved of access to credit and viewed higher interest rates in their 

areas as reflecting the scarcity of funds.  Regional interest rate differentials persisted until 

around the time of World War I and helped shape the attitudes of Americans living in 

western areas toward the nation’s financial system.4 

These regional differences gave rise to a major political movement in the latter 

part of the 19th century, as western farm borrowers increasingly demanded a reform of 

the U.S. monetary system.  Their chief complaints included the high interest rates they 

faced as well as the burdens placed on them by deflation that increased the real value of 

their debts.  Indeed, the economy experienced 1 to 2 percent deflation annually in the 

years leading up to the 1890s.  The country’s currency was linked to gold, and deflation 

reflected the growing scarcity of gold relative to the amount of economic activity.  The

Journal of Economic History, vol. 25 (September), pp. 355-93.  Economic historians have debated the 
extent to which interest rate differentials reflected market segmentation and supply versus demand in each 
market.  Other factors include higher risk premiums, reflecting higher expected default rates in some areas 
of the country, and varying levels of monopoly power.
