pure intermediary and takes no net position in any of the underlying contracts that it 

clears, so it can experience losses only when a clearing member defaults and has posted 

insufficient margin to cover the cost of replacing its open positions.  Central 

counterparties are typically designed to distribute any losses they do incur in a relatively 

predictable way across all clearing members.  In this way, central clearing provides for a 

transparent mutualization of counterparty risks among participants.  

Central counterparties are designed to be narrowly focused on intermediation and 

not the provision of credit and liquidity.  This structure improves the chances that, in the 

event of a significant market stress, market functioning will not be threatened by the 

failure of market infrastructure itself.   

Of course, the other side of this coin is that adding a central counterparty 

introduces a single point of failure for the network, making it critical that the central 

counterparty itself be well managed and well regulated.  To help ensure this result, title 

VII of the Dodd-Frank Act adopted stronger safeguards than in the past for central 

counterparties that clear OTC derivatives.  Title VIII aimed at strengthening the 

supervision of financial market utilities, including central counterparties designated as 

systemically important, by requiring annual examinations as well as ex ante reviews of 

material rule and operational changes.  In April 2012, the international organizations that 

set standards for financial market infrastructures such as central counterparties published 

new and stronger standards for these entities.  U.S. regulators, including the Federal 

Reserve, participated actively in this work and are expected to make formal proposals for 

incorporating the new standards into U.S. regulations as soon as possible.
