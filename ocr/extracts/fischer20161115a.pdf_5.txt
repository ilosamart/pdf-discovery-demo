This analysis, however, is limited to episodes of distressed borrowers rather than a 

systemwide stress. 

4.  Flash events 

In addition, recent flash events--such as the sharp movement in Treasury prices on 

October 15, 2014; the rapid rise and decline of the euro-dollar exchange rate on March 

18, 2015; 6 and the swing in sterling on October 7, 2016--have led some to assert that 

market liquidity has become less resilient.   Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York have argued that spikes in volatility and sudden declines in liquidity have 

become more frequent in both Treasury and equity markets.7  The Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission also points out that flash events are more common now.8  Market 

participants suggest that the rapid growth in high-frequency trading in equity, foreign 

exchange, and U.S. Treasury markets, along with broader concerns about less resilient 

liquidity, potentially explains these flash events.  Nevertheless, a report on the October 

15, 2014 event by the staff of the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, and market 

regulatory agencies found no single factor that caused the sharp swing in prices.9 

A Broader Review of the Evidence  

1.  Trading costs are low 

Even though flash events appear to be more common, it is certainly too soon to 

declare that a broad reduction in market liquidity has occurred.  Figure 3 plots realized
