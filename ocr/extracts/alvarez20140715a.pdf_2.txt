Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Green, and other members of the subcommittee, 

thank you for the opportunity to testify about the Federal Reserve’s supervisory activities 

pertaining to banking organizations and their account relationships with law-abiding businesses.  

In my testimony, I will describe the legal framework governing the establishment and 

maintenance of customer accounts and the regulatory expectations the Federal Reserve has 

established for the banking organizations we supervise.  I will also highlight related aspects of 

our examination and enforcement process in this area.  

Let me begin by saying that the Federal Reserve believes it is important that banking 

organizations provide services to consumers and businesses whose activities comply with 

applicable laws.  It is equally important that the banks we supervise do not facilitate or 

participate in illegal activity.  Indeed, during the past several years the Federal Reserve has 

provided information to the banking organizations we supervise to clarify the requirements for 

providing account services to law-abiding businesses.  

Legal Framework and the Federal Reserve’s Regulatory Expectations 

Congress, through the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), requires banking organizations to 

establish and maintain anti-money-laundering (AML) programs designed to detect when services 

provided by the organization are being used for illegal purposes.  By law, each Federal Reserve-

regulated institution, like other depository institutions, must have a BSA program that contains 

four critical elements, including a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance with 

the BSA, independent testing of the bank’s compliance with the BSA, training of appropriate 

bank personnel, and the designation of an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring 

day-to-day compliance with the BSA.1  Under the general rubric of “know your customer” laws 

1  See 31 U.S.C. § 5318(h) and Board of Governors Regulation H (12 C.F.R. § 208.63) (BSA program requirements 
for state member banks).
