New York Fed and at the Board.  And we gather thousands of tidbits of anecdotal information 

from a wide range of sources.  

Given my background in banking and the important role lending has played in both the 

crisis and the recovery, I try to provide the Committee with insight into current lending 

conditions, including loan quality and credit availability.  I begin my preparations about two

released after the meeting.  At this point in the process, we aren’t debating which option is best 

or even necessarily what the best words are, but rather, we are trying to ensure the options span 

the range of plausible alternatives.

meeting and a forecast of economic performance, including hundreds of charts, tables, and 

graphs.2

  In addition to the baseline forecast, which is the staff’s estimate of the most likely path 

for the economy, several alternative simulations are included to provide a sense of the impact of
