The Fed, like other central banks, does appropriately retain some matters for 

private discussions.  These discussions often contain market-sensitive information and 

may, by necessity, involve frank assessments of market- or even firm-specific conditions 

as well as outside-the-box ideas needed to deal with evolving economic situations.  These 

exceptions reflect the view that transparency should preserve the ability of policymakers 

to think out of the box and should not inhibit free give-and-take and the testing of ideas 

that is essential to reaching good decisions.  Transcripts of the FOMC’s meetings are 

made available with a five-year lag, allowing researchers to study the closed-door 

discussions after an appropriate time has elapsed. 

Central Bank Independence and New Challenges 

Low inflation 

The basic governance structure set up in the late 1970s was envisioned as a means 

to monitor and encourage the Federal Reserve to pursue its mandates, and an aggressive 

and successful campaign to bring down inflation followed.  Indeed, the high inflation of 

the 1970s and early 1980s was one of the primary motivations for the broadening and 

deepening of monetary policy independence worldwide.   

Today consumer price inflation remains below the FOMC’s objective of 

2 percent.  According to the personal consumption expenditures index, the 12-month 

change in core prices (prices excluding the food and energy categories) has been around 

1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since the beginning of 2013.  At the September 2015 FOMC 

                                                 
did in 1998.  See for example Figure 1 in that paper.  These measures of transparency cover a variety of 
factors, including the openness about policy objectives and economic data, disclosures about the procedures 
used in deliberations, the speed of such disclosures, and transparency about the operational aspects of 
meeting targets.
