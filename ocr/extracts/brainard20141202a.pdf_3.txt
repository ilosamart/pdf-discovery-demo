you can elaborate on how to improve our regulations in more detail than we can cover in 

the time we have today.    

 We recognize that depository institutions come in many sizes, have different 

business models, and manage different risks.  As a result, it is often necessary to tailor 

regulations to the institution.  Applying a one-size-fits-all approach to regulations may 

produce a small benefit at a disproportionately large compliance cost to smaller 

institutions.  

 Of particular concern in this regard is the need to ensure our regulations are 

appropriately calibrated for smaller institutions.  For example, because the largest banks 

present the greatest risk to the stability of our financial system, many of the regulations 

passed under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

(Dodd-Frank Act) are specifically targeted at these firms.  It would be counterproductive 

to apply those same expectations to small banks.  Accordingly, we think it is important to 

tailor rules whenever possible to clearly differentiate expectations for different portfolios 

of banks and reduce undue burden on community banks. Tailoring regulations may be 

more challenging in some areas, such as rules that provide transparency and fairness in 

consumer transactions. Those are standards that apply throughout the financial system.   

 I should note that the Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule-writing authority for many 

of the consumer laws and regulations to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or 

CFPB.  The review of those regulations must be undertaken by the CFPB under 

procedures incorporated in the Dodd-Frank Act rather than EGRPRA.  However, the 

Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation retained rule-writing authority for the Community
