Government intervention in the United States has also addressed the problem of 

the fundamental illiquidity of mortgages.  Going back 100 years, before the Great 

Depression, the U.S. mortgage system relied on small institutions with local deposit bases 

and lending markets.  In the face of widespread runs at the start of the Great Depression, 

banks holding large portfolios of illiquid home loans had to close, exacerbating the 

contraction.  In response, the Congress established housing agencies as part of the New 

Deal to facilitate housing market liquidity by providing a way for banks to mutually 

insure and sell mortgages.8   

In time, the housing agencies, augmented by post-World War II efforts to increase 

homeownership, grew and became the familiar government-sponsored enterprises, or 

GSEs:  Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs).  The GSEs bought 

mortgages from both bank and nonbank mortgage originators, and in turn, the GSEs 

bundled these loans and securitized them; these mortgage-backed securities were then 

sold to investors.  The resulting deep securitized market supported mortgage liquidity and 

led to broader homeownership.9   

Costs of Mortgage Credit  

While the benefits to society from homeownership could suggest a case for 

government involvement in securitization and other measures to expand mortgage credit 

availability, these benefits are not without costs.  A rapid increase in mortgage credit, 

especially when it is accompanied by a rise in house prices, can threaten the resilience of 

the financial system.
