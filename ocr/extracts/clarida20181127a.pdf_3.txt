up, with various measures now running in the neighborhood of 3 percent on an annual 

basis. 

The inflation data in the year to date for the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) have been running at or close to our 2 percent objective, including on 

a core basis--that is, excluding volatile food and energy prices.  While my base case is for 

this pattern to continue, it is important to monitor measures of inflation expectations to 

confirm that households and businesses expect price stability to be maintained.  The 

median of expected inflation 5-to-10 years in the future from the University of Michigan 

Surveys of Consumers is within--but I believe at the lower end of--the range consistent 

with price stability.  Likewise, inflation readings from the TIPS (Treasury Inflation-

Protected Securities) market indicate to me that financial markets expect consumer price 

index (CPI) inflation of about 2 percent to be maintained.  That said, historically, PCE 

inflation has averaged about 0.3 percent less than CPI inflation, and if this were to 

continue, the readings from the TIPS market would indicate that expected PCE inflation 

is running at somewhat less than 2 percent. 

What might explain why inflation is running at or close to the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

long-run objective of 2 percent, and not well above it, when growth is strong and the 

labor market robust?  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity growth in 

the business sector, as measured by output per hour, is averaging 2 percent at an 

annualized rate this year, while aggregate hours worked in the business sector have risen 

at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent through the third quarter.  This decomposition--in 

which the growth in output is broken down into measures of aggregate supply, the growth 

of aggregate hours and the growth of output per hour--suggests that the growth rates of
