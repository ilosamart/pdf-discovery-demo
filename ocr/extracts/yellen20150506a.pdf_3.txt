and job creation.  Access to capital is important for all firms, but it is particularly vital for 

startups and young firms, which often lack a sufficient stream of earnings to increase 

employment and internally finance capital spending.  Indeed, research shows that more 

highly developed financial systems disproportionately benefit entrepreneurship.1  

The financial sector also helps households save for retirement, purchase homes 

and cars, and weather unexpected developments.  Many financial innovations, such as the 

increased availability of low-cost mutual funds, have improved opportunities for 

households to participate in asset markets and diversify their holdings.2  Expanded credit 

access has helped households maintain living standards when suffering job loss, illness, 

or other unexpected contingencies.3  Technological innovations have increased the ease 

and convenience with which individuals make and receive payments.4  

The contribution of the financial sector to household risk management and 

business investment, as well as the significant contribution of financial-sector 

development to economic growth, has been documented in many studies.5  Such research 

1 Recent reviews have highlighted potential costs of a distorted financial sector, but such reviews also 
emphasize the range of both theoretical and empirical work that has documented the many ways in which 
the financial sector can support economic efficiency; see, for example, Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) 
and Zingales (2015).  Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) discuss evidence that financial development 
supports entrepreneurship, and Fort and others (2013) examine the importance of financing for business 
formation and young firms. 
2 Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) discuss how an important fraction of growth in the U.S. financial 
sector reflects the greater demand of households for asset management services and credit.  Malkiel (2013) 
considers similar issues and reviews how improved access to low-cost investment options has benefited 
households. 
3  Krueger and Perri (2006) analyze how an increase in access to credit contributed to householdsâ€™ ability to 
smooth spending despite substantial income volatility. 
4 Changes in payment technologies have been rapid, and an area of particular interest is the fast growth of 
mobile payment and financial service technologies.  The Federal Reserve has conducted several surveys to 
understand these developments, and the most recent results are discussed in Board of Governors (2015).  
5 A substantial body of research finds that financial development supports economic growth, including 
Goldsmith (1969), King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales (1998), and Levine (2005).  It is 
noteworthy that this research emphasizes differences across countries, and that the United States is among 
the most financially developed countries in the world.
