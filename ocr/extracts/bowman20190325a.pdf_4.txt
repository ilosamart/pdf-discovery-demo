One in five people in rural areas have a bachelor’s degree, compared to one in three in 

urban areas.4  This educational disparity helps explain why the employment-to-population and 

labor force participation rates in rural areas are lower than in many urban areas.5 Another 

contributing factor to low rural labor force participation is the opioid crisis, which the entire 

nation is struggling to overcome.   

Policymakers need to be aware of and be willing to confront these issues.  But let me be 

clear:  I am optimistic about the future of rural America.  The narrative of rural decline is too 

sweeping and brushes aside the diversity of the rural experience.  Just as many cities thrive while 

others struggle, there are deteriorating rural communities and rural communities that are thriving 

and growing.   

So let’s build on these successes and highlight a few of the positives. 

Following six years of steady population losses, up through 2016, the rural population 

appears to have stabilized.  And while employment is growing more slowly in rural areas than in 

urban areas, rural unemployment has recovered and is now 1 percentage point below pre-

recession levels.6  The rate of poverty in rural areas is also falling.  From a peak in 2013, the rural 

poverty rate has fallen 2 percentage points to 16.4 percent in 2017.   

There are also many creative and innovative rural communities.  In manufacturing, 

innovation rates are similar for urban and rural manufacturers, although the services sector in 

rural areas lags its urban counterparts.7  And, I am greatly encouraged to see younger generations 

choosing to live in and return to their roots in rural communities, just as my family and I chose to
