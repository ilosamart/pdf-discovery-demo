ledger little to no information about the identity of owners of the cryptocurrency, this essentially 

mimics a bearer instrument--that is, an instrument whereby the holder of the instrument is 

presumed to be its owner.  Further, cryptocurrencies are easy to transfer across borders.  Indeed, 

a cryptocurrency that mimics a bearer instrument and provides significant anonymity in 

transactions, including across borders, could raise significant concerns regarding the potential to 

facilitate illicit activities and associated money laundering.  For example, electronic instruments 

can be easily transferred and stored in large amounts, and peer-to-peer transactions outside of the 

United States could be very hard to prevent and detect.  Such instruments appear to have proven 

susceptible for use to convey payments to illicit actors--for example, to pay ransoms.   

Overall, however, the still relatively small scale of cryptocurrencies in relation to our 

broader financial system and relatively limited connections to our banking sector suggest that 

they do not currently pose a threat to financial stability.5  Of course, if cryptocurrencies were to 

achieve wide-scale use, or their impact were greatly magnified through leverage, the effects 

could be broader.  In particular, adverse developments and shifts in sentiment could cause a 

global rush to exit this market.  As we have seen in other speculative activity in the past, rush-

for-the-exits behavior can aggravate price fluctuations, create trading difficulties, and even 

induce market breakdowns.  Thus, we will continue to monitor cryptocurrencies as they evolve, 

with particular vigilance for any signs of growing materiality to the broader financial system.   

Central Bank Digital Currencies 

 Given some of the inherent issues and challenges that cryptocurrencies pose for investor 

and consumer protection and the prevention of money laundering, some have advocated that 

central banks should create their own digital forms of currency as more stable and reliable
