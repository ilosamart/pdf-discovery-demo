With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been 

in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important.  

Here, recent developments are mixed.  The May reading of the University of Michigan 

Surveys of Consumers’ measure of longer-term inflation expectations remained near its 

all-time low, while the New York Fed’s measure of three-year inflation expectations 

edged up in its latest reading to the highest level in more than a year.  And although 

market-based measures of inflation compensation have improved relative to their lows in 

the middle of last year, they are still below the average level in the period from 2010 to 

2014.   

Attaining the Committee’s symmetric target for inflation on a sustainable basis is 

especially important in the current environment, with the neutral real interest rate at 

historically lower levels, in order to ensure conventional policy has room to respond to 

unexpected adverse developments.  Underlying fundamentals, such as import prices and 

diminishing slack, should lead inflation to resume moving closer to its goal. Nonetheless, 

currently I see more signs that progress on inflation is slowing than of a breakout of 

inflation to the upside, as might be the case with a nonlinearity in the relationship 

between inflation and unemployment when unemployment is very low.6   

But as noted earlier, a breakout in inflation also was not a primary concern 

following the past two times the unemployment rate dropped as low as it is now, in 1998 

and 2006, when recessions followed within two or three years.  One notable feature of 

both episodes was that they were preceded by sharply elevated financial imbalances.  In 

the late 1990s, equity prices had reached very high levels, according to common
