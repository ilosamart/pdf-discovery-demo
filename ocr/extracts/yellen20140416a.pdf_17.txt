Conclusion 

In summary, the policy framework I have described reflects the FOMC’s 

commitment to systematically respond to unforeseen economic developments in order to 

promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.   

 It is very welcome news that a return to these conditions has finally appeared in 

the medium-term outlook of many forecasters.  But it will be much better news when this 

objective is reached.  My colleagues on the FOMC and I will stay focused on doing the 

Federal Reserve’s part to promote this goal.
