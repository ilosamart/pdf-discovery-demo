large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about our intentions for the future path 

of short-term interest rates.  The rationale for those tools was straightforward:  Given our 

inability to meaningfully lower short-term interest rates after they reached near-zero in 

late 2008, the FOMC used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset 

purchases to apply downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, which were still well 

above zero.  

Longer-term interest rates reflect, in part, financial market participants’ 

expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates.  As a result, FOMC 

communications that affect those expectations--such as the enhanced forward rate 

guidance provided in our post-meeting statements in the aftermath of the Great 

Recession--can affect longer-term interest rates.1  In addition, longer-term interest rates 

include a term premium, which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing 

the interest rate risk associated with longer-term securities.  When the Federal Reserve 

buys longer-term securities in the open market, the remaining stock of securities available 

for purchase by the public declines, which pushes the prices of those securities up and 

thus depresses their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields.2  

Several studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did 

appreciably reduce longer-term interest rates.3   

                                                 
1 Before the Great Recession, the FOMC occasionally provided forward rate guidance, but that guidance 
was typically confined to a relatively short horizon. 
2 In addition to depressing term premiums, large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve can lower 
longer-term yields if those purchases are perceived by the public as a signal that short-term interest rates 
are likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated.
