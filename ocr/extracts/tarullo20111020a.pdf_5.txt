Longer-Term Concerns for the U.S. Labor Market 

Persistent employment weakness during an economic recovery, even such a tepid 

one, raises the important question of whether it is symptomatic of longer-run changes in 

the labor market.  Indeed, in some respects the recent weakness resembles the “jobless” 

recoveries that followed the 1990 and 2001 recessions.  In both of those episodes, job 

growth remained weak well after the downturn in real gross domestic product (GDP) 

ended, and the unemployment rate continued to rise, though from lower levels than we 

have today.  One might reasonably ask if these similarities suggest that structural changes 

have placed the labor market on a permanently lower growth path. 

A first response is that there are important differences between this recovery and 

the recoveries that followed those earlier recessions.  In particular, some explanations 

offered for the weak labor market recovery following the past two recessions are clearly 

not relevant today.  Both the 1990 and 2001 recessions were relatively shallow 

downturns.  This factor may have allowed more of the employment adjustment to occur 

through attrition, which can be spread over a longer period than layoffs.  And both of 

those recessions followed long expansions, which may have permitted a buildup of 

productive inefficiencies that gave businesses scope to increase output in the subsequent 

recovery without expanding employment.2 

That said, there are some discouraging longer-term trends.  Even before the 

recession, the labor market seemed to be on a slower trajectory than in previous decades.
