realistically be implemented and take effect, and the appropriate calibration of policies 

that will be effective in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing well-

underwritten credit flows. 9  And, as with supervisory policies, there is reason to doubt 

how effective they would be in circumstances where credit growth had been excessive 

across wide parts of the economy.   

As I have said previously, however, given that procyclicality is an important 

contributor to systemic risk, there is good reason to continue work on developing time-

varying policies.  I would devote particular attention to policies that can act as the rough 

equivalent of an increase in interest rates for particular sources of funding.  Such policies 

would be more responsive to problems that were building quickly because of certain 

kinds of credit, without regard to whether they were being deployed in one or many 

sectors of the economy.  In that respect, such policies should be more effective (and 

perhaps less controversial) in slowing the buildup of excess credit than a measure 

directed squarely at one sector, which might be quickly met by the redirection of a reach 

for yield to other asset classes.   

 One example is the countercyclical capital buffer in Basel III, which provides for 

an increase in the risk-weighted capital requirements of prudentially regulated banking 

organizations of up to 2-1/2 percentage points when â€œcredit growth is excessive and is 

                                                 
9 Note that this issue of shared or complementary authorities, grounded in constitutional considerations 
such as democratic accountability and avoiding too much concentration of power in any one part of 
government, is already a factor.  While the Financial Stability Oversight Council was created in part to 
allow for coordination of the authorities of its constituent agencies, it cannot assure coordination among 
independent entities, most of which have a number of independent members.  Even within the Federal 
Reserve, there is not a unity of relevant authority, in that regulatory and supervisory powers are lodged only 
in the Board of Governors, whereas monetary policymaking rests with the entire FOMC.
