Community bank profitability is affected by both external factors outside of bank control, 

such as local economic conditions, and factors within bank control, such as the composition and 

stability of the bank’s loan portfolio.  The paper by Amel and Prager examines the effects of 

these two sets of factors on bank profitability over the past 20 years.  They find that local

a very substantial impact on a bank’s level of profits.  They find that any major change in a 

bank’s portfolio composition tends to lower bank profits, indicating yet again that banks tend to

attention of our examiners, because even a slight tightening of standards can have a significant
