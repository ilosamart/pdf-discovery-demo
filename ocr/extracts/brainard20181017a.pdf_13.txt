Consumer Financial Protection released the findings of its research on financial well-

being, it included a 10-item Financial Well-Being Scale Questionnaire, a self-evaluation 

tool designed to help an individual think comprehensively about his or her financial life.34  

The questionnaire asks consumers to rate statements such as “I can enjoy life because of 

the way I’m managing my money” and “I am securing my financial future.”  

Similarly, this April, the Center for Financial Services Innovation announced the 

launch of a new data set that uses subjective consumer responses to survey questions and 

pairs that information with actual data on their financial transactions.35  The regularly 

refreshed data is designed to give industry, researchers, and policymakers better insight 

into consumers’ financial lives by providing more accurate metrics for assessing changes 

over time.  The new initiative, which they call “Financial Health Pulse,” aims to bring the 

siloes of a consumer’s financial life into one comprehensive picture, encompassing 

“income, spending, savings, debt, retirement, and credit scores.”   

Just as we are learning how to assess financial health more effectively, we are 

also seeing progress on tools that are specifically designed to address the challenges 

underlying financial inclusion.  Moreover, these tools can be built upon a new generation
