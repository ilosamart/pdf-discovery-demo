boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further 

and inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective.   

By itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds 

rate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general 

economy.  What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-

term interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public.  As I noted, most of my 

colleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising short-

term interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years.  It’s important to 

emphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent 

adjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the 

economy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment 

and 2 percent inflation.   

The economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and it is conceivable, for 

example, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the 

apparent anchoring of inflation expectations.  Here, Japan’s recent history may be 

instructive:  As shown in figure 9, survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in 

that country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of 

persistent, mild deflation.34  The explanation for the persistent divergence between actual 

and expected inflation in Japan is not clear, but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced 

by all central banks:  Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from 

perfect.  Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of our models often err, 

                                                 
34 In addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit 
actual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has 
substantially recovered.
