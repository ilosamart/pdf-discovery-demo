more from observing economic developments in the period ahead.  It is thereby important 

to emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how incoming data 

affect the evolution of the economic outlook.  Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in 

inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is 

rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate 

more quickly as well; conversely, if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate 

would likely rise more slowly.  Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our 

2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress 

toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the 

federal funds rate. 

In closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this 

opportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy.  The economy has come a 

long way toward the FOMCâ€™s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  

When the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a 

testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the 

financial crisis and the Great Recession.  In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are 

looking forward to. 


                                                   
estimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time--are 
generally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data 
available.
