of the financial crisis in early 2009, which used an adverse macroeconomic scenario and 

estimates of firm revenues and potential losses on a portfolio-specific basis to calculate the 

amount of capital that each firm would need to remain a viable financial intermediary even were 

the adverse scenario to materialize.  The test was thus both forward-looking and horizontal, 

meaning that the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies were assessed in a simultaneous, 

consistent fashion. 

Dodd-Frank creates two kinds of stress testing requirements.  First, it mandates that the 

Federal Reserve Board conduct annual stress tests on all bank holding companies with $50 

billion or more in assets to determine whether they have the capital needed to absorb losses in 

baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic conditions.  Second, it requires both these 

companies and certain other regulated financial firms with between $10 billion and $50 billion in 

assets to conduct internal stress tests.  The Board must both publish a summary of results of the 

supervisory stress tests and issue regulations requiring firms to publish a summary of the 

company-run stress tests. 

Those who participated in the 2009 exercise, both at the banks and at regulatory agencies, 

know that the resource demands associated with it were considerable.  Yet the value of that effort 

was also considerable, a fact that doubtless informed the Congressional decision to make the 

practice mandatory.  The exercise itself forces supervisors to focus on the nature and extent of 

potential sources of loss for the largest bank holding companies as a group.  The disclosure of 

stress test results allows investors and other counterparties to better understand the profiles of 

each institution.  And, I believe, the demands of supervisors for well-specified data and 

projections from firms has improved risk management at these institutions.
