districts and in individual schools, where teacher pay is often uniform based on 

experience, factors beyond pay tend to lead more experienced and better-performing 

teachers to migrate to schools and to classrooms with more-advantaged students.31 

Higher Education that Families Can Afford 

For many individuals and families, higher education is the other cornerstone of 

economic opportunity.  The premium in lifetime earnings because of higher education 

has increased over the past few decades, reflecting greater demand for college-educated 

workers.  By one measure, the median annual earnings of full-time workers with a four-

year bachelor’s degree are 79 percent higher than the median for those with only a high 

school diploma.32  The wage premium for a graduate degree is significantly higher than 

the premium for a college degree.  Despite escalating costs for college, the net returns for 

a degree are high enough that college still offers a considerable economic opportunity to 

most people.33

31 Better and more-experienced teachers tend to move to better-resourced schools, including those with 

more active outside funding, or those with more-advantaged students, such as magnet schools.  Even within 

schools, more experienced and higher performing teachers are more likely to teach Advanced Placement 

classes which tend to serve more advantaged students.  The result is that lower income and lower achieving 

students are more likely to be taught by less experienced and lower performing teachers.  See Charles
