its current level, rather than estimates of the “lift-off” date.  If 

such an explicit criterion made it clear that short-term interest 

rates will not immediately be increased as soon as a Taylor rule 

descriptive of past behavior would justify a funds rate above 25 

basis points, this would provide a reason for market participants 

to expect easier future monetary and financial conditions than 

they may currently be anticipating . . . 

The very powerful effects of forward guidance have been called “the 

forward guidance puzzle”.  But the puzzle is not a deep one, for the ability of 

any central bank to commit to follow a particular monetary policy rule must 

be a diminishing function of the length of the horizon that is being considered.   

This fact serves to limit the extent to which policy can deliberately shape 

private expectations.  However, the strength of forward guidance is just one 

manifestation of a very high interest elasticity in the DSGE models typically 

used by Woodford that shows up pervasively.  For example, any combination 

of shocks that brings the economy to the ZLB for an appreciable length of 

time will display the effects of the elevated interest elasticity in such models, 

whether or not the central bank is assumed to issue explicit forward guidance.  

This high elasticity is also in evidence in attempts to evaluate alternative 

monetary policy regimes.17 

7.   What to do at the Lower Bound, Quantitative Easing.  Woodford is much less 

impressed by the potential power of quantitative easing (or “targeted asset 

purchases” as he describes them in his Jackson Hole paper).  He argues that 

portfolio balance effects do not exist in a modern, general-equilibrium theory

made in this paragraph.
