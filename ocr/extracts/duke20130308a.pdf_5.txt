homes.  If the majority of newly above-water sellers exit homeownership, they could 

create a substantial increase in overall supply and change the trajectory of house prices.  

But I think it is much more likely that many of them will also purchase a home in the 

same market, perhaps moving up to a larger home or downsizing to a smaller one.  In that 

case, they would create additional demand as well as supply.  And, in any event, the sales 

would provide more clarity about the level of house prices and increase liquidity in these 

markets.   

The weight of the shadow inventory--homes in the process of foreclosure or loans 

90 days or more past due--on home prices is likely to wane as the number of loans 

entering the foreclosure pipeline declines and those already in the pipeline resolve.  I 

think the nature and duration of the effect on prices will vary across the country, 

depending on the location of the shadow inventory and the speed of its resolution.  Some 

evidence of this relationship can be found by comparing the relative performance of 

house prices in states where foreclosures are processed through the court system (judicial 

states) with performance in states where foreclosures do not go through the courts 

(nonjudicial states). 

Through mid-2012, house prices fell further in nonjudicial states than in judicial 

states, likely in part because the faster nonjudicial foreclosure process boosted the for-

sale inventory in those states.  Since that time, though, prices have moved back up in 

nonjudicial states, as the inventory was worked down while prices drifted lower in 

judicial states as inventory accumulated.  Over time, the shadow inventory is becoming 

more concentrated in states with the slower judicial foreclosure processes and will likely
