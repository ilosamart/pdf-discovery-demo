The Federal Reserve is an independent entity within the federal government in 

that its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or any other executive branch 

official.  The Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, sets the Federal Reserve’s goals 

and oversees it, but the Federal Reserve decides independently how to achieve its 

congressionally mandated goals.  The ability to make monetary policy decisions that are 

free of short-term political influence is critical for central banks.  This is especially true 

because the effective conduct of monetary policy requires a long-term perspective.  A 

central bank that is subject to political pressure might opt for policies that favor rapid 

expansion in the near term at the expense of higher inflation in the future.  Such actions 

would surely result in the loss of the confidence and credibility that are needed to achieve 

the objectives of monetary policy.  Indeed, research has shown that countries with 

independent central banks have better economic performance and lower inflation than 

countries whose central banks are not independent.2 

The structure of the Federal Reserve is uniquely American in its decentralization.  

The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., 

and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.  The seven members of the Board of 

Governors are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  Each Reserve
