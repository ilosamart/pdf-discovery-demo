After five years of post-crisis stress testing, however, we believed it was important for us 

to conduct a more thorough assessment of the program.  Taking advantage of the shift in timing 

of the annual stress tests following the 2015 cycle, we undertook an overall review.5  We knew 

there were several areas to which attention was needed.  These included the imperfect alignment 

of CCAR with the regulatory capital requirements as they had evolved since we began stress 

testing, the desire for additional macroprudential elements in the stress test, and the qualitative 

component of CCAR as it applied to less complex firms.   

But we also wanted to hear what others thought.  Accordingly, we met with bank 

officials, debt and equity-side market analysts, public interest groups, and academics--both to 

solicit their views on the topics I noted a moment ago and to hear their overall evaluation of, and 

recommendations for, our stress testing and CCAR exercises.  As you can imagine, we received 

a wide range of suggestions, at least some of which were inconsistent with one another.  In the 

main, though, these discussions reflected strong support for stress testing, reinforced our going-

in view of the key issues for consideration, and presented us with some other areas for possible 

change.  Before describing the package of potential changes that is emerging from our review, let 

me explain a bit more about each of the key topics. 

First is the fact that CCAR has been adjusted to align with some, but not all, of the 

important changes made in our regulatory capital rules over the past six years.6  One might 

decide that the regulatory capital rules and CCAR should be different, complementary capital 

measures, roughly the way that a leverage ratio requirement and risk-weighted capital

6 For example, our regulatory capital rules now include a minimum requirement based on common equity, reflecting 
the fact that common equity provides the best buffer against losses. As a result, the similar common equity 
requirement that had been included in the early years of CCAR, to meet an additional post-stress target ratio of tier 1 
common equity, was removed after CCAR 2015. Other changes that have been integrated into the stress test include 
modification of the risk-weighted asset calculation methodologies and revised definitions of capital.
