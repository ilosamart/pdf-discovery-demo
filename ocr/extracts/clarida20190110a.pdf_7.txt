these global economic and financial developments as, at each future FOMC meeting, I 

consider what adjustment to our monetary policy stance is warranted to achieve and 

sustain our dual-mandate objectives.  

With our December decision, the 2.5 percent upper limit of our target range for 

the federal funds rate is now equal to the lower end of the range of Committee 

participants’ estimates of its longer-run equilibrium level, r*.  One defines r* as the level 

of the policy rate that, if sustained, would maintain full employment and price stability in 

the long run.  As I have discussed in a previous speech, r* is both unobserved and time 

varying, so it must be inferred from macroeconomic and financial data.6       

It is for this reason that, at this stage of the business cycle and with the economy 

operating close to our dual-mandate objectives, it will be especially important for our 

policy decisions to continue to be data dependent.  We need to be data dependent in two 

related but distinct ways.  First, we need to base our policy decisions on what trends in 

the data tell us about where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to our 

dual-mandate objectives for unemployment and inflation.  Second, we need to be data 

dependent by looking at a wide range of real and financial data that can provide 

information on where the economy is heading under appropriate policy, including the 

ultimate destination for u* and r*.  Over the past seven years, FOMC participants have 

continually revised down their estimates of long-run u* and r* as the unemployment rate 

fell and historically low policy rates did not trigger a surge in inflation and inflation 

expectations above target.  This process of learning about u* and r* as new data arrive
