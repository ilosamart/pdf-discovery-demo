It is worth saying a little about the “musical chairs” mechanism that leads to the 

sharp spike in rates.  The fund managers in the model care about their relative 

performance in that they are averse to posting lower returns than their peers, holding 

fixed absolute performance.  These relative-performance concerns induce a form of 

strategic complementarity of fund manager actions.  Specifically, as short-term rates 

begin to rise and fund manager i contemplates whether she should bail out of long-term 

bonds and move into short-term bills, she is more apt to do so if she thinks that some 

other manager, j, is also going to bail--because she is worried that otherwise, she may 

wind up underperforming manager j and finishing last in the relative-performance 

tournament. 

While appearing in a different guise here, this strategic-complementarity effect--

the idea that any one agent is in more of a rush to get out when he or she thinks that 

others may also want to get out--is essentially the same mechanism that drives bank runs 

in the classic work of Diamond and Dybvig, and that, in one manifestation or another, 

creates financial fragility in many other settings.

  However, one thing that is distinctive 

about the variant presented in the current paper is that there is a clear prediction of 

exactly what sets off the run for the exits on the part of money managers--namely, a small 

increase in short rates beyond a certain threshold level.

The model focuses on one particular source of run-like fragility that might 

emanate from the asset-management sector, but there are others.  One that the paper

 This feature is in contrast to many other models in the Diamond-Dybvig (1983) tradition, which have 

multiple equilibria and hence convey a sense of fragility, but have less to say about what underlying 

variable tips the scales toward a run-like equilibrium.  The more pinned-down nature of the model in this 

paper comes from an application of the global-games methodology described in Morris and Shin (2003).
