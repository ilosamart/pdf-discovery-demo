on pre-crisis standards.  This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips 

curve relationship is flatter than in the past, which means that price inflation is likely to 

be less informative regarding labor market tightness than it was previously.3  It therefore 

seems particularly valuable to look beyond inflation and headline unemployment to 

assess the strength of the labor market.  Even when aggregate economic statistics look 

strong, studying geographic areas and demographic groups that are not faring as well can 

point to ways of further improving the economy’s performance. 

The Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor 

force participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the 

growth capacity of the economy.  When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we 

need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive 

price inflation.  At a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely 

to be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to 

consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for 

some prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could 

increase the labor force and boost economic activity.  

More broadly, when a person who was previously unemployed or discouraged 

secures a job, not only does it boost the economy, but that person also may gain a greater 

sense of economic security, self-sufficiency, and self-worth and be better able to invest in 

their family’s future.  With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that 

inhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may better grasp how
