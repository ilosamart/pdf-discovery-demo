Having provided a detailed assessment of the measures Congress chose to require in 

order to address too big to fail, it is worth spending a minute reflecting on what Congress chose 

not to require in the Dodd-Frank Act. In particular, it is noteworthy that Congress did not 

prescribe major changes to scope or scale of systemic institutions in the too-big-to-fail toolkit.14 

One rationale is that the public sector on its own is unlikely to be the best judge of the 

optimal scope and scale of financial institutions.  While the private sector may be in a better 

position to judge the market benefits associated with economies of scope and scale and business 

models associated with particular banking organizations, the public sector is likely to be a better 

judge of the risks that their size, interconnectedness, and complexity pose to the financial system.  

Accordingly, the Dodd-Frank Act assigns regulators the responsibility for calibrating 

requirements such that investors, senior executives, and board members internalize those risks. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the law does not prescribe broad structural changes, some 

observers may judge whether reform has gone far enough based on the extent of changes in the 

scope or scale of the U.S. systemic banking institutions relative to the crisis.  These eight 

banking institutions now hold $10.6 trillion in total assets and account for 57 percent of total 

assets in the U.S. banking system today--not materially different from the $9.4 trillion and 60 

                                                            
14 Two partial exceptions are the Volcker rule and the swaps push-out provision.  The former prevents banking 

organizations from engaging in most forms of proprietary trading and limits their investments in private funds, while 

the latter prohibits the provision of federal assistance to certain swaps entities.  However, these provisions apply to 

banking organizations broadly and are not limited in their scope to large or more complicated institutions.    

     With regard to size, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a cap on concentration for purposes of mergers and 

acquisitions, and includes size thresholds for some of its provisions, but it does not set precise limits on the size of 

financial institutions and imposes no limits on organic growth.  Section 622 of the act, for example, says that a 

“financial company may not merge or consolidate with … another company if the total consolidated liabilities of the 

acquiring financial company upon consummation of the transaction would exceed 10 percent of the aggregate 

consolidated liabilities of all financial institutions,” which limit is currently assessed at approximately $2.16 trillion.
