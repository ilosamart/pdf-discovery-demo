The Role of the Federal Reserve in Faster Payments 

So what is our role at this moment of opportunity for the payment system?  In keeping 

with the Fedâ€™s historical role in payments, five years ago we launched a collaborative effort with 

a broad array of stakeholders to catalyze a safe, efficient, and accessible faster payment system 

for the United States.  As part of that effort, 300 organizations representing consumers, 

businesses, banks, card companies, and technology providers, including many represented here 

today, came together to define expectations for the future of the retail payment system and to 

make recommendations on how to implement those expectations.  The members of the task force 

told us that the Federal Reserve needed to develop a 24/7 settlement system.9  The U.S. Treasury 

echoed this theme in a recent report.10   

Over the past year, we have undertaken an assessment of what the Federal Reserve could 

do to modernize its infrastructure to support interbank settlement of faster payments.  That 

assessment found that 24/7 payment-by-payment interbank settlement in real-time--what we 

refer to as real-time gross settlement (RTGS)--offers clear benefits in minimizing risk and 

maximizing efficiency.  A 24/7 economy with 24/7 real-time payments needs 24/7 real-time 

settlement, and RTGS is the way to achieve this.  That is where we believe that the Federal 

Reserve and the private sector together need to make investments for the future.  In this regard, 

the U.S. retail payment system lags behind some other countries:  the Reserve Bank of Australia 

and the European Central Bank have already implemented or are on the cusp of implementing 

RTGS systems to support private-sector faster payment services.
