Federal Reserve System.  Diversity and inclusion are important to the strength of the 

banking industry, and therefore I am pleased that the Federal Reserve System is

solving problems, and thereby contributing to better outcomes, in research, policy, and 

business.  Studies suggest that increased diversity alters group dynamics and 

decisionmaking in positive ways.  Microeconomic experiments and other research have
