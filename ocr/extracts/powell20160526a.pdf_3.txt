over the two quarters ending in March 2016 is estimated to have averaged only 1 percent 

on an annualized basis.  This estimate may continue to move around as more data come 

in.1  And there are good reasons to think that underlying growth is stronger than these 

recent readings suggest.  Labor market data generally provide a better real-time signal of 

the underlying pace of economic activity.2  In addition, retail sales surged in April, as did 

consumer confidence in May, suggesting that the pause in consumption may have been 

transitory.  Moreover, stronger demand would be more consistent with an environment 

that remains quite supportive of growth, with low interest rates, low gasoline prices, solid 

real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, healthy levels of business 

and household confidence, and continuing strong job creation.  Indeed, current forecasts 

for second-quarter GDP growth are for a rebound to around 2-1/4 percent.3   

Inflation remains below the 2 percent target of the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC), with total inflation as measured by the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures at 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in March and core 

inflation at 1-1/2 percent, both slightly higher than a year earlier.  Core inflation has been 

held down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, as well as 

the indirect effects of lower oil prices on core prices.  As the recent financial market 

tensions have eased, oil prices have increased and the dollar has weakened a bit on net.  If 

oil prices and the dollar remain broadly stable, inflation should move up further over time 

to our 2 percent objective.  Inflation expectations seem to be under some downward 

                                                 
1 For example, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a 70 percent confidence band around the 
estimate of first-quarter GDP would extend from negative 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent, which implies that the 
spending data should be taken with a grain of salt. 
2 Analysis by Board staff finds that lagged employment growth provides a better signal of current-quarter 
GDP or employment growth than does lagged GDP growth.  
3 For example, the May Blue Chip forecast for second-quarter real GDP growth was 2.3 percent, and the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaâ€™s GDPNow forecasting model predicted 2.5 percent, as of May 17.
