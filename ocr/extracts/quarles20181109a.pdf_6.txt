dynamism and ensuring that firms have sufficient notice regarding the capital 

requirements to which they are held.   

In the first years after the financial crisis, as the banking system was dramatically 

ramping up the total amount of capital in the system, this volatility was less of a 

management problem: until we reached reasonably full capitalization, each year every 

bank needed to increase its capital.  If one year that increment was a little higher or a 

little lower than the previous year, that was simply a modest difference of velocity, not 

direction.  At the current juncture, however, both our system as a whole and each of the 

largest banks in that system are fully meeting their capital requirements.  In these 

circumstances, having a highly variable capital requirement presents a significant 

management challenge. 

We are considering ways of preserving the dynamism of stress testing while 

reducing its volatility, and plan to seek comment on a proposal in this area in the not-too-

distant future.  In addition, we are also exploring ways of improving our approach to 

measuring risks in the trading book.  Firms’ trading books are dynamic and complex, as 

firms hold both long and short positions.  Many have noted that a single market shock 

does not adequately capture risks in firms’ trading book, and we agree with those 

comments.  We are exploring ways to incorporate multiple market shocks in our stress 

test without adding volatility to the results and without increasing the compliance burden. 

We are also considering adjusting another element of the SCB proposal in order 

to provide more notice to firms.  Currently, and under the SCB proposal, a firm must 

decide whether to increase or decrease its planned dividends and share repurchases for 

the upcoming year without knowledge of a key constraint: the results of the stress test.  In 

other words, we require a firm to give us a formal plan for dividends and stock 

repurchases without knowing what its effective capital requirement is.  If it guesses 

wrong, it could be publicly shamed for failing the stress test (if its dividends are too high 

relative to capital), or penalized in the markets for inadequate distribution of income (if 

its dividends are too low relative to capital).  Now, while this might at first blush appear 

to be pointless and obdurate cruelty, the reasoning behind the practice was initially 

perfectly sensible:  it reflected the view that firms should think rigorously about their
