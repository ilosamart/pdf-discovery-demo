While crowdfunding may not be as well known in the community development 

context, there are, in fact, existing models of crowdfunding for community development 

that we can learn from.  I understand that several of these existing models will be 

discussed on a panel later this morning.  One local example is Fundrise, an investment 

platform for commercial real estate that gives individuals the opportunity to invest 

directly in neighborhood businesses.  Fundrise started on the H Street corridor here in 

D.C., and has completed 18 real estate deals totaling more than $10 million.  For 

example, this platform attracted 361 people to invest a total of $350,000 toward the 

redevelopment of 906 H Street, N.E.  Currently a vacant building, this property, which is 

located on the quickly revitalizing H Street corridor, now has the funding necessary to 

renovate the property and transform it into a restaurant or retail space.   

A second example is Calvert Foundation’s Community Investment Note.  This is 

an interesting one because Calvert Foundation was essentially doing something akin to 

crowdfunding for community development before Internet platforms became available.  

As you may know, Calvert Foundation is a certified Community Development Financial 

Institution (CDFI) that was established in 1988 as a 501(c)3 when Calvert Investments 

found strong interest among its clients to invest directly in underserved communities.  

Since 1995, 13,000 people have invested in these notes, which provide a financial return 

while economically empowering communities.

   According to Calvert Foundation, these 

13,000 individual investments have collectively helped to create 430,000 jobs for low-

income individuals, built or rehabilitated 17,000 affordable homes, and financed close to
