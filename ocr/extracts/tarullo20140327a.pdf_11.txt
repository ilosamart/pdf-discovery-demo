 A greater challenge for the EU has been dealing with banks headquartered in one EU 

country but doing business in other EU countries under the “single passport,” which basically 

allows for full access in the rest of the EU, with supervision provided only by the home country.  

During the crisis, there were some notable instances of banking stresses and failures involving 

such institutions, with consequent negative effects on depositors, counterparties, and economies 

in other parts of the EU.  Much of the ongoing post-crisis reform agenda in Europe seems 

directed at ensuring the safety and soundness of EU-based institutions.  The most important of 

these changes may be the assumption by the European Central Bank of supervisory 

responsibility for larger euro area banks.  And, as we saw just last week, work continues on the 

long process of creating a credible resolution mechanism for those banks. 

 As a member state of the EU, the United Kingdom of course implements the EU policies 

I have just described.  But that country has applied an additional set of requirements on the local 

operations of foreign banks, particularly with respect to liquidity.  The Prudential Regulation 

Authority of the Bank of England applies local liquidity requirements to commercial and 

investment banking subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks, requiring them to hold local buffers as 

determined by internal stress tests with both 14- and 90-day components.  The assumptions on 

which the stress tests are premised are quite strict.  For example, the U.K. subsidiary generally 

must assume zero inflows from non-U.K. affiliates--even for claims on non-U.K. affiliates with 

short terms that mature within the stress test period--and 100 percent outflows to non-U.K. 

affiliates.  The requirements generated by the test are subject to a supervisory review and add-on 

that for some firms has resulted in a significant increase in the buffer requirement.  Branches of 

foreign commercial banks may in some circumstances be subject to local liquidity requirements 

as well.
