the warnings of their own risk managers with a wave of the hand.  

So what should be the main tools of macroprudential supervision?  Many of them 

are similar to those of microprudential policy.  They take the form of restrictions or 

incentives related to financial firms’ balance sheets.  Still, macroprudential policies differ 

from purely microprudential approaches in that they are intended to protect the financial 

system as a whole and, by extension, the broader economy.  Macroprudential policies 

will be aimed at countering the pro-cyclical nature of credit and leverage, leaning against 

the wind when systemic risk is accumulating.  In addition, they will seek to stem risks 

related to interconnections and spillovers in the financial system.  

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is playing a key role in designing 

this new regulatory regime as part of the Basel III initiative.  And, under Federal Reserve 

leadership, initiatives to implement macroprudential supervision are well under way in 

the United States.  Policymakers here and abroad agree that macroprudential policy must 

include requirements to hold more and higher-quality capital.  And capital requirements 

must be reformulated to reduce the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage.  Financial 

institutions may be required to build capital buffers in good times, which they can run 

down in bad times, thereby limiting credit growth during booms and mitigating credit 

contraction in downturns.  Banks may also be required to have, in addition to their 

standard equity buffers, contingent capital in the form of debt that is convertible to equity 

if they experience significant losses.  This additional capital would protect them from 

insolvency during busts while allowing them to benefit from debt finance in boom times.  

U.S. regulators have also been charged with developing heightened prudential standards
