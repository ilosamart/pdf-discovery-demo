than anything in our experience.  We are developing the tools to manage our enlarged balance 

sheet in support of policy tightening when the time comes, and we will need to deploy them in 

ways that reinforce our ability to achieve our macroeconomic objectives.  That won’t be easy 

since we’ve never had so many levers to manipulate before, but the FOMC has been giving 

considerable thought to this issue, and I’m confident that we will find the right balance and 

sequence of actions to support our basic policy decisions. 

Some Implications of Uncertainty   

As this last point illustrates, we are still in the midst of a very unusual period in U.S. 

economic history and therefore in the conduct of monetary policy.  Policy always operates in an 

environment of uncertainty.  The events of the past three years have highlighted to me yet again 

our limited knowledge of the dynamics of the financial system, the economy, and the interactions 

between them.   

I can be reasonably certain of only one point:  My economic forecast is highly likely to 

be wrong--but I don’t know how.  One implication of this pervasive uncertainty is that any 

statement about the future path of monetary policy must be conditional--dependent on the 

economy following the expected path.  Although the FOMC has stated that the federal funds rate 

is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, this statement explicitly depends on 

an economic outlook similar to the one I have given today.  We cannot provide a precise 

timetable for when short-term interest rates will begin to return to normal because that depends 

on the evolution of actual and projected activity and inflation.   

Another implication of uncertainty is that policymakers need to be open to alternative 

views about how best to set policy over time to stabilize prices and achieve maximum 

employment.  All models of the economy are flawed to some degree, and a policymaker cannot
