face value. 

And now to the bottom line:  The title of my speech is an incomplete quotation of 

something Paul Samuelson once said.  What Samuelson said was this, “I’d rather have 

Bob Solow than an econometric model, but I’d rather have Bob Solow with an 

econometric model than without one.” And Samuelson, who was a shameless eclectic, 

would almost certainly have said essentially the same thing about policy rules. 

 Thank you.
