The considerations I just mentioned have led most private-sector forecasters to 

project that growth will continue in 2019 but at a somewhat slower pace than in 2018.  At 

the Federal Reserve, in our most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median 

participant on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projected that in 2019, GDP 

growth of 2 percent will be the modal, or most likely, outcome; that core PCE inflation 

will rise to 2 percent; and that the unemployment rate will fall a bit further, to 3.7 percent, 

by the end of the year.  Again, these are modal outcomes, and, of course, my FOMC 

colleagues and I should and do factor in risks on either side of these projections in our 

policy deliberations. 

Monetary Policy 

Given this outlook for the U.S. economy, we decided at our March meeting that 

the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate.2  The federal funds rate is now in the 

broad range of estimates of neutral--the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain 

the economy.  Our baseline economic projections see economic growth for the year as a 

whole running somewhat above the Committee’s median estimate of its longer-run trend 

and core PCE inflation remaining near our 2 percent objective.  For these reasons, we 

have indicated we can be patient as we assess what adjustments, if any, will be 

appropriate to the stance of monetary policy. 

At our March meeting, the Committee also released revised Balance Sheet 

Normalization Principles and Plans, and it announced that the FOMC intends to slow the
