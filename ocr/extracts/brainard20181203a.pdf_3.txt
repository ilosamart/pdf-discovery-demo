Still Changing 

At the first Treasury conference in 2015, market participants were still processing 

the results of the Joint Staff Report.2  It came as a surprise to many that the high-

frequency trading activity conducted by “proprietary trading firms,” or PTFs, accounted 

for a majority of trading in the interdealer platforms that are so central to the Treasury 

market.  Indeed, the names of the largest proprietary trading firms were new even to 

some seasoned professionals.  At that time, the discussion often drew a very bright line 

between traditional dealers and proprietary trading firms and, in particular, the trading 

activities associated with each.

they are trading.  Now, as then, broker-dealers intermediate financial transactions 

primarily to serve their clients’ needs, and, for this reason, they are required to register 

with FINRA.  Conversely, the hallmark of proprietary trading firm activity was and still

and many other forms of oversight.  This distinction remains important today.
