the choice of inflation measure matters for the interpretation of this episode, as alternative 

measures gave policymakers somewhat different signals.  Notably, core PCE inflation for 

2003 was initially reported, in the first quarter of 2004, as having slowed to about 

1 percent, and it appeared to be on a steep downward trajectory.7  These data heightened 

concerns about deflation on the FOMC.  In contrast, the CPI data released at the same 

time showed core inflation for 2003 of about 2 percent.  In this case, data revisions 

ultimately raised estimates of PCE inflation for that period, implying that deflation was 

less of a risk than was thought at the time.  But that such revisions would occur could not 

be known in advance, and policy decisions, of course, must be made based on the 

information available at the time. 

 For my purposes today, however, the most significant concern regarding the use 

of the standard Taylor rule as a policy benchmark is its implication that monetary policy 

should depend on currently observed values of inflation and output.  In particular, the 

Taylor rule recommendation shown in Slide 3 relates the prescribed policy interest rate to 

the inflation rate and output gap that correspond to the same quarter in which the policy 

decision was made.8  However, because monetary policy works with a lag, effective 

monetary policy must take into account the forecast values of the goal variables, rather 

than the current values.  Indeed, in that spirit, the FOMC issues regular economic 

projections, and these projections have been shown to have an important influence on 

policy decisions (Orphanides and Wieland, 2008). 

                                                       
7 Inflation measures are on a four-quarter basis.  Core inflation excludes the prices of food and energy.  
Because it excludes the most volatile components of the price index, core inflation was often used by the 
FOMC as an indicator of the underlying trend of inflation. 
8 More precisely, because inflation is measured on a four-quarter basis, the current inflation rate 
corresponds to the rate of price increase over the current quarter and the prior three quarters.
