England, helped quickly push bond yields back down to levels that these central 

banks regarded as appropriate to their economic situation.  For example, the Bank 

of England’s threshold strategy announced in the summer of 2013--promising to 

keep policy rates extraordinarily low at least until unemployment fell below 7 

percent--lowered the expected path of policy rates significantly by pushing back 

expectations of liftoff.  

• A third reason likely to lessen adverse spillovers is that a number of EMEs have 

markedly improved fundamentals, even relative to several years ago.  India is a 

good example.  India was dubbed one of the “Fragile Five” economies during the 

taper tantrum and, during that episode, experienced large capital outflows, a spike 

in borrowing costs, and sizable exchange rate depreciation.10  Since that time, 

India has markedly improved its macroeconomic framework, cutting its inflation 

rate by half to around 5 percent, anchoring inflation expectations more securely, 

and reducing what had been large and persistent fiscal and current account 

deficits.  Somewhat more generally, the improved macroeconomic frameworks in 

many EMEs achieved over the past couple of decades--with inflation targeting 

often playing a key role--has enabled these economies to pursue countercyclical 

policies to a much greater degree than in the past and should help insulate them 

from monetary policy spillovers.11 

                                                 
10  Basu, Eichengreen, and Gupta (2014) describe how India’s economy and financial markets were 
affected by the taper tantrum. 
11  Coulibaly (2012) draws on a large cross-country data set to investigate empirically the factors that have 
allowed EMEs greater scope to pursue countercyclical monetary policies, and it highlights the importance 
of both inflation targeting and financial reforms that enhance transparency.
