It is an honor to be invited to deliver the annual Sandridge lecture to the Virginia 

Association of Economists.  This series has a long history of important discussions, including the 

now-famous global savings glut speech by then-Governor Ben Bernanke in 2005.  I confess to 

being quite intimidated by this illustrious history, but I hope to heighten interest in my own 

contribution by offering you something prized by economists everywhere--fresh data.  I am 

going to draw on preliminary data from the Federal Reserveâ€™s Survey of Consumer Finances 

(SCF) to talk about the impact of the financial crisis on the wealth of consumers and small 

business owners.   

As the recent financial crisis unfolded, I kept coming back to two questions that seemed 

central to understanding the way consumers and small businesses might respond to changes in 

their own circumstances during the crisis and, importantly, how their attitudes toward spending 

and investing might change going forward.   

The first question had to do with the relationship between household wealth and the 

saving rate.  And as a baby boomer myself, I wondered whether the relationship between wealth 

and savings might be especially important as the baby boomers faced a change in wealth just as 

most were planning to retire.  So I am going to talk first about how changes in wealth impacted 

the spending plans and risk tolerance of consumers closest to retirement.   

The other question that continually arises is whether the sharp reduction in small business 

credit was due to changes in the supply of credit, demand for credit, or creditworthiness of 

potential borrowers.  While the SCF data do not offer any definitive answers, they do give some 

previously unavailable insight into the role of creditworthiness, if we use changes in wealth as 

proxies for changes in creditworthiness.
