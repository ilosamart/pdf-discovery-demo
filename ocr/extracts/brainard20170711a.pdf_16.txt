Figure 1.  Home Demand Shock 
Figure 1 illustrates the case of a favorable demand shock in the home country. 

The solid lines illustrate the case when Home uses the short-term interest rate as its active 

policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, consistent with a desire to delay balance 

sheet normalization.   

The policy reaction is calibrated to be sufficiently aggressive that home GDP 

always remains at baseline (see column 2 of Table 1).  The higher policy rate path (that 

is, higher rc) causes the long-term interest rate (panel A) to rise, which in turn induces the 

real exchange rate to appreciate (panel B).  The stronger currency and an expansion in 

domestic absorption (panel C) causes a deterioration in net exports (panel D).  At the end 

of the period shown, domestic demand has nearly returned to baseline, while net exports 

are just a bit below baseline--consistent with Home country’s GDP remaining at baseline 

(panel E).  Because foreign monetary policy rates is assumed to remain on hold, foreign 

GDP (panel F) rises by the improvement in its net exports (that is, by the mirror image of 

panel D, given that foreign domestic absorption is unchanged).  

The dashed lines illustrate the case of a favorable demand shock in the Home 

country when the central bank opts to tighten exclusively through reducing its balance 

sheet (again, by enough to keep output at potential--see column 3 of Table 1).  Long-term 

interest rates (panel A) rise in response, but the exchange rate appreciates less in this case 

(panel B), reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to unconventional 

monetary policy actions (φu < φc ).  Net exports decline (panel D) by less--reflecting both 

the smaller exchange rate appreciation and a smaller rise in absorption (panel C)--which 

translates into less of a boost to foreign GDP (panel F) than when the home country 

adjusts through conventional policy.
