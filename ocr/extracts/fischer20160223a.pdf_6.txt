sometimes more uncertain than at other times--and all monetary policymakers can really 

be sure of is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect.  That 

is why the Committee has indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent, 

which is to say that we will adjust policy appropriately in light of economic and financial 

events to best foster conditions consistent with the attainment of our employment and 

inflation objectives.   

As you know, in making our policy decisions, my FOMC colleagues and I spend 

considerable time assessing the incoming economic and financial information and its 

implications for the economic outlook.  But we must also consider some other issues, two 

of which I would like to mention briefly today.   

First, most estimates of the full employment rate of unemployment are close to 

5 percent.  The actual rate of unemployment is now slightly below 5 percent, and the 

median view of the members of the FOMC is that it will decline further, perhaps even to 

the vicinity of 4.7 percent.  The question is, should we be concerned about that 

possibility?  In my view, a modest overshoot of this sort would be appropriate in current 

circumstances for two reasons.  The first reason is that other measures of labor market 

conditions--such as the fraction of workers with part-time employment who would prefer 

to work full time and the number of people not actively looking for work who would like 

to work--indicate that more slack may remain in the labor market than the unemployment 

rate alone would suggest.  And the second reason is that with inflation currently well 

below 2 percent, a modest overshoot could actually be helpful in moving inflation back to 

2 percent more rapidly.  Nonetheless, a persistent large overshoot of our employment 

mandate would risk an undesirable rise in inflation that might require a relatively abrupt
