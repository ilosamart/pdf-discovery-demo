third reason is that investors may be wary of investing in securities collateralized by non-

QM loans because it is difficult to gauge the risks.  A borrower’s ability to repay a loan 

that is not a QM may be based on “soft” information or on idiosyncratic factors that are 

difficult for the investor to observe or monitor.  Investors may respond to this information 

asymmetry by requiring a higher risk premium or by refusing to purchase these securities 

altogether.  For all of these reasons, the non-QM market could become small and illiquid, 

which would further increase the cost of these loans. 

Loans eligible to be purchased, insured, or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie 

Mac, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the U.S. Department of Veterans 

Affairs, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture are automatically designated as QMs.  

This provision is slated to end no later than January 2021.  As long as such loans remain 

an outsized share of mortgage originations, the QM rule may have less of an effect on the 

availability of mortgage credit. 

As more private capital returns to the mortgage market, though, two aspects of the 

QM rule will have a more significant effect on access to credit:  the debt-to-income (DTI) 

requirement and the provisions that affect interest rates, points, and fees.  Turning first to 

DTI, under the QM definition, borrower payments on all debts and some recurring 

obligations--such as mortgages, credit card debt, student loans, auto loans, alimony, and 

child support--must be 43 percent or less of borrower income.  To gauge the possible 

number of borrowers affected by this requirement, the Board staff looked at households 

in the Survey of Consumer Finances that purchased a home with mortgage credit in the 

two years preceding the survey.  In the 2001, 2004, and 2010 waves of the survey, about 

15 to 20 percent of these households had payments that exceeded 43 percent of income,
