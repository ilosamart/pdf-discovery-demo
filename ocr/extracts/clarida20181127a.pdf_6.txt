distinct roles that data dependence should play in the formulation and communication of 

monetary policy. 

It is important to state up-front that data dependence is not, in and of itself, a 

monetary policy strategy.  A monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine 

incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment--and 

humility!--to formulate, and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent 

with our policy objectives.  In the case of the Fed, those objectives are assigned to us by 

the Congress, and they are to achieve maximum employment and price stability.  

Importantly, because households and firms must make long-term saving and investment 

decisions and because these decisions--directly or indirectly--depend on the expected 

future path for the policy rate, the central bank should find a way to communicate and 

explain how incoming data are or are not changing the expected path for the policy rate 

consistent with best meeting its objectives.4  Absent such communication, inefficient 

divergences between public expectations and central bank intentions for the policy rate 

path can emerge and persist in ways that are costly to the economy when reversed. 

Within this general framework, let me now consider two distinct ways in which I 

think that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent.  U.S. monetary 

policy has for some time and will, I believe, continue to be data dependent in the sense 

that incoming data reveal at the time of each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

meeting where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to the goals of 

                                                 
4 For example, long-term bond yields can be written as the sum of the expected path of the policy rate plus 
a term premium.  The exchange rate between two countries can be written as the sum of the policy rate path 
differential between two countries plus a risk premium.  So even for households and firms that do not 
directly care about the policy rate path, they do care about long-term bond yields and exchange rates that 
reflect this path.
