upcoming meetings, I look forward to what promises to be an interesting discussion on 

these issues with my colleagues.      

Finally, in assessing our balance sheet policy, it is important to point out that the 

Fed remains entirely focused on meeting its statutory dual-mandate objectives of 

maximum employment and price stability.  The normalization of the balance sheet is not 

a competing goal.  If ever it appears that our plans for the balance sheet are running 

counter to the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, we would quickly reassess 

our approach to the balance sheet.
