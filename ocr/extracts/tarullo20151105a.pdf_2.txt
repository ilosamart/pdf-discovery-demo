The regulation of financial institutions is necessarily a dynamic exercise.  Growth or 

innovations in banking may create new risks that prompt regulatory change.  The new 

requirements, in turn, incentivize or disincentivize certain actions by financial institutions, 

including shifts in activity that may start anew the process of regulatory response.  The 

regulation of international banking reflects this general pattern, but because internationally active 

banks can quickly transmit financial problems across national boundaries, it also features the 

question of who should be doing the regulating in a dynamic financial environment.   

Following the financial crisis, during which some internationally active banks posed 

special problems for both home and host countries, this issue has commanded attention 

reminiscent of the aftermaths of the Herstatt failure of the 1970s and the Bank of Commerce and 

Credit International (BCCI) failure of the early 1990s.  Unlike those earlier instances, though, 

this renewed prominence of the “who does the regulating” question has accompanied a major 

reconsideration of what regulation is appropriate.  Today I would like to address both the “who” 

and the “what” issues in the regulation of international banking.  My theme is hardly an original 

one--namely, that in the absence of either a global regulator or completely insular national 

banking systems, we must continue to work toward a system of shared responsibilities to assure 

both home and host regulators that internationally active banks are subject to adequate oversight 

and controls. 

I will begin by reviewing briefly the benefits and risks associated with international 

banking and then identifying the different models for allocating responsibility for the oversight 

of international banks.  After noting the shortcomings of the system for regulating internationally 

active banks that prevailed before the financial crisis and developments in the intervening years,
