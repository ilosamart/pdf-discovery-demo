legacy systems. This type of settlement entails a buildup of obligations—like IOUs between 

banks—that could present real risks to the financial system in times of stress. These are not 

resilient long-term solutions for our dynamic economy and the banks that support it.  

We are seeing some companies looking to establish a payment system that bypasses our 

banks and our currency. Facebook’s Libra project raises numerous concerns that will take time to 

assess and address. But one thing is clear: consumers and businesses across the country want and 

expect real-time payments, and the banks they trust should be able to provide this service 

securely—whatever their size. To provide everyone with the ability to send and receive funds 

securely on a 24x7x365 basis, banks need to embrace and invest in real-time innovations, and the 

Federal Reserve needs to provide a safe and efficient real-time interbank clearing and settlement 

service accessible to all banks. 

We are proud of our strong record of cooperating with and supporting private-sector 

services, while fostering competition for public benefit. We have provided vital support to the 

sole private-sector provider of real-time settlement for faster payments, and we will continue to 

do so. The Federal Reserve provided a joint account to enable the private-sector operator to offer 

real-time payments. Moreover, today we are announcing our intent to explore the expansion of 

Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service operating hours to support the efficiency 

of the joint account structure for the private-sector real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service and 

provide broader benefits. That said, the joint account structure, with its requirement of 

prefunding and settlement on a private ledger, is fundamentally different from the approach the 

Federal Reserve will use to settle transactions directly between banks.
