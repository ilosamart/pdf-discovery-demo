To the extent that the expansion of these networks was tied to export-led growth 

that depended partly on preferential treatment of the export sector, more-balanced growth 

in these economies may also result in a better allocation of production across countries.  

If growth of trade is lower as a result, that is not necessarily a problem.  However, there 

is a well-established literature indicating that trade encourages greater efficiency, along 

with the dissemination of technological innovation, and slower growth of trade could 

reduce this effect. 

It also bears noting that Asian trade growth has been accompanied by the creation 

of a variety of intraregional and broader trade agreements--including the 10-nation 

ASEAN and membership in the World Trade Organization, which China achieved in 

2001 and Vietnam in 2007--as well as a host of bilateral agreements, both within and 

outside the region.  I will return briefly to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) at the end 

of the talk. 

Finally, demographics are an additional factor likely to lower growth in the 

region, particularly in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and China, 

notwithstanding the recent relaxation of the one-child policy.  As shown in table 3, both 

China and Thailand have a median population age of about 37 years, about the same as 

the median in the United States.  The median age is even higher in Hong Kong, Korea, 

and Singapore, all of which have medians of 40 years or more.  Relatedly, as shown in 

the second column of the table, China, Thailand, and the relatively developed emerging 

Asian economies are expected to have a significant percentage of their populations older 

than 65 years by 2030, with the proportion similar to that in the United States, though still 

below those in Germany and Japan.  In contrast, demographics are less of an issue
