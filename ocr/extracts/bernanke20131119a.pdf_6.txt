maximum employment and price stability are complementary.  When they are not, the 

FOMC has stated that it will pursue a balanced approach in the pursuit of its dual 

mandate, working to ensure that both inflation and employment are close to their desired 

values in the longer term.   

In short, the Federal Reserve, like many central banks around the world, has made

more effective.   

The financial crisis and its aftermath, however, have raised even greater 

challenges for, and demands on, the Federal Reserve’s communication.  We have had to

of housing prices and construction, new financial shocks in Europe and elsewhere, 

restrictive fiscal policies at all levels of government, and, of course, the enormous blows 

to output and employment associated with the worst U.S. recession since the Great 

Depression.  Moreover, for the first time since the FOMC began using the federal funds

meaningfully further.  Consequently, to provide needed support to the economic recovery 

and minimize the risk of deflation, the Federal Reserve has had to adopt new policy tools, 

which bring their own communication challenges.  In the remainder of my talk, I will 

discuss how the Federal Reserve has used communication to try to further inform the 

public’s expectations about how the FOMC will employ what are currently its two
