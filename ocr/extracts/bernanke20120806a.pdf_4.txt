Although the field is still young, there have been interesting developments in the 

measurement of economic well-being.  In a commencement address two years ago titled 

“The Economics of Happiness,” I spoke about the concepts of happiness and life 

satisfaction from the perspective of economics and other social science research.1  

Following the growing literature, I define “happiness” as a short-term state of awareness 

that depends on a person’s perceptions of one’s immediate reality, as well as on 

immediate external circumstances and outcomes.  By “life satisfaction” I mean a longer-

term state of contentment and well-being that results from a person’s experiences over 

time.  Surveys and experimental studies have made progress in identifying the 

determinants of happiness and life satisfaction.  Interestingly, income and wealth do 

contribute to self-reported happiness, but the relationship is more complex and context-

dependent than standard utility theory would suggest.2  Other important contributors to 

individuals’ life satisfaction are a strong sense of support from belonging to a family or 

core group and a broader community, a sense of control over one’s life, a feeling of 

confidence or optimism about the future, and an ability to adapt to changing 

circumstances.  Indeed, an interesting finding in the literature is that the overwhelming 

majority of people in the United States and in many other countries report being very 

happy or pretty happy on a daily basis--a finding that researchers link to people’s intrinsic 

abilities to adapt and find satisfaction in their lives even in very difficult circumstances.3

2 Canonical models of economic decisionmaking presume individual maximization of “utility,” or well-
being.  They tend to focus on the consumption of goods or services and assume that more consumption is 
preferred to less.  For example, see Andrew Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, and Jerry R Green (1995), 
Microeconomic Theory (New York:  Oxford University Press).
