liquidity”3  (2) to strengthen the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and 

supervision; (3) to build the capacity for undertaking effective macroprudential regulation 

and supervision; (4) to develop suitable resolution regimes for financial institutions; (5) 

to strengthen the infrastructure of financial markets, including markets for derivative 

transactions; (6) to improve compensation practices in financial institutions; (7) to 

strengthen international coordination of regulation and supervision, particularly with 

regard to the regulation and resolution of global systemically important financial 

institutions, later known as G-SIFIs; (8) to find appropriate ways of dealing with the 

shadow banking system; and (9) to improve the performance of credit rating agencies, 

which were deeply involved in the collapse of markets for collateralized and securitized 

lending instruments, especially those based on mortgage finance.  

Rather than seek to give a scorecard on progress on all the aspects of the reform 

programs suggested from 2007 to 2009, I want to focus on three topics of particular 

salience mentioned earlier: capital and liquidity, macroprudential supervision, and too big 

to fail. 

Capital and Liquidity Ratios 

  At one level, the story on capital and liquidity ratios is very simple: From the 

viewpoint of the stability of the financial system, more of each is better.   

This is the principle that lies behind the vigorous campaign waged by Anat 

Admati and Martin Hellwig to increase bank capital ratios, set out in their book, The 

3 Group of Thirty (2009), p. 21. For an incisive account of measures to deal with the TBTF problem, see 
the 2009 speech by my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Daniel K. Tarullo (2009), “Confronting Too Big 
to Fail,” speech delivered at the Exchequer Club, Washington, D.C., October 21,
