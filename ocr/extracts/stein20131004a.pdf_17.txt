issue stable-value demandable liabilities with no capital buffer or other explicit loss-

absorption capacity—which make them highly vulnerable to runs by their depositors.  I 

welcome the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission on this front, particularly 

its focus on floating net asset values, and look forward to concrete action.  Another 

source of fragility arises from money funds investing in repo loans collateralized by 

assets that they are unwilling or unable to hold if things go bad.  This feature creates an 

incentive for them to withdraw repo financing from broker-dealers at the first sign of 

counterparty risk, even if the underlying collateral is in good shape.    

 I’m sure we will hear much more about this last set of issues over the remainder 

of the conference today.  I look forward to the discussions.  Thank you.
