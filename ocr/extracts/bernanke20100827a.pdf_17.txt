money markets such as the federal funds market to become much less liquid, as near-zero 

returns might induce many participants and market-makers to exit.  In normal times the 

Fed relies heavily on a well-functioning federal funds market to implement monetary 

policy, so we would want to be careful not to do permanent damage to that market.  

A rather different type of policy option, which has been proposed by a number of 

economists, would have the Committee increase its medium-term inflation goals above 

levels consistent with price stability.  I see no support for this option on the FOMC.  

Conceivably, such a step might make sense in a situation in which a prolonged period of 

deflation had greatly weakened the confidence of the public in the ability of the central 

bank to achieve price stability, so that drastic measures were required to shift 

expectations.  Also, in such a situation, higher inflation for a time, by compensating for 

the prior period of deflation, could help return the price level to what was expected by 

people who signed long-term contracts, such as debt contracts, before the deflation 

began.   

However, such a strategy is inappropriate for the United States in current 

circumstances.  Inflation expectations appear reasonably well-anchored, and both 

inflation expectations and actual inflation remain within a range consistent with price 

stability.  In this context, raising the inflation objective would likely entail much greater 

costs than benefits.  Inflation would be higher and probably more volatile under such a 

policy, undermining confidence and the ability of firms and households to make longer-

term plans, while squandering the Fedâ€™s hard-won inflation credibility.  Inflation 

expectations would also likely become significantly less stable, and risk premiums in 

asset markets--including inflation risk premiums--would rise.  The combination of
