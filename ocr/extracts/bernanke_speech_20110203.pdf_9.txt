people receiving benefits.  Currently, there are about five individuals between the ages of 

20 and 64 for each person aged 65 and older.  By 2030, when most of the baby boomers 

will have retired, this ratio is projected to decline to around 3.4  Overall, the projected 

fiscal pressures associated with Social Security are considerably smaller than the 

pressures associated with federal health programs, but they are still notable.  

The CBOâ€™s long-term budget projections, by design, do not account for the likely 

adverse economic effects of such high debt and deficits.  But if government debt and 

deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned, the economic and financial effects 

would be severe.  Sustained high rates of government borrowing would both drain funds 

away from private investment and increase our debt to foreigners, with adverse long-run 

effects on U.S. output, incomes, and standards of living.  Moreover, diminishing investor 

confidence that deficits will be brought under control would ultimately lead to sharply 

rising interest rates on government debt and, potentially, to broader financial turmoil.  In 

a vicious circle, high and rising interest rates would cause debt-service payments on the 

federal debt to grow even faster, causing further increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio and 

making fiscal adjustment all the more difficult.   

How much adjustment is needed to restore fiscal sustainability in the United 

States?  To help answer this question, it is useful to apply the concept of the primary 

budget deficit, which is the government budget deficit excluding interest payments on the 

national debt.  To stabilize the ratio of federal debt to the GDP--a convenient benchmark 

for assessing fiscal sustainability--the primary budget deficit must be reduced to zero.5  

                                                 
4 These figures are the inverse of the ratio of the population age 65 or older as a percentage of the 
population ages 20 to 64 shown in figure 3-2, p. 47, in CBO, The Long-Term Budget Outlook, in note 2. 
5 This result requires that the nominal rate of interest paid on government debt equal the rate of growth of 
nominal GDP, a condition which usually serves as a reasonable approximation.  If the rate of interest on
