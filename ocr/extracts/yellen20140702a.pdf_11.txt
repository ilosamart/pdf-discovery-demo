what the limits of such tools may be, and when, because of such limits, it may be 

appropriate to adjust monetary policy to “get in the cracks” that persist in the 

macroprudential framework.11 

In weighing these questions, I find it helpful to distinguish between tools that 

primarily build through-the-cycle resilience against adverse financial developments and 

those primarily intended to lean against financial excesses.12   

Building Resilience 

Tools that build resilience aim to make the financial system better able to 

withstand unexpected adverse developments.  For example, requirements to hold 

sufficient loss-absorbing capital make financial institutions more resilient in the face of 

unexpected losses.  Such requirements take on a macroprudential dimension when they 

are most stringent for the largest, most systemically important firms, thereby minimizing 

the risk that losses at such firms will reverberate through the financial system.  Resilience 

against runs can be enhanced both by stronger capital positions and requirements for 

sufficient liquidity buffers among the most interconnected firms.  An effective resolution 

regime for SIFIs can also enhance resilience by better protecting the financial system 

from contagion in the event of a SIFI collapse.  Further, the stability of the financial 

system can be enhanced through measures that address interconnectedness between 

financial firms, such as margin and central clearing requirements for derivatives 

transactions.  Finally, a regulatory umbrella wide enough to cover previous gaps in the
