silos, and coordinating government agencies, philanthropy, and the private sector to meet 

the needs of local communities requires extraordinary commitment and effective 

leadership.  But persistence and effort pay off.  The holistic approach has the power to 

transform neighborhoods and, as a result, the lives of their lower-income residents.  

Let me give another example, drawn from the experience of the East Lake 

neighborhood in Atlanta, a neighborhood that exemplified the effects of concentrated 

poverty.  In the early 1990s, East Lake had a crime rate 18 times higher than the national 

average.  Nearly 60 percent of adults received public assistance, and only 5 percent of 

fifth grade children were able to meet state academic performance standards.  A local 

philanthropist, Tom Cousins, wanted to improve the quality of life in this neighborhood 

by de-concentrating its poverty.

  But he understood that East Lake’s problems were 

interconnected:  Replacing substandard housing would do little to attract families to the 

neighborhood if it lacked good schools, but schools couldn’t perform well if students 

feared for their safety, arrived hungry, and were otherwise unprepared or unable to learn.  

High dropout rates in turn fueled the neighborhood’s high rates of unemployment and 

crime. 

To deal with the interconnectedness of the neighborhood’s problems, Cousins 

determined to attack them simultaneously.  He created the East Lake Foundation to 

facilitate transformative change.  The foundation partnered with the Atlanta Housing 

Authority to replace the neighborhood’s low-income housing project with mixed-income 

housing that accommodated former tenants and other very low-income residents as well
