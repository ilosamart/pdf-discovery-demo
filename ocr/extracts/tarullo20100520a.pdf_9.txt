foreign central banks to date have elicited only a modest demand.3

Even if usage increases significantly, the risks to the Federal Reserve, and by implication 

the risks to the U.S. taxpayer, are minimal.  U.S. interests are safeguarded by the foreign currency 

held by the Federal Reserve during the term of the swap.  Moreover, our exposures are not to the 

institutions in the foreign countries ultimately receiving the dollar liquidity but to the foreign 

central banks.  Over the life of the previous temporary swap program (from December 2007 to 

February 2010), all swaps were repaid in full, and the Federal Reserve earned $5.8 billion in 

interest.  Finally, the Federal Reserve bears no market pricing risk in these drawings, since the 

swaps are designed so that fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates have no effect on the 

payments made at the end of the transaction.      

  However, even in such 

instances, the existence of these facilities can reassure market participants that funds will be 

available in case of need, and thus help forestall hoarding of liquidity, a feature that exacerbated 

stresses during the global financial crisis.   

Conclusion 

 The agreement of the Federal Reserve to reinstate foreign exchange swap arrangements 

was designed not to insulate banks and investors from losses they may incur, but as a prudent 

effort to help minimize the risk of financial turmoil in Europe, with the consequences that would 

ensue for the global financial system, including the United States.  In the worst case, such turmoil 

could lead to a replay of the freezing up of financial markets that we witnessed in 2008.  With 

unemployment remaining quite high, and with continued need for balance sheet repair by many 

businesses, financial institutions, and households, it is particularly important that the United States 

not sustain a significant external shock.
