While repos are generally a low risk, low margin business, they proved to be 

vulnerable to runs during the financial crisis, when concerns of possible defaults by 

large financial firms led to a sudden withdrawal of funding from repo markets.  As

York produced a set of measures that have sharply reduced the amount of intraday 

credit and improved risk management practices in the tri-party repo market.  These

significantly reduced the likelihood of a borrower default.  But if a default were to 

take place, some counterparties, particularly those unwilling or unable to hold 

sizable positions, would retain strong incentives to sell assets quickly regardless of 

the price received.     

A repo CCP could help to address this “fire sale” risk.  CCPs have rule-

transfer positions to solvent broker-dealers, or hedge positions and auction them

clearing members, and thus to monitor and manage counterparty and market-risk
