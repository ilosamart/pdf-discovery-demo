important economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor market developments 

carefully.   

Economic conditions here in the Philadelphia metropolitan area have improved 

broadly in line with national trends.  During the downturn, the Philadelphia area and the 

city itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did for the nation as a whole, but 

unemployment took longer to recover thereafter.4  In the City of Philadelphia, in 

particular, unemployment was still running above 10 percent as recently as 2013.  But 

unemployment here has fallen appreciably since then, helped by a revival in residential 

and commercial construction that is evident around the city.   

While the general picture of the labor market is largely positive, some people are 

still struggling.  Unemployment rates rose more during the recession for African 

Americans and Hispanics than for the nation overall, and even though those rates have 

also come down by more during the economic expansion, unemployment remains higher 

for these groups.  Unfortunately, those gaps have not narrowed noticeably relative to 

where they were before the recession.  Unemployment rates for young African American 

and Hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high, and one important 

benefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job 

opportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high 

unemployment.  To be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor market 

outcomes of minority groups are not amenable to monetary policy, and measures beyond 

the scope of monetary policy should be considered to alleviate the economic challenges 

                                                 
4 The discussion refers to data for the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan 
Statistical Area.  Since 1990, the areaâ€™s unemployment rate has averaged about 1/4 percentage point lower 
than the national rate.  By contrast, in the City of Philadelphia itself, the unemployment rate has generally 
run about 2 percentage points higher than for the broader metropolitan area.
