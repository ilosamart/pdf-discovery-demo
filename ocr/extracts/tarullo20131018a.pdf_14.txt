Key Attributes.  Mitigating the obstacles to SIFI resolution will require, at a minimum, that key 

foreign jurisdictions implement national resolution regimes consistent with the Key Attributes.  

While compatible host-country resolution regimes are necessary for orderly cross-border 

resolutions, they may not be sufficient.  Most importantly, home-country resolution of a global 

systemic financial firm may be nearly as difficult if creditors and counterparties of the firmâ€™s 

foreign operations run as will likely happen if domestic creditors and counterparties do so.  

Possibilities for such runs may be reduced by well-developed and transparent arrangements for 

cooperation between home- and host-country officials in resolving these firms.  The recent joint 

paper by the FDIC and Bank of England is an important example of such cooperation.11  But, 

standing alone, even the best of cooperative arrangements may not remove all salient obstacles. 

One key challenge is that certain Title II stabilization mechanisms, including the one-day 

stay provision with respect to over-the-counter derivatives and certain other financial contracts, 

may not apply outside the United States.  Accordingly, counterparties to financial contracts with 

the foreign subsidiaries and branches of a U.S. firm may have contractual rights and substantial 

economic incentives to terminate their transactions as soon as the U.S. parent enters into 

resolution.  Equivalent opportunities and incentives may apply to counterparties of U.S. 

operations of foreign banking organizations.   

One approach to addressing this problem would be for domestic legislatures to amend 

bankruptcy and insolvency laws to recognize stays imposed in home-country resolution 

procedures consistent with international standards.  However, it may be difficult to get such legal 

changes on roughly comparable terms in all relevant jurisdictions, much less to conclude a 

binding international agreement along those lines.
