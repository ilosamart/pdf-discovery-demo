declines in equity prices can put downward pressure on spending and confidence.  From 

the financial stability perspective, however, today we do not see dangerous excesses in 

the stock market.  

Monitoring Likely Triggers for Financial Distress  

I mentioned the distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks, or triggers.  In 

addition to monitoring vulnerabilities under our four-part framework, we also consult a 

broad range of contacts regarding sources of risk that might trigger distress at any given 

time.  For example, discussions with contacts currently point to risks emanating from the 

normalization of monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere, the unsettled state 

of trade negotiations, Brexit negotiations, budget discussions between Italy and the 

European Union, and cyber-related disruptions.12  

Having identified possible triggers, we can assess how a particular trigger is likely 

to interact with known vulnerabilities.  A good current example is that of Brexit.  U.S. 

banks and broker-dealers participate in some of the markets most likely to be affected by 

Brexit.  The Fed and other regulators have been working with U.S. financial institutions 

that have operations in the European Union or the United Kingdom to prepare for the full 

range of possible outcomes to the negotiations.  In addition, the scenarios used in the 

stress tests routinely feature severe global contractions and show that U.S. banks have the 

capital to weather even highly disruptive events.  

                                                 
12 The Financial Stability Report does not currently have a standard set of metrics for determining the 
resiliency of critical financial systems to cyber disruptions.  Nonetheless, cyber risks are the subject of 
ongoing policy efforts at that Federal Reserve and other relevant agencies, and these entities are working to 
develop resiliency expectations and measures, which may be part of future discussions in the stability 
report.
