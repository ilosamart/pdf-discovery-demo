I want to thank Ben Dulchin and the Association of Neighborhood and Housing 

Development (ANHD) for inviting me to be here with you today.  While New York is known 

globally as a cultural hub that attracts the world to its doorstep, it is known locally as a city of 

neighborhoods.  Like other cities across this country, New York’s future is bound to the vitality 

of its neighborhoods as places to live, work, learn, play, worship, and invest.1   

Neighborhoods have been the focus of ANHD’s work for over 40 years.  The 

organization’s success is a function of its unwavering focus on preserving and strengthening the 

quality of life in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods across the five boroughs.  The 

mission of each of the members of ANHD is to strengthen these communities.  Together, your 

organizations are providing capacity building, advocacy, and services for the benefit of your 

communities and the city as a whole.   

Like many of the nation’s metropolitan areas, New York City has rebounded since the 

recession and is thriving.2  That, however, has not been the experience for many.  Many of the 

city’s residents have not fully recovered, and some have fallen further behind.  Here, as 

elsewhere in the country, there remain important gaps in economic opportunity.   

Powerful research now demonstrates that persistent gaps in economic opportunity are 

connected to the health of neighborhoods.  The effects of place on opportunity can stretch from 

one generation to the next.  Raj Chetty and others have shown that upward mobility can vary 

immensely by neighborhood even within the same metropolitan area.  The longer a child lives in

2According to the most recent report by the New York City Comptroller, the city’s GDP grew 2.7 percent in the first 
quarter of 2018 as compared to 2.3 percent for the nation, and the unemployment rate for the city fell to 4.3 percent, 
the lowest rate on record. See “NYC Economic Growth Slows Down, but Still Surpasses the Nation,”
