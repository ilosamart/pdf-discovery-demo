reactions to the announcement of the emergency facilities, anecdotal evidence, and a number of 

the studies we do have suggest that the facilities forestalled potentially much worse outcomes 

and encouraged improvements.  For example, some asset-backed securities (ABS) spreads, such 

as those for consumer ABS and commercial mortgage-backed securities, narrowed significantly 

following the creation of the TALF, and activity in ABS markets has picked up.  While the 

overall improvement in the economic outlook has no doubt contributed to the improvement in 

ABS markets, it does appear that the TALF helped to buoy the availability of credit to firms and 

households and thus supported economic activity.  Indeed, following the kick-start from the 

TALF, a number of these markets are now operating without any governmental backing.  

Another example is the reduction in pressures in U.S. dollar funding markets (as evidenced by 

the sharp narrowing of spreads between Libor (London interbank offered rates) and OIS 

(overnight index swap) rates and the decline in premiums paid for U.S. dollars in foreign 

exchange swap markets).  These developments followed the establishment of the Term Auction 

Facility (which auctioned discount window credit to depository institutions) and also of liquidity 

swaps between the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks, which enabled those banks to lend 

dollars to commercial banks in their jurisdictions.  Our willingness to lend in support of the 

commercial paper and asset-backed commercial paper markets helped to stem the runs on money 

market funds and other nonbank providers of short-term credit.  Of note, usage of these 

emergency liquidity facilities declined markedly as conditions in financial markets improved, 

indicating that they were indeed priced at a penalty to more normal market conditions.  They 

were successfully closed, suggesting that market participants had not become overly reliant on 

these programs and were able to regain access to funding markets.  Except for the TALF and the 

special Bear Stearns and AIG loans, all were repaid without any losses to the Federal Reserve.
