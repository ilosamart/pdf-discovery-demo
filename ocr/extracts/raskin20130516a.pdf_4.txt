real GDP was about 1-3/4 percent above its year-earlier level in the first quarter, a modest 

gain that is about in line with the pace of growth during much of the recovery.   

The strength of the recovery among the components of GDP has been mixed 

recently.  In terms of the housing sector, there is no question that many communities and 

neighborhoods were devastated by the effects of the financial crisis.  Recently, we see 

that overall demand has been strengthening, with both home sales and prices rising 

markedly in many areas.  Both new and existing home sales have moved up, on net, since 

late 2011, and housing starts averaged an annual rate of nearly 1 million units in the first 

quarter of this year, up considerably from the extremely low levels that prevailed through

the housing sector has been driven by historically low mortgage rates, growing optimism 

about future house prices, continued gains in the job market, and sizable purchases of

globalization and technological change have continued to shift the occupations and 

industrial distribution of new jobs available.  These currents of globalization and
