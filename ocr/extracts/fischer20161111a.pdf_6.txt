each other out, on average, for our trading partners so that their net exports were not very 

much affected.6  Moreover, insofar as our unconventional policies reduced global interest 

rates and boosted asset prices--a third channel that tended to expand foreign as well as 

domestic demand--these actions were probably mildly stimulative for the global 

economy.  

It may be helpful to provide some ballpark numerical estimates of how these 

different channels are likely to play out in determining the overall spillovers to foreign 

GDP by drawing on the research of my Federal Reserve colleagues.7  Specifically, they 

considered the spillovers from a hypothetical easing of Fed policy scaled to cause the 

yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note to fall 25 basis points.8  This easing by the Fed 

raises U.S. GDP about 0.5 percent, and--based on event-study analysis--causes the U.S. 

dollar to depreciate by about 1 percent or perhaps a bit less.  While foreign exports are 

hurt due to the implied appreciation of foreign currencies--reducing foreign GDP about 

0.15 percent, according to their estimates--foreign exports are boosted by nearly the same 

amount due to the policy-induced expansion of U.S. domestic demand.  Thus, the overall 

effect on foreign GDP arising through these two trade channels is negligible.  However, 

given that the fall in U.S. interest rates tends to reduce foreign interest rates--at least on 

average--by around half as much, my colleagues concluded that U.S. monetary stimulus 

likely has noticeable positive spillovers to foreign economies.

of U.S. monetary policy actions on foreign economies.

10-year U.S. Treasury note to fall by this amount.
