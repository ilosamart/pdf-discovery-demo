before the last two recessions (the dashed red line), it could reflect a structural change in 

firms’ reliance on part-time labor.13  In addition, these two measures have to be weighed 

against other labor indicators that have either returned to, or are currently above, their 

pre-recession levels.  As shown in figure 7, those indicators include the quits rate (the 

short-dashed blue line), household perceptions of job availability (the short-and-long-

dashed green line), the jobs opening rate (the long-dashed red line), and the percentage of 

small firms finding it hard to fill jobs (the solid black line).   

On balance, the unemployment rate probably is correct in signaling that overall 

labor market conditions have returned to pre-crisis levels.  But that return does not 

necessarily demonstrate that the economy is now at maximum employment because, due 

to demographic and other structural changes, the unemployment rate that is sustainable 

today may be lower than the rate that was sustainable in the past.   

In that regard, some observers have pointed to the continued subdued pace of 

wage growth as evidence that the economy is not yet back to full employment.  As shown 

in figure 8, labor compensation as measured by the employment cost index (the short-

dashed red line) has been growing at more or less the same rate since 2014, and hourly 

compensation in the nonfarm business sector (the short-and-long-dashed green line)--a 

quite noisy measure, even after smoothing--is actually growing more slowly.  But growth 

in average hourly earnings (the solid blue line) and the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth 

Tracker (the long-dashed black line) have clearly picked up.14  In addition, productivity

Valletta and van der List (2015).

changes for individuals who had a job in both the current month and a year ago.
