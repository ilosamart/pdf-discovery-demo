In the corporate debt markets, valuation pressures had been high for a while, 

before risk spreads widened and issuance slowed over the past year.  The high issuance of 

corporate debt in recent years is evident in the near-record-high debt-to-asset ratios at 

speculative-grade and unrated corporations, making this sector vulnerable to adverse 

shocks.  In addition, increased defaults could lead to sharper-than-expected price declines 

if concerns that liquidity in corporate bond markets is not as robust as in the past--a topic 

to which I will return in a few minutes--turn out to be justified.    

In the financial sector, regulatory capital ratios remain at historically high levels, 

and liquidity buffers appear sizable in the banking sector.  Capital ratios continue to trend 

upward for both life and property and casualty insurers. 

A Closer Look at Shadow Banking 

Still, our view of developments at nonbank firms that have traditionally relied on 

high leverage and short-term wholesale funding and were at the center of the financial 

crisis--the shadow banking sector--remains incomplete.6   

One source of information about leverage at nonbanks is the Senior Credit Officer 

Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), which the Federal Reserve 

initiated after the crisis.  The SCOOS provides information about the availability and 

terms of credit in securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives markets--for 

example, on credit granted by dealers to counterparties such as hedge funds or insurers to 

                                                   
6 I have previously discussed the lines between bank and nonbank activities (Fischer (2015)).  The term 
“shadow banking” has been in use for some time, and I continue to use this term in this speech largely to 
ensure some connection to discussion in recent years.  Recently, discussions of bank-like and other 
financial activities have begun to draw more clear distinctions regarding potential financial stability risks 
across activities; see Financial Stability Board (2015a) and the recent discussion in Tarullo (2015).  Finally, 
money market mutual fund (MMMF) shares are not, technically, debt claims.  However, the regulatory 
framework and historical precedent (in which MMMF shares had a fixed net asset value under normal 
conditions) appear to have led investors to treat such shares similarly to uninsured deposits.
