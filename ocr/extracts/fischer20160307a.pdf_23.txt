Appendix 

The following model includes a number of elements that play a central role in the 

analysis of economic fluctuations and in larger policy models as I have encountered them 

at the Federal Reserve and other institutions. 

An aggregate demand relationship, in the form of the investment-saving (or IS) 

curve, characterizes the negative dependence of economic activity on the real borrowing 

rate, 𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵 − 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 , and the positive dependence on expected output, 𝑦𝑦𝑒𝑒; government spending, 

𝐺𝐺; and net exports, NX, as a function of the exchange rate, 𝑒𝑒, and foreign output, 𝑦𝑦𝑓𝑓: 

 
𝑦𝑦 = 𝐴𝐴(𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵 − 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 , 𝑦𝑦𝑒𝑒 ,𝐺𝐺,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁), 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ  𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑓𝑓 �𝑒𝑒𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓

𝑃𝑃
,𝑦𝑦𝑓𝑓�.           (1) 

 
The Phillips curve describes a relationship between inflation and labor market 

slack.  Inflation responds negatively to the level of the unemployment gap, 𝑢𝑢,�  and to 

changes in aggregate productivity, 𝑧𝑧 (including shocks to commodity prices).  Current 

inflation also responds positively to expected future inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 , and to the level of the 

borrowing rate and of the exchange rate, 𝜙𝜙(𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵, 𝑒𝑒) (cost − push shocks): 

 
𝜋𝜋 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑢𝑢�) − 𝑧𝑧 + 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 + 𝜙𝜙�𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,  𝑒𝑒�.                           (Phillips curve)    (2)   

 
Current issues regarding the role of expectations, the size of the slope, and the 

pass-through from exchange rate movements to domestic prices and wages can be 

addressed in this context.  Recent discussions can be found in Blanchard’s (2016) 

reference to the back-to-the-1960s thinking about the Phillips curve and in Blanchard, 

Cerutti, and Summers’s (2015) thoughts on hysteresis mechanisms underlying the 

inflation and unemployment dynamic.
