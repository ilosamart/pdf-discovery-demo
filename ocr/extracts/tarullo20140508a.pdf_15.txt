At the time of its development, the IRB approach seemed intended to result in a modest 

decline in risk-weighted capital requirements, a goal that the financial crisis revealed to be badly 

misguided.  But even with the higher capital ratios required by Basel III, the IRB approach is 

problematic.  The combined complexity and opacity of risk weights generated by each banking 

organization for purposes of its regulatory capital requirement create manifold risks of gaming, 

mistake, and monitoring difficulty.  The IRB approach contributes little to market understanding 

of large banks’ balance sheets, and thus fails to strengthen market discipline.  And the relatively 

short, backward-looking basis for generating risk weights makes the resulting capital standards 

likely to be excessively pro-cyclical and insufficiently sensitive to tail risk.  That is, the IRB 

approach—for all its complexity and expense—does not do a very good job of advancing the 

financial stability and macroprudential aims of prudential regulation.  Yet a capital measure that 

incorporates these aims is precisely what is needed to complement the traditional 

microprudential elements of our capital standards. 

 The supervisory stress tests developed by the Federal Reserve over the past five years 

provide a much better risk-sensitive basis for setting minimum capital requirements.  They do 

not rely on firms’ own loss estimates.  They are based on adverse scenarios that would affect the 

entire economy and take correlated asset holdings into account.  As we gain experience, we have 

been enhancing the macroprudential features of the annual stress test exercise.  And, of course, 

the disclosure of the results helps inform counterparties and investors, thereby increasing market 

discipline.  They are undoubtedly a substantial amount of work for both the banks and 

supervisors but, unlike the IRB approach, the benefits seem worth the work.

 Under the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review program, bank holding companies 

participating in the supervisory stress tests must demonstrate their capacity for sound quantitative risk assessment 

and management, but not for purposes of setting regulatory capital requirements.
