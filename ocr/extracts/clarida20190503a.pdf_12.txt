next 5 to 10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (figure 5).  

Market- and survey-based estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but, again, when 

there is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey 

evidence as on the market-derived estimates. 

The examples I have mentioned illustrate the important point that, in practice, 

there is not typically a clean distinction between “model-based” and “market-based” 

inference of key economic variables such as r* and expected inflation.  The reason is that 

market prices reflect not only market expectations, but also risk and liquidity premiums 

that need to be filtered out to recover the object of interest—for example, expected 

inflation or long-run r*.  This filtering almost always requires a model of some sort, so 

even market-based estimates of key inputs to monetary policy are, to some extent, model 

dependent. 

Implications for Monetary Policy 

Let me now draw together some implications of the approach to models, markets, 

and monetary policy I have laid out in these remarks.  Macroeconomic models are, of 

course, an essential tool for monetary policy analysis, but the structure of the economy 

evolves, and the policy framework must be—and I believe, at the Federal Reserve, is—

nimble enough to respect this evolution.  While financial market signals can and 

sometimes do provide a reality check on the predictions of “a model gone astray,” market 

prices are, at best, noisy signals of the macroeconomic variables of interest, and the 

process of filtering out the noise itself requires a model—and good judgment.  Survey 

estimates of the long-run destination for key monetary policy inputs can—and, at the Fed,
