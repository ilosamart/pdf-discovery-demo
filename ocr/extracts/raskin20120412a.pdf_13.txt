Conclusion 

In summary, the contours of how this recovery is proceeding seem related to the 

factors that characterized the downturn.  The financial crisis was unprecedented since the 

Great Depression, and the recession was extraordinarily deep, even compared with other 

severe recessions in the postwar period.  Consequently, we have had much more ground 

to make up relative to other economic downturns.  The recent recession also lasted longer 

than most, and long recessions tend to be followed by slow recoveries.  However, the 

current recovery has been even slower than would be expected given its characteristics.  

An important factor explaining this slowness has likely been the severe contraction in the 

housing market, which has been the largest since the Great Depression.  Not only have 

the enormous loss of housing wealth, heavy debt burdens, and tight credit conditions 

restrained household spending, but the accompanying wave of mortgage defaults has also 

had considerable repercussions for homeowners, lenders, communities, and the pace of 

this economic recovery. 

Here in Los Angeles, the housing market contraction and economic downturn 

were even deeper than those experienced nationwide.  As a result, Los Angeles--like the 

rest of the United States--also is suffering through the slow pace of recovery typically 

associated with a long recession, a financial crisis, and an extraordinary contraction in 

housing activity.  In light of the economic hardships that have been endured in Los 

Angeles and nationwide, the Federal Reserve remains fully committed to doing 

everything it can to promote maximum employment in the context of price stability.
