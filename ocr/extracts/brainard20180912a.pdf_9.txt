expectations of monetary policy divergence strengthened, contributing to upward 

pressure on the dollar earlier this year.  The resulting currency adjustments are 

compounding challenges faced by some emerging market economies, along with a 

complicated and unpredictable trade environment and gradually increasing interest rates. 

Although capital flow reversals have been contained to several notably vulnerable 

countries so far, I am attentive to the risk that a pullback from emerging markets could 

broaden.   

The Path of Policy 

What are the implications for policy?  Over the next year or two, barring 

unexpected developments, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely 

to be appropriate to sustain full employment and inflation near its objective.  With 

government stimulus in the pipeline providing tailwinds to demand over the next two 

years, it appears reasonable to expect the shorter-run neutral rate to rise somewhat higher 

than the longer-run neutral rate.  Further out, the policy path will depend on how the 

economy evolves. 

These developments raise the prospect that, at some point, the Committee’s 

setting of the federal funds rate will exceed current estimates of the longer-run federal 

funds rate.  Indeed, the median projection in the SEP has this property.  This raises the 

possibility of a flattening or inversion of the yield curve in the event that term premiums 

do not rise from their currently very low levels.15   

                                                   
15 The standard expectations hypothesis model decomposes longer-term interest rates into a component that 
represents the influence of expectations of future short-term interest rates and a “term premium.”  Most 
estimates of the term premium, which are model-based, suggest that term premiums have been very low 
recently, and some suggest that term premiums are roughly zero across the yield curve.  If term premiums 
remain low and stable, the component associated with expectations of future short-term interest rates will 
dominate movements in long-term interest rates.
