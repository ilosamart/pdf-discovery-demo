Let me turn now from the longer-term issues that are the focus of the review to 

the nearer-term outlook for the economy and for monetary policy.  So far this year, the 

economy has performed reasonably well.  Solid fundamentals are supporting continued 

growth and strong job creation, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows.  Although 

inflation has been running somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective, we have 

expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market.  Along with this 

favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade 

developments and concerns about global growth.  When the FOMC met at the start of May, 

tentative evidence suggested these crosscurrents were moderating, and we saw no strong case 

for adjusting our policy rate. 

Since then, the picture has changed.  The crosscurrents have reemerged, with 

apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising 

renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy.  Our contacts in business 

and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments.  These concerns 

may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may 

be starting to show through to incoming data.  For example, the limited available 

evidence we have suggests that investment by businesses has slowed from the pace 

earlier in the year.   

Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my 

FOMC colleagues, like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with 

unemployment remaining near historic lows.  Inflation is expected to return to 2 percent 

over time, but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year.  However, 

the risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown.
