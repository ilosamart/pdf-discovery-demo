this time on money market mutual funds, after Lehman Brothers’ shadow banking activities 

caused it to fail and the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck.   

   As noted earlier, some key elements of pre-crisis shadow banking such as SIVs have 

vanished, and some key actors of that earlier period have been brought within the bounds of 

prudential regulation.  Today, the shadow banking sector is smaller and the traditional banking 

sector is more resilient.  Nonetheless, abundant global liquidity continues to seek out safe assets, 

and some financial market participants will continue to accept maturity and liquidity mismatches 

in order to earn incrementally higher yields.  The risks associated with short-term wholesale 

funding in particular have more receded than disappeared.  Accordingly, the prototype of the 

precarious shadow banking model can generate new variants that should command regulatory 

attention.  Before returning to this issue, though, I want to speak more directly to why and how 

we should analyze the risks and benefits associated with specific forms of nonbank financial 

intermediation, rather than make regulatory decisions based upon the fact that a particular form 

of intermediation bears some resemblance to the borrowing or lending activities traditionally 

associated with commercial banks.    

Analyzing Nonbank Intermediation 

 Switching from a focus on “shadow banking” to a consideration of the varieties of 

nonbank intermediation reinforces the importance of assessing specific risks rather than merely 

categorizing activities as either shadow banking or something else.  In this way, the potential 

over-inclusiveness for financial stability purposes of the tag “shadow banking” can be better 

avoided.  Even nonbank intermediaries that engage in lending to consumers or small businesses 

are not monolithic, insofar as the sources of their funding--and thus attendant run risks--may 

differ markedly.
