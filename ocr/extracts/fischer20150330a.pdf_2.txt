It is an honor to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaâ€™s 20th Financial 

Markets Conference, and I am grateful to President Lockhart and the organizers for 

inviting me to do so.1  This evening I would like to take stock of progress on financial 

reforms in the nonbank financial sector and highlight some principles for approaching 

prudential regulation of this sector to further strengthen financial stability.   

The nonbank sector includes firms with diverse business models and practices, 

many of which differ greatly from those of banks.  Even so, nonbank firms and activities 

can pose the same key vulnerabilities as banks, including high leverage, excessive 

maturity transformation, and complexity, all of which can lead to financial instability.  

The reforms undertaken to date reflect both the differences and similarities between the 

nonbank and bank sectors.   

While there has been progress on the financial reform front, we should not be 

complacent about the stability of the financial system.  Regulation often creates 

incentives for activity to move outside the regulatory perimeter, and market participants 

respond to incentives.  Thus we should expect that further reforms will certainly be 

needed down the road.   

The Nonbank Sector Was an Important Source of Vulnerability in the Crisis 

As you know, the nonbank financial sector in the United States is larger, and 

plays a more important role, than it does in most other countries.  In recent years, about 

two-thirds of nonfinancial credit market debt has been held by nonbanks, which includes 

market-based funding by securitization vehicles and mutual funds as well as by 

institutions such as insurance companies and finance companies.  Nonbanks are involved
