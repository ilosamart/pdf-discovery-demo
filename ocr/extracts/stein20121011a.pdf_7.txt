mechanism.6  Moreover, I have no reason to expect any diminishing efficacy on this 

market-impact dimension, so in this instance the past evidence seems like a good guide to 

future outcomes.   

However, the evidence on Treasury-market impact is just a starting point.  To 

fully evaluate an LSAP, one needs to take several further steps, some of which are more 

open to debate.  In so doing, it is helpful to clarify the specifics of the supply-demand 

story.  One version of this story works through the market price of duration risk, which is 

the interest rate risk borne by an investor in long-term bonds.  In this case, all bonds--

including Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and MBS--can be thought of as close 

substitutes for one another, and an LSAP, by reducing the total quantity of duration in 

private hands, lowers the price of duration risk and so reduces the yields on all long-term 

bonds by an amount proportional to their duration.  Going further, this story might also 

suggest that, to the extent that equities embed duration risk, the return investors require to 

hold them should fall commensurately, thus giving a significant boost to stock prices. 

In other versions of the story, markets are more segmented, and Treasury 

securities and other bonds are not such close substitutes, so an LSAP has differential 

effects on various securities.  In this case, an LSAP that absorbs Treasury supply would 

be expected to lower the yields on Treasury securities relative to those on corporate 

bonds, or alternatively, to increase the corporate-Treasury spread.7  And by a similar 

logic, an LSAP might have only a modest effect on stock prices. 

With this backdrop, let’s start with the efficacy side of the question.  Take our 

$500 billion LSAP and, as mentioned earlier, stipulate that it reduces the 10-year
