(which is used in the estimation) is computed as a geometrically declining weighted 

average, 

𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = 0.95𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡−1 + 0.05𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡, 

where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡  denotes trend productivity growth and where the moving average is 

initialized in 1955:Q1 with that quarter’s estimate of the trend growth rate. 

The model is used to compute a decomposition of ECI growth following a 

procedure similar to that used to construct the decomposition for core PCE price 

inflation.  The table summarizes the results of this decomposition over various periods; 

note that the column labeled “Slack” combines the effects of ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡, the 

effect of the model’s constant term is included in the column labeled “Trend 

productivity,” and the column labeled “Other” gives the contributions of the model’s 

tracking errors.

Note:  ECI growth is reported as average percent changes at an annual rate for the periods shown; 
contributions are expressed in percentage points.  The contribution of the model’s constant term is included 
in the contribution for trend productivity.  Contributions may not sum to total growth because of rounding. 
  

                                                 
Before the series’ starting point in 1947:Q2, actual productivity growth is padded with an ARIMA(4,1,0) 
model; after its 2017:Q2 endpoint, the series is padded with the CBO’s January 2017 forecast of average 
nonfarm business trend productivity growth from 2017 to 2027 (which is 1.67 percent in log differences) 
and with the 2027 value of the CBO forecast (1.77 percent) thereafter.
