potentially amplifying moderate adverse shocks into more serious financial strains or a 

recession.9 

Given the risks to the financial system and economy from this potential adverse 

feedback loop, a strong case can be made that the financial systemâ€™s buffers should be 

fortified when the economy is strong.  Reinforcing capital buffers during the strong part 

of the cycle means that banks will have a cushion to absorb losses and remain sound 

during a subsequent downturn.  Thicker capital buffers help bolster the confidence of 

market participants when conditions deteriorate, helping prevent the downward spiral 

from a loss of confidence.  And during the downturn, that extra buffer can be released to 

enable banks to continue lending and help mitigate its severity.  History suggests that we 

should not expect the market to provide incentives for banks to build the necessary 

buffers when times are good; the essence of the cycle is that market sentiment become 

overconfident precisely when risk is actually highest.  One of the roles for independent 

regulatory bodies such as the Federal Reserve is to serve as a counterweight.  Moreover, 

as we saw in the last crisis, it is much costlier to rebuild capital in a downturn when 

earnings and risk appetite are low than to build buffers in an expansion when earnings are 

strong. 

At the Federal Reserve, the two important tools that can respond somewhat to 

rising vulnerabilities are the design of stress-test scenarios and the countercyclical capital 

buffer (CCyB).  The annual supervisory stress test examines the resilience of large bank 

holding companies to a severely adverse scenario, which includes salient risks that can be
