that could be limiting the economy’s potential, by studying labor market outcomes of 

men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in more depth.8    

Research on the drivers of disparities in labor market outcomes can also help the 

Federal Reserve better assess potential tradeoffs in monetary policy.  In meetings with 

community groups, we often hear from advocates who point to the stark discrepancy they 

see between the economy’s aggregate U-3 unemployment rate, which many forecasters 

estimate to be at or approaching full employment, and the much higher rates of 

unemployment among the people in their neighborhoods.  For instance, Rod Adams, a 

neighborhood advocate here in Minneapolis, noted the unemployment rate for African 

Americans locally was still almost 9 percent late last summer and observed that “if the 

labor market were truly healthy, people in my community would all be able to find full-

time jobs at decent wages.”9  While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are 

not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in the 

labor market outcomes of different groups, understanding these barriers and efforts to 

address them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.   

The Federal Reserve’s community development work is invaluable in supporting 

our efforts to understand and improve the labor market experiences of different groups.10  

For instance, during the Great Recession, workforce development organizations in 

                                                 
8 Aaronson and others (2014) and Barnichon and Mesters (2016) are examples of using details from 
demographic groups to assess overall labor market trends.  In September, the Board of Governors is hosting
