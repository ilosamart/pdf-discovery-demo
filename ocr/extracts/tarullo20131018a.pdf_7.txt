during a one-day statutory stay of the contractual rights of counterparties of the firm being 

resolved.  As I will discuss later, this authority is not without limitations, particularly in a cross-

border resolution, but it is a critical tool for an effective resolution of a financial firm with 

complex portfolios of financial contracts.  

While Title II establishes a special resolution mechanism and grants the FDIC powers 

responsive to the special challenges posed by the failure of large financial institutions, it provides 

only a legal framework, not an elaborated description of how these powers would be used to 

resolve a systemically important financial firm.  Moreover, the very large financial firms that are 

the most likely subjects of a Title II proceeding have extensive cross-border activities, and thus 

implicate the legal systems of other countries.  Thus, for orderly liquidation authority to be 

effective in containing too-big-to-fail concerns and supporting financial stability, the statutory 

provisions must be supplemented with administrative planning by the FDIC and with consistent 

measures in other jurisdictions.    

Developing a Clear, Credible Approach to Resolution 

 It is important to develop and articulate a credible approach to such a resolution 

proceeding, for at least two reasons.  First, unless creditors and counterparties have well-

grounded expectations as to how they will be treated in a resolution setting, they may need to 

charge a premium to compensate for the additional uncertainty associated with the disposition of 

their claims, which can lead to a mispricing of risks.  In some cases, particularly in periods of 

increasing stress in the financial system, they may be unwilling to deal with certain firms 

altogether.  Parties who have short-term lending to, or contractual arrangements with, these firms 

may “run” as those loans or contracts lapse, thereby potentially crippling the ongoing business of 

the firm and creating adverse effects in other parts of the financial system.
