A final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of 

achieving a prompt return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, an objective that 

would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat 

below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level.  To a limited degree, such an outcome 

is envisioned in many participants’ most recent SEP projections.  A tight labor market 

may also work to reverse some of the adverse supply-side developments resulting from 

the financial crisis.  The deep recession and slow recovery likely have held back 

investment in physical and human capital, restrained the rate of new business formation, 

prompted discouraged workers to leave the labor force, and eroded the skills of the long-

term unemployed.15  Some of these effects might be reversed in a tight labor market, 

yielding long-term benefits associated with a more productive economy.  That said, the 

quantitative importance of these supply-side mechanisms are difficult to establish, and 

the relevant research on this point is quite limited.    

Of course, taking a gradualist approach is not without risks.  Proceeding too 

slowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the 

Committee’s inflation objective over time, especially if it were to undermine the FOMC’s 

inflation credibility.  Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which 

high levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but 

tight labor markets generate marked upward pressure.  If so, a decline in unemployment
