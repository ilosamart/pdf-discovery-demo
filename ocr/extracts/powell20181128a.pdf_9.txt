saw this chain of events play out repeatedly in various parts of the financial sector in the 

weeks following the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.   

In our surveillance, we examine leverage across many types of financial 

institutions, including banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and various funding 

vehicles.  Currently, we do not detect a broad-based buildup of abnormal or excessive 

leverage.  As with banks, capital levels at insurance companies and broker-dealers appear 

robust.  In addition, securitization levels are far below their pre-crisis levels, and those 

structures that do exist rely on more stable funding (see figure 4).  Our view into leverage 

and risk-taking outside the banking sector is admittedly incomplete, however, and we are 

always working to get a better view of emerging leverage excesses.8 

The second vulnerability is funding risk, which arises when banks or nonbank 

financial entities rely on funding that can be rapidly withdrawn.  If depositors or market 

participants lose faith in the soundness of an institution or the system as a whole, unstable 

funding can simply vanish in what is called a “run.”  During the crisis, we saw 

widespread runs, including at broker-dealers, some segments of the repo market, and 

money market mutual funds.  These runs did severe damage, contributing to a 

generalized panic at the time.  Had the authorities not stepped in, the damage could have 

been even more severe.   

Today we view funding-risk vulnerabilities as low.  Banks hold low levels of 

liabilities that are able and likely to run, and they hold high levels of liquid assets to fund 

any outflows that do occur.  Money market mutual fund reforms have greatly reduced the 

run risk in that sector.  More generally, it is short-term, uninsured funding that would be

largest banks have committed about $1 trillion in lines of credit to nonbanks.
