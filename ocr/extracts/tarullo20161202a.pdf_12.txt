that proved so dangerous in the recent crisis, the NSFR requires more stable funding for short-

term loans to financial firms. 

It is important to note how liquidity requirements also affect the capital needed by a bank, 

as can be illustrated by a simple, if admittedly improbable, example.  Assume two banks with 

exactly the same assets and the same amount of capital.  One funds those assets entirely through 

insured (sticky) deposits and longer-term debt, while the other funds its assets entirely through 

short-term uninsured deposits and repo borrowing.  Assume now that an external shock reduces 

the value of the assets dramatically, with lingering uncertainty as to whether the value will 

continue to drop.  It is readily apparent that the two large banks face very different risks, since 

the second bankâ€™s funding will at best become more expensive and at worst decline or disappear.   

A sound regulatory regime will align the riskiness of the two banks more closely, by requiring 

the second bank to change its funding profile, increase its capital, or some combination of the 

two.  In fact, the LCR and NSFR would require more stability in funding at my second 

hypothetical bank, while one of the factors used to calculate the capital surcharge applicable to 

the largest banks is its relative reliance on runnable funding. 

I will not go into detail in explaining a third key factor of our post-crisis regulatory 

regime--the requirement for rigorous risk management at large banks.  But a brief example 

should make the point.  During the height of the crisis in the winter of 2009, as we were 

conducting the first stress test, we found that some of the largest banks were literally unable to 

determine in any reasonable time their aggregate exposures to particular counterparties and 

business lines across their varied operations.  That deficiency made it easier to understand how 

they could have gotten themselves in such trouble.  Because of the supervisory expectations for 

risk management in our annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise,
