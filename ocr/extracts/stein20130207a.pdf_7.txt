example, a prolonged period of low interest rates, of the sort we are experiencing today, 

can create incentives for agents to take on greater duration or credit risks, or to employ 

additional financial leverage, in an effort to “reach for yield.”

  An insurance company 

that has offered guaranteed minimum rates of return on some of its products might find 

its solvency threatened by a long stretch of low rates and feel compelled to take on added 

risk.

  A similar logic applies to a bank whose net interest margins are under pressure 

because low rates erode the profitability of its deposit-taking franchise. 

Moreover, these three factors may interact with one another.  For example, if low 

interest rates increase the demand by agents to engage in below-the-radar forms of risk-

taking, this demand may prompt innovations that facilitate this sort of risk-taking. 

Why the Distinction Matters 

To summarize the argument thus far, I have drawn a distinction between two 

views of risk-taking in credit markets.  According to the primitives view, changes over 

time in effective risk appetite reflect the underlying preferences and beliefs of end 

investors.  According to the institutions view, such changes reflect the imperfectly 

aligned incentives of the agents in large financial institutions who do the investing on 

behalf of these end investors.  But why should anybody care about this distinction?  

One reason is that your view of the underlying mechanism shapes how you think 

about measurement.  Consider this question:  Is the high-yield bond market currently 

overheated, in the sense that it might be expected to offer disappointing returns to 

investors?  What variables might one look at to shape such a forecast?  In a primitives-

driven world, it would be natural to focus on credit spreads, on the premise that more risk

 See Rajan (2006) for an early exposition of the reach-for-yield phenomenon.

 This mechanism is the classic risk-shifting effect described by Jensen and Meckling (1976).
