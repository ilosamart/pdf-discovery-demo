 We have learned a few interesting things based on the findings of this research.  For 

example, the number of institutions that exceed at least one of the two screening criteria has 

declined substantially from 2006 to the present.  While much of this decline seems to have 

resulted from the contraction of construction portfolios in the wake of the crisis, banks that 

exceeded the criteria when the guidance was issued appear to have experienced a bigger decline 

in total CRE loans than can be explained by the adverse economic environment alone.  This 

finding could indicate that the thresholds are indeed being interpreted as hard caps.  Moreover, it 

was apparent that banks that exceeded the criterion for construction and land development were 

far more likely to have failed over the period from 2007 to 2011 than were those banks that 

exceeded the criterion for overall CRE exposures and portfolio growth.  We now recognize the 

importance of the rapid growth criterion, which may have received less attention than the criteria 

for construction and overall CRE lending concentrations.  We intend to use the findings of this 

research to help clarify our communication and training for examiners and bankers around CRE 

lending concentrations.   

Small Business Lending 

 There is probably no loan category in which community bankers’ local knowledge and 

deep ties to the community are more important than small business lending.  The Federal 

Reserve System has a project under way to try to improve our understanding of small business 

credit markets, which would of course include community banks.  One challenge we have faced 

is that it is difficult to measure lending to small businesses precisely.  For one thing, small 

business owners frequently tap their personal home equity, credit cards, or loans secured by 

commercial real estate that they own to finance their business operations,

 In the Federal Reserve’s 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances, 18 percent of households reported personally 

guaranteeing or collateralizing loans to their family businesses, and 15 percent of households reported lending
