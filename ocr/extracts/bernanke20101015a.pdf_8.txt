currently about 5 percentage points above the rates that prevailed just before the onset of 

the financial crisis.  

In gauging the magnitude of prevailing resource slack and the associated restraint 

on price and wage increases, it is essential to consider the extent to which structural 

factors may be contributing to elevated rates of unemployment.  For example, the 

continuing high level of permanent job losers may be a sign that structural impediments--

such as barriers to worker mobility or mismatches between the skills that workers have 

and the ones that employers require--are hindering unemployed individuals from finding 

new jobs.  The recent behavior of unemployment and job vacancies--somewhat more 

vacancies are reported than would usually be the case given the number of people looking 

for work--is also suggestive of some increase in the level of structural unemployment.  

On the other hand, we see little evidence that the reallocation of workers across industries 

and regions is particularly pronounced relative to other periods of recession, suggesting 

that the pace of structural change is not greater than normal.  Moreover, previous post-

World-War-II recessions do not seem to have resulted in higher structural unemployment, 

which many economists attribute to the relative flexibility of the U.S. labor market.  

Overall, my assessment is that the bulk of the increase in unemployment since the 

recession began is attributable to the sharp contraction in economic activity that occurred 

in the wake of the financial crisis and the continuing shortfall of aggregate demand since 

then, rather than to structural factors. 3  

                                                 
3 Recent empirical studies assessing the magnitude of shifts in the sustainable rate of unemployment--the 
portion of unemployment not attributable to temporary cyclical factors--include Barnichon and Figura 
(2010), Dickens (2009), Dowling, Estev√£o, and Tsounta (2010), Fleischman and Roberts (2010), Fujita 
(2010), Lindner and Tasci (2010), and Kuang and Valletta (2010).
