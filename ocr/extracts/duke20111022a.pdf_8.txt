Francisco, the “Kindergarten to College” initiative sets up college savings accounts for all of the 

city’s kindergartners.  In Oklahoma, the “SEED for Oklahoma Kids” experiment establishes an 

account at the birth of a child and "seeds" each account with $1,000.  On an annual basis, eligible 

families can earn matching funds for their contributions to a parallel account they open within 

the state's tax-advantaged College Savings Plan.    

There is some evidence that financial knowledge is the result of regular saving, rather 

than the source.  So these types of programs offer children and adults the opportunity to manage 

their own account, thereby fostering financial education while encouraging saving.     

Create an Emergency Fund 

My third recommendation is to create an emergency fund in addition to your longer-term 

savings and investments. These frightening statistics demonstrate why:  Nearly half of all 

Americans consider themselves financially fragile, meaning that they would “probably” (22.2 

percent) or “certainly” (27.9 percent) be unable to come up with $2,000 in 30 days to cope with a 

financial emergency.7  Similarly, almost half of all Americans report having trouble making ends 

meet.8  Almost half of all households surveyed in the 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances had 

less than $3,000 in liquid savings, and 20 percent had less than $3,000 in broader savings.9  

Finally, in a recent survey on the effects of unemployment and the recession, 70 percent of 

workers reported withdrawing funds saved in college and retirement accounts for present day
