of the Class of 1923.  Her career and achievements as a mathematician embody both the 

opportunities that opened for Pembroke graduates in the decades after she left here and 

the limitations many women faced and the compromises she, like so many others, was 

forced to make.  

A Historical Perspective on Women in the Labor Force 

From the time that Brown began to accept women and into the 1920s, most 

women in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were 

primarily young and unmarried.  In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful 

workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the 

home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such.2  Of course, these 

statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy 

beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included 

work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural 

products, for sale.  Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of 

women by race.  African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the 

labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to 

remain in the labor force after marriage.3   

                                                 
2 My discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of 
Claudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s 
Employment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work 
Understanding the Gender Gap:  An Economic History of American Women, from which the statistics on 
female labor force participation from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century are drawn.  A 
thorough discussion of the quality of these data and their usefulness in making comparisons over time is 
included in that work. 
3 The higher participation rates of African American women have been attributed to different cultural 
norms that developed during slavery and the legacy of slavery, which left blacks impoverished and with 
low levels of education, making women’s wages an important source of family income (Boustan and 
Collins, 2013; Goldin, 1977).
