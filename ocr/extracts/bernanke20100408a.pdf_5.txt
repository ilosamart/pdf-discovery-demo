and with greater force than in the 1930s.  For example, in October 2008, just weeks after 

the sharp intensification of the crisis, the Congress authorized the Troubled Asset Relief 

Program (TARP) to support stabilization of the financial system.  It was far from perfect 

legislation, but it was essential for preventing an imminent financial collapse.  For its 

part, the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal 

Reserve, sharply and proactively cut its target for short-term interest rates from the fall of 

2007 through 2008.  After the target could go no lower, the Committee embarked on an 

unprecedented (for the United States) program of long-term securities purchases, recently 

completed, to support private credit markets, including the mortgage market. 

Also, in the spring of 2009, the Federal Reserve led the Supervisory Capital 

Assessment Program, known as the bank stress test.3  In some ways, its effect was similar 

to Roosevelt’s national bank holiday.  During the holiday in 1933, banks temporarily shut 

their doors.  Examiners were dispatched to evaluate them, and banks that were declared 

sound reopened to renewed depositor confidence.  In the 2009 stress tests, 

multidisciplinary teams of examiners, economists, financial experts, and other specialists 

calculated how much capital 19 of the nation’s largest bank holding companies would 

need to remain healthy and continue lending during a hypothetical worse-than-expected 

economic scenario.  The Treasury Department committed to supplying additional capital 

as necessary from the TARP.  Critics had warned that the stress test could backfire, but as 

it turned out, the release of the results last May helped restore confidence in banks, and 

many institutions have since been able to raise capital from investors and repay the 

capital the government had injected.
