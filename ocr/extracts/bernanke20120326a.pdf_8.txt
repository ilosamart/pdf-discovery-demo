working or looking for work to be counted as part of the labor force, an increase in the 

number of people too discouraged to continue their search for work would reduce the 

unemployment rate, all else being equal--but not for a positive reason.  A story centered 

on potential workers dropping out of the labor force might seem in line with the low level 

of the labor force participation rate (figure 9).  But other data cast doubt on that idea.  For 

example, a broad measure of labor underutilization that includes people only marginally 

attached to the labor force has declined about in line with the unemployment rate since 

late 2010 (figure 10).

  On balance, an assessment of a broad range of indicators suggests 

that a substantial portion of the decline in the unemployment rate does reflect genuine 

improvement in labor market conditions. 

 Yet another interpretation of the recent improvement is that it represents a catch-

up from outsized job losses during and just after the recession.  In 2008 and 2009, the 

decline in payrolls and the associated jump in unemployment were extraordinary.  In 

particular, using the Okun’s law metric, the run-up in the unemployment rate in 2009 

appears “too large” relative even to the substantial decline in real GDP that occurred.  

This point can be seen by returning to figure 8, which shows the Okun’s law relationship.  

The open triangle labeled “2009” in the upper left of the figure shows an increase in the 

unemployment rate in that year well above the one implied by the contraction in real 

GDP and Okun’s law.  In other words, employers reduced their workforces at an 

unusually rapid rate near the business cycle trough--perhaps because they feared an even 

more severe contraction to come or, with credit availability sharply curtailed, they were 

trying to conserve available cash.

 The broader measure of labor underutilization referenced here is the U-5 measure of unemployment, 

constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
