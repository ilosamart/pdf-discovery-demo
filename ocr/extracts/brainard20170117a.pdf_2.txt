There are many sources of uncertainty affecting the trajectory of the U.S. 

economy and, by extension, the appropriate path of monetary policy.  In particular, there 

has been speculation about significant changes to fiscal policy of late, although the 

magnitude, composition, and timing of any fiscal changes are as yet unknown and will 

depend on the incoming Administration and the new Congress as well as the vicissitudes 

of the budgeting process.  Even once any changes are enacted, uncertainty will remain 

about their effects on the overall economy.  It thus seems possible that monetary policy 

could be affected for some time by uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy and its effects on 

the economy.1  

Macroeconomic Outcomes Are Difficult to Predict 

Before I turn to the possible effects of fiscal policy, it is helpful to remind 

ourselves of the immense uncertainty that accompanies any attempt to forecast future 

economic developments.  Many possible surprises could materially affect the future path 

of the U.S. economy, such as shocks to the price of oil, the foreign economic outlook, the 

rate of productivity growth, the sentiment of households and businesses, financial 

stability, and fiscal policy, to name a few.  The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to 

predict the future path of activity, unemployment, and inflation.   

By statute, the Federal Reserve is mandated to conduct monetary policy to 

promote the long run goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  In todayâ€™s 

framework, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined stable prices to 

mean 2 percent inflation.  The FOMC adjusts the stance of policy in light of incoming
