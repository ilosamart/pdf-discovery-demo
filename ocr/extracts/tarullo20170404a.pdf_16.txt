bank-by-bank basis.8  Banks subject to the supervisory stress tests have generally found it to be 

their binding capital constraint.  This is as it should be, insofar as stress testing is meant to help 

set capital requirements for when they will most be needed--that is, in a serious economic 

downturn. 

From the first stress test performed in the winter of 2009, the Federal Reserve has 

publicly disclosed progressively more information about its supervisory model, the scenarios, 

and the results.  During the crisis, disclosure was intended to help restore confidence in the 

banking system.  Our continuation and expansion of disclosure helps market participants, 

analysts, academics, and the public better evaluate both the condition of the banks and the rigor 

of supervisory oversight.  It thus serves the dual purpose of market discipline and government 

agency accountability. 

To serve its important financial stability purpose, stress testing must never become static.  

As the financial system evolves, with the creation of new products and new correlations among 

asset price movements, the supervisory model must account for these changes.  And as salient 

risks to the financial system arise, the scenarios must test for these new risks.  Apart from the 

inherent need for adaptation, though, there is one respect in which the Federal Reserveâ€™s stress 

testing program is incomplete and other respects in which it is still in transition from a crisis and 

post-crisis measure to a permanent and central feature of prudential oversight.  

The significant way in which the stress testing program is incomplete is that it has only 

limited features with which to assess the condition of participating banks from a macroprudential 

perspective.9  For example, it generally does not directly take account of second-round effects of

9 The stress testing program does have some macroprudential elements, which have been modestly enhanced in 
recent years. For example, we vary the market shock over time to reduce the incentive for firms to correlate their
