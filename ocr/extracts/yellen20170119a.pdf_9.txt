strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of 

simple monetary policy rules.  In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual 

projections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables 

under their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy,” together with their 

estimates of the normal longer-run values of the federal funds rate, the unemployment 

rate, and GDP growth.10  Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a 

whole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings.  

Such a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to policymaking is similar to that 

employed at other central banks.11 

Figure 5 shows a plot of FOMC participants’ most recent assessments of the 

appropriate path for the federal funds rate through 2019.  The black solid lines show the 

median value of the federal funds rate at the end of each year.  To understand the 

considerations that likely underlay these judgments, I will contrast participants’ 

assessments with the recommendations of some simple policy rules commonly used to 

help gauge the appropriate stance of policy.  As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews 

policy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules, and I believe that their 

prescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate 

should be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.  

That said, I will emphasize that the use and interpretation of such prescriptions require 

                                                           
10 These individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections that 
accompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the 
FOMC. 
11 The FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting, an approach to monetary 
policymaking advocated by Svensson (2005), among others.  However, while the Committee publishes 
participants’ projections--including policy paths--in the SEP, it does not publish a “consensus” forecast, in 
contrast to some other central banks.
