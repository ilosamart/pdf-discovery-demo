Lesson T2:  Monetary policy in normal times.6  In normal times, monetary policy 

should continue to be targeted at inflation and at output or employment.7  Typically, 

central bank laws also include some mention of financial stability as a responsibility of 

the central bank.  At this stage the institutional arrangements under which different 

central banks exercise their financial stability mandate vary across countries, and depend 

to a considerable extent on the tools that the central bank has at its command.  It will take 

time for the advantages and disadvantages of different arrangements to be evaluated and 

recommendations on what works best to be developed.  On paper, the British approach of 

setting up nearly parallel committees for monetary policy and for macroprudential 

financial supervision and regulation appears to be a leading model.   

Another issue that remains to be settled is that of the possible use of monetary policy, 

i.e. the interest rate, to deal with financial stability.   For instance, for some time several 

economists – including those working at the BIS – have been urging an increase in the 

interest rate to restore risk premia to more normal levels.  Most central bankers say they 

would prefer to use macroprudential tools rather than the interest rate for this purpose.  

While such tools would have the advantage of being directly targeted at the problem that 

is to be solved,  it is not clear that there are sufficiently strong macroprudential tools to 

deal with all financial instability problems, and it would make sense not to rule out the 

                                                 
6 This is topic B8 in Table 1. 
 
7 In most modern central bank laws, the central bank’s policy goals include both inflation and a measure of 
economic activity, although more often than not, the inflation goal is defined as more important than the 
output or employment goal. By contrast, the Fed has a dual mandate that gives equal weight to both 
inflation and employment.  I believe that in practice almost all central banks give approximately equal 
weight to their inflation and employment or output goals.
