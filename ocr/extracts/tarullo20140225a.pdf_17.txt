The explosive growth of short-term wholesale funding in the years preceding the 

crisis is the exemplary case of how the regulatory system has not kept pace with the 

integration of traditional lending and capital market activities.  The amount of credit 

created through those channels meant that aggregate credit growth in the economy 

relative to GDP was much higher than just a few decades earlier, a development that may 

itself be connected to a greater likelihood of financial crises.14  Moreover, this funding 

was peculiarly susceptible to runs that can prompt fire sales and the sudden withdrawal of 

credit from counterparties.   

These direct financial stability concerns have been my principal motivation in 

devoting so much attention to measures such as minimum margins on securities financing 

transactions, a version of which are currently under development internationally under 

the auspices of the Financial Stability Board.15  But these kinds of changes might also 

make the trade-off between systemic risk and near-term growth aims a bit easier, since a 

financial system with more ballast will be less prone to listing in response to 

accommodative monetary policies directed at the dual mandate goals of price stability 

and maximum employment.  Were such a regime of minimum margins in place, one 

could also see the potential for enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy by adding 

a time-varying, countercyclical component.
