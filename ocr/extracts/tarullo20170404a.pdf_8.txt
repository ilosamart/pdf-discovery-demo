traded instruments, there is ongoing and substantial need for context-specific, data-heavy 

judgment.  Efforts to achieve consistency in treatment across agencies have been both time-

consuming and, at times, unsuccessful.    

 The second problem is that the approach taken in the regulation in pursuit of consistency 

was one that essentially contemplated an inquiry into the intent of the bankers making trades to 

determine, for example, whether the trades were legitimate market making.  The agencies knew 

this approach would be complicated when we adopted it, but it seemed the best way to achieve 

consistency, at least over time.  I think the hope was that, as the application of the rule and 

understanding of the metrics resulting from it evolved, it would become easier to use objective 

data to infer subjective intent.  This hasn’t happened, though.  I think we just need to recognize 

this fact and try something else. 

Had there been an obviously better approach, we would have taken it five years ago.  My 

suspicion is that it lies in reviewing and monitoring the trading limits established on all trading 

desks.  As contemplated in the statute, capital requirements might also be used as a 

complementary tool, such as by requiring progressively higher amounts of capital as trading 

inventories age--a pretty good indicator that market making is morphing into proprietary trading.  

Whether a consistent approach can be developed while five agencies continue to be involved is 

not clear, but it is certainly worth trying. 

 The third problem, also in the statute, is that the Volcker rule applies to a much broader 

group of banks than is necessary to achieve its purpose.  As I have said before, the concerns 

underlying the Volcker rule are simply not an issue at community banks.2  Many regional banks
