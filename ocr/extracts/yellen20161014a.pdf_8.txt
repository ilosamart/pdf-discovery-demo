Federal Reserve.12  Nevertheless, the various linkages between heterogeneity and 

aggregate demand are not yet well understood, either empirically or theoretically.  More 

broadly, even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well suited to achieve 

distributional objectives, it is important for policymakers to understand and monitor the 

effects of macroeconomic developments on different groups within society. 

Financial Linkages to the Real Economy 

My third question concerns a key issue for monetary policy and macroeconomics 

that is less directly addressed by this conference:  How does the financial sector interact 

with the broader economy?   

In light of the housing bubble and subsequent events, policymakers clearly need 

to better understand what kinds of developments contribute to financial crises.  What is 

the relationship between the buildup of excessive leverage and the value of real estate and 

other types of collateral, and what factors impede or facilitate the deleveraging process 

that follows?  Does the economic fallout from a financial crisis depend on the particulars 

of the crisis, such as whether it involves widespread damage to household balance sheets?  

How does the nature and degree of the interconnections between financial firms affect the 

propagation and amplification of stress through the financial system and overall 

economy?  Finally--and most importantly--what can monetary policy and financial 

oversight do to reduce the frequency and severity of future crises? 

                                                 
12 Guvenen (2011) reviews several issues related to macroeconomics with heterogeneity.  For an overview 
of the interactions between distribution and aggregate outcomes, see the work by Quadrini and Rios-Rull 
(2015).  For recent work on the effects of monetary policy in models with heterogeneous agents, see 
Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2016); Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2016); Auclert (2016); and Sterk 
and Tenreyro (2016).
