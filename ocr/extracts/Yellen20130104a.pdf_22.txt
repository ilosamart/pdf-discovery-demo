Moreover, the analyses for monitoring and measuring systemic risks suggested and 

described by Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia and by Cont, Moussa, and Santos require this 

kind of detailed data to gain a holistic view of systemic risk.    

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that data on U.S. swaps transactions be 

reported to swaps data repositories regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission or to securities-based swaps data repositories regulated by the Securities and 

Exchange Commission.  Similar European regulations impose trade reporting 

requirements on swaps transacted in Europe.  But there is still no guarantee, due to 

confidentiality concerns and legal barriers to data sharing, that the data reported into 

these trade repositories will ultimately be accessible to all of the regulators who require 

the data to obtain a holistic view of the derivatives market.  Given that the derivatives 

market is global in scope, access to those data is essential for authorities with systemic 

risk responsibilities, such as the Federal Reserve, to monitor and respond to risks.  To 

make this point concrete, it is unclear whether we will be able, on a regular and 

comprehensive basis, to produce the sort of analysis illustrated by figure 4.  In order to 

effectively monitor market developments and systemic risks, it is crucial that regulators 

across jurisdictions and countries share data on a consistent and regular basis.  

While better data and more transparency are important for monitoring and 

responding to the buildup of systemic risks, we do, of course, also recognize the 

confidentiality concerns.  Information is a valuable resource to most financial market 

participants, and unnecessarily burdensome or overly revealing information disclosures 

could compromise the position of market participants and reduce incentives for trade,
