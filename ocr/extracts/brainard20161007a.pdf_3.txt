where technology changes are viewed through the prism of our responsibilities for 

promoting the safety and efficiency of the payments and settlements systems; supervising 

financial institutions engaged in payments, clearing and settlement; and safeguarding 

financial stability.  We want to maintain public confidence in the payments system, while 

supporting innovation that provides broadly shared benefits to the public over time, 

including through the reduction of unnecessary frictions, costs, and delays.   

 Illustrative Use Cases 

 Let me briefly mention a few of the use cases that we have explored in our 

discussions with industry stakeholders in order to illustrate the potential of distributed 

ledger technologies to improve payments, clearing, and settlement, as well as the 

considerations that are important to us in our assessment of benefits and risks.   

In cross-border payments and trade finance, significantly faster processing and 

reduced costs relative to the long and opaque intermediation chains associated with 

current methods of correspondent banking are promising potential benefits of the 

technology.  Reducing intermediation steps in cross-border payments may help decrease 

time, costs, and counterparty risks and may materially diminish opacity, for instance by 

enabling small businesses or households remitting payments across borders to see the 

associated transfer costs and processing times up front.  In trade finance, where 

document-intensive processes are not fully automated, distributed ledger technology may 

be able to reduce significant costs and speed up processing associated with issuing and 

tracking letters of credit and associated documents. To see the full potential of this 

technology realized for cross-border payments, it will be important to identify and track
