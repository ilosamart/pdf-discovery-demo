Largely as a result of these measures, the common equity capital ratios of the 

largest U.S. bank holding companies have more than doubled since the crisis.  In 

addition, banking organizations are, for the first time, subject to a numerical liquidity 

requirement.  The requirement ensures that large banking organizations maintain buffers 

of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to meet cash outflows during a 30-day episode of 

systemic and idiosyncratic liquidity stress.  In addition, the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council has designated four key nonbanking institutions as “systemically important 

financial institutions,” and these firms are also subject to supervision and regulation by 

the Federal Reserve. 

These changes in supervision and regulation, along with the enhancement of 

resolution mechanisms for financial institutions, have made the financial system more 

resilient and lessened the probability that a lender of last resort will be needed to deal 

with financial stresses in the future.  Because the regulated firms are much better 

capitalized, doubts about their financial condition are less likely to arise, making them in 

turn less likely to lose access to funding in the marketplace.  Moreover, their substantial 

stockpiles of liquid assets should allow them to weather temporary periods of illiquidity 

without assistance or, if necessary, provide time for the authorities to implement an 

orderly resolution. 

While we have likely reduced the probability that lender of last resort loans will 

be needed in the future, we have not reduced that probability to zero.  We could, 

presumably, require financial institutions to fund illiquid assets entirely with longer-term 

debt and equity or, equivalently, allow them to use short-term liabilities to fund only safe 

and highly liquid assets.  However, such an approach would be costly in terms of reduced
