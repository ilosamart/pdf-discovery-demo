economy is producing at its full potential rather than leaving productive resources fallow.  

In the longer term, minimizing the duration of unemployment supports a healthy 

economy by avoiding some of the erosion of skills and loss of attachment to the labor 

force that is often associated with long-term unemployment. 

Notwithstanding this observation, which adds urgency to the need to achieve a 

cyclical recovery in employment, most of the economic policies that support robust 

economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank.  We have 

heard a great deal lately about federal fiscal policy in the United States, so I will close 

with some thoughts on that topic, focusing on the role of fiscal policy in promoting 

stability and growth.  

To achieve economic and financial stability, U.S. fiscal policy must be placed on 

a sustainable path that ensures that debt relative to national income is at least stable or, 

preferably, declining over time.  As I have emphasized on previous occasions, without 

significant policy changes, the finances of the federal government will inevitably spiral 

out of control, risking severe economic and financial damage.1  The increasing fiscal 

burden that will be associated with the aging of the population and the ongoing rise in the 

costs of health care make prompt and decisive action in this area all the more critical. 

Although the issue of fiscal sustainability must urgently be addressed, fiscal 

policymakers should not, as a consequence, disregard the fragility of the current 

economic recovery.  Fortunately, the two goals of achieving fiscal sustainability--which 

is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term--and avoiding the 

creation of fiscal headwinds for the current recovery are not incompatible.  Acting now to
