Another effort to improve communication with community bankers is our new 

Community Banking Connections website and quarterly newsletter.  These sources of 

information focus on safety-and-soundness issues that are of practical interest to 

community bankers and bank board members.  We have also launched a series of special-

purpose publications called Fed Links that highlight key elements of specific supervisory 

topics and discuss how examiners typically address the topic.8  The common goal of all of 

these outreach efforts is building and sustaining an ongoing dialogue with community 

bankers. 

Despite the challenges that you face, I firmly believe that community banks are 

here to stay.  Banks of different sizes serve different functions, and both large and small 

banks are needed to meet the funding needs of a healthy economy.  The Federal Reserve 

does not use a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and supervision and is committed to 

continually reevaluating and improving oversight to meet the complementary goals of 

bank soundness, financial stability, and economic growth.  The risks and vulnerabilities of 

community banks differ substantially from those of larger banks, and an explicit tailoring 

of regulation and supervision for community banks is appropriate. 

I look forward to our discussion.
