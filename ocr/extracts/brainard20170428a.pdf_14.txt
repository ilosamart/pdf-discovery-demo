Regulatory Developments 

As regulators, we have a responsibility to ensure that the institutions subject to our 

supervision are operated safely and soundly and that they comply with applicable statutes and 

regulations.  More broadly, we have a strong interest in permitting socially beneficial 

innovations to flourish, while ensuring the risks that they may present are appropriately 

managed, consistent with the legal requirements.  We do not want to unnecessarily restrict 

innovations that can benefit consumers and small businesses through expanded access to 

financial services or greater efficiency, convenience, and reduced transaction costs.  Nor do we 

want to drive these activities away from regulated banks and toward less governed spaces in the 

financial system.  

Regulators in the United Kingdom and continental Europe have recently outlined new 

approaches to facilitate connectivity in financial services, while attempting to mitigate the 

associated risks.  In August 2016, the UK Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) released a 

package of mandates aimed at increasing competition for consumer and small business current 

accounts (akin to U.S. checking accounts).27  This year nine of the country’s largest banks were

larger banks do not have to compete hard enough for customers’ business, and smaller and newer banks find it 
difficult to grow.  This means that many people are paying more than they should and are not benefiting from new 
services.  To tackle these problems, the CMA is implementing a wide-reaching package of reforms.  Central to the 
CMA’s remedies are measures to ensure that customers benefit from technological advances and that new entrants 
and smaller providers are able to compete more fairly.”); UK Competition & Markets Authority, Retail Banking
