and that is explored in the research of Caballero and Simsek.  Moreover, because market 

participants commonly have partially or fully offsetting positions with multiple 

counterparties, a fully bilateral network is inefficient from a risk-management standpoint:  

Gains in the value of positions with one counterparty cannot be netted against losses in 

the value of positions with other counterparties.   

By taking one side of every trade, a central counterparty serves to transform the 

mesh network shown in panel A of figure 3 into something that looks more like the hub-

and-spoke network illustrated in panel B.  This network structure has no effect on the 

exposure of individual market participants to the assets or indexes underlying the 

derivatives contracts in question, but it dramatically simplifies and improves the 

transparency of the network of counterparty risk exposures.

Central clearing can yield important advantages over a fully bilateral market 

structure.  The simpler hub-and-spoke network structure is more transparent, and the 

central counterparty is well positioned to impose common margin requirements on all 

market participants.  Central clearing facilitates the netting of gains and losses across 

multiple market participants, which has the potential to significantly reduce each 

participantâ€™s aggregate counterparty risk exposure.  Rather than managing its 

counterparty risk exposure to all other trading partners, a market participant needs to 

manage only its exposure to the central counterparty.  The central counterparty acts as a

 For clarity, figure 3, panel B, illustrates an idealized centrally cleared network in which only one central 

counterparty clears all trades.  In practice, it is entirely possible that more than one central counterparty 

may accept a given class of contracts for clearing.  Research by Darrell Duffie and Haoxiang Zhu, among 

others, shows that central clearing exhibits significant economies of scale and scope (Duffie and Zhu, 

2011).  As in other economic enterprises that exhibit strong positive network effects, the potential 

efficiency gains from consolidation in central clearing need to be appropriately weighed against the 

countervailing benefits afforded by greater competition among central counterparties.
