Looking at the smallest community banks, those with less than $100 million in 

assets, gives some hints for why their numbers have declined.  The average ROA for the 

smallest banks (in purple, with circles) has been consistently lower than that for the next-

smallest class of banks since 1995.  The already lower level of profits for the smallest 

banks began to decline further in 2006.  Since 2009, profits for the smallest banks have 

increased slightly but remain below their levels of profitability prior to the recession and 

below the ROA levels for larger banks.5 

Data on nonperforming loans (NPLs) show a mixed picture.6  A breakdown of 

community banks by size indicates that the ratio of NPLs to total loans peaked for every 

size category in 2010 (figure 8).  Prior to 2007, the smallest community banks 

consistently had a higher ratio of NPLs than did larger community banks; but from 2007 

until 2013, their NPL rate was below that of larger community banks.  In the past two 

years, NPLs on the balance sheets of the smallest banks have declined more slowly than 

for larger banks so that banks with less than $100 million in assets once again have the 

highest NPL ratio. 

Let me turn now to consider changes in the number of community banks over the 

past 20 years at a more local level.  For purposes of this discussion, I define local banking 

markets as counties in rural areas and as Metropolitan Statistical Areas in urban areas.  

                                                 
5 The patterns for return on equity (ROE) are similar to those for ROA, although community banks as a 
whole had negative ROE in both 2009 and 2010.  The largest community banks, with $1 billion to 
$10 billion in assets, suffered much greater negative returns on equity in these years than did smaller 
community banks.  Midsize community banks, with $300 million to $1 billion in assets, fared better than 
their larger and smaller counterparts. 
     The smallest community banks showed an unusual pattern in their ROEs.  (It should be noted that, for 
banks of this size, ROE can be a questionable measure of profitability because such banks tend to be either 
privately held or very thinly traded.)  These banks were in the only size category that did not show a 
negative ROE in 2009, but it was also the only class to show a negative ROE in 2013, and the ROE for 
these banks has been consistently below that for larger banks since the recession. 
6 NPLs are defined as nonaccrual loans plus loans that are 90-plus days past due and still accruing.
