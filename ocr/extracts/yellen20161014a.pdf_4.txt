demographic factors, as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of 

labor productivity.  The latter likely reflects an unusually slow pace of business capital 

accumulation since the crisis and, more conjecturally, the sharp decline in spending on 

research and development and the very slow pace of new firm formation in recent years.6 

If we assume that hysteresis is in fact present to some degree after deep 

recessions, the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse 

these adverse supply-side effects by temporarily running a “high-pressure economy,” 

with robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market.  One can certainly identify 

plausible ways in which this might occur.  Increased business sales would almost 

certainly raise the productive capacity of the economy by encouraging additional capital 

spending, especially if accompanied by reduced uncertainty about future prospects.  In 

addition, a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit 

on the sidelines and encourage job-to-job transitions that could also lead to more-

efficient--and, hence, more-productive--job matches.7  Finally, albeit more speculatively, 

strong demand could potentially yield significant productivity gains by, among other 

things, prompting higher levels of research and development spending and increasing the 

incentives to start new, innovative businesses.   

Hysteresis effects--and the possibility they might be reversed--could have 

important implications for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy.  For example, 

hysteresis would seem to make it even more important for policymakers to act quickly 

                                                 
6 Fernald (2015), however, argues that much of the apparent slowdown in U.S. potential GDP growth 
began prior to the 2007-09 recession. 
7 See Okun (1973) for an early discussion of the benefits of a high-pressure economy.  Importantly, not all 
of these benefits might show up as measured output, but they would nonetheless be welfare improving--for 
example, higher job satisfaction from better matches between workers and employers, as noted by Akerlof, 
Rose, and Yellen (1988).
