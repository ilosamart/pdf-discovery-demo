considerable uncertainty.  Moreover, the purchases created a large volume of excess reserves in 

the banking system.  The reserves themselves could begin to affect the pattern of interest rates if 

depositories try to diversify out of reserves into other assets.  When it comes time to absorb those 

reserves and raise interest rates, the Federal Reserve has a variety of tools at its disposal, ranging 

from increasing the rate it pays on excess reserves, to absorbing reserves by engaging in reverse 

repurchase agreements or offering term deposits to depository institutions, to selling the assets on 

its balance sheet.  The possible mix of and sequencing in the use of those tools is under active 

consideration by the FOMC.  We will choose the combination best suited to meeting our 

macroeconomic objectives, and those choices will influence not only the general level of interest 

rates, but also the relationships among them.    

Finally, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates fluctuate in response to many forces 

in addition to changes in the stance of monetary policy; yield curves have shifted considerably at 

times in the past when monetary policy has been relatively inactive.  For example, the path of the 

federal budget deficit is likely to be an important influence over coming years.  As you know, 

under current law, the deficit is on track to remain quite large even as the economy recovers, 

pushing up the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product substantially.  Unless the trajectory 

is changed, the competition for savings between the government, on the one hand, and 

households and businesses, on the other, could be significant as households and businesses begin 

to borrow and spend in the recovery, putting upward pressure on interest rates.  Moreover, a 

number of institutions have an unusually large amount of debt to roll over in the next few years 

as a consequence of the shortening of the maturity of borrowing that naturally occurred under the 

pressure of financial market turmoil.  I’m confident that sound institutions will find credit readily 

available to them, but the cost could be affected by the increasing competition for funds.
