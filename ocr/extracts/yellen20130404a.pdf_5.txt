It will help if I start with some basics.  The FOMC consists of the 7 members of 

the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and 5 of the 12 presidents of the regional 

Federal Reserve Banks.  All 12 presidents participate in FOMC meetings but only 5 get a 

vote, a roster that rotates each year.   

The FOMC’s job, assigned by the Congress, is to use monetary policy to promote 

maximum employment and stable prices, objectives that together are known as the 

Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  In normal times, the Committee pursues these goals by 

influencing the level of a short-term interest rate called the federal funds rate, which is 

what banks charge each other for overnight loans.  When the FOMC pushes the federal 

funds rate up or down, other short-term interest rates normally move in tandem.  

Medium- and longer-term interest rates, including auto loan rates and mortgage rates, 

generally adjust also, through a mechanism I will return to in a moment.  By pushing the 

federal funds rate up or down, the FOMC seeks to influence a wide range of interest rates 

that matter to households and businesses.  

Typically, the FOMC acts to lower the federal funds rate, with the intention of 

reducing interest rates generally, when the economy is weakening or inflation is declining 

below the Committee’s longer-run objective.  The FOMC raises the federal funds rate 

when inflation threatens to rise above its objective or when economic activity appears 

likely to rise above sustainable levels.  Raising and lowering the federal funds rate was 

long the primary means by which the FOMC pursued its economic objectives.    

It is hard to imagine now, but only two decades ago, the Federal Reserve and 

other central banks provided the public with very little information about such monetary 

policy moves--the spirit of “never explain” was very much alive.  There were a number
