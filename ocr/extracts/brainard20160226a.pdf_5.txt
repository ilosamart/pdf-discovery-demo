likely much smaller now than it has been in earlier decades.  Recent research suggests a 

dramatic flattening of the Phillips curve in recent decades.4  If this finding continues to 

hold true, resource utilization would need to differ more sharply across national 

economies to produce a noticeable difference in inflation. 

The persistence of relatively soft core PCE inflation readings in the United States, 

despite a substantial improvement in employment, suggests we should be cautious in 

relying on the historical relationship between employment gains and stronger inflation in 

todayâ€™s economy.  Moreover, the softening in market-based measures of inflation 

expectations and some hints of weakening in survey measures deserve our attention.  This 

deterioration in inflation expectations and a weakened link between labor market 

tightening and inflation--together with the asymmetry of policy in the vicinity of the 

lower bound--lead me to put a high premium on evidence that actual inflation is firming 

sustainably.  

Putting these pieces of evidence together suggests that if core inflation remains 

below target in all major advanced economies and inflation expectations remain under 

pressure in many, I might expect policy divergence to remain more limited than 

previously predicted. 

Common Conditions 

To the extent that we are observing limited divergence in inflation outcomes and 

less divergence in realized policy paths than many anticipated, this could be attributable 

to common shocks or trends that cause economic conditions to be synchronized across 

                                                 
4 In the United States, for example, Blanchard (2016) estimates that the slope of the Phillips curve has 
declined by more than two-thirds since the 1970s.  Other recent research includes Blanchard, Cerutti, and 
Summers (2015) and Kiley (2015b).
