A key implication of the weakening in the relationship between inflation and 

employment, then, is that we should not assume monetary policy will act to restrain the financial 

cycle as much as previously.  As a consequence, policymakers may need to think differently 

about the interplay of the financial and business cycles due to the combination of a low neutral 

rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation.  With financial stability risks likely to be 

more tightly linked to the business cycle than in the past, it may make sense to take actions other 

than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.  In order to enable monetary 

policy to focus on supporting the return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent target on a 

sustained basis along with maximum employment, we should be looking to countercyclical tools 

to temper the financial cycle.   

One tool other central banks have been using to help temper the financial cycle is the 

countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB).  The CCyB provides regulators with the authority to 

require large banks to build up an extra capital buffer as financial risks mount.10  Although the 

CCyB was authorized as part of the post-crisis package of reforms, so far, the Federal Reserve 

has chosen not to use it. Turning on the CCyB would build an extra layer of resilience and signal 

restraint, helping to damp the rising vulnerability of the overall system.  Moreover, because the 

CCyB is explicitly countercyclical, it is intended to be cut if the outlook deteriorates, boosting 

the ability of banks to make loans when extending credit is most needed and providing a valuable 

signal about policymakers’ intentions.  This feature proved to be valuable in the United Kingdom 

in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
