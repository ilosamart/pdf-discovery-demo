from 45 percent to about 5 percent.6  Another important difference from the 1960s is that 

inflation has been low and stable for an extended period, which has better anchored 

inflation expectations.  Today policymakers have a greater appreciation of the role 

expectations play in inflation dynamics and a clearer commitment to maintaining low and 

stable inflation.   

Unfortunately, with the passage of a half-century and important changes in the 

structure of our economy and in central bank practices, in my view the historical 

comparison does not shed as much light as we might have hoped. 

Questions prompted by a tight labor market 

The lack of useful historical precedent leaves us with some uncertainty about the 

answers to several important and challenging questions.  First, estimates of the natural 

rate of unemployment by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants and 

others have drifted lower as unemployment has declined without much apparent reaction 

from inflation.  How reliable are these estimates?  Natural rate estimates have always 

been uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has become less responsive to 

the unemployment rate.7  The anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and 

                                                 
6 Other changes in the workforce since the late 1960s seem less likely to have much affected the natural 
rate of unemployment.  There are many more women in the workforce now, but while women used to have 
higher unemployment rates than men, that is no longer the case.  And while younger workers tend to have 
less stable employment patterns and higher unemployment rates than older workers, the working 
population is, on net, only a little bit older now than it was in the late 1960s.  (The average age of people in 
the workforce declined through the 1970s as more of the baby-boom generation entered their working 
years, but it increased subsequently.)
