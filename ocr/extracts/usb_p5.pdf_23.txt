and its subsidiaries are treated as one. Thus, the
total amount that all political committees of a
corporation and its subsidiaries may make to a
single candidate is $5,000 in any federal election
(provided that the committees are qualified multi-
candidate committees under FECA).

Violation of FECA by any corporation is
punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000,
and any director or officer of any corporation
who consents to any contribution or expenditure
by the corporation in violation of FECA is
subject to fine or imprisonment or both.

State laws concerning this matter should also
be reviewed by the examiner. However, FECA
preempts state law with respect to election to
federal office.

Bank Bribery Act—18 USC 215

The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984
amended the federal bank bribery law to pro-
hibit employees, officers, directors, agents, and
attorneys of financial institutions from seeking
or accepting anything of value in connection
with any transaction or business of their finan-
cial institution. The definition of a financial
institution in 18 USC 20(9) includes a U.S.
branch or agency of an FBO. The amended law
also prohibited anyone from offering or giving
anything of value to employees, officers, direc-
tors, agents, or attorneys of financial institutions
for or in connection with any transaction or
business of the financial institution. Because of
its broad scope, the 1984 Act raised concerns
that it might have made unlawful what had
previously been considered acceptable conduct.

In July 1985, the Department of Justice issued
a Policy Concerning Prosecution Under the New
Bank Bribery Statute. In that policy, the Justice
Department discussed the basic elements of the
prohibited conduct under Section 215, and indi-
cated that cases to be considered for prosecution
under the new bribery law entail breaches of
fiduciary duty or dishonest efforts to undermine
financial institution transactions. Because the
statute was intended to reach acts of corruption
in the banking industry, the Justice Department
expressed its intent not to prosecute insignificant
gift giving or entertaining that does not involve
a breach of fiduciary duty or dishonesty.

Congress decided that the broad scope of the
statute provided too much prosecutorial discre-
tion. Consequently, Congress adopted the Bank

Bribery Amendments Act of 1985 to narrow the
scope of 18 USC 215 by adding a new element,
namely, an intent to corruptly influence or reward
an officer in connection with financial institution
business.

This law now specifically excepts the pay-
ment of bona fide salary, wages, fees or other
compensation paid, or expenses paid or reim-
bursed in the usual course of business. In
addition, the law now requires the financial
institution regulatory agencies to publish guide-
lines to assist employees, officers, directors,
agents, and attorneys of financial institutions in
complying with the law. The branch’s internal
code or written policy should prohibit such
persons from (1) soliciting for themselves or for
a third party (other than the branch itself)
anything of value from anyone in return for any
business, service, or confidential information of
the branch and from (2) accepting anything of
value (other than bona fide salary, wages, and
fees) from anyone in connection with the busi-
ness of the branch, either before or after a
transaction is discussed or consummated. In
addition, the code/policy may specify appropri-
ate exceptions to the general prohibition of
accepting something of value in connection with
branch business.

Furthermore, the branch’s code of conduct or
written policy should provide that if a branch
official is offered or receives something of value
beyond what is permitted in the policy, that
branch official must disclose that incident to an
appropriately designated official of the financial
institution. The branch should maintain such
disclosures. A branch official’s full disclosure
evidences good faith when it is made in the
context of properly exercised supervision and
control. Management should review the disclo-
sures and determine that what is accepted is
reasonable and does not pose a threat to the
integrity of the branch. Thus, the prohibitions of
the bank bribery statute cannot be avoided by
simply reporting to management the acceptance
of various gifts.

The business luncheon or holiday season gift
from a customer generally is not a violation of
the statute if: (1) its acceptance is based on a
family or personal relationship existing indepen-
dent of any business of the financial institution,
(2) the benefit is available to the general public
under the same conditions on which it is avail-
able to the branch, or (3) the benefit would be
paid for by the branch as a reasonable business
expense if not paid for by another party. What is
