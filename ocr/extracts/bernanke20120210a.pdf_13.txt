Moreover, keeping paying tenants in homes--including leasing to the former 

owners at market rents--may, in some cases, be the best way to maintain property values 

and the quality of neighborhoods.  REO-to-rental programs could potentially also 

minimize the amount of time that a vacant property languishes in REO inventory.  That 

is, appropriately structured programs could help some involuntary renters become owners 

again by giving them options to purchase the homes they are renting.   

REO-to-rental programs are not a “silver bullet” for the housing market, and, 

indeed, implementing them presents some challenges.  For example, selling the properties 

in bulk to investors to rent out has proven difficult at times because of lack of financing, 

although the GSEs have just announced a pilot program to facilitate such purchases.  In 

addition, many REO properties may not be appropriate for REO-to-rental programs, 

either because they are in very poor condition or because they are not part of a 

sufficiently large cluster of properties to allow for economies of scale in their 

management. 

Nevertheless, REO-to-rental programs appear to have some potential for success.  

As of early November 2011, about 60 metropolitan areas each had at least 250 REO 

properties for sale by the GSEs and the FHA--a scale that could be large enough to 

realize efficiency gains.

  Atlanta has the largest number of REO properties for sale by 

these institutions, with about 5,000 units.  The next-largest inventories are in the 

metropolitan areas of Chicago; Detroit; Phoenix; Riverside, California; and Las Vegas,

Federal Reserve staff calculations from data on the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 

Real-Estate Owned Properties Portal, available at www.huduser.org/reo/reo.html.  Recently, only around 

half of the properties in the REO inventories of the GSEs have been offered for sale at any given point.  

The other properties are leased to existing tenants under the provisions of the Protecting Tenants at 

Foreclosure Act, are located in states with a redemption period after foreclosure, or are under renovation or 

otherwise unavailable for sale.
