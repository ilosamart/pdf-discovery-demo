The experience of the Great Depression had major ramifications for all three 

aspects of the Federal Reserve I am discussing here:  its goals, its policy framework, and 

its accountability to the public.  With respect to goals, the high unemployment of the 

Depression--and the fear that high unemployment would return after World War II--

elevated the maintenance of full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy.  The 

Employment Act of 1946 made the promotion of employment a general objective for the 

federal government.  Although the Fed did not have a formal employment goal until the 

Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 codified “maximum employment,” along with 

“stable prices,” as part of the Fed’s so-called dual mandate, earlier legislation nudged the 

central bank in that direction.

  For example, legislators described the intent of the 

Banking Act of 1935 as follows:  “To increase the ability of the banking system to 

promote stability of employment and business, insofar as this is possible within the scope 

of monetary action and credit administration.”

The policy framework to support this new approach reflected the development of 

macroeconomic theories--including the work of Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, Ralph 

Hawtrey, Dennis Robertson, and John Maynard Keynes--that laid the foundations for 

understanding how monetary policy could affect real activity and employment and help

 For example, section 10B enhanced the powers of the Federal Reserve to lend to member banks, and 

sections 13(3) and 13(13) enabled the Federal Reserve to provide short-term credit to a wide range of 

potential borrowers in specific circumstances.   
20

 More precisely, the three statutory objectives for monetary policy set forth in the Federal Reserve 

Reform Act of 1977 are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The 

dual mandate refers to the first two goals, and the long-term interest rate goal is viewed as likely to emerge 

from the macroeconomic environment associated with achievement of the employment and price stability 

goals (Mishkin, 2007).  Thus, the interest rate goal of the Federal Reserve Reform Act can be regarded as 

subsumed within the dual mandate.
