One particularly problematic policy is government guarantees of mortgage-related 

assets.  Pre-crisis, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were viewed by 

investors as having an implicit government guarantee, despite the GSEs’ representations 

to the contrary.  Because of the perceived guarantee, investors did not fully internalize the 

consequence of defaults, and so risk was mispriced in the agency MBS market.  This 

mispricing can be notable, and is attributable not only to the improved liquidity, but also 

to implicit government guarantees.10  Taken together, the government guarantee and 

resulting lower mortgage rates likely boosted both mortgage credit extended and the rise 

in house prices in the run-up to the crisis.  

Another factor boosting credit availability and house price appreciation before the 

crisis was extensive securitization.11  In the United States, securitization through both 

public and private entities weakened the housing finance system by contributing to lax 

lending standards, rendering the mid-2000 house price bust more severe.12  Although the 

causes are somewhat obscure, it does seem that securitization weakened the link between 

the mortgage loan and the lender, resulting in risks that were not sufficiently calculated or 

internalized by institutions along the intermediation chain.  For example, even without 

government involvement, in Spain, securitization grew rapidly in the early 2000s and 

accounted for about 45 percent of mortgage loans in 2007.13  Observers suggest that 

Spain’s broad securitization practices led to lax lending standards and financial 

instability.14
