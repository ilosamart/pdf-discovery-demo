financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.  Because the U.S. economy 

required additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC 

deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis:  balance sheet policies and 

forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate.16 

The FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet through a 

sequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension 

program, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.  

With regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made “calendar based” statements, 

and, later on, it issued “outcome based” guidance.  Overall, the empirical evidence 

suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by 

strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent.  That said, 

estimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely.17 

In addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will consider 

additional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding.  For example, as is presently 

Bank of Japan policy, the FOMC could, when the ELB is binding, establish a temporary 

ceiling for Treasury yields at longer maturities by standing ready to purchase them at a 

                                                 
16 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial 
Crisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed 
setting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017).  In addition 
to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other 
measures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more 
generally support the economic recovery.  These supplementary measures included the setting up of several 
credit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.
