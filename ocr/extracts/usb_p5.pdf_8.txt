Asset Pledge and Capital Equivalency Deposits
Effective date July 1997 Section 5030.1

Asset pledge or capital equivalency deposit
accounts may be established as a requirement
for licensing a branch. These accounts are
designed to provide a ready source of liquid
assets to begin to pay for the expenses of a
liquidation, in the event it became necessary to
take possession of a branch.

Federal and state licensing authorities may
prescribe, by statute or regulation, requirements
and conditions under which the branch will
establish, maintain, and conduct an asset pledge
or capital equivalency deposit account. These
conditions and requirements will vary from one
regulatory agency to another. However, the fol-
lowing represents some of the conditions or
requirements that may be imposed:

• Balance in the account may be a specific
dollar amount and/or a variable amount based
on a specified percentage of third party liabili-
ties (i.e., related party liabilities and other
specific liabilities are usually excluded);

• Guidelines for establishing the account (i.e.,
account must be held by a third party, in the
name of the licensing authority);

• Types of assets available for pledging or
deposit (i.e., certificates of deposit, U.S. gov-
ernment securities, etc.);

• Conducting transactions (i.e., regulatory
approval for deposits and withdrawals and
direct confirmation to the licensing authority
may be required).

Asset pledge or capital equivalency deposit
accounts, in severe problem situations, can also
be used as a form of supervisory follow-up
action. When severe problem situations are
encountered, the licensing authority may require
an upward adjustment by the branch in the
balance of the applicable account. This may be
done by increasing the, normally required, spe-
cific dollar amount and/or the variable amount,
based on a specified percentage of third party
liabilities. The amount of the increase should be
sufficient to give the regulators additional funds
to cover expenses associated with a branch
liquidation.
