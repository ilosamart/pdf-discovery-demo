The second key feature is a source of immediate funding to continue essential functions 

and minimize the kind of fire sales referred to earlier.  The Bankruptcy Code allows for so-called 

debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to be provided to any firm going through the bankruptcy 

process.4  Such DIP financing is often essential to maximize the going-concern value of the firm.  

For a failed SIFI, such funding may be required quickly and in fairly large sums—needs that 

may not be fully met by private lenders, at least not in the immediate aftermath of a firm being 

placed into the Title II process.   

For these reasons, funding from the FDIC, drawing on a line from Treasury, is available 

under Title II.  It is important to note, though, that the underlying concept has the same roots as 

DIP financing—lending that will maintain or increase the going-concern value of the firm, not 

absorb losses.  It is not a capital injection and does not put taxpayers at risk.  The FDIC has 

indicated that it will, in order to protect taxpayers more fully, require that the financing be 

collateralized and if, for any reason, the FDIC cannot recover the full amount of credit extended, 

the shortfall is to be made up by a tax on other large financial firms. 

 The third necessary feature is a temporary stay of close-out rights of qualified financial 

contract counterparties.  The ability of the FDIC, subject to important creditor safeguards, to 

nullify the direct- and cross-default rights of counterparties can halt the disruptive, uncertainty-

driven race to seize and liquidate a firm’s assets immediately upon its entrance into a Title II 

resolution.  The FDIC authority includes the opportunity to decide whether it wants to transfer 

qualified financial contracts (QFCs) to a bridge financial company or another solvent company 
                                                 
4 When a firm is continuing operations under the reorganization provisions of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 
or even doing so temporarily under the liquidation provisions of Chapter 7, it may, without court approval, incur 
unsecured debts for which creditors have priority over other unsecured lenders for normal operational expenses; 
with the approval of the court, the firm may also incur debt for other expenses.  As explained above, repayment of 
some existing short-term creditors may be necessary to maintain the value of a financial firm, something not 
generally considered a normal operating expense of the sort for which DIP financing is routinely available under 
current bankruptcy law.
