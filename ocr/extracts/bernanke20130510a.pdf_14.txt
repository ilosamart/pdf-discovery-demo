of a sharp move.  Asset prices that are far from historically normal levels would seem to 

be more susceptible to such destabilizing moves. 

From a financial stability perspective, however, the assessment of asset valuations 

is only the first step of the analysis.  Also to be considered are factors such as the 

leverage and degree of maturity mismatch being used by the holders of the asset, the 

liquidity of the asset, and the sensitivity of the asset’s value to changes in broad financial 

conditions.  Differences in these factors help explain why the correction in equity markets 

in 2000 and 2001 did not induce widespread systemic disruptions, while the collapse in 

house prices and in the quality of mortgage credit during the 2007-09 crisis had much 

more far-reaching effects:  The losses from the stock market declines in 2000 and 2001 

were widely diffused, while mortgage losses were concentrated--and, through various 

financial instruments, amplified--in critical parts of the financial system, resulting 

ultimately in panic, asset fire sales, and the collapse of credit markets. 

Nonfinancial Sector 

Our financial stability monitoring extends to the nonfinancial sector, including 

households and businesses.  Research has identified excessive growth in credit and 

leverage in the private nonfinancial sector as potential indicators of systemic risk.

Highly leveraged or financially fragile households and businesses are less able to 

withstand adverse changes in income or wealth, including those brought about by 

deteriorating conditions in financial and credit markets.  A highly leveraged economy is 

also more prone to so-called financial accelerator effects, as when financially stressed
