having today and use it to improve our work.  In doing so, I am confident our work will 

be more effective and efficient.  And in the process, I hope to help you better understand 

the role of the Federal Reserve and what we are trying to accomplish.   

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy mandate is twofold: to promote maximum 

employment and stable prices.  To do that, we continuously monitor the health of the 

U.S. economy in general, and because of its sizable share of overall activity, the 

agricultural sector in particular.  U.S. agriculture and its related industries support about 

22 million jobs in the United States and produce close to 10 percent of our exports.2  A 

healthy farm economy also supports many rural and regional economies.  We track 

commodity prices, ag credit, and exports as factors that influence our outlook on inflation 

and economic growth.  As bank supervisors, we work to ensure safe and sound banking 

practices.  We also monitor trends in asset quality and risk-management practices at 

agricultural banks as part of our ongoing assessment of the level and direction of risk at 

these financial institutions and within the agricultural economy.    

Earlier this week, I had the privilege of welcoming farm sector leaders to the 

Federal Reserve Board in Washington, where we hosted the 2019 National Agricultural 

Credit Conference.  For nearly 80 years, this conference has brought together leaders in 

this sector to discuss important issues related to farm credit.  Attendees at this year’s 

conference recognized that, while the outlook for the farm economy in 2019 may be 

similar to a year ago, there are ongoing concerns that increasing stress on producers could 

lead to repayment difficulties.
