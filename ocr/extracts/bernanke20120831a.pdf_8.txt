Importantly, the effects of LSAPs do not appear to be confined to longer-term 

Treasury yields.  Notably, LSAPs have been found to be associated with significant 

declines in the yields on both corporate bonds and MBS.14  The first purchase program, in 

particular, has been linked to substantial reductions in MBS yields and retail mortgage 

rates.  LSAPs also appear to have boosted stock prices, presumably both by lowering 

discount rates and by improving the economic outlook; it is probably not a coincidence 

that the sustained recovery in U.S. equity prices began in March 2009, shortly after the 

FOMC’s decision to greatly expand securities purchases.  This effect is potentially 

important because stock values affect both consumption and investment decisions.  

While there is substantial evidence that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases 

have lowered longer-term yields and eased broader financial conditions, obtaining precise 

estimates of the effects of these operations on the broader economy is inherently difficult, 

as the counterfactual--how the economy would have performed in the absence of the 

Federal Reserve’s actions--cannot be directly observed.  If we are willing to take as a 

working assumption that the effects of easier financial conditions on the economy are 

similar to those observed historically, then econometric models can be used to estimate 

the effects of LSAPs on the economy.  Model simulations conducted at the Federal 

                                                                                                                                                                                 
arbitrage model of the term structure of interest rates and time-series data from 1994 to 2007 to estimate the 
effects on term premiums of changes in the amount of longer-term Treasury debt and agency MBS held by 
the public.  Using this model, Li and Wei are able to infer the effects of the two LSAP programs and the 
MEP, controlling for changes in the expected path of the federal funds rate and its implications for long-
term interest rates.  Their analysis suggests that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are an important 
factor underlying the current very low level of the term premium in longer-term rates.    
14 On corporate bonds, see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011) and Wright (2012); Fuster and 
Willen (2010), Hancock and Passmore (2011), and Wright (2012) report results on mortgage yields.  Early 
skeptics of balance sheet policies worried that any effects on Treasury yields would not be transmitted to 
other interest rates and asset prices.  The evidence reported in these papers refutes this concern, as does the 
fact that spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields and mortgage rates over comparable-maturity 
Treasury yields were not elevated from late 2009 through mid-2011; those spreads have since risen 
somewhat, reflecting in part concerns about the European situation and the pace of the U.S. economic 
recovery.
