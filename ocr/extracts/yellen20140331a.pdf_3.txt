work; to feel your marriage and other relationships strained and broken by financial 

difficulties.  And yet many of those who have suffered the most find the will to keep 

trying.  I will introduce you to three of these brave men and women, your neighbors here 

in the great city of Chicago.  These individuals have benefited from just the kind of help 

from community groups that I highlighted a moment ago, and they recently shared their 

personal stories with me. 

It might seem obvious, but the second thing that is needed to help people find 

jobsâ€¦is jobs.  No amount of training will be enough if there are not enough jobs to fill.  I 

have mentioned some of the things the Fed does to help communities, but the most 

important thing we do is to use monetary policy to promote a stronger economy.  The 

Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps since the onset of the financial crisis to 

spur economic activity and create jobs, and I will explain why I believe those efforts are 

still needed.   

The Fed provides this help by influencing interest rates.  Although we work 

through financial markets, our goal is to help Main Street, not Wall Street.  By keeping 

interest rates low, we are trying to make homes more affordable and revive the housing 

market.  We are trying to make it cheaper for businesses to build, expand, and hire.  We 

are trying to lower the costs of buying a car that can carry a worker to a new job and kids 

to school, and our policies are also spurring the revival of the auto industry.  We are 

trying to help families afford things they need so that greater spending can drive job 

creation and even more spending, thereby strengthening the recovery.
