significant adverse effect if the failure of the resulting firm, or its inability to conduct regular-

course-of-business transactions, would likely impair financial intermediation or financial market 

functioning so as to inflict damage on the broader economy.”36  The Board will consider a 

variety of factors that could indicate the potential for damage, including the size of the resulting 

firm, the availability of substitute providers for any critical products or services, the 

interconnectedness of the firm with the banking and financial system, the contribution of the firm 

to the complexity of the financial system, and the extent of cross-border activities of the firm.37  I 

would expect that, over time, our discussion of these factors in the context of specific 

transactions will provide firms, their attorneys, and other members of the public with more 

guidance as to how a specific case is likely to be analyzed.  At some point, we and others in the 

official sector may become comfortable enough with a particular measure of systemic risk that it 

will be a starting point for analysis in these cases.  But I suspect it will be much longer, if ever, 

before such a measure could provide the extent of presumptive sorting that HHI does in antitrust 

analysis today.   

While the absence of experience and a comprehensive informing theory make detailed 

guidance infeasible in the foreseeable future, I do think we should be able to elaborate certain 

categories of presumptive approvals and denials more quickly.  Before I suggest how, let me 

emphasize that here I am speaking for myself only, since the full Board will address these issues 

only in future orders.  We have already suggested a limited presumptive safe harbor where an 

acquisition involves less than $2 billion in assets or results in a firm with less than $25 billion in 

total assets.38  Personally, I would set the size of the resulting firm higher than $25 billion, but 

somewhat lower than the $50 billion Dodd-Frank threshold over which a firm is subject to 

special prudential standards.
