Appendix 

Here we review the simulations that underlie the estimates of the effects of 

various economic disturbances for their implications for the long-run equilibrium real 

federal funds rate, using simulations of the staff’s FRB/US model.  We first provide 

background on the methodology we use.  We then review the nature of the shocks that 

are discussed in the speech and show the effects of those shocks on the long-run federal 

funds rate.  Finally, we provide details about the results shown in the figures. 

1.  Background 

Our point of departure is a definition of the equilibrium interest rate that 

corresponds with the neutral rate of interest.  In particular, we use the definition of the 

neutral rate of interest that Chair Yellen used in a 2015 speech:  “the real rate consistent 

with the economy achieving maximum employment and price stability over the medium 

term,” which, in an elaboration in a footnote, is said to be “usually thought of as 

independent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy . . . [that] fade 

away after a few years.”1  The sort of disturbances being captured under the rubric of 

shifts in r* are thus rarer and more persistent than the usual business cycle phenomena 

and are associated with the “various adjustment processes that are unusually drawn out 

by historical standards . . . [and have] slow-moving influences on both aggregate demand 

and supply.”2  This definition corresponds reasonably closely with the (possibly time-

varying) intercept of a Taylor-type rule in that the standard arguments of the 

                                                 
1 See Yellen (2015a), paragraph 15 and footnote 4. 
2 See Yellen (2015a), footnote 4.  Other definitions of the neutral rate used by the Chair in her public 
communications include the short-term real interest rate “that would be neither expansionary nor 
contractionary if the economy was operating near potential” (Yellen, 2015c, 2016) and the short-term real 
interest rate “that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in line with potential” (Yellen, 2015b).  
There may be circumstances in which the nuances of these definitions would matter, but, for our purposes, 
we can take them as one and the same.
