complex banking organizations to meet only the minimum standards in CCAR.  We expect the 

more systemically important firms to establish and maintain the most sophisticated risk-

management and capital planning practices.  Their risk management and capital adequacy should 

be sufficiently strong to help ensure their resiliency to a range of unexpected stress events, since 

their distress could pose a threat to the financial system and to the broader economy. 

Fourth, precisely because of its importance to our supervisory program, the qualitative 

assessment will continue to be progressively more integrated into year-round supervision of the 

CCAR firms.  While some important features of capital planning are observable only during the 

formal CCAR process, most of the risk-management and capital planning standards incorporated 

in CCAR are operative and observable by supervisors throughout the year.  These should be an 

important focus of ongoing supervisory oversight and of discussions between firms and 

supervisors.  Only in unusual circumstances should supervisors learn for the first time during 

CCAR of significant problems in the quality of the capital planning processes, and only in 

unusual circumstances should firms be surprised at the outcome of the qualitative assessment. 

We have already taken steps to further this integration of CCAR and regular supervision.  

At the end of each CCAR process our supervisors send to each firm a letter detailing their 

conclusions concerning the qualitative assessment.  To the extent weaknesses or areas for 

improvement are identified, those letters provide a basis for regular stocktaking by both firms 

and supervisors.  More generally, last year we released a paper on our expectations for all aspects 

                                                                                                                                                             
company-run stress tests and capital planning processes in the normal course of supervision.  This review is tailored 
to the smaller size, reduced complexity, and limited systemic risk of these firms. See footnote 5, p. 14160, of Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency (2014), “Supervisory Guidance on Implementing Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Tests for 
Banking Organizations with Total Consolidated Assets of More Than $10 Billion but Less Than $50 Billion,” final 
supervisory guidance (Docket No. OCC–2013–0013), Federal Register, vol. 79 (March 13), 
www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-03-13/pdf/2014-05518.pdf.  For other, smaller banking organizations--those with 
$10 billion or less in total consolidated assets--there is no supervisory expectation or regulatory requirement that 
these firms will conduct capital stress testing.
