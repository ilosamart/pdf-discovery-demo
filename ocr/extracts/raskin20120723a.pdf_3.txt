groundwork for change, but necessary, sustainable results are realized only when the regulated—

be they drivers or banks—get on board. 

If drivers are key players in ending texting-while-driving, then the banks themselves are 

essential actors in our economic comeback, and community banks play a central role.  

Community banks were not major culprits in the subprime mortgage crisis, but they definitely 

suffered from it and took some hard hits because of it.   

The best community banks exemplify the high-road virtues that we seek to revive as 

standard operating practices throughout the banking system generally.  I am referring to close 

customer service, long-term vision and sustained relationships, investment that benefits both the 

bank and the community, commitment to sound underwriting, and consistently legal and ethical 

practices and transparent governance.     

Here at the graduate school, I imagine these high-road virtues to be one of the core values 

of the program, not peripheral after-thoughts to the course work that you are engaged in.  This is 

good because, while I have been discussing the low road and the high road as though they are 

distinct and different physical destinations and directions, in fact it can often be difficult to tell 

the difference between the two.  And just as a detailed map, GPS system, and sound experience 

and judgment can help a driver know which road to take, it can require deep study, careful 

analysis, and commitment to be prepared to see the positive and negative dynamics intrinsic to 

any situation and then to make the right choice.    

I believe your institutions have the capacity to do a lot of good, and that in fact your 

banks are doing good work every day.  And that is why it is a privilege to be here to address you 

as future leaders of our country’s community banks.
