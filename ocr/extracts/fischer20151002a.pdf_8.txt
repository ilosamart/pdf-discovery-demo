notable growth in mortgage originations at independent mortgage companies as reflected 

in the striking increase in the share of home-purchase originations by independent 

mortgage companies from 35 percent in 2010 to 47 percent in 2014.  This growth 

coincides with the timing of Basel III, stress testing, and banks’ renewed appreciation of 

the legal risks in mortgage originations.12  As another example, there have also been 

many reports of diminished liquidity in fixed-income markets.  Some observers have 

linked this shift to new regulations that have raised the costs of market making, although 

the evidence for changes in market liquidity is far from conclusive and a range of factors 

related to market structure may have contributed to the reporting of such shifts.13 

Despite limited evidence to date, the possibility of activity relocating in response 

to regulation is a potential impediment to the effectiveness of macroprudential policy.  

This is clearly the case when activity moves from a regulated to an unregulated 

institution.  But it may also be relevant even when activity moves from one regulated 

institution to an institution regulated by a different authority.  This scenario can occur in 

the United States because different regulators are responsible for different institutions, 

and financial stability traditionally has not been, and in a number of cases is still not, a 

central component of these regulators’ mandates.  To be sure, the situation has improved 

since the crisis, as the FSOC facilitates interagency dialogue and has a shared 

responsibility for identifying risks and reporting on these findings and actions taken in its

13 As highlighted in detail in the report about events in U.S. Treasury markets on October 15, 2014, the 
move toward increasingly electronic, algorithmic, and high-speed trading in the foreign exchange, equity, 
and Treasury securities markets is almost certainly changing some aspects of liquidity.  See U.S. Treasury 
and others (2015), which includes the findings of staff from the Department of the Treasury, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the SEC, and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  See also Dudley (2015).
