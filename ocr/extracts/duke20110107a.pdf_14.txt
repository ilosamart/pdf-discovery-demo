roughly $1 trillion to a base of about $43 billion in aggregate bank reserves, M1 and M2 

rose at relatively moderate rates over the same period.  

Going one step further, I should note that the linkage between the monetary 

aggregates and either real economic activity or inflation has been very weak over recent 

decades.  The lack of a reliable relationship between the monetary aggregates and the 

economy led the Federal Reserve to abandon M1 as a key policy instrument in the early 

1980s and then to reduce the role of M2 as a policy instrument in the late 1980s and early 

1990s.  Indeed, in a 2006 speech about the historic use of monetary aggregates in setting 

Federal Reserve policy, Chairman Bernanke pointed out that, “in practice, the difficulty 

has been that, in the United States, deregulation, financial innovation, and other factors 

have led to recurrent instability in the relationships between various monetary aggregates 

and other nominal variables.”3  Still, my colleagues and I will be monitoring a wide range 

of financial and economic developments very closely--including the growth of the money 

supply, inflation, and many other financial and nonfinancial variables--and, based on a 

full assessment of those developments, the FOMC will withdraw monetary 

accommodation at the appropriate time.  My view is that the elevated reserve balances 

would be inflationary only if they prevented the FOMC from effectively removing 

monetary accommodation by raising interest rates when the time comes to remove such 

accommodation, and I am convinced that that will not be the case. 

The FOMC has a number of tools at its disposal for raising interest rates.  When 

appropriate, the Federal Reserve can put upward pressure on interest rates by raising the 

rate it pays on reserve balances.  Moreover, we have developed new tools that will allow
