Committee has relied too much on time-based guidance in recent years and should use it 

only parsimoniously in the future. 

I commend the authors for undertaking this enormously challenging and useful 

exercise.  The paper forces us to reconsider the Committee’s evolving understanding of 

the macroeconomic environment before, during, and after the Great Recession; its 

decisions and its communications; and the market’s understanding of those decisions, 

which have sometimes deviated from what the Committee actually said. 

The distinction between time-based and data-based guidance is an important one, 

and the potential problems with time-based guidance are real and well described in the 

paper.  That said, I am not convinced that this distinction has played a central role in 

determining the successes and challenges of FOMC communications in this remarkable 

era, or that it helps us improve in the future.  The authors are, in their words, 

“unabashedly judgmental” in labeling specific communications to be either time- or data-

based.2  My own judgments differ in significant respects from those described in the 

paper. 

Discussion of Forward Guidance 

I will start in December 2008, when the Committee said that “weak economic 

conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for 

some time.”3  This relatively weak time-based guidance was strengthened in a series of 

steps until August 2011, when the time-based language became “at least through mid-
