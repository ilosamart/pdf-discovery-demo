Aside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy, 

persistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for 

the robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate 

spending in the United States.  The gaps in household income and wealth between the 

richest and poorest households are at historically high levels, as income and wealth have 

increasingly accrued to the very richest households.  For example, results from the 

Federal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is due to be released 

soon, indicate that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of households reached 

24 percent in 2015, up from 17 percent in 1988.  The share of wealth held by the top 

1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.6  Some research 

suggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in 

the aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of 

any additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are 

likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.7   

Disparities by Race and Ethnicity 

 When we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.8  In August, the national 

unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked 

substantial differences across different demographic groups.  As shown in figure 1, 

unemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians,
