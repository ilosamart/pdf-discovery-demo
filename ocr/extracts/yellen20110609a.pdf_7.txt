year on average in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, compared with 9 percent 

per year in high-income neighborhoods.  Likewise, during the bust from 2007 to 2010, 

house prices fell 8 percent per year in lower-income neighborhoods, compared with 

7 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods.  House price changes also varied more 

across lower-income neighborhoods than high-income neighborhoods, implying that a 

greater share of lower-income neighborhoods exhibited price swings that were more 

dramatic than the overall average. 

 Linked inextricably to the volatility in house prices in these communities was the 

volatility of mortgage lending.  Mortgage lending surged in low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods during the housing boom, and subsequently contracted sharply.  Over 

2003 to 2006, purchase mortgage originations increased 60 percent in low- and moderate-

income neighborhoods but less than 20 percent in high-income neighborhoods. 8  

Unfortunately, during this surge in lending many borrowers were encouraged to take out 

subprime mortgages with teaser rates and prepayment penalties as well as alt-A 

mortgages with negative amortization features.  When these markets collapsed, 

precipitating an overall tightening in credit conditions, mortgage originations through 

2009 fell by 65 percent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and 50 percent in 

high-income neighborhoods. 

 The greater decline in house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods 

has had several unfortunate consequences for mortgage borrowers.  As of March 2011, 

borrowers with prime mortgages who lived in these neighborhoods were twice as likely
