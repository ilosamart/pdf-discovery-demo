today, where we are engaged in managing the expected exit from the policies adopted by 

the Fed to deal with the Great Recession. 

This morning I want to talk about major lessons learned from the economic crises of 

the last twenty years, many of them crises in which I was involved.  I draw on three 

papers on lessons of crises that I wrote at different stages during that period.  The three 

papers were written in 1999 (when I was at the IMF), 2011 (when I was Governor of the 

Bank of Israel), and 2014 (when I had been nominated but not yet confirmed as Vice-

Chairman of the Fed.)   

The ten lessons presented in each paper are summarized in Table 1.  Each lesson is 

numbered, and each bears a letter: F for the 1999 paper (written when I was at the IMF); 

B for the 2011 paper, when I was at the Bank of Israel; and S for SIEPR2, where the 2014 

paper was presented. 

Each of the lists reflects the concerns of the times and circumstances in which it was 

written.  The 1999 paper was written at a time when the IMF was under criticism for its 

handling of the many crises with which it had been confronted since 1994.  It was a time 

of far less transparency than today.  For instance, in May of 1997 when I paid a secret 

visit to Thailand to try to gauge the seriousness of their situation, and asked for data on 

their international reserves, I was told that I could get them â€“ on condition I not pass them 

on to anyone else in the Fund.  This was an offer I had no difficulty in refusing.   

In addition to lessons in the 1999 paper relating to the Fund, it is clear from the 

conclusions presented in F5 (Keynesianism), F6 (bank and debt restructuring) and F7 

(exchange rates) that the Fund had drawn the correct critical lessons on several of the
