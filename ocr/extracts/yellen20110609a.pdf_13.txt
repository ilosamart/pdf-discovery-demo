foreclosure processing, and should lead to improved customer treatment and better 

transparency and oversight of mortgage servicers’ processes.  The intent is for servicers 

to be held to the same standards regardless of their regulator and regardless of whether 

the loans being serviced are held on the originator’s books, have been sold, or have been 

securitized.  By having a common set of standards for the mortgage servicing industry, 

the financial regulatory agencies will emphasize the importance of servicing practices 

that promote the best interests of borrowers and the broader housing market. 

 Let me turn finally to mortgage credit.  No one wants to see a return to the loose 

lending standards that prevailed in the run-up to the crisis, but households and the 

economy will benefit if we can foster sustainable homeownership with an increase in 

responsible lending.  The Federal Reserve, in coordination with other agencies, has 

recently published two notices of proposed rulemaking that will affect the provision of 

mortgage credit.  I will describe these rules and explain how we are attempting to balance 

the objectives of better underwriting and access to credit in the rulemaking process.  I 

should note that both rulemakings are open for comment, and we very much welcome 

your feedback. 

 The first set of rules implements the risk-retention provisions of the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Broadly speaking, these provisions 

require issuers of all types of asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed 

securities, to retain 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets they securitize.15  In the run-

up to the financial crisis, a disproportionate share of mortgage loans was made by lenders

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Housing 
Finance Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (2011), “Credit Risk Retention; Proposed Rule,” (Docket No. 2011-1411), Federal Register, 
vol. 76 (April 29), p. 24090.
