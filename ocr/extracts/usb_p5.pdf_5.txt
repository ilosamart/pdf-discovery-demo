Liabilities Requiring Coverage

Once eligible assets are determined, the asset
maintenance computation requires a determina-
tion of liabilities requiring cover. Generally,
liabilities requiring cover include all liabilities
of a branch and may even include certain
contingent liabilities, as determined by the
appropriate regulators. The liabilities will be
adjusted to exclude the following:

• Amounts due and other liabilities to other
offices, agencies, branches, and affiliates of
the FBO, including unremitted profits;

• Reserves for loan losses and other
contingencies;

• Any other liability, as specifically required by
statute, regulation, or the appropriate regulators.
