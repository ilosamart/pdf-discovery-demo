path for policy and thus the term premium.  Moreover, fluctuations in the term premium 

on U.S. Treasury yields are driven in part by a significant “global” factor, which 

complicates efforts to treat the slope of the yield curve as a sufficient statistic for the 

expected path of U.S. monetary policy (Clarida, 2018c).  Again, here, surveys of market 

participants can provide useful information—for example, about “the expected average 

federal funds rate over the next 10 years,” which provides an alternative way to identify 

the term premium component in the U.S. Treasury curve. 

Quotes from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market can 

provide valuable information about two key inputs to monetary policy analysis:  long-run 

r* and expected inflation.14  Direct reads of TIPS spot rates and forward rates are signals 

of the levels of real interest rates that investors expect at various horizons, and they can 

be used to complement model-based estimates of r*.  In addition, TIPS market data, 

together with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of “breakeven 

inflation” or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of 

future inflation.  But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation needs to be augmented 

with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge 

between inflation compensation and expected inflation. 

As is the case with the yield curve and interest rate futures, it is useful to compare 

estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of 

expected inflation obtained from surveys—for example, the expected inflation over the 

                                                 
14 Well before the launch of the TIPS market, Friedman (1984) stressed the benefits to monetary policy 
analysis that would arise from the availability of market-based estimates of longer-term inflation 
expectations, and he contrasted that situation with the one then prevailing, in which it was difficult to 
ascertain the real yields implied by the market’s longer-term nominal yields.  In a similar vein, Campbell 
and Clarida (1987, p. 105) observed—also in the pre-TIPS era—that “it is hard to measure expected long-
term inflation rates.”
