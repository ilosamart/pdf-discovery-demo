requirement that large banking organizations have credible resolution plans and 

undertake preparations to make those plans operationally feasible.  In particular it 

requires the top-tier holding companies of systemic banking organizations to maintain a 

sufficiently large buffer of long-term debt that can be converted into equity and used to 

fully recapitalize their important operating subsidiaries in the event of bankruptcy.  The 

proposed levels of long-term debt are calibrated to the specific riskiness and scale of each 

institution’s activities, taking into account the likely shrinkage of the operations of their 

subsidiaries in resolution. 

 The requirement is designed to mitigate contagion, fire-sale, and run risks by 

providing comfort to depositors, short-term debt holders, and counterparties of the 

operating subsidiaries of the firm, since the long-term unsecured debt issued by the top-

tier holding company would be structurally subordinated to the claims on the operating 

subsidiaries.  The presence of long-term debt holders that will be bailed in ensures that 

taxpayer resources will not be used and should provide incentives to preserve the firm’s 

value as it approaches insolvency, thus aligning the firm’s interests with the public’s 

broader interest in financial stability.   

The Board has received many detailed comments on the proposed long-term debt 

rule.  Some have commented on the existing stock of outstanding long-term debt with 

acceleration clauses that might not qualify under the rule’s criteria and have proposed 

grandfathering as a possible solution.  Others have raised questions about whether the 

leverage ratio or the risk-based capital framework provides the more appropriate 

calibration benchmark for the minimum long-term debt requirement.  Comments from 

foreign banks have also addressed our proposal to impose internal long-term debt
