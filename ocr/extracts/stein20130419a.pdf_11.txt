liquidity services created by a bank--via its deposits, the credit lines it provides to its 

customers, the prime brokerage services it offers, and so forth.  The analog to the 

mitigation technology--the scrubbers--is the stock of HQLA that the bank holds.  And the 

analog to pollution is the net liquidity risk associated with the difference between these 

two quantities, something akin to the LCR shortfall.  That is, when the bank offers a lot 

of liquidity on demand to its customers but fails to hold an adequate buffer of HQLA, this 

is when it imposes spillover costs on the rest of the financial system. 

In the case of the power plant, I argued that a regulation that calls for a fixed 

quantity of mitigation--that is, for a fixed number of scrubbers--is more attractive when 

there is little uncertainty about the cost of these scrubbers.  In the context of the LCR, the 

cost of mitigation is the premium that the bank must pay--in the form of reduced interest 

income--for its stock of HQLA.  And, crucially, this HQLA premium is determined in 

market equilibrium and depends on the total supply of safe assets in the system, relative 

to the demand for those assets.  On the one hand, if safe HQLA-eligible assets are in 

ample supply, the premium is likely to be low and stable.  On the other hand, if HQLA-

eligible assets are scarce, the premium will be both higher and more volatile over time. 

This latter situation is the one facing countries like Australia, where, as I noted 

earlier, the stock of outstanding government securities is relatively small.  And it explains 

why, for such countries, having a price-based mechanism as part of their implementation 

of the LCR can be more appealing than pure reliance on a quantity mandate.  When one 

sets an up-front fee for a CLF, one effectively caps the implicit tax associated with 

liquidity regulation at the level of the commitment fee and tamps down the undesirable 

volatility that would otherwise arise from an entirely quantity-based regime.
