Third, the general-equilibrium structure of the model is also important:  It is 

helpful to be able to understand, for example, if a hypothetical appreciation of the dollar 

might have something to do with an increase in equity share values or whether an 

independent causal force is at work.  Finally, the New Keynesian nature of the model 

implies that wages and prices are sticky and that markets adjust slowly to their longer-run 

equilibria. 

Much of the usefulness of the FRB/US model stems from its careful modeling of 

the monetary transmission mechanism and the key role that the expectations of 

households, workers, firms, and investors play in that mechanism.  The monetary policy 

transmission mechanism is the means through which changes in a central bankâ€™s policy 

instrument affect the economy.  In the FRB/US model, the usual policy instrument--the 

federal funds rate--plays no direct role in the economy.12  Rather, an increase in the 

federal funds rate affects expectations of future values of that rate, which in turn affect 

interest rates on longer-term bonds, equity prices, and the exchange value of the U.S. 

dollar.13  Households and firms are forward looking in that the adjustment costs just 

mentioned oblige households to set out a plan--a contingency plan--for consumption, 

savings, and employment for the future.  Increases in interest rates influence these plans, 

as they do the investment and hiring plans of firms.  All of those decisions, in turn, shape 

employment, output, and inflation. 

                                                 
12 In this speech, I do not talk about the effects of so-called unconventional monetary policies--balance 

sheet policies, forward guidance, and the like--except to note that many of the same elements of the 

monetary policy transmission mechanism are in force when the central bank uses such policies; in 

particular, expectations formation continues to play a key role. 
13 There is also an effect on term premiums, which influence Treasury bond rates and, in turn, the rates on 

other financial instruments.
