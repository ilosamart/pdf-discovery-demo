level of a substantial senior debt requirement to facilitate resolution under Title II of Dodd-

Frank.  In parallel with the approach to capital surcharges, a senior debt requirement could also 

potentially be made a function of an institution’s systemic footprint. 

 To illustrate my argument, let us take as given the central premise of those who favor size 

limits:  namely, that society would be better off if the distribution of banks were not so skewed 

toward a handful of very large institutions.  (To be clear, I am using the word “size” as shorthand 

for the broader concept of an institution’s systemic footprint, which in addition to size, might 

reflect complexity, interconnectedness, and global span of operations.)  In other words, let’s 

simply posit that a goal of regulation should be to lean against bank size, and ask:  What are the 

best regulatory tools for accomplishing that goal?  As in many other regulatory settings, this 

question can be mapped into the “prices-versus-quantities” framework laid out by Martin 

Weitzman nearly 40 years ago.

  Here a size cap is a form of quantity regulation, whereas capital 

requirements that increase with bank size can be thought of as a kind of price regulation, in the 

sense that such capital requirements are analogous to a progressive tax on bank size.

 A key challenge with quantity-based regulation is that one has to decide where to set the 

cap.  Doing so requires a regulator to take a strong stand on the nature of scale and scope 

economies in large financial firms.  Moreover, even if one reads the empirical literature as being 

quite skeptical about the existence of such economies beyond a certain point in the size 

distribution--a proposition which itself is debatable--the most that such large-sample studies can

 See Weitzman (1974).  Haldane (2010) also uses Weitzman’s framework to talk about price-versus-quantity 

regulation in the TBTF context. It should be noted that there are various hybrid approaches that are neither pure 

quantity nor pure price regulation.  For example, Tarullo’s (2012) discussion of limits on uninsured liabilities is not 

a rigid size cap, since it does not constrain an institution’s absolute size, to the extent that it is able to adjust its 

funding mix.

 To be clear, this taxation aspect of capital requirements is not their only appeal, or even their primary one.  Even if 

it were almost costless to impose higher capital requirements on bigger banks--so that doing so provided essentially 

no disincentive to bank size--it might still be a good idea to do so, for purely prudential reasons.  In other words, 

capital requirements serve as both a prudential buffer and a tax, and can be a useful regulatory tool for both reasons.
