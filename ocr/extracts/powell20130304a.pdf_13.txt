Two provisions of existing law already impose size caps on U.S. banking firms.  One 

limits acquisitions of banks by any bank holding company that controls more than 10 percent of 

the total insured deposits in the United States, and a second, added by Dodd-Frank, forbids 

acquisitions by any financial firm that controls more than 10 percent of the total liabilities of 

financial firms in the United States.  In addition, Dodd-Frank added a new requirement that 

banking regulators consider “risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system” in 

evaluating any proposed merger or acquisition by a bank or bank holding company.  Critics 

argue that these restrictions are inadequate and subject to exceptions that continue to allow even 

the largest firms to grow, both organically and through acquisitions.   

The simplest forms of this idea would put a further absolute limit on the amount of 

balance sheet assets or liabilities, or on the risk-weighted assets of a financial firm.  Capping the 

size or systemic footprint of each financial firm would limit the adverse systemic effects of the 

failure of any single firm.  Smaller, simpler financial firms should be easier to manage and 

supervise in life, and easier to resolve in death.  One option would be to impose a cap on a large 

U.S. banking firm’s short-term non-deposit liabilities as a fraction of U.S. GDP.  This form of 

proposal would allow such a firm to continue to increase assets and diversify its activities to 

achieve potentially available economies of scale and scope, so long as the firm finances 

expansion through more stable forms of funding.

Any new size limits should be designed to limit systemic footprint while minimizing 

costs to efficiency.   This will be a challenging task.  The question of whether the benefits of
