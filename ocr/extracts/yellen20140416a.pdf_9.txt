Federal Reserve implemented at the height of the crisis had been largely wound down, 

and the Fed was soon to complete its first large-scale asset purchase program. Private-

sector forecasters polled in the April 2010 Blue Chip survey were predicting that the 

unemployment rate would fall steadily to 8.6 percent in the final quarter of 2011.11   

This forecast proved quite accurate--the unemployment rate averaged 8.6 percent 

in the fourth quarter of 2011.  But this was not the whole story.  In April 2010, Blue Chip 

forecasters not only expected falling unemployment, they also expected the FOMC to 

soon begin raising the federal funds rate.  Indeed, they expected the federal funds rate to 

reach 1.3 percent by the second quarter of 2011.12  By July 2010, however, with growth 

disappointing and the FOMC expressing concerns about softening in both growth and 

inflation, the Blue Chip forecast of the federal funds rate in mid-2011 had fallen to 

0.8 percent, and by October the forecasters expected that the rate would remain in the 

range of 0 to 25 basis points throughout 2011, as turned out to be the case.13  Not only 

did expectations of policy tightening recede, the FOMC also initiated a new $600 billion 

asset purchase program in November 2010.

were similar to the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the unemployment rate at the 
end of 2011 submitted in conjunction with the April 2010 FOMC meeting, which ranged from 8.1 to 
8.5 percent.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “Minutes of the Federal Open

meeting, the FOMC noted that “the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent 
months.”  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “FOMC Statement,” press
