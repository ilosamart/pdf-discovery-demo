suggests that state governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for 

retiree health benefits.4  

Not all of the longer-term issues facing state and local fiscal authorities involve 

closing budget gaps.  For example, in light of the recent experience, an important 

question is whether anything can be done to reduce the sensitivity of state and local 

budgets to the business cycle.  As the past couple of years have shown, the balanced-

budget rules under which most states operate can force sharp cuts in services and 

increases in taxes during recessions, which is just the time when many people in the state 

are economically most vulnerable.  Moreover, the instability in funding streams and tax 

rates associated with the business cycle can impede planning by both the public and the 

private sectors. 

By and large, the evidence suggests that balanced-budget rules provide valuable 

fiscal discipline for states, and I do not advocate eliminating them.5  However, even with 

these rules in place, the question remains whether the effects of the business cycle on 

state budgets can be mitigated in the future.  One strategy used by many governments is 

to build up a rainy day fund during good economic times.  Measured as a percent of 

general fund expenditures, the aggregate reserve-fund balances for all state governments 

stood at a record 11-1/2 percent at the end of fiscal 2006.  These comparatively high 

reserve-fund balances have lessened the severity of spending cuts or tax increases in 

many states during the past couple of years.  However, given the depth of the recession, 

even these historically high balances proved insufficient to fully buffer the budgets of
