of coverage of counterparties and products; the prudent treatments of legal netting, collateral and 
margin; and soundness in the stress methodology employed. 
Supervisors also requested that firms calculate an IDR loss estimate reflecting counterparty 
credit losses from default. The methodologies and the quality of firm submission varied. In some cases, 
supervisors developed independent estimates of the potential losses from counterparty defaults under 
the more adverse scenario. 
Pre-Provision Net Revenue 
Analysis of firm submissions for PPNR started with a critical assessment of the business 
projections that were included in the BHCs' submissions. In particular, the submissions and their 
underlying assumptions were assessed for consistency with the overall macroeconomic scenarios. To 
help in its work, the supervisors also reviewed copies of the firms' internal management and financial 
reports. For example, "ALCO packages," including information about the yield curve assumptions, net 
interest income projections, and economic value of equity assessments made by the firms as part of 
their business planning processes, were reviewed and compared with the assumptions used in firms' 
SCAP projections.9 [Footnote 9. The ALCO package is information generated by a bank holding company's " 
Asset-Liability Committee," containing historical information, analysis, and projections of the evolution of the 
firm's assets and liabilities, associated funding costs, and liquidity risk exposure and management. End footnote 9.] 
The supervisors also examined historical trends in the main components of PPNR--net interest income, noninterest 
income, and noninterest expense--for each firm using data from regulatory reports and from public financial 
statements. This evaluation involved a critical assessment of the firms' estimates based on supervisory knowledge 
of each firm's revenue drivers and the risks to those drivers. This analysis was then used to modify key 
assumptions in firms' forecasts (for example, projected growth rates and stock price indexes) to make them more 
consistent with the scenarios provided in the stress test. Peer analysis was also developed during the process 
and used to identify trends and outliers. 
Supervisors also examined the historical relationship between PPNR and its main components 
to measures of macroeconomic activity, and examined firm-specific differences in the composition of 
PPNR, assessing which components have been more volatile in the past, and thus less likely to be 
sustainable in strained economic conditions. 
Supervisors weighted the estimates arrived at through these techniques and compared them 
with firm submissions. Where supervisors' analysis produced lower estimates of PPNR than those 
provided by the firm, the supervisory estimate was applied. 
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
The supervisors developed benchmarks based on projections of the required level of reserves at 
the end of the scenario. The goal was to determine the level of reserves needed at year-end 2010 for 
two distinct portfolios, the "vintage" loans remaining from year-end 2008 and the newly extended 
credits over the scenario horizon. To arrive at the vintage loan total, supervisors began with the year-
end 2008 loan book balance, by loan segment, and reduced these balances based on the estimated 
losses calculated for this exercise. New loans were estimated based on information provided by the 
firms as part of this exercise or, if no loan growth information was provided, by assuming that any new
