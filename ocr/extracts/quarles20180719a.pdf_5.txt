That accomplishment is only the start of what will be many.  As I noted, just three 

months after SOFR has begun production, we have already seen the introduction of futures 

markets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  LCH has now begun to offer clearing of SOFR 

overnight index and basis swaps, and CME Group will begin to do so within a few months.  

These are steps that the private sector must lead, and they have, but it is important that the public 

sector encourage the development of SOFR markets where it can.  The ARRC has issued a first 

letter to U.S. regulators asking us to consider exemptions for legacy swaps seeking to incorporate 

the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s protocol or exemptions for amending to 

move from LIBOR to SOFR, and these are issues that we should look at seriously; we should 

avoid placing unintended hurdles in the way of those who may seek to transition from LIBOR.   

Here is something you don’t hear often in the context of any large, complex undertaking 

involving input from a large number of stakeholders:  The effort to implement SOFR is ahead of 

schedule. The ARRC has recognized that we have to make transitioning to SOFR as easy as it 

can be.  That is the reason that it has added the creation of a forward-looking term rate as the 

final step in its Paced Transition Plan.  As the ARRC has noted and the Financial Stability Board 

has now reiterated, this kind of forward-looking term rate will be useful in facilitating a 

transition away from LIBOR in some cash markets, such as corporate loans, but it is not 

primarily intended for use in derivatives markets.  In fact, we have to encourage use of SOFR in 

derivatives markets to the fullest extent possible if a robust forward-looking term rate is to be 

created.   

For that reason, we also have to find ways to encourage uses of SOFR in those cash 

markets where it is appropriate.  The European Investment Bank’s recent announcement that it
