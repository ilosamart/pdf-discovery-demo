the appropriate amount of prepositioned capital and liquidity.  We are also considering whether 

formalizing resolution capital and liquidity requirements through a rulemaking process would 

improve the predictability and transparency of our approach. 

We continue to believe that the IHC and attendant requirements are appropriate for 

foreign banks with large U.S. operations.  However, in light of our experience with these 

structures, I believe we should consider whether the internal TLAC calibration for IHCs could be 

adjusted to reflect the practice of other regulators without adversely affecting resolvability and 

U.S. financial stability.  The current calibration is at the top end of the scale set forth by the FSB, 

and willingness by the United States to reconsider its calibration may prompt other jurisdictions 

to do the same, which could better the prospects of successful resolution for both foreign G-SIBs 

operating in the United States, and for U.S. G-SIBs operating abroad.  Alternatively, it may be 

possible to streamline the elements of our resolution loss absorbency regime, which include both 

TLAC and long-term debt requirements.  I will be recommending to my colleagues that we look 

closely at these possibilities in the coming weeks and seek comment on ways to further improve 

this framework. 

Conclusion 

We are committed to working with other jurisdictions to continue to build the foundation 

of the SPOE resolution framework.  In addition to finding the appropriate balance of flexibility 

and certainty that I have discussed, we continue to advocate for increasing the standardization in 

the global implementation of the regulatory capital rules, improving host supervisorsâ€™ 

transparency into the global liquidity and capital positions of a G-SIB on a consolidated and 

deconsolidated basis, and addressing impediments to a successful SPOE resolution.  As with all 

regulations, we will be open to considering adjustments that would improve transparency and
