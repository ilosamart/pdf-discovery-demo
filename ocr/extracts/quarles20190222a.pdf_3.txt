little more detail around our decision to remain in the current framework of ample 

reserves. 

The most important factor in the decision was that the current system has worked 

very well. It has supported the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability.  And it has shown itself to be flexible and well suited to 

maintaining interest rate control through various changes in money markets, bank 

regulation, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Since the FOMC began lifting 

interest rates in December 2015, money market rates have generally moved closely with 

the federal funds rate, which in turn has followed changes in administered rates.     

Now that the decision on the operating framework has been made, a natural next 

step is to contemplate the appropriate size of the Fed’s balance sheet and reserves and the 

process for getting there.  In line with the requirements of operating with ample reserves-

-and boosted by the growth in nonreserve liabilities--the Fed will maintain a larger 

balance sheet and reserve supply relative to the pre-crisis period, with the goal of 

remaining on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.  I would note that reserves 

have already declined appreciably from their peak, falling by $1.2 trillion to a current 

level of around $1.6 trillion.  At the same time, we have seen a substantial increase in our 

nonreserve liabilities, such as currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account 

balance.  In our statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, we outlined an 

intention to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy 

efficiently and effectively.3  As the balance sheet continues to shrink, we are now in the 

process of determining that necessary size.
