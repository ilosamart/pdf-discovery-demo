Over the same period, however, about one-fifth of families saw a gain in wealth 

that was greater than six months of their usual income.  Moreover, a higher percentage of 

business owners who participated in the survey saw larger wealth gains relative to their 

incomes than was the case for the overall population.  These findings suggest that there 

just might be a pool of potential entrepreneurs who have both the resources and relevant 

experience to start successful businesses.   

Turning to the funding needs of more-mature businesses, in the 2010 SCF, we 

asked small business owners whether and to what extent external sources of money were 

used to finance the ongoing operations of or improvements to their primary businesses in 

the past year.  Focusing again on only businesses with fewer than 500 employees, the 

preliminary survey data suggest that for such purposes, slightly less than one-half of these 

businesses did not use any external funding.  Consistent with the funding information on 

the start-up phase for small businesses, a significant proportion of small business owners-

-about one-third--used their personal savings or assets to fund operations or make 

improvements.  And only small percentages of small business owners obtained credit 

from a bank or savings institution for such purposes:  Among these small business 

owners, about 5 percent used personal or business credit cards, slightly less than 

5 percent used business loans, and about 3 percent used personal loans. 

Taken together, these survey data suggest that many small business owners do not 

tap the credit markets, but instead use their own wherewithal to start and fund their 

businesses.  Indeed, a bit less than 80 percent of small business owner survey respondents 

with fewer than 500 employees indicated that they had not even applied for business 

loans in the past five years.  This is not to say that loans are not important--far from it--
