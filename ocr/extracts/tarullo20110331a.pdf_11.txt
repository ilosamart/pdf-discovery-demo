counterparties can survive.  Thus, it is important to set capital requirements such that the 

institutions designated by Congress or the FSOC could reasonably be expected to absorb losses 

associated with systemic stress without extraordinary government assistance, and still be well 

enough capitalized to serve as sound intermediaries.  Note that this is important both in order to 

preclude the need for government assistance and also to give assurance to those who might fund 

these institutions in a period of stress.   

Third, systemic risk supervision and regulation must be forward-looking.  The capital 

ratios familiar in banking regulation are at best a snapshot of the present and, if reserving for 

losses has lagged, not even that.  Actual and potential counterparties are less interested in a 

firm’s capital ratio at the moment they extend liquidity than they are in the ability of the firm to 

return those funds in the future, as called for in their contractual arrangements.  That is why, in 

the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) conducted in early 2009 and again in the 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review (CCAR) conducted early this year, the Federal Reserve 

focused instead on the common equity ratio that firms would maintain following losses that 

could be expected in an adverse scenario.   

A forward-looking, macroprudential perspective also requires attention to the co-

movement of firms’ asset valuations and revenues in a stressed environment.  This perspective 

reflects the fact that some losses are likely to be realized only in a systemic event.  For this 

reason, in our recent CCAR exercise we required the six largest firms to estimate potential losses 

from trading and related activities using the same severe global market shock scenario that was 

applied in the SCAP.  In fact, we actually required the firms to assume an instantaneous 

revaluation of their positions based on the change in market risk that occurred during the entire
