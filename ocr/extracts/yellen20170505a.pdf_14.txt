barriers to women’s continued progress remain.  The participation rate for prime 

working-age women peaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 75 percent.26  

Of course, women, particularly those with lower levels of education, have been affected 

by the same economic forces that have been pushing down participation among men, 

including technical change and globalization. 27  However, women’s participation 

plateaued at a level well below that of prime working-age men, which stands at over 

88 percent.  While some married women choose not to work, the size of this disparity 

should lead us to examine the extent to which structural problems, such as a lack of equal 

opportunity and challenges to combining work and family, are holding back women’s 

advancement. 

As I mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has 

narrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still 

earn about 17 percent less than men, on average, each week.28  Even when we compare 

men and women in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in 

background and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains.29  As such, we 

cannot rule out that gender-related impediments hold back women, including outright 

                                                 
26 The labor force participation rate for all women declined from a peak of 60 percent in 1999 and 2000 and 
now stands a bit below 57 percent.  However, as has been documented elsewhere, much of the decline for 
all women can be explained by the aging of the baby boomers into their retirement years and lower 
participation among teens and young adults.  It is also possible that the labor force participation rate is still 
being held down a bit by the waning effects of the Great Recession.  Aaronson and others (2014).

29 Manning and Swaffield (2008) find that although men and women enter the British labor force earning 
the same amount, among those who worked continuously and full time for 10 years, women would still 
earn 8 percent less than men, even if they have the same personality traits, were childless, and profess no 
interest in having children.  Also see Blau and Kahn (2016) and Noonan, Corcoran, and Courant (2005).
