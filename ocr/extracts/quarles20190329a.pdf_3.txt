of the incoming data in determining the appropriate stance of policy, particularly given 

some indication that growth has slowed, at least temporarily, in the most recent data.  

That said, I remain optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy, and I think that we 

have the potential to maintain growth at a healthy pace in the years ahead.   

With regard to the recent data, a sharp falloff in some retail sales measures in 

December suggested a slowing of consumption, the mainstay component of aggregate 

demand.  While I would not suggest ignoring this decline, it does seem rather inconsistent 

with a number of other indicators, including the continued strength of the labor market 

and wage gains in recent months.   

And the labor market does remain strong.  Even with a weak reading in February, 

the three-month average gain in payrolls, at 186,000, remains above most estimates of the 

pace of job gains needed to maintain downward pressure on an already historically low 

unemployment rate.  As with retail sales, the February payroll number seems a bit odd, 

especially when measured against the continued strength of the household survey for the 

same month.  That said, weak February payrolls are another reason to continue patiently 

watching the data to see how economic conditions evolve.   

Looking past the near-term data, I see many reasons to expect relatively strong 

growth in the coming years, supported by gains in the productive capacity of the 

economy.  Regarding the inputs of production, I have been encouraged by the increase in 

labor force participation over the past year.  After a period of subdued growth, investment 

was also strong last year, with spending on equipment and intangibles rising 7Â½ percent, 

increasing the capital stock and adding to the productive potential of the economy.  

Though some recent investment indicators have been less robust, these data are volatile,
