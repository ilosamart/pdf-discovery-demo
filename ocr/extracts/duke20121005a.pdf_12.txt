This initiative, called “Vacants to Value,” uses data and targeted housing code 

enforcement to foster redevelopment in areas where there is modest private investment interest.  

Using a variety of real-time data sources, this program has developed market typologies down to 

the census block-group level so that it can accurately determine the needs of specific 

neighborhoods and apply targeted programs to best meet those needs.  For example, the city is 

targeting approximately 700 vacant properties in weak market areas where large-scale 

investment--encompassing at least a city block--is necessary to catalyze private investment.  In 

healthier neighborhoods, the city believes that increased code enforcement and homebuyer or 

developer incentives should be enough to reduce vacancy and stabilize neighborhoods.  Lastly, 

in Baltimore’s hardest hit neighborhoods, the city is demolishing, holding, or maintaining 

properties that are unlikely to attract any private investment in the near future.20   

 Unfortunately, in some cases, vacant homes are beyond repair and will never be habitable 

again.  In these instances, demolition is often the best solution, and land banks can be a good 

way to hold the property until it can be converted to a better use.  A land bank is a governmental 

or nongovernmental nonprofit entity established, at least in part, to assemble, temporarily 

manage, and dispose of vacant land for the purpose of stabilizing neighborhoods and 

encouraging re-use or redevelopment of urban property.  Land banks have been around since the 

early 1970s, but the recent foreclosure crisis has stimulated the creation of several new land 

banking programs, including in New York State and Kansas City, Missouri.  A key characteristic 

of the new generation of land banks is that they often include mechanisms to self-finance over 

time, including the ability to recapture a portion of the property taxes for a fixed period of time 

after the property is put back to productive use.
