 While no institutions below $50 billion in assets are subject to supervisory stress 

testing or the requirements of CCAR, the Dodd-Frank Act does require that institutions 

with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets conduct their own stress tests.

  The 

initial tests by these firms will begin this year and will be completed by March.  While 

we believe that stress testing will help medium-sized institutions better understand the 

risks they face, we tailored our rule for these institutions to take account of differences in 

size, complexity, and business models.  We specifically exempted community banking 

organizations with $10 billion or less in total assets from the requirement that they run 

their own stress tests as those institutions cannot reasonably be expected to have the 

resources that larger banks devote to stress testing.

Benefits and Challenges of Stress Testing 

 As already noted, stress testing has a number of important benefits as a 

supervisory tool.  From a microprudential perspective, the CCAR provides a structured 

means for supervisors to assess not only whether banks hold enough capital, but also 

whether banks are able to rapidly and accurately determine their risk exposures, an 

essential element of effective risk management.  The cross-firm nature of the stress tests 

also helps supervisors identify outliers--both in terms of results and practices--that can 

provide a basis for further, more targeted reviews.
