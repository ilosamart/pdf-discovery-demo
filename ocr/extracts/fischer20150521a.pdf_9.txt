What about the present crisis of the euro area?  Two or three years ago, there was 

widespread skepticism on the western shores of the Atlantic and the English Channel 

about the viability of the monetary union, and there was much discussion of what would 

happen after the breakup of the present euro area--whether there would be one or two 

euro areas, one for the stronger countries, one for the weaker, and if so, how well each of 

the two blocs would fare.   

With one sentence--the sentence that included the words “whatever it takes”-- that 

skepticism was largely, though not totally, erased. With one decision--the decision to 

implement QE--it became clear that the ECB has the capacity both to decide to 

implement monetary policy at the zero lower bound--indeed below the zero lower 

bound--and to succeed in implementing that policy.  There can be no one whose Bayesian 

priors have not moved in favor of the survival of essentially the present euro area, even 

though we still await the outcome of the Greek crisis, and even though we know that the 

present crisis is not yet over. 

Is this an example of the success of the Monnet approach?  Absolutely.  European 

monetary policy in the earlier part of the Great Financial Crisis was innovative, 

particularly in the invention of full-allotment outright monetary transactions.  That policy 

was inspired by crisis, as were the innovative policies undertaken by the Fed in the 

United States.  More important than that:  It is hard to believe that a European banking 

union would have been put in place by 2014 if it had not been for the crisis.  And it is no 

less difficult to believe that a Single Supervisory Mechanism would have been set up 

absent the crisis.  Of course, one may say that the ability to make these difficult decisions 

depended on the skills of the leadership of the ECB--and that is true, and will always be
