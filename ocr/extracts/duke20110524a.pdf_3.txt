impact on the financial decisions made by American families.  Many now have fewer 

financial resources and limited options.  The pace and timing of their saving and

among recent high school and college graduates, especially among young African 

Americans, means that this demographic likely won’t be able to start saving and investing

In addition, starting salaries for recent college graduates have also declined,

saving and investing than their predecessors.  Young people are living with their parents 

longer, which helps conserve their limited resources but likely places a strain on their 

parents’ budgets. 

Also troubling is research showing that many consumers who should be saving 

for retirement instead have been forced to take hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) 

plans.  According to an analysis by Vanguard, hardship withdrawals increased by 49 

percent between 2005 and 2010.  Other types of withdrawals increased by 56 percent.  

The increasing use of retirement savings for other purposes is particularly 

troubling given that the responsibility for saving for retirement has shifted away from
