cases of bank panics (in which problems at one bank are imputed to others on the basis of 

incomplete and possibly incorrect information), led to government-provided deposit insurance.  

While countering runs and panics and protecting depositors from loss, government deposit 

insurance creates different justifications for capital regulation--protecting the government 

insurance fund, which is now guaranteeing a significant portion of the bank’s liabilities, and 

countering moral hazard, which may arise because insured depositors need no longer care 

whether the bank is adequately capitalized. 

The moral hazard issue leads us to a third example of how the liability side of the balance 

sheet of a financial intermediary reveals the need for capital regulation--the too-big-to-fail 

(TBTF) problem.  As the size of an intermediary increases, its exposures to other market actors--

including many other intermediaries--may become so extensive that its failure would threaten the 

financial system as a whole.  Believing that the government will, for this reason, prevent such an 

intermediary from becoming insolvent, market actors may extend credit as if a guarantee similar 

to deposit insurance were in place.  Thus the nature and extent of the firm’s liabilities, taken as a 

whole, may warrant capital regulation to offset an implicit TBTF subsidy. 

Even if the distinct problem of TBTF could be countered through other means, such as a 

credible bankruptcy or resolution option, the failure of a financial intermediary with systemically 

significant liabilities raises the prospect of imposing very large negative externalities on the 

financial system.  This prospect creates an additional argument for capital requirements--or, 

more precisely, an argument for progressively higher capital requirements that would reduce the 

probability of the failure of the systemically important intermediary. 

Note that this last discussion has moved us toward consideration of macroprudential 

reasons for capital requirements--specifically, for higher requirements aimed at reducing the
