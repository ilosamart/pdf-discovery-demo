I am pleased to participate in the ninth biennial National Interagency Community 

Reinvestment Conference.  Since its inception in 1996, this conference has fulfilled its 

mission to train bankers and community development professionals on the requirements 

of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) by providing cutting-edge information about 

regulations, policies, and best practices in community development.  In addition, it has 

become a source of inspiration for CRA-related community development activities.  As 

this year’s agenda demonstrates, this interagency conference has grown to encompass all 

aspects of community development, including discussions of community amenities that 

provide both quality of life and economic resilience for low- and moderate-income 

residents.   

Before I begin, I would like to thank the thousands of community development 

professionals I have met in the course of my work with the Federal Reserve for helping 

me to understand the breadth of the work that they do.  In fact, many of you are here 

today.  You have shown me your projects, shared your triumphs and frustrations, testified 

at hearings on the future of CRA, served on our Consumer Advisory Council, and 

actively participated in Federal Reserve conferences. Your counsel has given me a deeper 

appreciation of the complexities involved in creating and maintaining strong 

communities, particularly in times of economic stress.  In my remarks today, I would like 

to share some of these insights.
