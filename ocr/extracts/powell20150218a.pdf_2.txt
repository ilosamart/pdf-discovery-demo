It has now been over six years since the most acute phase of the financial crisis.  

Over the intervening years, market structures have evolved, and financial firms have

a range of factors that may address those challenges, illustrated with a discussion of 

recent developments in the syndicated leveraged loan market.  And I will argue that the 

standard for regulatory intervention in the credit markets should be higher than for the 

other three areas.
