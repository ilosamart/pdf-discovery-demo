There is a large body of evidence that suggests that LSAPs do in fact exert 

significant pressure on long-term Treasury yields.3  Estimates of the cumulative effect of 

past LSAPs on 10-year yields range from 80 to 120 basis points.4  And these past actions 

are one reason why Treasury term premiums are now near historic lows, on the order of 

minus 80 basis points, according to a well-known model used by the Board staff.5   

A central theme of my talk today is this:  When policy works by moving term 

premiums, as opposed to moving expectations about the path of short rates, the 

transmission to the real economy may be altered in subtle yet important ways that can 

have implications for the benefits of a policy action, its costs, and even its consequences 

for financial stability.  Moreover, to address these issues, we need to understand not only 

by how much an LSAP moves term premiums, but also why it does so.  It should be noted 

that many standard macro models completely set aside the distinction I am emphasizing 

here.  For example, in the Board staff’s main model, FRB/US, a fall in the long rate is 

assumed to have the same effect on economic activity irrespective of whether this fall 

comes from the term premium or from expectations of future short rates. 

 For the sake of concreteness in what follows, let’s think in terms of a 

hypothetical $500 billion LSAP, conducted entirely by buying longer-term Treasury 

securities; later I will speak to the differences that arise when the program is carried out 

with MBS purchases.  A reasonable estimate based on the literature would be that such a 

program reduces the term premium, and thus the 10-year Treasury yield, by 15 to 

20 basis points.  In my mind, this step is the least controversial piece of the transmission
