and the other regulatory changes I have just described are intended to promote the 

stability of the financial system.  In addition, to address the fragmentation of 

responsibility for financial stability across different agencies, the Fed is part of a new 

interagency body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which helps U.S. regulators 

work together more effectively to better promote the stability of the financial system.   

Enhanced Supervision 

 Along with the additional tools provided by these regulatory changes, the Federal 

Reserve has fortified its supervision of large financial institutions.  We significantly 

enhanced the manner by which we assess whether these firms have sufficient capital and 

liquidity and are meeting new regulatory requirements in this area. We have substantially 

raised our expectations for how well the firms we supervise should be managing their 

risks, maintaining internal controls, and exercising governance.  And we have 

reorganized our supervision of large financial institutions to increase the quality, 

consistency, and range of perspectives brought to bear on supervisory strategy and 

decisionmaking. 

One of the most important enhancements to large bank supervision since the 

financial crisis is our assessment of whether large institutions are holding enough capital 

to deal with stressful financial conditions.  The program includes stress testing and a 

yearly review of how firms are planning their future capital needs.7  The latest results will 

be disclosed in the coming days.   

7 The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review applies to a larger number of institutions than the most 
systemically important firms discussed in these remarks.
