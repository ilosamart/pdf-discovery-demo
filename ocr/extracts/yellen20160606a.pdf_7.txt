The Economic Outlook   

Let me now turn to the outlook for the economy.  GDP growth was reported to 

have been relatively weak early this year, but this measure of growth in economic activity 

can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.  Indeed, while spending data for the second 

quarter are limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle sales point to a 

significant step-up in consumer spending and GDP growth this quarter.6    

Stepping back from near-term indicators, I would like to focus more broadly on 

the factors likely to affect economic performance over the coming years.  Next week, 

concurrent with our policy meeting, the FOMC participants will release a new set of 

economic projections.  Those could, of course, differ from the previous set of such 

projections in March.  But speaking for myself, although the economy recently has been 

affected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good reasons to expect that the positive 

forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the 

negative ones.  As a result, I expect the economic expansion to continue, with the labor 

market improving further and GDP growing moderately.  And as I just noted, I expect to 

see inflation moving up to 2 percent over the next couple of years.   

Let me start with the positive.  The increase in employment over the past several 

years has contributed to higher household incomes and strengthening consumer 

confidence.  If the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown 

resulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth 

should pick up and support further gains in income.  In addition, rising equity and house 

prices have helped restore householdsâ€™ wealth.  The fall in oil prices has supported 

                                                 
6 On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual rate of 16.5 million units in 
March but then rebounded to a pace of 17.3 million units in April and 17.4 million units in May.
