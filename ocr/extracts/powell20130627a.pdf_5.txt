factors point to a gradual increase in inflation. While some measures of longer-term 

inflation expectations have moved down, others remain more stable.  Most FOMC 

participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent 

target over coming years.  Continued low or falling inflation could, however, raise real 

concerns.  Inflation can be too low as well as too high.  I have no doubt that the 

Committee will monitor this carefully and defend the inflation goal “from below,” if 

necessary.    

Dual Mandate—Full Employment 

The employment side of the dual mandate is a different story.  From payroll 

employment’s peak in January 2008 to its trough in February 2010, the U.S. economy 

lost nearly 9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate rose from an average of about 

4-1/2 percent in 2007 to a high of 10 percent in October of 2009.  As the economy has 

recovered, we have regained only about three-fourths of those lost jobs.  Unemployment 

was 7.6 percent in May and so has come down about 2-1/2 percentage points from its 

peak.  A broader measure that includes those who can only find part-time work, as well 

as those who want a job but have stopped looking, was 13.8 percent last month; in 2007, 

this measure averaged 8-1/4 percent.    

In addition, long-term unemployment remains very high--4.4 million Americans 

or about 37 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for six months or more.  

These numbers represent tragedy and hardship for these workers and their families, of 

course, but they also represent a crucial economic challenge.  The longer workers are 

unemployed, the greater the likelihood that their skills will erode and workers will lose
