June 6, 2012                                 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System                                                         2 

Economy is expanding at a moderate pace  
 

• Unemployment has declined over the past 
year.  

• But we remain far short of full employment. 

• Further progress is likely to be gradual due to 
persistent headwinds. 

• I expect inflation at or below 2% for the 
foreseeable future.  

• Risks are tilted toward a weaker economy.
