Costs of Receiving Written Offers 
of Credit or Insurance 

The fourth issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is 
“whether consumers incur significant costs or are otherwise adversely affected by the 
receipt of written offers of credit or insurance.” 

A review of congressional testimony, examination of available studies, discussion with 
interested parties including members of the Federal Reserve Board’s Consumer Advisory 
Council, and a review of public comments submitted on the present study indicate that 
four costs or problem areas for consumers have been identified in regard to prescreened 
offers of credit or insurance: (1) inconvenience, (2) the potential for identity theft, (3) 
privacy implications, and (4) debt burden. 

INCONVENIENCE 

First, but probably least consequential among the four costs or problem areas, is the 
inconvenience for some consumers arising from receiving unwanted prescreened 
solicitations for insurance and credit, especially credit card accounts resulting from 
marketing campaigns relying on prescreening. As noted above, in 2001-02 unsolicited 
mailings to consumers of offers of credit cards reached 4 to 5 billion pieces annually. 
Not at all clear, however, is whether the number of mailings would decline significantly, 
or the need for consumers to dispose of mailings they do not want would diminish (the 
major element of the inconvenience), if prescreening were not available. 

If prescreening were not allowed, credit card companies and other creditors, as well as 
insurance companies, might well switch a greater portion of their marketing effort to 
other sorts of purchased mailing lists that did not involve prescreening. This likely would 
lose many of the efficiencies of prescreened mailings discussed above and employ greater 
amounts of less-efficient post-screening. A reduced ability to target solicitations to 
qualified consumers might well lead to a larger number of mailings and might not be any 
less inconvenient for consumers now concerned about receiving too much “junk mail.” 

Nonetheless, the consumer survey asked some questions to find out a bit more about 
consumers’ overall attitudes toward the availability of prescreened solicitation programs. 
Following questions about voluntarily placing their name on an opt-out list, all 
respondents (whether or not they had credit cards) were asked for their views concerning 
government intervention in this area. The questions focused on whether they believed an
