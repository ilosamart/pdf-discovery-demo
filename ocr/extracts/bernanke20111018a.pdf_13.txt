addressing dysfunctional markets.  The idea that policy is more effective when separate 

tools are dedicated to separate objectives is consistent with the principle known to 

economists as the Tinbergen rule.7 

In practice, the distinction between macroeconomic and financial stability 

objectives will always be blurred to some extent, given the powerful interactions between 

financial and economic conditions.  For example, monetary policy actions that improve 

the economic outlook also tend to improve the conditions of financial firms; likewise, 

actions to support the normal functioning of financial institutions and markets can help 

achieve the central bank’s monetary policy objectives by improving credit flows and 

enhancing monetary policy transmission.  Still, the debate about whether it is possible to 

dedicate specific policy tools to the macroeconomic and financial stability objectives is a 

useful one that raises some important practical questions.  A leading example is the 

question of whether monetary policy should “lean against” movements in asset prices or 

credit aggregates in an effort to promote financial stability.  In my view, the issue is not 

whether central bankers should ignore possible financial imbalances--they should not--

but, rather, what “the right tool for the job” is to respond to such imbalances.8   

 The evolving consensus, which is by no means settled, is that monetary policy is 

too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address possible financial imbalances; instead, 

monetary policy should remain focused on macroeconomic objectives, while more-

some targets may not be met.  See Jan Tinbergen (1952), On the Theory of Economic Policy (Amsterdam:
