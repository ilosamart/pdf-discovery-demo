markets can continue to be supported by conventional investment banks, hedge funds, and other 

financial market participants.  Thus, any supposed impact by the Volcker Rule on overall market 

liquidity or credit spreads is, to me, questionable.   

Moreover, much of this so-called liquidity, especially in opaque over-the-counter 

markets, is potentially illusory and destabilizing, especially during adverse market conditions, 

which does not benefit the public.  Indeed, proprietary trading involves buying and selling purely 

for speculative purposes that have little to do with a true assessment of a financial positionâ€™s 

underlying value.  Price discovery actually is impeded by this hyper-liquidity that is introduced 

by such speculation.  This hyper-liquidity, motivated by nothing more than expectations of short-

term price movements, creates inefficient subsidies to buyers and sellers with no compelling 

public benefit. 

I think that certain markets should feature large credit spreads because they involve truly 

risky products.  Thus, a reduction in proprietary trading may have the effect of increasing 

spreads, but that is actually a public benefit, not a cost, because those wider spreads will more 

accurately reflect the risk involved in those positions.   

Indeed, banks backstopped by government funding are constrained in their ability to 

conduct market making, which only creates market pressure for financial instruments that 

represent proprietary trades to move to established exchanges where transparency is enhanced 

and exposure to counterparty default risk is greatly reduced. 

All of this is to say that liquidity is not an inherent public benefit that justifies the 

expenditure of significant compliance, oversight, examination, and enforcement costs.  In other 

words, certain capital market activities for federally insured banks should not be supported by 

vast amounts of public and private expenditure.
