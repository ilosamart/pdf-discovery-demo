(CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are responsible for 

establishing the regulatory regime for and supervising CCPs as well as determining 

which swaps must be centrally cleared.  The Federal Reserve and six other agencies are 

responsible for establishing margin requirements for derivatives that are not cleared 

through a CCP. 1  The Federal Reserve shares with the other members of the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) an interest in CCP regulation and central clearing 

from a broader financial stability perspective.  The Fed also plays a role in supervising 

financial market utilities that are designated as systemically important under Title VIII of 

the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank).       

The financial crisis involved significant failures in the functioning, regulation, and 

supervision of OTC derivatives markets.  These failures were well illustrated by the 

widespread and destabilizing effects of large losses by American International Group 

(AIG) on its OTC structured finance and credit derivative positions.  In the absence of 

government intervention, AIG’s failure would have exposed its counterparties to 

significant losses at a time of widespread financial stress.  Further, the lack of 

transparency in OTC derivatives markets at that time led to a wave of uncertainty about 

who was exposed to AIG and the extent of that exposure.  This fundamental lack of 

information fueled concerns about potential losses and drove a cycle of escalating 

pressure on large financial institutions around the globe.  Government intervention was 

deemed necessary to stop this cycle and contain the threat to the financial system.  AIG’s 

failure revealed systemic problems in the OTC derivatives market that went well beyond 

the failure of a single market participant.
