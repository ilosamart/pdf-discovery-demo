country to better understand current challenges facing your communities, your companies, and 

your industry.  My goal is to bring back the knowledge I gain from these discussions to inform 

and improve our work to support both the financial sector engaged in agricultural lending and our 

mission as the central bank of the United States.    

I hope that conferences like this will help generate a richer discussion about the 

challenges and unique advantages in rural America so we can develop more creative, effective 

and direct policy responses.  A deeper debate that, for example, distinguishes between low-

density and higher-density rural areas, between rural communities that are relatively isolated and 

those that are connected and close to thriving cities, will help us develop more durable solutions.   

Before I close, I want to thank you again, as well as the many people at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Kansas City and from the Federal Reserve Board who helped organize this 

yearâ€™s conference. Thanks to all of you for your work to ensure continued success for American 

agriculture.
