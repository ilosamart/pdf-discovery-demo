possible use of the interest rate for this purpose, particularly when other tools appear to 

be lacking.   

Lesson T3:  Active fiscal policy.8  There is a great deal of evidence that fiscal policy 

works well, almost everywhere, perhaps especially well when the interest rate is at its 

effective lower bound.  Because the lags with which fiscal policy affects the economy 

may be relatively long (particularly the “decision lag”, the lag between a situation 

developing in which fiscal policy should become more expansionary and the decision to 

undertake such a policy), automatic stabilizers can play an important stabilizing role. 

Another important fiscal policy discussion is currently taking place in the United 

States.  Infrastructure in the United States has been deteriorating, and government 

borrowing costs are exceptionally low.  Many economists argue that this is a time at 

which fiscal policy can be made more expansionary at low real cost, by borrowing to 

finance a program to strengthen the physical infrastructure of the American economy.  

This would mean a temporary increase in the budget deficit while the spending takes 

place.  That spending would have positive benefits – both an increase in aggregate 

demand as the infrastructure is built, and later an increase in aggregate supply as the 

positive impact of the increase in the capital stock due to the investment in infrastructure 

comes into effect – that under current circumstances would outweigh the costs of its 

financing.   

More generally, the case for more expansionary fiscal policy has always to take into 

account the consequences of greater debt on future interest rates and on the flexibility of 

future fiscal policy.  In this regard, government intervention to save banks has in some
