many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the 

crisis.  In addition, policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some point to 

consider additional options to secure a strong and resilient economy.  But before I turn to

the U.S. economy and the potential implications for monetary policy. 

Current Economic Situation and Outlook   

U.S. economic activity continues to expand, led by solid growth in household 

spending.  But business investment remains soft and subdued foreign demand and the 

appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 continue to restrain exports.  While economic 

growth has not been rapid, it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the 

labor market.  Smoothing through the monthly ups and downs, job gains averaged 

190,000 per month over the past three months.  Although the unemployment rate has 

remained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization 

have improved.  Inflation has continued to run below the FOMCâ€™s objective of 2 percent, 

reflecting in part the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices. 

Looking ahead, the FOMC expects moderate growth in real gross domestic 

product (GDP), additional strengthening in the labor market, and inflation rising to 

2 percent over the next few years.  Based on this economic outlook, the FOMC continues 

to anticipate that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time 

to achieve and sustain employment and inflation near our statutory objectives.  Indeed, in 

light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for 

economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate
