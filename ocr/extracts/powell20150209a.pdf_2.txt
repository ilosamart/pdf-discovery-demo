It is a pleasure and a particularly personal honor for me to speak to you today as a 

guest of this institution.1   

I am proud to say that my grandfather, James J. Hayden, earned his doctorate of 

law from Catholic University and later served as dean of the law school.  He was an early 

scholar of the regulation prompted by a technological innovation that would change the 

world--aviation.  He was, in that sense, someone who looked to the future and wanted to 

be a part of it.  In his years leading the law school, I hope my grandfather could also 

glimpse the great institution that it would become.  

It has been a little more than six years since the fall of 2008, when the peak of a 

severe financial crisis presented the very real threat of a second Great Depression.  The 

damage was extensive, and for some time, the recovery was frustratingly slow.  But the 

economy has improved considerably over the past two years, and I am optimistic that that 

this improvement will continue.  The financial system is also stronger and more resilient 

after improvements in regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve and other agencies 

and better management by banks and other financial firms.   

The Fed acted boldly during and after the financial crisis in the face of great 

uncertainty. The full effects of these policies will become clearer with the passage of 

time.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve’s role in the Great Depression of the 1930s is still 

actively debated.  That said, as I will show, the evidence as of today is very strong that 

the Fed’s actions generally succeeded and are a major reason why the U.S. economy is 

now outperforming those of other advanced nations.  Other central banks are now 

embracing some of the same bold steps undertaken much earlier by the Fed.
