efficiency gains.  The decline in TFP growth has been widespread across advanced 

economies, suggesting that global trends are at play.8 

There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity growth.9  Some 

argue that the important paradigm-changing innovations are behind us, while others think 

that this slowdown is only a passing phase.  One thing on which all agree is that the 

future prospects for productivity growth and potential GDP are highly uncertain.  I hope 

there is also broad agreement on the need for policies that maximize potential growth and 

spread prosperity as widely as possible.  We need policies that encourage labor force 

participation and investment in education and training, in infrastructure, and in 

businesses. These policies are, of course, mostly outside the authority of the Federal 

Reserve. 

Low interest rates 

Another unanticipated feature of this recovery has been the low level of both 

short- and longer-term interest rates.  At 2.4 percent, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is 

far below levels typically seen before the financial crisis (figure 5).  Of course, Fed 

                                                 
8 There may also be a role for homegrown factors, such as the decrease in business dynamism.  See Jerome 
H. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic Developments, Monetary Policy Considerations, and Longer-Term 
Prospects,” speech delivered at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, June 28, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160628a.htm.  The worldwide nature of the 
slowdown is documented in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2016), “New 
OECD Indicators Trace Productivity Growth Slowdown Pre- and Post-Crisis,” webpage, OECD, 
http://www.oecd.org/economy/newoecdindicatorstraceproductivitygrowthslowdownpre-andpost-crisis.htm.  
For a discussion of the effects of dynamism on productivity, see Lucia Foster, John Haltiwanger, and C.J. 
Krizan (2001), “Aggregate Productivity Growth:  Lessons from Microeconomic Evidence,” in Charles R. 
Hulten, Edwin R. Dean, and Michael J. Harper, eds., New Developments in Productivity Analysis  
(Chicago:  University of Chicago Press). 
9 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of 
American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University 
Press).  Among the optimists are Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age:  
Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York:  W.W. Norton & 
Company).
