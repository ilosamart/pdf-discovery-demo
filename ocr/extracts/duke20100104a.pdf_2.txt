I am very pleased to be here today to discuss the economic outlook.  The opening 

of a new year is traditionally an opportunity to take stock of where we have been and 

where we are headed.  This year, such an assessment is particularly appropriate because, 

as we enter 2010, the U.S. economy has begun to emerge from the prolonged period of 

economic turmoil that began about two years ago. 

After a year and a half of decline, real GDP turned up in the third quarter of 2009. 

Recent data on production and spending suggest that economic activity continued to 

increase at a solid rate during the final months of last year.  I expect to see a continued 

moderate recovery in economic activity in 2010, supported by a further healing in 

financial markets and accommodative monetary policy.  The decisive actions taken by 

policymakers beginning in the fall of 2008 were instrumental in stabilizing financial 

markets and laying the groundwork for this recovery.

appears to be easing, any realistic assessment of the economic outlook must take into 

account prospects for conditions in credit markets, which will be a critical element 

shaping the recovery.  Thus, I plan to discuss how I see these developments influencing 

the economy over the coming year.  Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the views 

that I will be presenting are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

The November labor market report showed the smallest loss in payroll jobs since early 

2008, and in recent weeks the number of new claims for unemployment insurance has
