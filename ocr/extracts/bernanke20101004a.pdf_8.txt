interest on the debt would slow potential growth by reducing incentives to work, save, 

hire, and invest.  Finally, a large federal debt decreases the flexibility of policymakers to 

temporarily increase spending as needed to address future emergencies, such as 

recessions, wars, or natural disasters.  

It would be difficult to identify a specific threshold at which federal debt begins to 

pose more substantial costs and risks to the nationâ€™s economy.  Perhaps no bright line 

exists; the costs and risks may grow more or less continuously as the federal debt rises.  

What we do know, however, is that the threat to our economy is real and growing, which 

should be sufficient reason for fiscal policymakers to put in place a credible plan for 

bringing deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium term.  The sooner a plan is 

established, the longer affected individuals will have to prepare for the necessary 

changes.  Indeed, in the past, long lead times have helped make necessary adjustments 

less painful and thus politically feasible.  For example, the gradual step-up in the full 

retirement age for Social Security was enacted in 1983, but it did not begin to take effect 

until 2003 and will not be completed until 2027, thus giving future retirees ample time to 

adjust their plans for work, saving, and retirement.  

Fiscal Rules 

 Amid all of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic and budgetary 

outlook, one certainty is that both current and future Congresses and Presidents will have 

to make some very tough decisions to put the budget back on a sustainable trajectory. 

 Can these tough decisions be made easier for our elected leaders?  At various 

times, some U.S. Congresses and foreign governments have adopted fiscal rules to help 

structure the budget process.  Fiscal rules are legislative agreements intended to promote
