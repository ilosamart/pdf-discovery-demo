Size of Dollar’s Appreciation and Its Causes   

As seen in figure 1, the roughly 15 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar 

since July 2014 is large, though not unprecedented by historical standards.3  Two related 

factors appear to have played key roles in the dollar’s rise.  First, while the U.S. economy 

has performed relatively well--as is visible especially in our steady progress toward full 

employment--major foreign economies have generally experienced weak growth, along 

with persistently low inflation.  Because foreign central banks responded appropriately by 

providing additional monetary accommodation, foreign interest rates have declined 

relative to U.S. interest rates, encouraging investors to shift into dollar-denominated 

assets and in turn boosting the dollar.  But widening interest rate differentials can explain 

only part of the dollar’s large ascent.  A second factor has been heightened concern about 

the global outlook and an associated decrease in investor risk tolerance--factors that tend 

to increase investment in dollar assets.  In recent months, investors have been particularly 

focused on the possibility of a sharp slowdown in China and other emerging market 

economies, with commodity exporters seen as particularly vulnerable in the wake of the 

dramatic drop in oil and non-oil commodity prices since the summer of 2014.     

Effects of a Stronger Dollar on U.S. Activity and Inflation  

In considering the transmission of changes in the dollar’s value to U.S. output and 

inflation, it will be convenient for illustrative purposes to focus on the effects of a 10 

percent appreciation that is assumed to be permanent--and then to draw on this analysis to 

provide some guidance on how the dollar’s rise since mid-2014 has played out.  

                                                   
3 The broad dollar is a weighted average of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against the 
currencies of a broad group of major U.S. trading partners.  More information on the construction of the 
index can be found in Loretan (2005).
