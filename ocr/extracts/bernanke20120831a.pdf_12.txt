part from the same deterioration of the economic outlook that led the FOMC to introduce 

and then extend its forward guidance.  But the private sector’s revised outlook for the 

policy rate also appears to reflect a growing appreciation of how forceful the FOMC 

intends to be in supporting a sustainable recovery.  For example, since 2009, forecasters 

participating in the Blue Chip survey have repeatedly marked down their projections of 

the unemployment rate they expect to prevail at the time that the FOMC begins to lift the 

target for the federal funds rate away from zero.  Thus, the Committee’s forward 

guidance may have conveyed a greater willingness to maintain accommodation than 

private forecasters had previously believed.25  The behavior of financial market prices in 

periods around changes in the forward guidance is also consistent with the view that the 

guidance has affected policy expectations.26 

Making Policy with Nontraditional Tools:  A Cost-Benefit Framework  

Making monetary policy with nontraditional tools is challenging.  In particular, 

our experience with these tools remains limited.  In this context, the FOMC carefully 

compares the expected benefits and costs of proposed policy actions. 

The potential benefit of policy action, of course, is the possibility of better 

economic outcomes--outcomes more consistent with the FOMC’s dual mandate.  In light 

                                                            
25 In October 2009, private forecasters in the Blue Chip survey projected that the unemployment rate would 
be near 10 percent and overall inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) would be 2 percent 
at the time that short-term interest rates (three-month Treasury bill rates) rose above 50 basis points.  By 
March 2011, forecasters had lowered the projected unemployment rate at the policy liftoff date to about 
8-1/2 percent, again accompanied by inflation near 2 percent.  And by March 2012, forecasters projected 
that the unemployment rate would have fallen below 7-1/2 percent, and that CPI inflation would be moving 
up to close to 2-1/2 percent, before short-term interest rates would rise appreciably above the current target 
range. 
26 For example, Board staff members have performed event studies of the movement in Eurodollar futures 
prices and other financial variables immediately following the release of the August 2011 and January 2012 
FOMC statements.  In both cases, the provision of specific guidance about the likely date of liftoff was 
associated with a noticeable flattening of the expected path of the federal funds rate.  For a formal analysis 
of the effectiveness of the FOMC’s forward guidance, see Swanson and Williams (2012).
