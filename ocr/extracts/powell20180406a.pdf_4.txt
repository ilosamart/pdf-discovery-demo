A good place to begin is with the term “maximum employment,” which the 

Committee takes to mean the highest utilization of labor resources that is sustainable over 

time.  In the long run, the level of maximum employment is not determined by monetary 

policy, but rather by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market.1  

Also, the level of maximum employment is not directly measureable, and it changes over 

time.  Real-time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2  Recognizing 

this uncertainty, the FOMC does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment.  Instead, 

we look at a wide range of indicators to assess how close the economy is to maximum 

employment.   

The headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor 

market conditions.  In addition, it is widely known and updated each month.  As I noted, 

the unemployment rate is currently at 4.1 percent, which is a bit below the FOMC’s 

median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  However, the 

unemployment rate does not paint a complete picture.  For example, to be counted in the 

official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past 

four weeks.3  People who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as 

unemployed, but as out of the labor force, even though some of them actually want a job

2 This fundamental uncertainty has been extensively studied, particularly with respect to the most 
commonly used measure of full employment--the so-called natural rate of unemployment.  The authors of 
one well-regarded study concluded that even when using sophisticated statistical techniques, the natural 
rate of unemployment could be as much as 1-1/2 percentage points above or below their point estimate.

Natural Rate of Unemployment?” chapter 5 in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing

not they are actively looking for work.
