A disadvantage of this calendar-based approach was that it might not be clear 

whether changes in the date reflect changes in the FOMC’s outlook for growth, for 

inflation, or a shift in the desired stance of policy.  In December 2012, the FOMC 

therefore replaced the date with greater detail on the economic conditions that would 

warrant maintaining the federal funds rate at its present, exceptionally low level.  

Specifically, it stated that near-zero rates would likely remain appropriate for a 

considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and “at least as long as the 

unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years 

ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 

2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well 

anchored.”17  

It deserves emphasis that a 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate and inflation one to 

two years ahead that is 1/2 percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent objective 

are thresholds for possible action, not triggers that will necessarily prompt an immediate 

increase in the FOMC’s target rate.  In practical terms, it means that the Committee does 

not expect to raise the federal funds rate as long as unemployment remains above 

6-1/2 percent and inflation one to two years ahead is projected to be less than 

1/2 percentage point above its 2 percent objective.  When one of these thresholds is 

crossed, action is possible but not assured.        

Moreover, these thresholds for possible action do not reflect any change in the 

Committee’s longer-run goals.  With respect to maximum employment, most FOMC
