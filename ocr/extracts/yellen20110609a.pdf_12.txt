 The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with other financial banking regulators and 

government agencies, has embarked on initiatives to help resolve the existing stock of 

vacant properties and prevent even more properties from entering foreclosure.14  The first 

initiative involves revisions to the rules governing the Community Reinvestment Act 

(CRA) that took effect in January.  Under the revised rules, depository institutions 

receive positive consideration in CRA examinations for participating in community 

stabilization activities in areas designated as eligible for funds under the Neighborhood 

Stabilization Program authorized by the Congress.  Such activities might include 

donating properties that they’ve taken possession of--known as real estate owned--to 

nonprofit housing organizations or providing financing for the purchase and rehabilitation 

of foreclosed, abandoned, or vacant properties.  Although it is too early to assess the 

effect of these CRA changes, the participation of more than 600 banks and industry 

stakeholders in a webinar recently hosted by the Federal Reserve indicates that there is 

interest and potential in this tool.  Our host today, the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Cleveland, played a key role in envisioning these changes to the CRA rules.

the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.  The other financial bank regulators and government agencies for the national servicing 
standards are the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Administration, the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, and the Department of the Treasury.
