Compliance
Introduction
Effective Date July 1997 Section 5000.1

Head office management should develop adequate
policies and procedures to ensure that the branch
is in compliance with all applicable U.S. federal
and state laws and regulations, including report-
ing and special supervisory requirements.

To the extent possible given the size, risk
profile and organizational structure of the branch,
these responsibilities should be vested in a
branch official or compliance officer whose
function is separate from line management. The
compliance officer should be qualified and
familiar with U.S. and state laws and regulations.

Branch management and the compliance offi-
cer should ensure that all appropriate personnel

are properly trained in meeting regulatory
requirements on an ongoing basis. In addition,
the training program should ensure that branch
personnel are informed of U.S. and state laws
and regulations to which the branch may be
subject.

The scope of the branchâ€™s audit function also
should ensure that the branch is meeting all
applicable regulatory requirements. The head
office should ensure that the audit team is
qualified to audit its U.S. branch operations for
compliance with U.S. and state laws, regula-
tions, and regulatory reporting requirements.
