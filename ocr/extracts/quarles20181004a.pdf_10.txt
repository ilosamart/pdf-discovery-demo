2008 suggests that community banks have been able to compete quite successfully with 

larger banks in both urban and rural markets during and since the recent recession. 

Head Offices 

As I have mentioned, the average numbers of banks and bank branches have 

increased or remained constant in rural markets in recent years despite a wave of mergers 

that has greatly reduced the number of U.S. banking organizations.  Industry 

consolidation has led to fewer banks but maintained most of the branches of the acquired 

banks.  In addition, most mergers and acquisitions have involved expansion into new 

markets by the acquiring bank rather than acquisitions of local competitors, which has 

allowed local communities to continue to enjoy a variety of potential providers of 

banking services despite the industry consolidation.8 

One unavoidable aspect of consolidation is a loss in the number of bank 

headquarters offices.  The number of bank headquarters located in urban markets has 

fallen by half over the past 20 years, while the number in rural markets has fallen by 

45 percent.9  Consolidation has led to a doubling in the number of banking markets--

almost all of which are rural--in which no banks are headquartered (figure 16).  We hear 

anecdotally that banks are more attuned to the needs of the communities in which they 

are headquartered, so the significance of this loss could have an effect on the local 

markets.  

                                                 
8 One way that economists measure the structure of a market is by measures of market concentration.  Not 
surprisingly, rural markets are, on average, much more concentrated than urban markets.  However, 
average concentration levels have been declining in rural markets while increasing slightly in urban 
markets over the past two decades. 
9 The average urban market has more headquarters offices than the average rural market (figure 15).  There 
are just over 8 banks headquartered in the average urban market (down from just over 14 in 1997), 
compared with an average of 1.3 banks headquartered in the average rural market (down from 2.4 in 1997).
