  Reaching agreement on a cross-border resolution process will be challenging.  

Our financial services industries and our economies differ in many ways.   But we have a 

shared interest in financial stability, in reducing moral hazard, and in protecting 

taxpayers.  

 On that note, I will briefly discuss the Fed’s proposal for oversight of foreign 

banks operating in the United States, which carries out a mandate from the Congress 

under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 2  Our proposal 

represents a targeted set of adjustments aimed at reducing the risks posed by the U.S. 

operations of large foreign banks to U.S. financial stability that were revealed during, and 

in the aftermath of, the recent financial crisis.  The proposal is not intended to create a 

disadvantage for foreign banks in the U.S. market.   Rather, the proposal is part of a 

larger set of regulatory reforms that substantially raises standards for all banking 

organizations operating in the United States and aims to achieve the goals we share with 

Germany: vigorous and fair competition and a stable financial system.  Indeed, in some 

sense it follows the lead of the European Union and its member states in ensuring that all 

large subsidiaries of globally active banks meet Basel capital rules.  We believe that our 

foreign bank proposal, which would increase the strength and resiliency of the U.S. 

operations of these firms, would meaningfully reduce the likelihood of disruptive ring-

fencing at the moment of crisis that could undermine an SPOE resolution of a large 

foreign bank.  We are fully committed to the international efforts to address cross-border
