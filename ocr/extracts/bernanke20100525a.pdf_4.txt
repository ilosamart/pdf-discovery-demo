In contrast, policymakers in a central bank subject to short-term political 

influence may face pressures to overstimulate the economy to achieve short-term output 

and employment gains that exceed the economy’s underlying potential.  Such gains may 

be popular at first, and thus helpful in an election campaign, but they are not sustainable 

and soon evaporate, leaving behind only inflationary pressures that worsen the 

economy’s longer-term prospects.  Thus, political interference in monetary policy can 

generate undesirable boom-bust cycles that ultimately lead to both a less stable economy 

and higher inflation.  

Undue political influence on monetary policy decisions can also impair the 

inflation-fighting credibility of the central bank, resulting in higher average inflation and, 

consequently, a less-productive economy.  Central banks regularly commit to maintain 

low inflation in the longer term; if such a promise is viewed as credible by the public, 

then it will tend to be self-fulfilling, as inflation expectations will be low and households 

and firms will temper their demands for higher wages and prices.  However, a central 

bank subject to short-term political influences would likely not be credible when it 

promised low inflation, as the public would recognize the risk that monetary 

policymakers could be pressured to pursue short-run expansionary policies that would be 

inconsistent with long-run price stability.  When the central bank is not credible, the 

public will expect high inflation and, accordingly, demand more-rapid increases in 

nominal wages and in prices.  Thus, lack of independence of the central bank can lead to
