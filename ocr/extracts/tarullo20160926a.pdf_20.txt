account, this element captures a key amplification channel evident during the last financial crisis.  

As the banking system experienced capital losses, the cost of funding increased and some 

wholesale funding markets shut down even for relatively healthy banks.  The potential for this 

kind of funding shock means that the presence of a poorly capitalized bank might increase 

funding costs for all banks--a classic kind of macroprudential concern. 

Liquidity shocks and fire sale dynamics 

As we saw during the last financial crisis, repo and other funding markets can simply 

close to distressed institutions, which are then unable to access certain kinds of funds at any 

price.  Such a firm may then be forced to make up the funding shortfall by turning to market 

sources of liquidity by selling assets--both high-quality liquid assets like Treasury securities and 

less liquid assets.  During the financial crisis, distressed firms sold large amounts of securities as 

quickly as possible.  The fire sale price discounts required for such rapid execution in turn 

imposed mark-to-market losses on other firms with similar holdings.  To understand better this 

channel of financial contagion, we intend to continue our work on the ability of markets to 

handle large quantities of asset sales under stress, the capacity and willingness of firms to tap 

their buffers of high-quality assets, and the susceptibility of bank capital to mark-to-market 

losses from fire sales.  

Many commentators have drawn attention to these concerns, and some have advocated an 

integrated approach to capital and liquidity stress testing.  We may or may not be able to achieve 

this end point.  At a minimum, though, research in this area will allow us to move in this 

direction, perhaps by using the conclusions reached in the annual stress test as a starting point for 

our annual Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR), or vice versa.  The results 

could also shed light on the current calibration of our liquidity rules.
