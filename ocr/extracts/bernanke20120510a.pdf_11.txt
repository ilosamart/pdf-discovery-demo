This analysis suggests that the tightening of lending standards that occurred between 

2007 and 2009 was much greater than a model based on historical experience would 

predict, contributing to the subdued pace of lending.  These results are consistent with 

other evidence that the crisis induced exceptionally high levels of risk aversion and 

uncertainty on the part of both lenders and borrowers, constraining the flow of credit.  As 

these factors have receded and the economy has improved, lending standards have 

become less stringent.  

Some bankers and borrowers believe that enhanced supervision and regulation has 

made it more difficult for banks to expand their lending.  The Federal Reserve takes 

seriously its responsibility to ensure that supervisory actions to protect banks’ safety and 

soundness do not unintentionally constrain lending to creditworthy borrowers, and we 

have taken a variety of steps to address these concerns.  For example, we have issued 

guidance to supervisors stressing the importance of taking a balanced approach to 

supervision and of promptly upgrading a bank’s supervisory rating when warranted by a 

sustainable improvement in its condition and risk management.  Some analysis has 

indicated that, all else being equal, banks with lower supervisory ratings tend to lend less; 

prompt upgrades by supervisors when such upgrades are appropriate may thus ease an 

unnecessary constraint on lending.  Indeed, in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first 

quarter of this year, the number of ratings upgrades for banks and bank holding
