influence short-term market interest rates, and the federal funds rate gradually emerged as 

the preferred operating target.  Low and stable inflation was achieved for most of the 

1950s and the early 1960s.  However, beginning in the mid-1960s, inflation began a long 

climb upward, partly because policymakers proved to be too optimistic about the 

economy’s ability to sustain rapid growth without inflation.

Two mechanisms might have mitigated the damage from that mistaken optimism.  

First, a stronger policy response to inflation--more like that observed in the 1950s--

certainly would have helped.
24

  Second, Fed policymakers could have reacted to 

continued high readings on inflation by adopting a more realistic assessment of the 

economy’s productive potential.
25

  Instead, policymakers chose to emphasize so-called 

cost-push and structural factors as sources of inflation and saw wage- and price-setting as 

having become insensitive to economic slack.
26

  This perspective, which contrasted 

sharply with Milton Friedman’s famous dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere 

a monetary phenomenon,” led to Fed support for measures such as wage and price 

controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation.
27

  A further obstacle was the 

view among many economists that the gains from low inflation did not justify the costs of 

achieving it.

The consequence of the monetary framework of the 1970s was two bouts of 

double-digit inflation.  Moreover, by the end of the decade, lack of commitment to

 Estimates of the response of the federal funds rate to inflation for the 1970s generally show only a weak 

reaction.  See Judd and Rudebusch (1998); Taylor (1999a); and Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000).  For the 

quotation, see Friedman (1963, p.17).

inflation.
