if the economy performs broadly in line with the Committee’s expectations--which is to 

say, pretty well.   

Many factors may have contributed to this market reaction.  Among them, I 

would argue that market expectations began to lose touch with Committee intentions in 

two ways.  First, while the Committee sees policy as data dependent, markets seem to fix 

on dates.  The decision to reduce purchases now or to hold off for a meeting or two does 

not carry great macroeconomic significance.  But, to a fixed-income trader, the timing of 

the decision is everything.  It appears that many market participants concluded after the 

June press conference that the Committee was eager to reduce purchases and committed 

to doing so at the September meeting, independent of incoming data.   

Second, the expected path of the federal funds rate, as reflected in various market 

prices, increased significantly, implying an earlier liftoff from the zero lower bound than 

suggested by the Committee’s forward guidance.6  Many FOMC members had said 

publicly that the decision to reduce purchases did not reflect any change in the 

Committee’s plans for holding the federal funds rate at its current level.  

The September decision not to reduce purchases clearly took some market 

participants by surprise.  For me, the decision was a close call, and I would have been 

comfortable with a small reduction in purchases.  However, as the minutes of the 

September FOMC meeting reflect, there were legitimate concerns about the strength of 

incoming economic data, the economic effects of tighter financial conditions and of 

                                                 
6 Decomposing federal funds futures into components representing the true expected path of the federal 
funds rate and term premiums is difficult.  Staff models suggest that a portion of the upward revision in the 
federal funds futures curve over this period was associated with a pulling forward in the expected date of 
liftoff in the federal funds rate.
