shipments of capital equipment suggest that solid growth will likely continue in the 

second half of the year.  In addition, oil drilling had rebounded this year after dropping 

sharply last year, although Hurricane Harvey creates uncertainty about drilling in coming 

months.  While lackluster consumer spending was one of the key reasons for the weak 

increase in first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), growth in personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) bounced back strongly in the second quarter, and recent readings on 

retail sales suggest another solid increase in consumer spending this quarter. 

Of course, the likely economic effects of Hurricane Harvey raise uncertainties 

about the economic outlook for the remainder of the year.  Based on past experience, it 

appears likely that the hurricane will have a notable effect on GDP in the current quarter, 

although output is likely to rebound by the end of the year.  According to the U.S. 

Department of Energy, between 20 and 30 percent of the nation’s oil refining capacity 

was shut down at the peak last week, and it is estimated that about 50 percent of 

petrochemical production was similarly shut down.  Some oil production has also been 

disrupted.  These developments have put upward pressure on gasoline prices.  Based on 

previous hurricane events, the increase in gasoline prices should be short lived, but this 

outcome is uncertain and will depend on the extent of damage to refining capacity.   

Improvements in the labor market have continued.  According to last Friday’s 

labor market report, nonfarm payrolls have increased around 185,000 per month over the 

three months through August, about the same as the average monthly gains last year.  The 

unemployment rate has been roughly flat for the past several months at 4.4 percent, 

which is 1/2 percentage point lower than at the same time last year.  The employment-to-
