Good afternoon.  I appreciate this opportunity to speak with you today. 

I’m not sure when you last found yourself in a planetarium.  At the start of my 

most recent visit, I was handed a brochure that said “Sit anywhere.  All seats provide 

equal viewing of the universe.”  I took the brochure but instead of contemplating the 

stars, I contemplated my job as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board.  And it 

occurred to me that the brochure was wrong.  Completely wrong.  All seats do not 

provide equal viewing of the universe.  Some seats are better than others.  It’s not just 

that the Big Dipper is clearer than Ursa Minor from certain seats.  If you want, for 

example, to see the economy, you don’t necessarily want to always be sitting in 

Washington.  That is not a seat that tells you everything you need to know about the 

economy.  You have to break out, set free, and hightail it out of the Beltway to Los 

Angeles.  It’s critical to appropriate policymaking that we get a multidimensional view of 

the so-called economic universe.   

From that perspective, it is an understatement to say that these are profoundly 

challenging times for millions of Americans.  Many families have suffered significant 

declines in their net worth over the past several years, especially as the value of their 

homes and other assets has plummeted.  Many households have faced job losses or large 

reductions in the number of hours worked, events that have reduced family income and 

well-being.  While I’m not happy to bear witness to households trying to navigate these 

difficulties, we would be poor policymakers if we consistently avoided the seats that give 

us this view.   

In short, I’m very pleased to be here, but I’m here on a mission.  It’s a quest to 

understand what the seat from Los Angeles tells us about the economy, and more
