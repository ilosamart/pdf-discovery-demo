borrowing is not reported as small business lending.  But there is also no definition of small 

business borrowers for the reporting of small business lending as a loan category.  

 However, small loans to businesses--commercial and industrial loans and CRE loans with 

original principal amounts of less than $1 million--are reported separately and can be used as a 

proxy for small business lending.  Using this measure, we can estimate the importance of small 

business lending to community banks and the importance of community banks to small 

businesses.  As of September 2012, banks with $10 billion or less in assets accounted for more 

than 98 percent of all commercial banking institutions, but they held less than 20 percent of 

banking industry assets.  However, they held more than half of outstanding small loans to 

businesses.  For such institutions, these small loans to businesses represent nearly 20 percent of 

their total domestic lending and slightly more than 40 percent of their total commercial lending.  

Small business lending is likely even more important to smaller banks than these statistics show 

because these loans are identified by the size of the loan rather than the size of the borrower.  I 

believe it is probable that many of the larger business loans made by these smaller banks were 

also made to small business borrowers.  

At the other end of the spectrum, banking organizations with more than $50 billion in 

assets accounted for less than one percent of institutions, but held 75 percent of the assets.  

Holding almost 40 percent of outstanding small loans to businesses, these large banks are 

important small business lenders, but small loans to businesses were not a significant segment of 

large bank loan portfolios.  They represented less than five percent of these banks’ total domestic 

lending.
