For example, the Board has made it clear that capital stress tests and other aspects 

of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review requirements do not apply to 

community banks, either explicitly or implicitly.  In addition to Board members making 

this point in public speeches and in meetings with bankers, the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

examiner training emphasizes that these requirements, which were established under the 

Dodd-Frank Act, will apply only to large banking organizations.  

The Fed also made changes in 2014 to better tailor our program of consumer 

compliance supervision of smaller institutions.  Under the new approach, the intensity of 

bank examinations is based on our assessment of the risk profile of individual community 

banks, including how each identifies and manages consumer compliance risk.  Risk 

assessment begins before examiners arrive at the bank, allowing examiners to focus on 

higher-risk concerns at the banks they supervise.  We have also directed examiners to 

spend less time on those areas of consumer compliance where problems are uncommon, 

although we are ready to ramp up that scrutiny if we have concerns about practices at a 

particular institution.   

Since making these changes 16 months ago, the average length of time for 

examinations has dropped, and the feedback we have heard from you is mostly positive.  

Bankers have told us that the examiners seem to have a better grasp of the key issues and 

that exams are, as we intended, more closely tailored to the business characteristics and 

risk profile of individual institutions.  Examiners also tell us they sometimes see increased 

consumer compliance risk at community banks that are expanding beyond their traditional 

product offerings, often using outside vendors to introduce new products such as prepaid 

cards or credit card add-ons.  These products are often complex, and community banks
