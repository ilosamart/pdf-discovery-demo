Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency securities at the end of the first quarter of this year 

seems to have had only negligible effects on longer-term rates and spreads. 

The Federal Reserve did not hold the size of its securities portfolio precisely 

constant after it ended its agency purchase program earlier this year.  Instead, consistent 

with the Committee’s goal of ultimately returning the portfolio to one consisting 

primarily of Treasury securities, we adopted a policy of re-investing maturing Treasuries 

in similar securities while allowing agency securities to run off as payments of principal 

were received.  To date, we have realized about $140 billion of repayments of principal 

on our holdings of agency debt and MBS, most of it prior to the end of the purchase 

program.  Continued repayments at this pace, together with the policy of not re-investing 

the proceeds, were expected to lead to a slight reduction in policy accommodation over 

time.  

However, more recently, as the pace of economic growth has slowed somewhat, 

longer-term interest rates have fallen and mortgage refinancing activity has picked up.  

Increased refinancing has in turn led the Fed’s holding of agency MBS to run off more 

quickly than previously anticipated.  Although mortgage prepayment rates are difficult to 

predict, under the assumption that mortgage rates remain near current levels, we 

estimated that an additional $400 billion or so of MBS and agency debt currently in the 

Fed’s portfolio could be repaid by the end of 2011. 

At their most recent meeting, FOMC participants observed that allowing the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to shrink in this way at a time when the outlook had 

weakened somewhat was inconsistent with the Committee’s intention to provide the 

monetary accommodation necessary to support the recovery.  Moreover, a bad dynamic
