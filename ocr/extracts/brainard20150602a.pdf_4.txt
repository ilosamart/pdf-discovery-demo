Continuing softness in consumption this year would naturally raise some 

questions about a more persistent change in consumer behavior.  For example, the 

financial crisis may have altered expectations of longer-run income growth and attitudes 

toward risk such that consumers may be more cautious about spending gains in income 

and wealth that are perceived to be temporary.     

Modest growth in consumer spending would be significant because strength in 

other categories of aggregate demand remains elusive.  Although the data on April 

housing starts and permits look promising, the current level of single-family housing 

permits is little changed from the level in the fourth quarter of last year, and average 

growth in residential investment over the past year and a half has been tepid.  Given low 

interest rates and continued job gains, it is puzzling that housing starts have remained far 

below the trend levels implied by population growth.  Tight credit for borrowers with 

less-than-pristine credit may explain some of the weakness.  But it is also possible that 

attitudes toward homeownership have changed as a result of the financial crisis and 

recent recession, especially among the millennial Great Recession generation. 

Meanwhile, government spending has contributed very little, on average, to GDP 

growth in recent quarters.  With the Budget Control Act of 2011 restraining federal 

outlays and with pension and health-care obligations limiting expenditures at the state 

and local level, the public sector is not likely to contribute significantly to GDP growth 

over the next few years. 

Just as the positive effects appear to have been more muted than expected, so, too, 

the negative effects from the substantial decline in the price of oil and appreciation of the 

exchange rate on business investment, manufacturing, and exports seem to have been
