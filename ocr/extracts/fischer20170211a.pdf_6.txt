used of the models the Board staff has at its disposal.8  FRB/US is an estimated, large-

scale, general-equilibrium, New Keynesian model.9 

Each of the adjectives is noteworthy, so I will briefly cover each in order.  First, 

for models to be of use to guide monetary policy, they need to be estimated such that they 

do a reasonable job of fitting the data; only under such circumstances can their 

quantitative predictions be taken as useful.10  Of course, they do not fit the data perfectly.  

The economy is an extremely complicated mechanism, and every macroeconomic model 

is a vast simplification of reality. 

Second, the large scale of FRB/US is an advantage in that it can perform a wide 

variety of computational “what if” experiments.  It is often the case that two 

macroeconomic phenomena happen at the same time--an increase in the value of equity 

shares and an appreciation of the dollar, for example--and it is an obvious benefit if the 

combination of the two can be analyzed within the same modeling framework.11 

                                                 
8 In addition to the FRB/US model, Board staff maintain EDO, a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 

(DSGE) model of the U.S. economy, and SIGMA, a multicountry DSGE model.  Staff members at the 

Reserve Banks also maintain and use a number of DSGE models.  Information on the FRB/US model, the 

EDO model, and the SIGMA model is available on the Board’s website at, respectively, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-about.htm, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/edo/edo-models-about.htm, and 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2005/835/ifdp835r.pdf.  
9 One reason why the FRB/US model is well known is that it is in the public domain and is regularly 

updated for public use, including the provision of a database that is constructed using the median 

projections from the most recent SEP.  See Brayton, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2014a) for a broad 

description of the model and Reifschneider, Ttlow, and Williams (1999) for a description and explanation 

of model properties.  Brayton and others (1997) provides an accessible summary of the role and importance 

of expectations formation in the FRB/US model. 
10 The FRB/US model is unfashionable by current academic standards in that it is not a DSGE model.  The 

difference that is relevant in this context is that the empirical fit of FRB/US is allowed to show through 

more explicitly because the modeling structure of the model is less restrictive than with a DSGE model.  

Even so, FRB/US has limitations, which it shares with other models of its class, including a relatively 

primitive financial sector with no theoretically grounded determination of term premiums.  
11 Of course, it is also advantageous to solicit from several models the implications of a particular 

macroeconomic phenomenon of interest.  For this reason, among others, the staff across the Federal 

Reserve System builds and maintains a number of models.
