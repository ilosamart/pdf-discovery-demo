For instance, in both the 2013 and 2014 stress test and capital planning exercises, we 

incorporated various combinations of interest rate shocks in the adverse scenarios.  

Supervisors have also been working to estimate the implications of a wider variety of 

interest rate shocks.  Our analysis to this point (undertaken outside of our annual stress 

test program) suggests that banking firms are capitalized to withstand the losses in asset 

valuations that would arise from large spikes in rates, which, moreover, would see an 

offset from the increase in the value of bank deposit franchises.  This finding is consistent 

with the lack of widespread stress during the period of May through June 2013 when 

interest rates increased considerably.7  The next set of stress-test results, which we will 

release next month, will provide further insight on this point, both to regulators and to 

markets. 

While ad hoc supervisory action aimed at specific lending or risks is surely a 

useful tool, it has its limitations.  First, it is a bit too soon to judge precisely how effective 

these supervisory actions – such as last year’s leveraged lending guidance – have been.  

Second, even if they prove effective in containing discrete excesses, it is not clear that the 

somewhat deliberate supervisory process would be adequate to deal with a more 

pervasive reach for yield affecting many areas of credit extension.  Third, and perhaps 

most important, the extent to which supervisory practice can either lean against the wind 

or increase the overall resiliency of the financial system is limited by the fact that it 

applies only to prudentially regulated firms.  This circumstance creates an incentive for 

intermediation activities to migrate outside of the regulated sector.   

                                                 
7 The FSOC staff with the regulatory agencies also have been assessing whether other financial institutions, 
such as insurance companies and pension funds, may be susceptible to a large spike in interest rates.
