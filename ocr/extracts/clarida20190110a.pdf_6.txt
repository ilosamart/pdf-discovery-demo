capital spending slowed notably in the third quarter and the manufacturing indexes from 

the Institute for Supply Management have softened, though other data are consistent with 

a rebound in business spending in the fourth quarter.  If a pickup in the growth of 

investment spending was realized and sustained, it would be expected to contribute to 

future productivity growth.   

The December Decision and the Outlook for Monetary Policy in 2019 

With a robust labor market and inflation running close to our 2 percent inflation 

objective, the Committee decided at its December meeting to raise the target range for the 

federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.4  That said, growth and growth prospects in 

other economies around the world have moderated somewhat in recent months, and 

overall financial conditions have tightened materially.  These recent developments in the 

global economy and financial markets represent crosswinds to the U.S. economy.  If 

these crosswinds are sustained, appropriate forward-looking monetary policy should 

respond to keep the economy as close as possible to our dual-mandate objectives of 

maximum employment and price stability.5  I will closely monitor the incoming data on

5 In the model of optimal monetary policy discussed in a paper by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, the central 
bank is able to offset fully exogenous declines in aggregate demand through adjustments in the expected 
path for the policy rate.  See Richard H. Clarida, Jordi Galí, and Mark Gertler (1999), “The Science of 
Monetary Policy:  A New Keynesian Perspective,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 37 (December), 
pp. 1661-1707.  A paper by Clarida shows that this result extends to the open economy facing, for example, 
a decline in exports.  While monetary policy in practice must confront real-world complications that 
theoretical models ignore, the crucial point is that economic projections for growth and inflation under 
appropriate monetary policy may be much less affected by adverse or positive “demand” fluctuations than 
would be the case if policy did not respond appropriately to these developments.  That is, under present 
circumstances and under appropriate monetary policy, one can be more optimistic about the economic 
outlook than would be a “pessimist” who focuses only on the crosswinds without factoring in the 
appropriate policy response to the crosswinds.  See Richard H. Clarida (2017), “The Global Factor in 
Neutral Policy Rates:  Some Implications for Exchange Rates, Monetary Policy, and Policy Coordination,”
