weaknesses included inadequate risk-measurement and risk-management systems at 

many financial firms as well as shortcomings in some firms’ business models, such as 

overreliance on unstable short-term funding and excessive leverage.  In the public sector, 

gaps and blind spots in the financial regulatory structures of the United States and most 

other countries proved particularly damaging.  These regulatory structures were designed 

for earlier eras and did not adequately adapt to rapid change and innovation in the 

financial sector, such as the increasing financial intermediation taking place outside of 

regulated depository institutions through the so-called shadow banking system.  In the 

realm of economic management, the leaders of financial firms, market participants, and 

government policymakers either did not recognize important structural problems and 

emerging risks or, when they identified them, did not respond sufficiently quickly or 

forcefully to address them.  Shortcomings of what I have called economic science, in 

contrast, were for the most part less central to the crisis; indeed, although the great 

majority of economists did not foresee the near-collapse of the financial system, 

economic analysis has proven and will continue to prove critical in understanding the 

crisis, in developing policies to contain it, and in designing longer-term solutions to 

prevent its recurrence. 

I don’t want to push this analogy too far.  Economics as a discipline differs in 

important ways from science and engineering; the latter, dealing as they do with 

inanimate objects rather than willful human beings, can often be far more precise in their 

predictions.  Also, the distinction between economic science and economic engineering 

can be less sharp than my analogy may suggest, as much economic research has direct 

policy implications.  And although I don’t think the crisis by any means requires us to
