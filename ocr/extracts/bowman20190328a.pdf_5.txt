Federal Reserve tracks these developments closely because of their potential implications 

for both the economy and banking supervision. 

The challenging outlook has prompted some to wonder if the industry is about to 

relive the hard times of the 1980s farm crisis.  But here, I think, the historical contrast is 

somewhat reassuring.  In the 1970s, farm income in the United States had advanced 

rapidly as exports surged.  The broad increase in farm income led to a significant rise in 

capital investments in the years that followed.  But exports began to soften and fell 

sharply after the suspension of trade with the then-Soviet Union.  Farm incomes dropped, 

profits declined rapidly, and liquidity in the U.S. farm sector dried up.   

Other factors turned the sharp downturn into a crisis.  High interest rates in the 

early 1980s, in response to the Great Inflation, contributed to the stress.3  Despite the 

reductions in profits and liquidity, capital spending remained elevated in the early 1980s, 

and was financed with higher levels of debt made possible by rising land values.  With 

debt burdens rising and incomes falling, many farm operations were forced to sell their 

land, causing the value of farmland to decline rapidly.  The result was a sharp increase in 

farm bankruptcies and a number of bank failures.  

What about now?  There are some similarities.  Farm incomes rose rapidly from 

2000 before reaching their peak in 2013 at $123 billion.4  During that time, spurred by 

rising demand in China and a boom in biofuels, farmers invested heavily in new
