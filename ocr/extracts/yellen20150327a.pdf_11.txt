estimated longer-run trend with inflation moving up to around 2 percent.  This solid 

economic performance is projected to be consistent with a gradual normalization of 

monetary policy:  The median funds rate projection in the March SEP increases 

a percentage point per year on average through the end of 2017.   

The projected combination of a gradual rise in the nominal federal funds rate 

coupled with further progress on both legs of the dual mandate is consistent with an 

implicit assessment by the Committee that the equilibrium real federal funds rate--one 

measure of the economy’s underlying strength--is rising only slowly over time.  In the 

wake of the financial crisis, the equilibrium real rate apparently fell well below zero 

because of numerous persistent headwinds. These headwinds include tighter underwriting 

standards and restricted access to some forms of credit; the need for households to reduce 

their debt burdens; contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government after the initial 

effects of the fiscal stimulus package had passed; and elevated uncertainty about the 

economic outlook that made firms hesitant to invest and hire, and households reluctant to 

buy houses, cars, and other discretionary goods.   

Fortunately, the overall force of these headwinds appears to have diminished 

considerably over the past year or so, allowing employment to accelerate appreciably 

even as the level of the federal funds rate and the volume of our asset holdings remained 

nearly unchanged.6  Stated differently, the economy’s underlying strength has been 

6 Although the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program last October, the stimulus provided by this 
type of unconventional monetary policy action depends primarily on the stock of longer-term assets held by 
the Federal Reserve, not the flow of securities bought.  Because the FOMC has held the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet constant since October while continuing to keep the federal funds rate near zero, 
the overall stance of monetary policy is thus little changed over this period.  However, the downward 
pressure on long-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings should decline over time, 
particularly after the FOMC suspends its current reinvestment policy, because the average duration of the 
assets held in the portfolio will be steadily falling and because the relative size of the portfolio to the stock 
of publicly held debt will be shrinking.
