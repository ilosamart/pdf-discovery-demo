products offer the potential to make tailored financial advice scalable.  For instance, a fintech 

developer could pair historical data about how different types of consumers fare with a specific 

product, on the one hand, with a consumer’s particular financial profile, on the other hand, to 

make a prediction about how that consumer is likely to fare with the product.  

The Evolution of Financial Autopilots

price comparison tools to offer tailored “agents” for consumers that can recommend products 

based on analyses of individual behavior and preferences.33  Today, a new generation of personal
