of how much stress the bank was under and, on the other, the concept of a capital conservation 

buffer above minimum capital requirements as it has been added to the capital rules.  The second 

is a soft limitation on dividends put in place by the Board at the inception of CCAR.  Both of 

these features of CCAR reflected supervisory concerns with the fact that, even as the financial 

crisis was clearly unfolding, some of the largest banks continued to repurchase shares and pay 

dividends to shareholders and, thereby, depleted capital that proved to be needed later.12 

The SCB approach addresses the first of these issues by providing a continuous constraint 

on any planned distributions that would bring capital levels below the sum of the minimum 4.5 

percent of risk-weighted assets plus the firm-specific SCB, plus any applicable GSIB 

surcharge.13  However, because declines in observed and reported capital levels usually occur 

with a lag, and the historical evidence that dividends are less likely to be curtailed than share 

repurchases,14 we would assume a firm will maintain its dividends for one year while reducing 

its repurchases.  This would have the effect of requiring a firm to hold capital to meet its stress 

losses and fund its planned dividends over the next year. 

The switch to an SCB approach would also give us an opportunity to address a second 

issue, the soft limit on dividends in CCAR.  Since its inception, our policy statements on CCAR 

have indicated that a capital plan with a planned dividend payout ratio above 30 percent would 

be subjected to particularly close scrutiny.  When this policy was adopted in late 2010, we 

expected that it would be a useful guideline during a period when most of the CCAR banks

13 Were a countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed, it would be added to the buffers above the 4.5 percent 
minimum capital requirement.

dividends until late 2008. See Hirtle (2014).
