Good morning.  As always, thanks are due to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 

City for organizing this conference.  This yearâ€™s topic, long-term economic growth, is 

indeed pertinent--as has so often been the case at this symposium in past years.  In 

particular, the financial crisis and the subsequent slow recovery have caused some to 

question whether the United States, notwithstanding its long-term record of vigorous 

economic growth, might not now be facing a prolonged period of stagnation, regardless 

of its public policy choices.  Might not the very slow pace of economic expansion of the 

past few years, not only in the United States but also in a number of other advanced 

economies, morph into something far more long-lasting? 

I can certainly appreciate these concerns and am fully aware of the challenges that 

we face in restoring economic and financial conditions conducive to healthy growth, 

some of which I will comment on today.  With respect to longer-run prospects, however, 

my own view is more optimistic.  As I will discuss, although important problems 

certainly exist, the growth fundamentals of the United States do not appear to have been 

permanently altered by the shocks of the past four years.  It may take some time, but we 

can reasonably expect to see a return to growth rates and employment levels consistent 

with those underlying fundamentals.  In the interim, however, the challenges for U.S. 

economic policymakers are twofold:  first, to help our economy further recover from the 

crisis and the ensuing recession, and second, to do so in a way that will allow the 

economy to realize its longer-term growth potential.  Economic policies should be 

evaluated in light of both of those objectives. 

 This morning I will offer some thoughts on why the pace of recovery in the 

United States has, for the most part, proved disappointing thus far, and I will discuss the
