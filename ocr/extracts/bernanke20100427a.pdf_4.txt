year, there are about 5 individuals between the ages of 20 and 64 for each person aged 65 

and older.  By the time most of the baby boomers have retired in 2030, this ratio is 

projected to have declined to around 3.  The projected fiscal imbalances associated with 

the Social Security system are notably smaller than those for federal health programs, but 

they still are significant and thus present an important challenge for policy.  

Elsewhere in the budget, noninterest spending for programs outside of Medicare, 

Medicaid, and Social Security has comprised roughly half of total outlays over the past 

couple of decades.  These expenditures support national defense and homeland security, 

education, transportation, and income-security programs, along with many other 

activities.  The commission will have the difficult job of weighing the economic, social, 

and other benefits of these programs and comparing the implications of cuts in these 

areas against other means of closing the fiscal gap.    

Choices regarding Medicare, Social Security, and other spending programs cannot 

be made in a vacuum but must be combined with decisions about how much revenue the 

government will raise and how it will raise it.  No laws are more basic than the laws of 

arithmetic:  For fiscal sustainability, whatever level of spending is chosen, revenues must 

be sufficient to sustain that spending in the long run.  At the same time, economic vitality 

is enhanced when taxes are not excessive and are collected through a system that is 

economically efficient, equitable, and transparent.  At present, a broad consensus exists 

that the U.S. tax code does not satisfy these criteria and is in need of reform.  I suspect 

that it is too much to ask the commission to review the tax code in detail, but a full 

picture of our budgetary dilemma will require attention to the strengths and weaknesses 

of our current system of raising revenue.
