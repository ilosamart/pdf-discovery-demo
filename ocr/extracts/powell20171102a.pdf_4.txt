these banks on the panels.  Market participants should understand that the official sector has 

done everything it can to stabilize and strengthen LIBOR.  Without the intervention of U.K. 

authorities, LIBOR would be in a weaker state today. 

But that balancing act has grown increasingly difficult.  As time has passed, some banks 

have grown more resistant to public-sector entreaties to remain on the panels.  As you know, one 

bank left the U.S. dollar panel last year.  At the same time, we have had to confront the fact that, 

if banks could not be persuaded to voluntarily remain on panels, then the legal powers to compel 

them to do so were limited.  Under European Union benchmark regulations, which LIBOR will 

soon be subject to, authorities can only compel submissions to a critical benchmark for a period 

of two years.  Given this time limit, brokering a voluntary agreement with the submitting banks 

to stay on for a longer period was the last, best choice that authorities had available to guarantee 

some further period of stability for LIBOR.  CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo and I have 

publicly supported the FCA’s efforts to secure an agreement with the submitting banks to stay on 

through the end of 2021, and we have encouraged the U.S. banks that submit to LIBOR to 

cooperate with FCA’s effort.   

Of course, LIBOR may remain viable well past 2021, but we do not think that market 

participants can safely assume that it will.  Users of LIBOR must now take in to account the risk 

that it may not always be published.  While the public’s understanding of this risk has increased 

significantly since Andrew Bailey’s speech, the official sector has been concerned about it for 

some years, as reflected for example in our public comments and in the annual reports of the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Given our understanding of the risks to LIBOR, the 

Federal Reserve convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (or ARRC) in 2014 in 

cooperation with the Treasury Department and CFTC.  Consistent with recommendations from
