growth in the coming years.  In particular, I anticipate that employment will continue to 

expand and the unemployment rate will decline further.   

An improving job market should, in turn, help support a faster pace of household 

spending growth.  Additional jobs and potentially faster wage growth bolster household 

incomes, and lower energy prices mean consumers have more money to spend on other 

goods and services.  In addition, growing employment and wages should make 

consumers more comfortable in spending a greater portion of their incomes than they 

have been in the aftermath of the Great Recession.  Moreover, increases in house values 

and stock market prices, along with reductions in debt in recent years, have pushed up 

households’ net worth, which also should support more spending.  Finally, interest rates 

faced by borrowers remain low, reflecting the FOMC’s highly accommodative monetary 

policies.  Indeed, recent encouraging data about retail sales and light motor vehicle 

purchases in the beginning of the second quarter could be an indication that the pace of 

consumer spending is picking up. 

Another positive factor for the outlook is that the drag on economic growth in 

recent years from changes in federal fiscal policies appears to have waned.  Temporary 

fiscal stimulus measures supported economic output during the recession and early in the 

recovery, but those stimulus measures have since expired, and additional policy actions 

were taken to reduce the federal budget deficit.  By 2011, these changes in fiscal policies 

were holding back economic growth.  However, the effects of those fiscal policy actions 

now seem to be mostly behind us.5  

                                                 
5 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on 
economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth 
roughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would
