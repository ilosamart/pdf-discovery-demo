Thank you, Chairman Powell.  It is my honor to introduce Chair Yellen.1 

When I first arrived at the Board, Chair Yellen offered me the opportunity to lead the 

Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs--even though I had little experience in this 

area.  I greatly appreciate the opportunity she gave me.  After visits to 16 communities across the 

country--both rural and urban--I can attest to the richness of our community development work.  

It helps us see the economy as it is experienced by Americans in their communities.  It provides 

a valuable perspective on our monetary policy goals by putting names and faces on the aggregate 

unemployment statistics.  It helps us spot problems in consumer credit in overstretched 

communities well before they show up in national statistics.  And it is essential in helping our 

banks meet their affirmative obligations to the low- and moderate-income communities they 

serve and to understand what is likely to be most effective in lifting up the lives of people in 

challenged communities. 

Janet Yellen’s experience as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 

during some of the most challenging economic times for our country no doubt shaped her 

commitment to the Federal Reserve’s community development work.2  One associate from the 

San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank recounts a meeting at the height of the crisis when staff 

suggested their exhausted boss should take a break from the round-the-clock emergency 

meetings.  Then-President Yellen stated that she had an obligation to continue working until such 

time that families were no longer losing their homes, their livelihoods, and their pensions.
