For example, were models to predict a surge in inflation, a decision for preemptive hikes 

before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced against the cost of 

the model being wrong.  Speaking for myself, I believe we can afford to be patient about 

assessing how to adjust our policy stance to achieve and sustain our dual-mandate 

objectives.  We begin the year as close to our assigned objectives as we have in a very 

long time.  In these circumstances, I believe patience is a virtue and is one we can today 

afford.  Thank you.
