Many have noted that during the current expansion, investment and capital 

accumulation have been lower than in previous expansions, so perhaps we just need to 

invest more.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to be that simple.  Standard reasoning holds 

that capital-per-worker drives productivity.  While we have had slower capital 

accumulation of late, we have also had slower growth in labor supply--hours worked.  

Thus, capital per worker, according to some analysis, has continued to increase roughly at 

its pre-recession trend.  In this view, the productivity problem is not simply one of 

inadequate investment.9   

Researchers have proposed several reasons why, even if the quantity of 

investment has kept up, recent investment may be leading to smaller productivity 

advances than in the past.  The more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a 

productivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are 

embedded in recent investment.10  Others suggest that productivity-advancing ideas are 

inherently harder to find and exploit than in the past, implying that slower productivity 

growth may be with us for the long haul.11  This debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime 

soon.  In the meantime, we should look for policies that will create an environment in 

which productivity can flourish.

10 For example, Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, and Rock (2018) highlight the need to make complimentary 
investments in intangibles to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies (see 
Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock (2018), “What Can Machines Learn and What Does It 
Mean for Occupations and the Economy?” AEA Papers and Proceedings, vol. 108 (May), pp. 43-47).  And 
Mokyr (2014) argues that the vast array of computers and other relatively new tools will usher in a new 
wave of progress just like the invention of barometers and microscopes and other tools propelled the 
technology in the 1700s (see Joel Mokyr (2014), “The Next Age of Invention,” City Journal, Winter). 
11 Bloom and others (2017) as well as Thompson and Spanuth (2018) discuss how it has become more 
costly to make technological advances.  See Nicholas Bloom, Charles I. Jones, John Van Reenen, and 
Michael Webb (2017), “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” available at 
https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/papers.html; and Neil Thompson and Svenja Spanuth (2018), “The Decline 
of Computers As a General Purpose Technology:  Why Deep Learning and the End of Moore’s Law Are 
Fragmenting Computing,” available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3287769.
