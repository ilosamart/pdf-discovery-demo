leadership is critical to establish the new rules of a new financial architecture.  Policy 

coordination with our Group of 20 colleagues should not take a backseat. 

 Alternative Theory of the Case:  If Too-Big-To-Fail Prevails… 

We should not fool ourselves.  Government interventions during the past couple of years, 

however necessary, revealed a set of policy preferences.  Expectations hardened that 

governments will come to the rescue of large ailing markets and large failing firms.  These 

expectations must be unlearned by market participants.  And the government’s role must be 

explicitly delineated.  These changes won’t happen overnight.  But, eradicating the too-big-to-

fail problem should be the predominant policy goal. 

If we fail to achieve this critical objective, the next-best regime may involve choosing a 

point between two competing models for systemically-significant firms:  regulating what 

financial institutions can do, and regulating how they do it.5  Clear rules--more focused on the 

“what” than the “how”--could liberate firms from the corridors of Washington so they can get 

back to business.  Supervisors, of course, would still serve an important role, leaning against the 

prevailing winds, providing guidance to firms, and ensuring best practices.  But, Washington 

would steer clear of managing the affairs of private firms. 

Obscuring the choice altogether--both directing the “what” and ordering the “how”--

strikes me as imprudent.  Washington finds itself perhaps too interested in scrutinizing the day-

to-day management and operations of financial firms.  Are they loaning too little to small 

businesses?  Too much to big developers?  Are loans to large corporations too cheap?  And loans 

to consumers too expensive?  The tendency by Washington to micromanage can harm an 

economy that desperately needs a competitive, vibrant, sustainable banking system.
