the recovery has faced powerful headwinds, suggesting that economic growth might well 

have been considerably weaker, or even negative, without substantial monetary policy 

support.  For the most part, research supports the conclusion that the combination of 

forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases has helped promote the recovery.  For 

example, changes in guidance appear to shift interest rate expectations, and the 

preponderance of studies show that asset purchases push down longer-term interest rates 

and boost asset prices.14  These changes in financial conditions in turn appear to have 

provided material support to the economy.15 

Once the economy improves sufficiently so that unconventional tools are no 

longer needed, the Committee will face issues of policy implementation and, ultimately, 

the design of the policy framework.  Large-scale asset purchases have increased the size 

of our balance sheet and created substantial excess reserves in the banking system.  

Under the operating procedures used prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of 

excess reserves likely would have impeded the FOMC’s ability to raise short-term 

nominal interest rates when appropriate.  However, the Federal Reserve now has effective 

tools to normalize the stance of policy when conditions warrant, without reliance on asset 

sales.  The interest rate on excess reserves can be raised, which will put upward pressure 

on short-term rates; in addition, the Federal Reserve will be able to employ other tools, 

such as fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, or term 

                                                 
14 There is a substantial recent research literature that has tried to quantify the effects of balance sheet 
policies on asset pricing. For example, see D’Amico and King (2013) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-
Jorgenson (2011).  Research on the effects on mortgage rates includes Hancock and Passmore (2011).  
Research on the effects on corporate bond yields includes Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2013) and Kiley (2013); 
Kiley (forthcoming b) examines the effects on U.S. equity prices.  For a recent study of the effectiveness of 
forward guidance, see Femia, Friedman, and Sack (2013).  
15 The range of macroeconomic frameworks used to judge the effects of these policy actions reflects the 
diversity of views within the profession of how to model the relevant empirical links, for example, Chung 
and others (2012); Fuhrer and Olivei (2011); Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012); and Kiley (forthcoming a).
