about the behavior of financial institutions and their effects on systemic risk and the real 

economy.  Our ability to model the channels by which disruptions in credit and finance 

affect the real economy and the ways these effects feed back into the banking and 

financial systems is getting more sophisticated.11  But our understanding of the key 

channels, their quantitative importance, and the effects of our policies remain incomplete 

at best.  It is therefore important that we implement policies that are likely to succeed in 

mitigating systemic risk in a future crisis regardless of the precise triggers and 

transmission channels.  A rich monetary policy literature demonstrates that simple rules 

result in good, even excellent, performance when policymakers face uncertainty about the 

structure of the economy and the source of economic shocks.12  This conclusion may 

apply to macroprudential supervision as well.  

A third consideration in the design of the macroprudential supervision relates to 

the need for extensive international cooperation.  If the United States were to go it alone 

with tough policies, we could see our financial institutions flee in a race to the bottom.  

But I’m convinced that won’t happen.  We are working closely with our international 

counterparts to develop coherent and comprehensive approaches, aided by the Basel
