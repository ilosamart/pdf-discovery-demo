support stable families and promote civic engagement.  And to help people feel in control 

of their own destinies, policies should respect the autonomy of individuals, families, and 

communities to make their own decisions whenever possible, as research has confirmed 

the intuitive notion that individual freedoms contribute to life satisfaction. 

Notwithstanding that income contributes to well-being, the economics of 

happiness is also a useful antidote to the tendency of economists to focus exclusively on 

material determinants of social welfare, such as the GDP.  GDP is not itself the final 

objective of policy, just as an increase in income may not be a good enough reason for 

you to change jobs.  Obtaining broader measures of human welfare is challenging, but not 

impossible.  Indeed, the United Nations has produced its human development reports for 

20 years, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been 

engaged in a comprehensive project to examine the progress of societies in order to 

ensure that economic policymaking focuses on improving human welfare, broadly 

construed.15 

But even though GDP or income should not be the only goal of our strivings, we 

can go one step further and recognize as well that happiness itself, at least to the extent 

that the term is associated with immediate rather than long-lasting feelings and emotions, 

should not be our only goal either.  Remember that I began by distinguishing between 

happiness and life satisfaction.  Happiness is just one component of the broader, longer-

term concept of life satisfaction, and only one indicator of how the fabric of our lives is 

being shaped by our choices and circumstances.  I am reminded of a story about Abraham 

Lincoln.  According to the story, Lincoln was riding with a friend in a carriage on a rainy
