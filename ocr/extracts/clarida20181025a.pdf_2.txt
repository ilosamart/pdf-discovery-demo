I see some familiar faces in the audience, and I am delighted to be at Peterson 

today to offer my first public remarks since being sworn in last month as Vice Chairman 

of the Federal Reserve Board.  As some of you know, I have been a student of U.S. 

monetary policy for more than 30 years.  So, for me, personally, it is a distinct honor and 

real privilege to have the opportunity to serve with my colleagues on the Board of 

Governors and, along with the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC).   

Now, of course, I fully realize that I have participated in just one FOMC meeting 

to date, so my remarks today will not come with a patina earned from long experience as 

a monetary policymaker.  That said, I thought it might be of interest to share my thinking 

on the current state of the U.S. economy, to explain how it informed my support for the 

FOMCâ€™s policy decision last month, and to discuss my views on the way forward for 

U.S. monetary policy.1 

The Economic Expansion in Year 10  

The U.S. economic expansion, now in its 10th year, is marked by strong growth in 

the gross domestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside 

for nearly two years.  It is impossible today to know with much precision how much of 

the pickup in growth and the decline in unemployment that we have seen over the past 

two years is structural and how much is cyclical.  Most likely, both factors are at work.  

That said, based on my reading of the accumulating evidence, I believe that trend growth
