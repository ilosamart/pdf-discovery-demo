will be able to raise rates and maintain them near their targeted level at the appropriate 

time.   

Another important question is whether monetary policymakers should alter their 

basic framework of flexible inflation targeting to take financial stability into account.  My 

answer to that question is that the “flexible” part of flexible inflation targeting should 

include contributing to financial stability, provided that it aids in the attainment of the 

main goals of monetary policy.  The main goals in the United States are those of the dual 

mandate, maximum employment and stable prices; in other countries the main goal is 

stable prices or low inflation.  

What can the central bank do when financial stability is threatened?  If it has 

effective macroprudential tools at its disposal, it can deploy those.  If it does not itself 

have the authority to use such tools, it can try to persuade those who do have the tools to 

use them.  If no such tools are available in the economy, the central bank may have to 

consider whether to use monetary policy--that is, the interest rate--to deal with the threat 

of financial instability.  At the moment in the U.S., though there may be some areas of 

concern, I do not think that financial stability concerns warrant deviating from our 

traditional focus on inflation and employment.   

A decision on whether to use the interest rate to deal with the threat of financial 

instability is always likely to be difficult--particularly in a small open economy, where 

raising the interest rate is likely to produce an unwanted exchange rate appreciation.  So a 

critical question must be whether effective macroprudential policies are to be found in the 

country in question.
