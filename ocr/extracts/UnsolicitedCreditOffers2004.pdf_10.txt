Potential Effects of Further Restrictions on Prescreened Solicitations 

Written offers of credit and insurance sent directly to consumers, often resulting from 
prescreened solicitation lists using credit records in the files of CRAs, have the potential 
to increase competition in the market for the relevant consumer financial services. The 
primary benefits of competition consist of lower prices and an increased availability of 
the product or service in question. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that actions 
undertaken to restrict the ability of lenders and insurers to provide written offers of credit 
or insurance to consumers would on balance result in a less competitive marketplace and 
thus relatively higher prices and reduced availability. 

Also, it is difficult to see how further restrictions on the ability of lenders and insurers to 
provide written offers of credit or insurance to consumers would improve the condition of 
those individuals or groups of individuals who might have been underserved in the past. 
It also is difficult to see how reducing the amounts of direct, tailored information sent to 
consumers on the availability and pricing of financial services would improve their 
“knowledge about new or alternative products and services.” 

The Fact Act includes enhancements to the opt-out-notice provisions of the FCRA; these 
include a review of the presentation and placement of the notice in prescreened 
solicitations and an extension of the opt-out period from two years to five years. The 
Congress also directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct a campaign to 
raise public awareness of opt-out rights, which may have the effect of increasing the 
frequency of opting out. These developments suggest that further legislative or 
regulatory changes to the opt-out system should await evaluation of the effects of these 
new provisions.
