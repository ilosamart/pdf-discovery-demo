First, don’t blame the mirror.  In times of economic weakness or financial 

distress, policymakers are often troubled by the messages embedded in financial market 

prices or bank lending statistics.  Some supervisors might disagree--even strongly--with 

the prices markets assign to a banking system’s financial wherewithal.  Some elected 

officials may blame commercial banks for the low levels of lending.  Some out-of-favor 

fiscal authorities may take great umbrage at the prices assigned to their funding costs.  

Still, outlawing a class of securities or upbraiding an industry tends to be 

counterproductive. 

Second, don’t fall in love with the mirror.  In benign economic times, market 

prices can lull investors and policymakers into a false sense of security.  Financial market 

prices may appear more sanguine about prospects than fundamentals suggest.  The cost of 

issuing a 10-year Treasury bond or German bund might be exceptionally low by 

historical standards.  Inflation expectations may appear well anchored.  But this is no 

guarantee of future performance.  Market prices adjust slowly and steadily…until they 

don’t.  Then, market prices can act in a nonlinear fashion.  That’s when policymakers end 

up with fewer, less desirable options.  And economies are done harm.  So, in each of 

these messages, we might think of the financial markets as a mirror, a very imperfect but 

still telling reflection of reality. 

Third, facts, not force, should be the predominant policy response.  Prevailing 

wisdom has it that policymakers must overreact when markets do.  In my view, this is an 

uncertain proposition.  If a problem were unique or isolated, game theory suggests that 

overwhelming force might serve policymakers’ interests.  But, these problems are not 

isolated.  And it is no game.  Markets will continue to clamor for more explicit
