It is also possible that the increasing prevalence of gig work will cause the 

cyclical behavior of unemployment, participation, and the workweek to change, with 

implications for how we assess the amount of slack.  We know that contingent work 

increases when the economy worsens.  If new technologies make it easier to find gig 

work, then we could see unemployment rise less in recessions, to the extent that gig 

workers are counted as employed.  However, it could be that individuals who are able to 

avoid unemployment through contingent work would still be underemployed if it is 

difficult to cobble together enough gigs to achieve full-time employment.  This would 

likely show up as lower average workweeks and higher levels of involuntary part-time 

employment during downturns.  As a result, cyclical changes in resource utilization could 

be reflected less in movements in the unemployment rate and more in variation in hours 

per worker.  

Beyond the behavior of macroeconomic variables, it is unclear how the growth of 

different types of gig work affects the welfare of workers.  Welfare should increase in 

cases where gig work meets the needs of workers by providing a low-barrier means of 

accessing employment and by allowing workers to better match actual hours worked with 

desired hours of work, especially if the gig work is available at times and in places where 

traditional work opportunities are in short supply.  

There is some evidence that this has, indeed, been the case.  For example, 

24 percent of informal workers in the EIWA survey indicated that contingent work had 

offset their spells of unemployment, loss of working hours, loss of benefits, or frozen 

wages in their formal employment “very much” or “somewhat.”  In addition, three-
