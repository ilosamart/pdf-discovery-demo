The combination of strong job gains and lackluster GDP growth over the past four 

quarters reflects exceptionally poor labor productivity growth.  Indeed, productivity 

declined 1/2 percent over the most recent four quarters and has increased only about 

1/4 percent per year, on average, since 2011.  While improving labor market conditions 

have led to higher household incomes in recent years, the key to improved living 

standards over the long haul will be a revival in productivity growth--at least to more 

normal levels, possibly in the range of 1-1/2 percent per annum. 

Foreign economies have been growing at a moderate pace, even in the face of 

numerous shocks, including concerns about China’s exchange regime at the start of the 

year and Brexit over the summer.  The economic effects of the steep appreciation of the 

dollar that began in mid-2014 have begun to fade, and U.S. exports have returned to 

growth following a weak 2015.    

Turning to inflation, I believe that transitory effects of the fall in oil prices and the 

rise in the dollar are the primary reason that inflation has fallen short of the FOMC’s 

2 percent goal.  Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 1 percent 

in August on a 12-month basis, held down by earlier declines in gasoline prices, but core 

PCE inflation has moved up somewhat, and its 12-month change stood at 1.7 percent in 

August.  As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, the drag on consumer price inflation from 

these sources ought to dissipate, and inflation will likely move closer to 2 percent.  This 

projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining 

reasonably well anchored; as the FOMC has noted, low readings for some indicators of 

expected inflation deserve close watching.
