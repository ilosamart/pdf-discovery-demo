Since recoveries from recession in the United States 

economy have normally been extended only if capital spending 

also joins the parade, we might diverge for a moment to see what 

could be done to improve capital spending in the year ahead.

As I view the future for business capital spending in new 

plant and equipment for 1976, there are two critical factors which 

must be resolved. First, businessmen must be convinced that the 

recovery is to continue and that consumer expenditures will be furÂ­

ther enlarged so that there will be a market for the products of an 

enlarged capacity. Second, businessmen must be convinced that their 

profit ratios will be strong enough to support new debt for capital 

spending before the new equipment comes on stream. In other words, 

the bottom line must show a sufficient profit to constitute a 

reasonable return on investment before businessmen will spend for 

new capacity. There are some favorable signs with regard to capital 

spending, particularly Lhe improvement in corporate liquidity--the 

corporate ability to fund bank debt and renew their bank lines of 

credit and the improved cash flow of corporations which has developed 

over the past few months as spending and consumption improved. In 

addition, new capital spending for some specialized industries appears 

to be increasing. Long-term rates of interest have come down marginally 

over the past sixty to ninety days and this should provide an atmosphere
