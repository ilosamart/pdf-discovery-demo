size of the economy is one-third the increase in household debt seen in the previous 

decade.  Business debt rises in expansions.  It is a steady upward plod in borrowing over 

the long expansion—not a rapid expansion—that has now brought business debt to GDP 

back to historic highs.  Seen this way, the current situation looks typical of business 

cycles.  The mortgage credit boom was, because of its magnitude and speed, far outside 

historical norms.3   

As for household debt, we see that household debt-to-income ratios have steadily 

declined post-crisis.  Moreover, a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime.  All 

told, household debt burdens appear much more manageable. 

Our second factor—valuation pressures—also points to moderate risks to 

financial stability.  Valuations are high across several financial markets.  Equity prices 

have recently reached new highs, and corporate bond and loan spreads are narrow.  Both 

commercial and residential property prices have moved above their long-run relationship 

with rents, although price gains slowed substantially last year.  All of these developments 

point to strong risk appetite—as might be expected given the strong economy.  But there 

does not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices, as was the 

case in the run-up to the financial crisis.  While borrowing by businesses has been strong, 

it is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing, whose 

collapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses.  Instead, the 

increase in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors, including 

technology, oil and gas production, and manufacturing.
