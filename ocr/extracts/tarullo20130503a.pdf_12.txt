 Stating the goal is easy, but executing it is not, precisely because short-term 

wholesale funding is used in a variety of forms by a variety of market actors.  

Determining appropriately equivalent controls is a challenging task and, with respect to 

institutions not subject to prudential regulation, there may be questions as to where--if at 

all--current regulatory authority resides.  And, of course, there is the overarching problem 

of calibrating the regulation so as to mitigate the systemic risks associated with these 

funding markets, while not suppressing the mechanisms that have become important parts 

of the modern financial system in providing liquidity and lowering borrowing costs for 

both financial and non-financial firms.  For all these reasons, it may well be that the 

abstract desirability of a single, comprehensive regulatory measure may not be achievable 

in the near term.    

 Still, at least as a starting point, we would do well to consider measures that apply 

broadly.  One option is to change minimum requirements for capital, liquidity, or both at 

all regulated firms so as to realize a macroprudential, as well as microprudential, purpose.  

In their current form, existing and planned liquidity requirements produced by the Basel 

Committee aim mostly to encourage maturity-matched books.  While maturity mismatch 

by core intermediaries is a key financial stability risk in wholesale funding markets, it is 

not the only one.  Even if an intermediary’s book of securities financing transactions is 

perfectly matched, a reduction in its access to funding can force the firm to engage in 

asset fire sales or to abruptly withdraw credit from customers.  The intermediary’s 

customers are likely to be highly leveraged and maturity transforming financial firms as 

well, and, therefore, may then have to engage in fire sales themselves.  The direct and
