on a failed institution’s shareholders and creditors and replace its management, while avoiding 

runs by short-term counterparties and preserving, to the degree feasible, the operations of sound, 

functioning parts of the firm.  By granting this authority, the law gives the government a third 

alternative to the Hobson’s choice of bailout or disorderly bankruptcy that authorities faced in 

2008.  Further, the credible possibility of losses should enhance market discipline by diminishing 

expectations among shareholders and long-term creditors that they effectively hold a put option 

because of a belief the government would bail out a large firm in order to preclude contagion 

from a disorderly failure.  

 The FDIC has already done considerable work in developing an approach to its potential 

exercise of orderly liquidation authority.  Other home countries of globally significant financial 

firms are working toward enacting their own resolution regimes.  But even with comparable 

regimes in place around the world, a number of significant cross-border issues will need to be 

addressed, such as the effect on certain contractual obligations of a firm in a host country when 

the home country places that firm into resolution.  Moreover, for the resolution mechanism to be 

credible ex ante and effective ex post, the capital and liability structure of major firms must be 

able to absorb losses without either threatening short-term funding liabilities or necessitating 

injections of capital from the government.   

 In this regard, it is useful to remember that the original rationale for Basel’s two tiers of 

capital requirements was that Tier 1 capital would be available to absorb losses so as to allow the 

firm to continue as a going concern, while the additional Tier 2 capital would be available to 

absorb losses if the firm nonetheless failed.  As I have already noted, the various Basel 

frameworks have materially strengthened both the quantity and quality of required Tier 1 capital.  

Now we also need to attend to the characteristics and size of the components of a firm's balance
