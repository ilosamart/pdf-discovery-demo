The post-crisis regime has shifted to implementing preventive policies well in 

advance of any crisis.7  Newly established ex ante policies include building the resilience 

of institutions by requiring more and higher-quality capital and liquidity buffers; a regime 

of stress tests undertaken by supervisors; and resolution planning, which requires firms to 

analyze their own potential for distress or failure and create a plan to be used in the event 

of bankruptcy.  These post-crisis policies have benefitted from public solicitation of 

feedback and in many cases from consideration in open meetings of the Board of 

Governors.   

Transparency and incorporation of public feedback in these areas have produced 

more effective supervision and regulation.  For example, transparent and clearly 

communicated policies make it easier for regulated entities to know what is expected of 

them and how best to comply.  Of course, as with any large-scale, complex undertaking, 

the standards adopted over the past decade can undoubtedly be improved.  At the Fed, we 

are committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post-crisis 

reforms.   

In a sense, stress testing is itself a step forward in transparency.  Pre-crisis, 

supervisors’ views of the risks facing our most systemically important firms--and the 

firms’ ability to understand and survive these risks--were shrouded in secrecy.  Post-

crisis, as part of our stress-testing regime, these supervisory views and expectations are 

transparent.  We expect that these firms will have capital, liquidity, and risk-management 

capabilities that are adequate for the firms not only to survive, but to continue to perform 

their key functions even in the event of truly severe stress, akin to the global financial
