had a job in 1967 versus a bit more than 70 percent in 2017.  For women of working age, 

the trends are less clear, but those without a college degree are also less likely to work 

today.  Research presented this morning will discuss some possible explanations for the 

divergence in employment, income, and other economic prospects between college grads 

and others. 

The third observation is that the prospect of moving up the economic ladder 

depends on factors beyond effort and talent, including your family, the neighborhood you 

grow up in, and the quality of the primary and secondary schools you attend.  Your 

chances for attending college are much better if you are raised in a higher-income 

household, and that advantage has increased substantially since the 1980s.  Another 

factor is geography.  Some research indicates that economic prospects are better for those 

who grow up in neighborhoods with less income inequality, less concentrated poverty, 

and better performing schools.  Finally, across so many dimensions, we continue to see 

disparities in economic outcomes by race and ethnicity.   

These issues are crucial.  Sound public policies can support families and 

businesses and help more Americans reach and remain in the middle class.  I look 

forward to hearing about your discussions over the next two days, and thank you, again, 

for your contributions.
