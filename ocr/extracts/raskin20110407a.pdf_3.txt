A significant backdrop to the post-crisis financial architecture is the expansive federal 

legislation that is known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

(Dodd-Frank).  Broadly speaking, Dodd-Frank gives us a roadmap for updating the regulatory 

framework of our financial system post-crisis, but it does not give us turn-by-turn directions for 

how to incorporate the new requirements into our supervisory processes.  To that end, the 

Federal Reserve and other federal regulators are devoting considerable time to implementing the 

requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Translating all of the new legislative requirements into 

rules and regulations, and then into an effective supervisory and examination program, is a 

massive undertaking, but it is essential to moving beyond the stabilization phase of crisis 

recovery and into that phase where we address  the underlying fault lines in our financial 

institution landscape.   

As we work through Dodd-Frank implementation, we will need to ask:  What constitutes 

effective supervision in the post-crisis world?  I expect that the answer will be the subject of 

debate for months and possibly years.   

The process of identifying the factors most important to constructing an effective 

supervisory and examination program has already begun.  For Americaâ€™s community banks, the 

vast majority of which did not contribute to the subprime crisis, the contours of this program will 

be of critical importance. 

As we have learned all too well, a financial system dominated by a handful of large 

institutions is unlikely to be resilient in the face of a crisis.  My view is that a diffuse financial 

system--one with a diverse range of institutions of varying size and complexity--is preferable to a 

system that is highly concentrated.
