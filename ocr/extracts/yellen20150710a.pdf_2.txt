Thank you, President Mester, and thank you to the City Club for inviting me to 

speak today.  I am aware of the club’s history and its tradition of promoting the free 

exchange of ideas, and I will do my best to allow plenty of time for your questions, which

if people understand what we are doing and why.  Finally, it’s important for us to hear 

perspectives and experiences from a wide range of participants in the economy.  This 

club stands for free and open communication, and so does the Federal Reserve.

inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP--fell more than 4 percent from the 

end of 2007 to the middle of 2009.  One of the hardest-hit industries was manufacturing,
