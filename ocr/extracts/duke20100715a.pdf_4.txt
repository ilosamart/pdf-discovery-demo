 We have gathered this morning an impressive array of panelists representing a 

spectrum of vantage points.  We look forward to the comments of our panelists today and 

at the upcoming hearings in San Francisco, Chicago, and Washington.  This input, 

together with written comments submitted from the public, will be carefully considered 

as we consider changes to Regulation C.
