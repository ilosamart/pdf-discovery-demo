Institutional Credibility at Stake 

Monetary accommodation from the world’s largest central banks remains extraordinary.  

Policy decisions made in response to the global financial crisis resulted in dramatic changes in 

the size and composition of central bank balance sheets.  The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 

has nearly tripled, including about $1.2 trillion of new mortgage-related securities, matched by a 

rise in excess reserve balances.  

Yet, the Federal Reserve’s most significant asset, like many other central banks, is not on 

its swollen balance sheet.  Neither can it be found in the lengthy footnotes of its audited financial 

statements.  Nor is it tucked away in the recesses of the Federal Reserve Act, like the long-

dormant, now renowned, section 13(3). 

The Fed’s greatest asset is its institutional credibility.  This institutional credibility is 

rooted in its inflation-fighting credibility, but it is broader still.2  It is tied up in the full range of 

Fed actions and balance sheet commitments.  This credibility is essential.  It increases the heft of 

our communications.  It gives weight to our economic assessments.  It amplifies the effect of 

announced changes in the short-term policy rate on longer-term rates.  It is, in some sense, the 

real money multiplier in the conduct of policy. 

  Given its immense value, we should not forget that the Federal Reserve’s hard-earned 

credibility is no birthright.  It is as much nurture as nature.  It was earned by our predecessors in 

the conduct of their duties, making considered judgments consistent with the statutory mandate 

of price stability and maximum employment.  Fortunately, for the asset to be burnished and 

bestowed upon the current crop of central bankers, it did not demand perfect clairvoyance or 

                                                            
2 In the economics literature, central bank credibility generally refers to its reputation for being more averse to 
inflation than the fiscal authority.  The broad consensus is that credibility along this dimension allows better 
economic outcomes.  Credibility anchors inflation expectations, which in turn allows the central bank to keep actual 
inflation in check.  See Ben S. Bernanke (2005), “What Have We Learned since October 1979?” Federal Reserve
