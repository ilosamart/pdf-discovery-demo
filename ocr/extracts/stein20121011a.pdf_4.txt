the federal funds rate were at, say, 3 percent, we would have, in my view, an open-and-

shut case for reducing it. 

The complication, of course, is that the federal funds rate is essentially at its lower 

bound, which means that we cannot do more simply by turning that dial further.  Instead, 

we have to use unconventional tools, such as LSAPs and guidance about the future path 

of the federal funds rate. 

With respect to LSAPs, my belief--which echoes the views expressed by 

Chairman Bernanke at Jackson Hole--is that past rounds of LSAPs have played a 

significant role in supporting economic activity and in preventing a worrisome 

undershoot of the Committeeâ€™s inflation objective.  The case is especially strong with 

respect to the first round of LSAPs, which was a very potent policy action that helped to 

bring the economy back from the brink in 2009. 

 However, we now face a harder set of questions--not about the value of past 

LSAPs, but about the marginal benefits and costs of further LSAPs.  A number of 

observers have raised concerns about diminishing returns, or escalating costs.  I think 

that, at least in the limit, these concerns must be right; we could in principle push this tool 

to the point that the hurdle for additional usage would become very high.  As 

policymakers, it is our responsibility to be as clear as possible about the nature of the 

costs and benefits, and how they might evolve.  In that spirit, I will try in what follows to 

outline the mechanisms that can give rise to decreasing marginal efficacy of LSAPs, or to 

increasing marginal costs.  

While much of my discussion will focus on the direct hydraulic effects of LSAPs 

on the economy, it should be emphasized that their overall impact may be augmented via
