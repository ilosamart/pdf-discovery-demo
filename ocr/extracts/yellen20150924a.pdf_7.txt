An unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of 

labor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust 

to movements in the overall level of prices.  Survey data suggest that this effect is 

probably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8  In the longer run, 

however, real wages--that is, wages adjusted for inflation--appear to be largely 

independent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by 

productivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors.  In support of this view, 

figure 3 shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long 

periods of time.   

Inflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that 

have been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years.  The most 

important cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bankâ€™s ability to combat 

recessions.  Normally, the FOMC fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal 

federal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight.  These 

reductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term 

real interest rates--that is, nominal rates adjusted for inflation--and improving financial 

conditions more broadly.  But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates 

cannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in 

securities.9  Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is 

essentially the negative value of the inflation rate.  As a result, the Federal Reserve has

9 Because of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are 
willing to pay a premium to hold short-term government securities or bank deposits instead.  As a result, 
several foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat 
below zero.
