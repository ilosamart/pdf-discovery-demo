conflict between financial stability and short-term economic stabilization.

contrasts with the MPC’s eight meetings a year.34 The lower frequency of meetings may 

also reflect the desirability of a relatively stable regulatory structure; financial tools likely 

should not be as continuously data dependent as monetary policy tools.

It is clear that the U.K. institutional framework for the preservation of financial 

stability has much to be said for it.  But it also seems clear that there is no uniquely 

optimal set-up of the framework for the maintenance of financial stability that is 

independent of the size and scale of the financial system of the country or of its political 

and financial history.

Conclusion

It has been more than 20 years since the Bank of England celebrated its 300th 

birthday with a conference focused on central bank independence.  Since then, central 

banks’ operating frameworks have undergone substantial changes, many in response to 

the financial crisis. But the case for monetary policy independence set out in the 1990s 

remains sound, and monetary policy independence is now widely accepted in the United 

Kingdom, as it long has been in the United States.  It is also clear that central bank
