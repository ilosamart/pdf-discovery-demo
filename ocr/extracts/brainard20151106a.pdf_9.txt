Cumulative asset purchases averaged a little over $1 trillion per program, which 

econometric estimates suggest contributed to sizable reductions in term premiums 

embedded in long-term yields and a downward shift in the expected path of the federal 

funds rate.  Similarly, in 2013, the Bank of Japan announced asset purchases at an annual 

pace of about 50 trillion yen and committed to continuing these purchases until inflation 

had moved up to 2 percent.  The European Central Bank, at the beginning of this year, 

committed to buying 60 billion euros of assets each month at least through September of 

next year, or until inflation is on a path to get to close to 2 percent.  In all of these cases, 

the policy actions themselves were large and designed to generate a significant easing in 

overall financial conditions, and the announcement effect likely was amplified because 

the policy reaction function around the zero lower bound was not well known and hence 

was difficult to anticipate.  

International Coordination of Unconventional Monetary Policy 

The intense debates over cross-border spillovers of unconventional monetary 

policy during the crisis naturally elicited calls for global coordination of monetary policy 

to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor actions that could undermine growth globally.  Recognizing 

the practical limitations of such proposals, in 2013, the Group of Seven (G-7) instead 

adopted a more circumscribed but achievable set of commitments.  Each member 

committed that its monetary policy settings--unconventional as well as conventional--

would be oriented to meeting its “respective domestic objectives using domestic 

instruments,” and “not target[ing] exchange rates.”6  This agreement ensured that actions
