be sustainable without creating franchise value, and worry that the creation of franchise value 

through limiting entry into securitization would, in their words, “limit the amount of money 

created.”  Yet, as I suggested earlier, the G-M proposal itself might constrain securitization in 

undesirable ways, both related and unrelated to repo transactions.   

In addressing the franchise value issue, it would be interesting to pursue an important 

idea that G-M mention, but which is not at the center of their proposal: making the repo 

bankruptcy exception available only where the collateral conforms to certain criteria established 

by law or regulation.  Given the demand for repo funding, it seems worth considering whether 

this device could be used to create the necessary franchise value.  Indeed, if this approach had 

promise, it might be feasible for a regulatory body to establish the requisite criteria without 

providing insurance.  With or without insurance, the “franchise value” might attach more to the 

instrument than to an institution. 

 There is not time here to enumerate the potential difficulties with these ideas, but they 

are not hard to discern, even as stated in such skeletal form.  In common with the G-M proposal, 

they would require a level of expertise and involvement in credit rating by the government that 

could pose practical and, in some conceivable alternatives, policy concerns.  In any case, these 

are thoughts for further discussion, rather than developed options.  Gary Gorton and Andrew 

Metrick have, in setting forth this proposal, continued to shape our understanding of the role and 

risks of the shadow banking system, as well as to add a specific proposal to our menu of possible 

responses.
