I had some experience with these issues while at the Bank of Israel.  In Israel, 

three separate regulators deal with different aspects of macroprudential policy, but there 

is no formal financial stability committee.  The Bank of Israel is also the supervisor of 

banks, so has considerable power over housing finance, which essentially is available 

only from the banks.  Starting in 2010, the Bank of Israel adopted several 

macroprudential measures to address rapidly rising house prices, including higher capital 

requirements and provisioning against mortgages; limits to the share of any housing 

financing package indexed to the short-term (central bank) interest rate to one-third of the 

total loan, with the remainder of the package having to be linked to either the five-year 

real or five-year nominal interest rate; and, on different occasions, limits to the loan-to-

value (LTV) and payment-to-income (PTI) ratios.  Additional precautionary measures 

were also implemented in the supervision of banks.   

The success of these policies was mixed. The limit of one-third on the share of 

any housing loan indexed to the short rate substantially raised the cost of housing finance 

and was the most successful of the measures.  Increases in both the LTV and PTI ratios 

were moderately successful.  Increasing capital charges and risk weights appeared to 

have little impact in practice.   

This experience led me to three conclusions on the effectiveness of 

macroprudential policies.  First, we were very cautious in using these new tools because 

we did not have good estimates of their strength and effectiveness.  Quite possibly, we 

should have acted more boldly on several occasions.  Second, use of these tools is likely 

to be unpopular, for housing is a sensitive topic in almost every country.  And third, 

coordination among different regulators and authorities can be complicated.
