 Runs and panics are the defining characteristic of a financial crisis, transforming debt 

problems that might themselves have produced a drag on the economy into a classic adverse 

feedback loop with more devastating consequences.  It is important to note that the short-term 

funding or immediately redeemable investments that can run when a shock hits are likely to have 

contributed to the vulnerability of relevant asset classes to those shocks.  The very short-term 

nature of the transaction reduces the incentives of counterparties to evaluate carefully the loan or 

investment they are making.  If you can refuse to roll over your repo tomorrow, why be too 

concerned about whether the underlying collateral may prove to be overvalued a few months 

later?  Consequently, funds may flow into asset classes with less sensitivity to information 

relevant to the value of the assets, driving asset values up and lending standards down, until the 

moment at which negative information becomes so powerful that everyone wants out at once. 

 Thus, in deciding where--from a prudential viewpoint--to concentrate analysis and policy 

initiatives within the broad universe of activities that can be described by the term shadow 

banking, it seems to me that the presence of runnable funding is the key, though perhaps not the 

only consideration.3  To be sure, this kind of funding remains at levels well below those 

prevailing before the crisis, as many of the more damaging mechanisms of that period--such as 

the infamous structured investment vehicles (SIVs)--have disappeared.  Moreover, the largest 

broker-dealers, both domestic and foreign, that were so dependent on short-term funding in the 

                                                           
3 Funding considerations are most relevant where funding is needed for an intermediaryâ€™s existing balance sheet of 
longer-term assets, since forced sales are the most likely alternative.  But they may also be useful in thinking about 
forms of non-bank credit in which the intermediary has only a small balance sheet of its own and essentially relies 
on external funding either to buy the loans directly or to fund them until they can be sold to other investors.  The 
potential fragility of such a business model in recessionary periods could be of concern if it had come to occupy a 
large part of the market for certain forms of lending.  In these circumstances, the withdrawal of these kinds of 
lenders could leave a hole that insured depository institutions--with their stickier funding sources and required 
capital levels--might not be able to fill completely.  The result could be the unavailability of credit for borrowers that 
were creditworthy even in less favorable economic times.
