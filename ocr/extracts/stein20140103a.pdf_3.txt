narrow-banking proposals, whereby bank-created money is backed by very safe liquid 

assets, such as Treasury bills.

A second class of theories emphasizes the asset side of banks’ balance sheets and 

their role as delegated monitors in the lending process.

  Here banks are seen as a 

mechanism for dealing with the information and incentive problems that would otherwise 

make it difficult for credit to be extended to opaque borrowers such as small businesses.  

Because this work is silent on the precise structure of the liability side, it does not draw 

much of a distinction between banks and other, nonbank lending intermediaries, such as 

finance companies. 

Finally, a third class of theories explicitly addresses the question of what ties 

together the asset and liability sides of banks’ balance sheets--that is, why do the same 

institutions that create private money choose to back their safe claims by investing in 

loans and other relatively illiquid assets?

  What is the nature of the synergy between the 

two activities? 

Our work fits into this third category, with two twists relative to previous 

research.  First, we stress the fact that on the asset side, banks hold not only loans, but 

like their shadow-banking counterparts, they also hold securities, often in very substantial 

amounts.  Moreover, these securities holdings have a particular pattern.  Banks tend to 

stay away from the safest and most liquid securities, such as Treasury securities, and

 Diamond and Dybvig (1983) is the classic reference in this area.  They argue that banks allow households 

that are unsure of the timing of their consumption needs to more efficiently invest in long-lived projects.  

Other papers include Diamond and Rajan (2001), who suggest that the fragility inherent in runnable deposit 

finance acts as a useful disciplinary device for bank management, and Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002), 

who emphasize the similarities between deposits and loan commitments, and the cost savings that accrue to 

an institution that offers both products.
