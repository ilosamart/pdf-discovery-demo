others are confident enough about their prospects to leave jobs voluntarily--even before 

they have landed their next job.   

While the data I have discussed thus far do point to a tight labor market, other 

data are less definitive.  The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage 

of working age individuals who are either working or actively looking for a job, has 

remained steady for about four years (figure 6).  This flat performance is actually a sign 

of improvement, since increased retirements as our population ages have been putting 

downward pressure on participation and will continue to do so.  However, the 

participation rate of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 54) has not 

recovered fully to its pre-recession level, suggesting that there might still be room to pull 

more people into the labor force (figure 7).  Indeed, the strong job market does appear to 

be drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time.  

For example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force after previously 

reporting that they were not working because of a disability has increased over the past 

couple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to 

take on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6   

Wage growth has also remained moderate, though it has picked up compared with 

its pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8).  Weak productivity growth is an 

important reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years.  At the same 

time, the absence of a sharper acceleration in wages suggests that the labor market is not 

excessively tight.  I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor 

market strengthens further.
