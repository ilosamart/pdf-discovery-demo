serve as the cornerstone of the global regulatory effort to safeguard the stability of the 

world’s financial system.    

Both in the United States and in Europe, some parts of the reform agenda will 

take longer to complete.  For example, I note the ongoing progress toward achieving one 

of the most ambitious and important regulatory goals: the creation of a European banking 

union.  It is clear that this challenging project will be the work of many years; indeed, it is 

not for an American to educate Europeans on the challenges of international cooperation.  

But the importance of this project for Europe’s future is equally clear.  The recent 

agreement on harmonizing national resolution regimes is an important achievement, and 

a milestone on the road to longer-term goals such as a single, centralized resolution 

authority. 

Another reform that will take time to complete is the establishment of a global 

framework for resolving large, systemically important banks.  Work to enable resolution 

of such institutions with diverse cross-border operations is especially important, and 

especially daunting.  The challenge is not so much to allow such institutions to fail, but 

rather to contain their failure so that it does not inflict enormous collateral damage on 

innocent bystanders and the broader economy.  As many of you know, in the United 

States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is developing a preferred approach to 

resolution for such rare cases: the single-point-of-entry (SPOE) approach.  This approach 

may be gaining some traction internationally.  In my view, SPOE can be a classic 

“simplifier,” making theoretically possible something that seemed impossibly complex. 

Under the SPOE approach, the home country resolution authority for a failing 

banking firm would effect a creditor-funded parent company recapitalization of the failed
