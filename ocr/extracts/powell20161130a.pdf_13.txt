communications tools have made the process more transparent to the public.  In this 

sense, the dot plot is more messenger than message. 

Cacophony 

I often hear that there are too many voices offering too much diversity of views 

about the likely path of policy—the cacophony problem.  Reserve Bank Presidents and 

Governors are expected to publicly discuss their views on the economy and policy.  

Indeed, our policy on the external communications of FOMC participants states that “the 

Committee’s public accountability is strengthened by open discussion of Committee 

participants’ views about the economic outlook as well as their judgments about the 

appropriate course of monetary policy.”24  Central banking often comes across as obscure 

and complicated, and we try to help the public understand what we do.  But there is more 

to it than that.  Jon Faust’s paper captures well the framers’ vision of an institutionalized 

diversity of perspectives.  In my view, the public expression of our diverse views helps 

sustain public support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution.  Those members of 

the public who disagree with our policy should know that their concerns are given voice 

in our deliberations.  But there is a tradeoff here that needs to be managed:  On the one 

hand, the effectiveness of policy is thought to depend on the public’s understanding of 

the Committee’s consensus.  On the other hand, the expression of diverse views may 

sometimes make it difficult for the public to see that consensus. 

Jon sees this public discussion about policy as mainly a form of negotiation.  In 

my view, motivations are simpler and more obvious.  Many of us enjoy getting out of the
