run off in the background at the gradual pace that was announced.  We would primarily 

look to ongoing adjustments in the federal funds rate to calibrate the stance of monetary 

policy as economic conditions evolve. 

Once balance sheet normalization is under way, I will be looking closely at the 

evolution of inflation before making a determination about further adjustments to the 

federal funds rate.  We have been falling short of our inflation objective not just in the 

past year, but over a longer period as well.  My own view is that we should be cautious 

about tightening policy further until we are confident inflation is on track to achieve our 

target.   

Unless we expect inflation to move quickly back toward target--or there are 

indications that the short-run neutral rate has moved up further--a variety of empirical 

estimates suggest we could approach neutral without too many additional rate increases.  

Many forecasters assume that the neutral rate of interest is very low currently, and that it 

is likely to be low relative to historical norms in the longer run.12  For example, the well-

known Laubach-Williams model currently suggests an estimate of the longer-run neutral 

federal funds rate that is actually slightly below zero.13  And in the most recent Summary 

of Economic Projections (SEP), the median longer-run nominal federal funds rate was 

3 percent, which implies the long-run real federal funds rate would only be 1 percent, 

lower than its average in the decades before then of around 2Â½ percent.14

trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation--averaged 2-1/2 percent.
