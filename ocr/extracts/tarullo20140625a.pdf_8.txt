test, including information about the types of models we use.7  We solicited comments on our 

design framework for scenarios in 2012, and incorporated into the final document some of the 

ideas we received--such as providing more information about the economic and financial 

conditions represented by paths of the variables in the scenarios.8  And this past spring, we 

published the additional set of stress test results that described how the firms would perform 

under the adverse scenario, in addition to the results of the severely adverse scenario, which we 

had previously released.9   

Because bank portfolios are often quite opaque and thus difficult for outsiders to value, 

this information should allow investors, counterparties, analysts, and markets more generally to 

make more informed judgments on the condition of U.S. banking institutions.  Coupled with 

other regulatory measures, this transparency should in turn increase market discipline.  This level 

of transparency also subjects us to greater outside scrutiny and analysis, a process that increases 

our accountability as regulators and helps us improve our assumptions and methodology over 

time.  These choices for greater transparency in the supervisory stress tests and CCAR have 

prompted healthy discussion on the merits of disclosure in other supervisory areas.   

As I think everyone in this audience knows, we have not disclosed the supervisory 

models themselves.  We do not want firms simply to copy our modeling in their own assessment 

of risks and capital needs.  And we certainly do not want them to construct their portfolios in an 

effort to game the model--a kind of analogue to teaching to a test.  But even though we do not 

publicly release the models, we have put systems in place to ensure oversight and accountability.
