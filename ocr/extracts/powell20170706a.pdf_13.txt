Second, memories of the crisis are fading.  If Congress does not enact reforms over the next few 

years, we are at risk of settling for the status quo--a government-dominated mortgage market 

with insufficient private capital to protect taxpayers, and insufficient competition to drive 

innovation.  There is a serious risk, if not a likelihood, that this state of affairs may persist 

indefinitely, leaving our housing finance system in a semi-permanent limbo.  Fortunately, we are 

blessed with a growing menu of reform options available for public vetting.  And there appear to 

be areas of broad agreement among them.  One of those plans, or a combination of different 

features of various plans, might well suffice to move us to a better system.  Housing finance 

reform will protect taxpayers from another bailout, be good for households and the economy, and 

go some distance toward mitigating the systemic risk that the GSEs still pose.
