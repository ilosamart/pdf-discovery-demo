Nearly four decades have elapsed since the demise of Bretton Woods, and during 

that time, the international monetary and financial system has undergone a significant 

transformation.  The changes that have occurred reflect deliberate policy choices by the 

official sector as well as the organic interactions of investors, institutions, and advancing 

technologies.  Judging by the standards of global economic growth, stable prices, and 

financial stability,  the international monetary and financial system, in its current 

incarnation, has a decidedly mixed record.  Wrenching crises and economic distress, 

notably including the difficult experience of the past several years, have punctuated 

periods of solid growth, low inflation, and financial stability.  Thus, the subject of today’s 

discussion is vitally important, and I am pleased to contribute my thoughts on steps we 

can take to improve our international economic order.1  

In evaluating our policy priorities, I find it helpful to distinguish between the 

international monetary system and the international financial system.2  The international 

monetary system is the set of rules, conventions, and institutions associated with 

monetary policy, official capital flows, and exchange rates.  It also includes mechanisms 

to provide official sector support to countries facing funding pressures.  The international 

financial system is much broader, encompassing both private and official participants in 

global financial markets.  I consider this distinction important in thinking about how to 

reduce the incidence and severity of future crises while preserving a prosperous global 

economy.
