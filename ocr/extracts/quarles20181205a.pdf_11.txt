communities are growing at a healthy pace, and growing communities need banks.  It is my hope 

that the opportunity for the future that this population growth suggests will support the local 

banks that communities need to thrive.

streamlining regulations and reducing the regulatory burden on smaller and regional banks.   

The Fed, along with the other banking agencies, recently proposed a community bank 

leverage ratio that is designed to simplify significantly the standards banks must abide by for 

holding capital.11  As a result, qualifying community banks will only need to calculate and meet 

a single measure of capital adequacy, rather than multiple measures.  We have also proposed a 

reduction in the burden of reporting requirements for community banks, and expect soon to 

propose an exemption for community banks to the Volcker rule.12  For a subset of the smallest

course, while the holding companies of community banks may be eligible for an exemption from capital rules, the 
subsidiary banks are still subject to capital requirements.
