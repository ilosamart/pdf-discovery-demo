The range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is wide, and the 

historical record provides ample grounds for humility.8  A middle-ground position that 

seems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held 

down by cyclical factors and lingering effects of the crisis.  As those factors dissipate, 

labor productivity growth should move up to 1-1/2 percent or so, the lower end of its 

longer-run range.   

In addition to productivity, the other principal factor in potential output is labor 

supply, which is determined by the working-age population, the natural rate of 

unemployment, and the trend labor force participation rate.  Both the natural rate of 

unemployment and labor force participation initially appeared to suffer crisis-related 

damage.  But more recent data are a bit more encouraging.   

The natural rate of unemployment reflects the matching of characteristics that 

employers are seeking with those of the unemployed.  With the dramatic labor market 

dislocations of the crisis, it was not surprising to see measures of matching efficiency 

deteriorate, and many observers raised their estimates of the natural rate accordingly.  But 

there are other factors, such as demographic change, that may have led to a decline in the 

natural rate of unemployment.9  Blue Chip forecastersâ€™ estimate of the natural rate have 

now returned to around 5 percent, about the same as before the crisis, suggesting that

Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.  See Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth:  
The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press); and Erik

Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York:  W.W. Norton).
