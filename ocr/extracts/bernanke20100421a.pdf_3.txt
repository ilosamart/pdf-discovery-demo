businesses and consumers all over the world to raise awareness about the new design and explain 

how to use its security features.  This global public education program is crucial to the successful 

introduction of the new $100 note, because a well-informed public is our first and best line of 

defense against counterfeiting. 

 It is important to understand that when this new-design $100 note is issued on February 

10, 2011, the approximately 6.5 billion older-design $100s already in circulation will remain 

legal tender.  U.S. currency users should know they will not have to trade in their older design 

notes when the new ones begin circulating. 

 We look forward to working with you all on the successful introduction of this new $100 

note.  Thank you.
