Similarly, in bad times, unemployment is high and few jobs are available (vacancies are 

low).  Thus, the Beveridge curve, the relationship between unemployment and vacancies, 

is downward sloping. 

On the usual interpretation, a recession is a period in which the economy is 

moving down along the Beveridge curve; as output and the demand for labor fall, job 

vacancies decline and unemployment rises.  In contrast, changes in the structural 

determinants of unemployment are thought to be reflected in shifts of the Beveridge 

curve to the left or right.  For example, suppose that, because of changes in technology or 

in the mix of industries and jobs, the mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and 

the needs of employers worsens.  Then, for a given number of job openings, the number 

of the unemployed who are qualified for those jobs is smaller and the unemployment rate 

is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened.  Graphically, 

an increase in a skills mismatch would be reflected in a shift of the Beveridge curve up 

and to the right. 

From figure 14, we can see some outward shift in the relationship between job 

vacancies and unemployment, consistent with some increase in structural unemployment 

since the onset of the recession.  However, a more in-depth analysis of the evidence 

suggests that the apparent shift in the relationship between vacancies and unemployment 

is neither unusual for a recession nor likely to be persistent.  Research has found that 

during and immediately after the serious recessions of 1973 to 1975 and 1981 to 1982, 

the Beveridge curve also shifted outward, but in both cases it shifted back inward during 

the recovery.  This temporary outward shift during a deep recession may be the result of a 

particularly sharp increase in layoffs, which raises unemployment quickly, even as
