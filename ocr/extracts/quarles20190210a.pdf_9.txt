which to evaluate the relevant data.  One public measure of whether we are doing this review 

process well will be whether we recommend any improvements or revisions on the basis of it.  In 

any system as complex and consequential as the body of post-crisis financial regulations, there 

will always be aspects--and sometimes material aspects--that can be improved on the basis of 

experience and analysis.  A credible review process that is both rigorous and dispassionate will 

find a few. 

Last year, the FSB completed the first two evaluations under its framework, of the effects 

of reform on infrastructure fin ance and the clearing of derivative contracts.  We are currently 

engaged in work examining the effects of reforms on the financing of small and medium 

enterprises, which are the lifeblood of many of the worldâ€™s economies.  We will consult publicly 

on the findings of this evaluation in June, ahead of the G20 Summit in Osaka.  And we are in the 

process of launching an important study on the effects of reforms aimed at ending too big to fail. 

This evaluation is being led by Claudia Buch, vice president of the Deutsche Bundesbank.  

Conclusion 

 This is an important time for the FSB.  We are nearing completion of the post-crisis 

reform agenda, a major accomplishment.  With that comes the opportunity to turn our focus to 

ways in which we can improve the FSB and prepare it for the next phase of its existence.  We 

will work diligently to enhance our transparency and to expand our efforts to reach out to as 

many stakeholders as possible.  We will prepare for the next crisis by making sure that our 

framework to assess vulnerabilities to financial stability is state of the art and remains so going 

forward.  And, we will work hard to maintain the important reforms in place, ensure they are 

working as intended, and, where possible, improve them.
