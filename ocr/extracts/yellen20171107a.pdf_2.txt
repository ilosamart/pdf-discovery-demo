Thank you for the honor of sharing this award with such a worthy person, my 

friend and former colleague Ben Bernanke, and also for the honor of being associated 

with the exemplary life and legacy of Paul Douglas. 

Sen. Douglas’s contributions to ethics in government are an important aspect of 

that legacy, but since Ben and I are the first economists to win this award, I would also 

like to give due credit to Professor Douglas for his contributions to economics. 

 Working with the mathematician Charles Cobb, Douglas gathered data and 

created a statistical model that advanced economists’ understanding of the relative 

contributions to production made by capital and labor.  This work demonstrated many of 

the methods that economists would come to use and continue to use to this day.  Douglas 

constructed empirical measures of key economic concepts.  He then employed what were, 

for the time, advanced statistical techniques to analyze these data, thereby shedding light 

on a basic economic relationship.  As one recent commentator put it, work such as 

Douglas’s was part of “a growing literature , , , [that] played an important role in shaping 

the approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become 

the standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th century.”1 

But, of course, Paul Douglas was much more than an economist.  From an early 

age, he always seemed to be the man in the middle, seen by the two sides of a dispute as 

intelligent, knowledgeable, and impartial enough to be trusted to seek a solution.  He 

mediated labor disputes and advised local government officials in Illinois.  He also 

helped governors in Pennsylvania and New York develop what became Social Security, 

unemployment insurance, and the idea of publicly owned power utilities.  After losing his
