2014--the earliest date consistent with the FOMC’s current forward guidance of “exceptionally 

low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”   

Although simple rules provide a useful starting point in determining appropriate policy, 

they by no means deserve the “last word”--especially in current circumstances.  An alternative 

approach, also illustrated in figure 10, is to compute an “optimal control” path for the federal 

funds rate using an economic model--FRB/US, in this case.  Such a path is chosen to minimize 

the value of a specific “loss function” conditional on a baseline forecast of economic conditions.  

The loss function attempts to quantify the social costs resulting from deviations of inflation from 

the Committee’s longer-run goal and from deviations of unemployment from its longer-run 

normal rate.19  The solid green line with dots in figure 10 shows the “optimal control” path for 

the federal funds rate, again conditioned on the illustrative baseline outlook.20  This policy 

involves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until late 2015, four quarters longer than the 

balanced-approach rule prescription and several years longer than the Taylor rule.  Importantly, 

optimal control calls for a later lift-off date even though this benchmark--unlike the simple 

policy rules--implicitly takes full account of the additional stimulus to real activity and inflation 

                                                            
19 Under this approach, the central bank’s plans are assumed to be completely transparent and credible to the public.  
In particular, both the policymaker and private agents are assumed to act as if they have perfect foresight about the 
evolution of the economy, including the future path of monetary policy, in that they ignore the possibility of 
unanticipated future shocks to the economy.  This assumption of “certainty equivalence” is commonly used but is 
not an intrinsic feature of optimal control techniques.  Indeed, the fully optimal policy under uncertainty involves the 
specification of a complete set of state-contingent policy paths. 
20 This procedure involves two steps.  First, the FRB/US model’s projections of real activity, inflation, and interest 
rates are adjusted to replicate the baseline forecast values.  Second, a search procedure is used to solve for the path 
of the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of an assumed loss function, allowing for feedback of changes in 
the federal funds rate from baseline to real activity and inflation.  For the purposes of the exercise, the loss function 
is equal to the cumulative discounted sum from 2012:Q2 through 2025:Q4 of three factors--the squared deviation of 
the unemployment rate from 5-1/2 percent, the squared deviation of overall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the 
squared quarterly change in the federal funds rate.  The third term is added to damp quarter-to-quarter movements in 
interest rates.
