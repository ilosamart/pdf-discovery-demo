Market liquidity is the ability to rapidly execute sizable securities transactions at a 

low cost and with a limited price impact.1  The high degree of liquidity in U.S. capital 

markets historically has contributed to the efficient allocation of capital through lower 

costs and a mix of bank- and market-based finance that supports the flexibility of these 

markets.2  Regulatory changes may have altered financial institutions’ incentive to 

provide liquidity, raising concerns brought into sharp relief by several “flash events” over 

the past few years.  At the same time, any changes in observed liquidity are also likely 

accompanied by other related changes--such as in technology--and a more complete 

assessment of these shifts is important when we think about the effects on liquidity of 

changes in financial regulations that were induced by the global financial crisis.3 

This afternoon, I will first review some of the concerns raised by market 

participants and others about market liquidity as well as highlight the challenges 

associated with finding clear evidence that substantiates these concerns.  I will then 

discuss whether potential impairment of liquidity might exacerbate problems related to 

fire sales and leverage.  Finally, I will make the case that any changes in market liquidity 

resulting from regulatory changes should be analyzed in the broader context of the 

overall safety of the financial system.  This perspective naturally emphasizes potential 

tradeoffs between the possibly adverse effect regulations may have on market liquidity 

and their positive effect on the stability of the financial system.
