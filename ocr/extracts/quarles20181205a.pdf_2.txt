It’s a pleasure to be here at Stanford, an honor to be invited to speak by SIEPR and the 

Bill Lane Center--two institutions for which I have long had fondness and respect--and a great 

luxury to have the chance to talk for an hour with a group of people who share my love for a part 

of the world we call the West.  Most of my day job enmeshes me, of necessity, in either broad 

systemic questions of global financial stability or the impossibly arcane minutiae of our 

convoluted and labyrinthine financial regulatory system.  Both of those are perfectly worthy 

occupations but inescapably require a relentlessly global outlook.  Yet my first intellectual 

passion as a very young man was for the history and life of a specific part of the world--the 

Western United States, as place and idea.  Your own presence here in the audience suggests that 

many of you have been moved at some point in your life, as I have been, by the words of 

Wallace Stegner: 

If there is such a thing as being conditioned by climate and geography, and I think there 
is, it is the West that has conditioned me.  It has the forms and lights and colors that I 
respond to in nature and in art.  If there is a western speech, I speak it; if there is a 
western character or personality, I am some variant of it; if there is a western culture in 
the small-c, anthropological sense, I have not escaped it.1 
 
So, that is why I say it is a pleasure and an honor but most especially a luxury for me to 

speak to an audience that shares my concern for and love of the West on the topic of how the 

preoccupations of my day job--banking and finance--affect this particular part of the world.  We 

all know that throughout the history of the West, banking and finance have played an important 

role as vital infrastructure for the economy.  That remains true today, although it is often 

overlooked in the traditional litany of issues critical to the West.  A strong banking industry is 

necessary for households and businesses to engage in the spending, saving, and investment that 

constitute economic activity, and one of the purposes of financial regulation is to ensure that
