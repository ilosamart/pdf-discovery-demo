We will be implementing the specific stress testing requirements of Dodd-Frank over the 

next year.  However, in the interim we are using a modified form of stress testing as part of the 

annual capital planning process we have established for large bank holding companies.  This 

process goes well beyond a stress testing exercise.  It requires firms to project their capital needs 

and plans on a firm-specific basis, as well as with reference to more standardized stress 

scenarios.  It also allows us to review the safety and soundness of the firm's capital position, 

including any plans it has for distributions of capital.  As you will recall, in the absence of such a 

capital review, some companies engaged in ill-advised, inappropriate capital distributions in the 

period immediately preceding the financial crisis, leaving them less able to absorb the losses that 

ensued.   

We conducted a capital plan review early this year for the 19 firms that had been 

involved in the 2009 stress test.  In just a few weeks, we will begin the 2012 review.  This 

process integrates stress testing and decisions about capital adequacy and possible capital 

distributions.  It also gives supervisors insight into the risk measurement and risk management 

capabilities of the firms.  We are close to issuing a final regulation that will contain the basic 

structure for this annual exercise.   

The rule would extend this formal capital planning to all bank holding companies with 

$50 billion or more in assets.  The comments received on the proposed regulation issued in June 

have been useful in crafting the final rule.  I expect that the final rule would, among other things, 

respond to the concern of some firms that the timing of the first capital planning process did not 

provide for appropriate capital distributions in the first quarter of the succeeding calendar year.  

Clarifications of some other issues that arose in the 2011 capital review will be addressed in the 

documentation for the 2012 exercise--such as describing with more specificity what constitutes
