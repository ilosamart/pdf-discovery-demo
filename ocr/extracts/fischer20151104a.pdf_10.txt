The Federal Reserve’s accountability structure has been largely stable since the 

1970s reforms.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve has greatly augmented its public 

communications about its economic outlook and its policy strategy.  Over the past 

20 years, this augmentation includes the release, beginning in 1994, of postmeeting 

statements explaining policy decisions.13  Other changes include the inclusion of roll call 

votes in the postmeeting statements in 2002; the release of the FOMC minutes three 

weeks after the meeting rather than following the subsequent meeting, beginning in 2005; 

the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections in 2007 and the inclusion in 

2012 of the “dot plot” showing FOMC participants’ federal funds rate projections; the 

Chair’s quarterly postmeeting press conferences in 2011; and the issuance in 2012 of the 

FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is 

reaffirmed every January.14   

This increased transparency has been a key complement to the Fed’s 

independence and accountability by regularly demonstrating that the Fed has been 

appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.  Transparency can also make monetary policy 

more effective by helping to guide the public’s expectations and clarify the Committee’s 

policy intentions.15 

                                                 
13 Prior to 1999, the FOMC released statements only after meetings at which the federal funds rate was 
changed.  Over time, the statements released by the FOMC have become more informative about the 
Committee’s views of the economy and policy. 
14 There are a number of additional transparency improvements that are less directly related to monetary 
policy communication, including detailed reports on liquidity facility and lending programs during the 
financial crisis, which can be found on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_reports.htm.  In addition, a full list of securities held in the 
System Open Market Account portfolio is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at 
www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html. 
15 Given the benefits of transparency, central banks around the world have also greatly augmented their 
public communications over the past 20 years.  Recent papers measuring transparency across central banks 
include Crowe and Meade (2008) and Dincer and Eichengreen (2014). Dincer and Eichengreen (2014) 
conclude that almost all of the central banks around the world had greater transparency in 2010 than they
