Of course, clearinghouses have been around for quite some time and have 

generally stood up well even in severe crises.6  But let’s look a little deeper at the risks.  

During the global financial crisis, governments around the world took extraordinary 

actions to shore up many of the large financial institutions that are also large clearing 

members.  While it is not possible to say with confidence what would have happened if 

these measures had not been taken, it is surely the case that whatever pressures CCPs 

faced would have been many times greater, and the potential consequences much greater 

as well.  Moreover, as CCPs grow into their enhanced role in the financial system, they 

will represent an ever larger locus for systemic risk.  It is therefore important not to be 

lulled into a false sense of security that past performance is a guarantee of future CCP 

success.   

After the crisis, governments firmly resolved that even the largest financial 

institutions must be allowed to fail and be resolved without taxpayer support and without 

threatening the broader financial system or the economy.  CCPs therefore need to adapt 

to a world in which their largest clearing members will be allowed to fail and to be 

resolved without taxpayer support.  And, as I will discuss a little later, the same is true of 

CCPs--they, too, should have no expectation of taxpayer support if they fail.  To say it as 

plainly as possible, the purpose of all of this new infrastructure and regulation is not to 

facilitate the orderly bailout of a CCP in the next crisis.  Quite to the contrary, CCPs and
