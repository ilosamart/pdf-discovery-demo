In sum, the central tendency of FOMC participant projections for the 

unemployment rate at the end of 2016 is 5.2 to 5.6 percent, and for inflation the central 

tendency is 1.7 to 2 percent. 2  If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would 

be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price 

stability for the first time in nearly a decade.  I find this baseline outlook quite plausible.  

Of course, if the economy obediently followed our forecasts, the job of central 

bankers would be a lot easier and their speeches would be a lot shorter.  Alas, the 

economy is often not so compliant, so I will ask your indulgence for a few more minutes.  

Three Big Questions for the FOMC 

Because the course of the economy is uncertain, monetary policymakers need to 

carefully watch for signs that it is diverging from the baseline outlook and then respond 

in a systematic way.  Let me turn first to monitoring and discuss three questions I believe 

are likely to loom large in the FOMC’s ongoing assessment of where we are on the path 

back to maximum employment and price stability. 

Is there still significant slack in the labor market? 

The first question concerns the extent of slack in the labor market.  One of the 

FOMC’s objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment, but exactly what 

conditions are consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess.  Thus far 

in the recovery and to this day, there is little question that the economy has remained far 

from maximum employment, so measurement difficulties were not our focus.  But as the 

attainment of our maximum employment goal draws nearer, it will be necessary for the
