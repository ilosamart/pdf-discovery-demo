domestic saving, as domestic expenditures became increasingly reliant on borrowing from 

abroad.2

The counterpart to the rising U.S. deficit was a surge in the current account surpluses of 

other countries.  In some Asian emerging market economies, current account surpluses arose as 

domestic investment collapsed after the financial crisis of the late 1990s, and domestic demand 

in those countries never recovered enough to absorb their strong saving.  For China, investment 

spending was very strong, but it was outpaced by even greater increases in saving, reflecting, 

among other factors, the weak social safety net and an underdeveloped financial sector.  In these 

countries, economic growth heavily depended on external demand, in part reflecting policies to 

keep exchange rates artificially low through intervention in currency markets.  To some extent, 

the resulting rapid accumulation of official reserves was welcomed as a buffer against the 

possibility of another sudden reversal of capital flows, as had occurred in the 1990s.  But by 

resisting appreciation of their currencies, these countries, to some degree, circumvented the usual 

balancing mechanism for economies that run increasingly large current account surpluses.  

Germany and Japan significantly depended on exports as a source of economic growth and ran 

large current account surpluses as well.  Finally, surpluses of oil exporters rose sharply with the 

escalation in oil prices, as their spending lagged rapid income gains.   


As a result of this pattern of surpluses and deficits, capital flowed strongly to the United 

States from rapidly growing emerging market economies and some advanced economies.  

Observers feared that, at some point, investors would decide they had enough dollar assets in 

their portfolios and pull back abruptly from financing the burgeoning U.S. current account 

                                                           
2 By 2006, the personal saving rate in the United States had declined to 2-1/2 percent, well below the 8 percent 
average between 1975 and 1995.  The U.S. federal fiscal balance moved from a surplus of 2-1/2 percent of GDP in 
2000 to a deficit of almost 2 percent in 2006.
