Thank you so much for being here.  It’s great to be home with so many friends, 

former colleagues, and former customers, and all of you who make Hampton Roads such 

a great place to live and do business.  I am truly honored to receive the Economic Impact 

award from the Economics Club of Hampton Roads, joining such company as Paul 

Sarbanes, former senator from Maryland and coauthor of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and 

Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  By 

honoring me, you recognize the extraordinary work of all the talented, knowledgeable, 

and dedicated men and women of the Federal Reserve System.  So I would like to take 

this opportunity to express my admiration for the Fed staff and my colleagues on the 

Board of Governors, especially Chairman Ben Bernanke.  I witnessed firsthand the 

leadership, the concern for the U.S. economy, and the political courage the chairman 

displayed as he led us through this tumultuous time.  I wholeheartedly believe that 

without the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to fight the financial crisis, our financial 

system would have frozen and the outcome for the economy would have been 

unthinkable.  It is hard to believe that it has only been 18 months since I left here.  So I 

thought I would tell you a little about what I have been doing. 

 I was officially sworn in as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System on August 4, 2008, at 8 o’clock in the morning.  Just a half hour later, I 

attended my first meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  (The 

FOMC, composed of the Board of Governors and the 12 Federal Reserve Bank 

presidents, is the body that makes decisions about interest rates and other aspects of 

monetary policy.)  Six weeks later I attended my second FOMC meeting.  Normally, the 

Board of Governors convenes right after the FOMC meeting for a quick vote on Reserve
