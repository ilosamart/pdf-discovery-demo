sizes and business models.  We should consider whether assessment areas also should be 

tailored to the business models employed by banks. 

Third, any redesign of CRA regulations should be done with the goal of 

encouraging banks to seek out opportunities in underserved areas.  This is not simply a 

question of expanding a bank’s assessment area, but of providing more incentives for 

banks to more effectively address the needs in neighborhoods that they may already be 

serving with branches.  For example, there are concerns that distortions may lead some 

areas to become credit hot spots, while others become credit deserts.  Investments, such 

as Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, are in such high demand in some areas that there is 

little return on investment, while it is difficult to find investors in other areas.  We believe 

that it is important for revisions to CRA regulations to address this type of market 

distortion to promote more lending and investment in smaller markets within a bank’s 

footprint. 

Fourth, the Federal Reserve is interested in promoting greater consistency and 

predictability in CRA evaluations and ratings.  We see the value of clearer definitions and 

metrics that use publicly available information to identify local credit needs and 

opportunities.   

Finally, it is important to recognize that the CRA is one of several mutually 

reinforcing laws.  The central thrust of the CRA is to encourage banks to ensure that all 

creditworthy borrowers have fair access to credit.  For banks to be successful in meeting 

the credit needs of their entire community, it has long been recognized that they must 

guard against discriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.
