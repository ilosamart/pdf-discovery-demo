Over the years, many economists--some of them textbook authors--have noted 

that expansionary fiscal policy could raise equilibrium interest rates.13  To illustrate this 

possibility, the next two bars on the slide show the estimated effect on interest rates of 

two possible expansionary fiscal policies, one that boosts government spending by 

1 percent of GDP and another that cuts taxes by a similar amount.  According to the 

FRB/US model, both policies, if sustained, would lead to a substantial increase in the 

equilibrium federal funds rate.  Higher spending of this amount would raise equilibrium 

interest rates by about 50 basis points; lower taxes would raise equilibrium rates by 

40 basis points.  I should note that the FRB/US model does not contain a great deal of 

detail about taxes and government spending.  These are thus the effects of very broad 

changes in income taxes and government spending, and not those of any specific, 

detailed, policy measures.   

It is important to emphasize that these estimates are from just one model and other 

models may give different results.  Still, I think these implications of fiscal policy 

measures are qualitatively correct--they are a standard result in many models, including 

the simplest textbook IS-LM model.     

Stimulative fiscal policies such as these could be beneficial if the economy 

confronted a recession.  Of course, it would be important to ensure that any fiscal policy 

changes during a recession did not compromise long-run fiscal sustainability.  

Government policies that boost the economyâ€™s long-run growth rate would be an 

even better means of raising the equilibrium interest rate.  This is a point I have also 

made in the past.14  While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies
