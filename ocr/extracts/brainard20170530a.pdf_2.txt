For the first time in many years, we are seeing signs of synchronized economic 

expansions at home and abroad, and the balance of risks globally has become more 

positive.  Recent data suggest that the underlying momentum of the domestic expansion 

remains solid.  While U.S. consumption was weak in the first quarter of 2017, the data so 

far are consistent with a rebound in the current quarter.  Moreover, financial conditions 

remain supportive of continued economic expansion despite some recent volatility.1 

The ongoing progress in bringing Americans back into productive employment is 

especially heartening.  With continued strength in the labor market, economic activity 

regaining momentum, and a brighter outlook abroad, it would be appropriate soon to see 

the federal funds rate moving closer to its neutral level.  If the economy evolves in line 

with the March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) median path, normalization of 

the federal funds rate is likely to be well underway before too long, setting the stage for a 

gradual and predictable running off of the balance sheet.   

Even so, I see some tension between signs that the economy is in the 

neighborhood of full employment and indications that the tentative progress we had seen 

on inflation may be slowing.  If the tension between the progress on employment and the 

lack of progress on inflation persists, it may lead me to reassess the expected path of the 

federal funds rate in the future, although it is premature to make that call today. 

Different Signals from the Labor Market and Inflation 

Let me start by reviewing the conflicting readings we are getting from the labor 

market and from inflation.
