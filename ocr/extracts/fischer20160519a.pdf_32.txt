Involuntary Unemployment

Chapters 13 and 14 of MIP deal with the consumption 

function when unemployment takes the household off its 

labor supply curve, and with other interactions between 

markets.  They are based on research by Leijonhufvud and 

Clower, and do an excellent job of clarifying the 

implications of disequilibrium in one market for behavior 

in other markets.  This approach was developed further by 

Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman in their 1976 

volume, Money, Employment, and Inflation, but began to 

go out of use and fashion in the 1980s.
