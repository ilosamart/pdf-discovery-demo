firms.  For example, the so-called Volcker rule will restrict the ability of banking firms to engage 

in proprietary trading of securities and derivatives and to invest in or sponsor private investment 

funds.    

Among the most important aspects of act are the measures that it authorizes to reduce the 

financial and economic effects of the failure of large firms.  A clear lesson of the past few years 

is that the government must not be forced to choose between bailing out a systemically important 

firm and having it fail in a disorderly and disruptive manner.  Instead, we need the tools to 

resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline--by ensuring that shareholders 

and creditors incur losses and that culpable managers are replaced--and that at the same time 

cushions the broader financial system from the possibly destabilizing effects of the firmâ€™s 

collapse.  Of course, such a framework has been in place for banks for several decades now, as 

you know.  The Dodd-Frank Act creates an analogous framework for systemically important 

nonbank financial firms, including bank holding companies.  Resolving a large, multinational 

financial firm safely will likely always be a difficult challenge, and a great deal of work remains 

to be done to make these new authorities fully effective.  Ultimately, though, these changes will 

mitigate moral hazard in our financial system by reducing expectations of government support 

by the creditors and counterparties of large firms.  Taken together, the measures I have described 

should give us a financial system that is safer, more efficient, and more equitable. 

In short, two key objectives of financial regulatory reform are, first, addressing the 

problems that emerged in the largest, most complex financial firms during the crisis and, second, 

creating a better balance with respect to regulation and oversight between banks and nonbank 

financial firms.  The Federal Reserve believes that these are the right goals for reform.  We are 

committed to working with the other U.S. financial regulatory agencies to implement the act and
