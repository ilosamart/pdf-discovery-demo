slack, inflation last year, and some other factors that I will leave aside for this discussion 

(figure 4):7 

Inflation(t) = -B Slack(t) + C Inflation(t - 1) + Other(t). 

The value of B is often referred to as the slope of the Phillips curve.  With a larger 

value of B, any change in labor market slack translates into a bigger change in inflation.  

As we say, as B increases, the Phillips curve steepens.  The value of C determines 

inflation’s persistence--that is, how long any given change in inflation tends to linger.  As 

the value of C increases, higher inflation this year translates more into higher inflation 

next year.  A particularly nasty case arises when B and C are both large.  In this case, 

slack has a large effect on inflation, and that effect tends to be very persistent.  One 

implication of a large C is that, if a boom drives inflation up, it will tend to stay up unless 

offset by a subsequent bust.8    

Figure 5 shows regression estimates of B and C, computed over 20-year samples 

starting with the sample from 1965 to 1984 and including each 20-year sample through 

2017.  During the Great Inflation samples, the value of C is near 1, meaning that higher 

inflation one year tended to translate almost one-for-one into higher inflation the next.  

The Phillips curve is also relatively steep in the Great Inflation samples, with 1 extra 

percentage point of lower unemployment converting into roughly 1/2 percentage point of 

higher inflation.  Thus, the Great Inflation presented that nasty case just described.   

                                                 
7 What is reported here is an updated version of results reported in Erceg and others (2018), and that work 
provides additional discussion.  Note that the “Other” term includes a constant.  
8 The text refers to when C is less than 1, in which case a rise in inflation would ultimately die out on its 
own.  When C is 1, the Phillips curve is of the “accelerationist” variety, and any offsetting rise in inflation 
due to labor market tightness would be permanent unless offset by an equal amount of subsequent slack.  
Blanchard (2016) has a good discussion of this issue.
