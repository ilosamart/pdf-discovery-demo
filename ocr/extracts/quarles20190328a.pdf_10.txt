with ensuring financial stability, however, we have to work to ensure that we can reap the 

benefits offered by these new technologies without harming financial stability.  We hope to offer 

some answers to these questions in the coming years and to do so in line with the principles I 

outlined earlier.  We will address the questions with discipline and analytical rigor in a way that 

incorporates the views of the public and key stakeholders and that results in answers that are 

practical and intelligible. 

Nonbank Financial Intermediation 

The second issue I would like to discuss is nonbank financing.  Since the global financial

known as “shadow banking”) provides a valuable alternative to bank financing and helps to 

support real economic activity.  Accordingly, the shift within the financial system toward 

nonbank financing represents a welcome increase in the diversity of the sources of lending to 

both firms and households.   

Even though the core of the financial system is much more resilient than before the

maturity and liquidity mismatches, opaque structures, and concentrated holdings of risky assets.  

Nonbank financing can also lead to lower lending standards, bidding up the price of risky assets 

and sending an encouraging signal to credit underwriters.  All of these channels played a role in 

the recent global financial crisis.  More recently, new forms of interconnectedness between
