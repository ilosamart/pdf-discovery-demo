that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market.  Let me 

explain what I mean by that word “slack” and why it is so important. 

Slack means that there are significantly more people willing and capable of filling 

a job than there are jobs for them to fill.  During a period of little or no slack, there still 

may be vacant jobs and people who want to work, but a large share of those willing to 

work lack the skills or are otherwise not well suited for the jobs that are available.  With 

6.7 percent unemployment, it might seem that there must be a lot of slack in the U.S. 

economy, but there are reasons why that may not be true.   

One important reason relates to the skills and education of people in the 

workforce.  It is no secret that America faces some daunting challenges in educating 

people and preparing them to work in a 21st century, globalized economy.  Many of you 

in this audience are helping workers address this challenge, but you also know that the 

economy continues to change very rapidly.   

To the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are 

demanding, there is less slack in the labor market.  This is an example of what 

economists call “structural” unemployment, and it can be difficult to solve.  Even 

understanding what workers need to appeal to employers is difficult in a fast-changing 

economy.  For government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning 

with improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work.  The 

problem goes deeper than simply a lack of jobs.   

But a lack of jobs is the heart of the problem when unemployment is caused by 

slack, which we also call “cyclical unemployment.”  The government has the tools to 

address cyclical unemployment.  Monetary policy is one such tool, and the Federal
