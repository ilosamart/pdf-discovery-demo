I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of 

Financial Research (OFR) for inviting me to address this conference.1   

I have two goals this afternoon.  First, I will briefly share my overall assessment 

of the current state of the vulnerabilities of the financial system.  Second, I will outline 

areas where regulators and researchers can work to fill in gaps in our understanding or in 

the data available to monitor conditions, especially conditions outside the banking sector.  

With regard to current conditions, like most who follow financial sector 

developments, I see financial vulnerabilities in the United States as greatly reduced from 

a decade ago, on the eve of the beginning of the global financial crisis.  But despite this 

relatively positive overall assessment, the financial system is dynamic and will evolve 

over time, and the tightening in regulation of the banking sector may push activity to 

other areas – and things happen. In particular, while current shadow banking activities are 

much reduced relative to their level in 2007-08, some developments remain hard to track, 

and interconnections across the financial system are hard to measure.   

Several steps have been taken to reduce shadow banking risks, including 

restrictions on the support banks can provide to shadow banking activities and reforms 

designed to lower the incentives of investors to run on money market mutual funds.  But 

more needs to be done.  For example, efforts to limit leverage used to finance securities 

positions, such as the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) recently finalized standard on 

minimum and potentially countercyclical haircuts on securities financing transactions, 

represent a further step in the right direction.  As the financial system evolves, we will

Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.  I am grateful to Michael Kiley and Nellie 
Liang for their contributions to this speech.
