The spread of gains and losses from 2007 to 2009 was sharper for business owners than 

for the population overall (figure 10).  Fifty-seven percent of business owners saw substantial 

losses in their net worth relative to their usual income, compared with 43 percent of the overall 

population; but the percentage of business owners who saw large wealth gains relative to their 

income was also larger than for the overall population.   

The industry in which the business operated had a significant impact on whether the 

business owner gained or lost wealth.  Families with businesses primarily engaged in mining or 

construction--among small businesses in the survey, this was overwhelmingly construction-

related businesses--were the most likely to see a substantial decline in net worth (figure 11).  In 

contrast, families with a wholesale or retail business were more likely to see a substantial gain.  

Those involved in utilities, transportation, and services--in the survey, this was predominantly 

services--saw the largest gains and the largest losses, but losses exceeded gains for the group.  

Only 82 percent of the consumers who reported owning a business in 2007 also reported 

owning a business in 2009.  And some of those who remained business owners may have scaled 

back their operations while awaiting recovery.  We do not have the detail necessary to assess the 

importance of reduced operations directly, but we have some suggestive evidence.  For 

businesses that were in operation in both 2007 and 2009, we see decreased median and mean 

business incomes for owners who saw their wealth fall and the reverse for owners whose wealth 

rose.  

Some of the decrease in activity may be driven by a decline in demand for services, but 

some may come from credit constraints.  For a variety of reasons, we cannot look directly at 

changes in credit availability for business owners and their businesses, but we can look at two 

indicators for the owners who had a continuing business in 2009.
