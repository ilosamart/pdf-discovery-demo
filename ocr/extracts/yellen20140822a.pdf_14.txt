quickly that slack is likely to be taken up, and thereby to the question of under what 

conditions we should begin dialing back our extraordinary accommodation.  As should be 

evident from my remarks so far, I believe that our assessments of the degree of slack 

must be based on a wide range of variables and will require difficult judgments about the 

cyclical and structural influences in the labor market.  While these assessments have 

always been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially 

challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which brought nearly unprecedented 

cyclical dislocations and may have been associated with similarly unprecedented 

structural changes in the labor market--changes that have yet to be fully understood.   

So, what is a monetary policymaker to do?  Some have argued that, in light of the 

uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack, policymakers should focus 

mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy.  To take an extreme 

case, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could 

largely ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to 

determine the extent of slack in the labor market.  In present circumstances, with inflation 

still running below the FOMCâ€™s 2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that 

we could maintain policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 

percent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished.   

Of course, our task is not nearly so straightforward.  Historically, slack has 

accounted for only a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation.  Indeed, unusual 

aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead-lag relationship between a 

tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction.  For example, as 

I discussed earlier, if downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pent-up wage
