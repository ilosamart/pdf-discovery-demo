have been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the 

decline in the unemployment rate.  In 2007, the average expectation for long-run GDP 

growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (figure 3).  The 

consensus estimate has moved down steadily since then and is now at 2.1 percent.  Other 

forecasters have also lowered their estimates over time, including those sampled by the 

Survey of Professional Forecasters and, yes, FOMC participants.7  Yet, as this figure 

shows, unemployment has declined faster than expected. 

More than the expected number of workers have been required to produce less 

than the expected amount of output.  The implication is that trend productivity and, 

ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.  The decline in estimates of 

potential growth has been driven largely by unexpectedly weak productivity growth.  

Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year, on average, since 2011--the 

worst performance over such a period since World War II (figure 4).  As this figure 

shows, productivity growth moves around significantly over time and has averaged about 

2 percent since 1970.  One factor behind the decline since the financial crisis is the 

relatively slow increase in the capital stock per worker, as weak demand and uncertainty 

about the future have held back business investment.  But the more important factor has 

been the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP), which represents the part of 

productivity that is not explained by capital increases or increases in the skills of the 

labor force.  TFP is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation and
