statements following its meetings that have related the outlook for policy to prospective 

economic developments and has introduced regular summaries of the individual 

economic projections of FOMC participants (including for the target federal funds rate).  

The provision of additional information about policy plans has helped Fed policymakers 

deal with the constraint posed by the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates; in 

particular, by offering guidance about how policy will respond to economic 

developments, the Committee has been able to increase policy accommodation, even 

when the short-term interest rate is near zero and cannot be meaningfully reduced 

further.

  The Committee has also sought to influence interest rates further out on the 

yield curve, notably through its securities purchases.  Other central banks in advanced 

economies, also confronted with the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates, 

have taken similar measures. 

In short, the recent crisis has underscored the need both to strengthen our 

monetary policy and financial stability frameworks and to better integrate the two.  We 

have made progress on both counts, but more needs to be done.  In particular, the 

complementarities among regulatory and supervisory policies (including macroprudential 

policy), lender-of-last-resort policy, and standard monetary policy are increasingly 

evident.  Both research and experience are needed to help the Fed and other central banks 

develop comprehensive frameworks that incorporate all of these elements.  The broader 

conclusion is what might be described as the overriding lesson of the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

history:  that central banking doctrine and practice are never static.  We and other central 

                                                                                                                                                 
that target over time.  In contrast, an instrument-based approach involves providing the public information 

about how the monetary policy committee plans to vary its policy instrument--typically, a short-term 

interest rate, like the federal funds rate--in response to economic conditions.  See Svensson (2003).
