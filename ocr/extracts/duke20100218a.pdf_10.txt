have funded without assistance from the TALF, and several more are in various stages of 

development.  We hope that our work in the commercial mortgage sector will help 

alleviate some of the strains in commercial real estate funding.  As many of you know all 

too well, this sector is particularly troubled as layoffs and business closures have led to 

vacant retail, office, and industrial spaces across the United States and refinancing 

options for maturing loans remain quite limited.     

I have to admit, I was originally quite skeptical about the TALF.  I was so 

skeptical, in fact, that I was asked to take the lead working with staff on its development.  

Those of you who have worked with me before know what a conservative lender I am.  

So you can imagine the effort required by staff to overcome every concern and objection 

that I had.  In the end, we created a program that was really quite safe from the standpoint 

of the taxpayer, yet quite successful from the standpoint of those who found loans that 

otherwise would have been unavailable. 

 As pleased as I was to see that the TALF worked, I am even more pleased to see 

that it is becoming unnecessary.  In recent months, market conditions for auto and credit 

card ABS have improved so much that new issues are increasingly being funded by non-

TALF sources.  Moreover, even though TALF loans have three- and five-year terms, 

investors have already repaid almost one-fourth of TALF loans. 

Lending to AIG 

Undoubtedly, the most difficult actions and the least popular from the public’s 

view were our assistance to individual firms, the so-called bailouts of investment bank 

Bear Stearns and insurance company AIG.  I wasn’t there for Bear Stearns, but I did have 

to vote on the AIG loan.  And I can tell you it was the hardest decision I have ever made.
