to estimate, in a fully independent way, how each firm’s loss, revenue, and capital ratio 

would likely respond in any specified scenario.  

 Another innovation since the SCAP is the increased supervisory focus on banks’ 

internal capital planning practices, which are reviewed as part of CCAR.  We see the 

requirement that banks with assets of $50 billion or more submit annual capital plans to 

the Federal Reserve as a critical enhancement.

  While regulatory minimums and 

supervisory expectations provide floors for acceptable capital levels, the firms and their 

boards of directors are responsible for assessing their own capital needs over and above 

the minimums.  Our supervisors scrutinize their practices and assess their capacity to 

fulfill that responsibility.  In particular, we require firms to formulate their own scenarios 

that capture the risks that they face, and to assess potential losses and revenues under 

both the supervisory scenarios and their internal scenarios over a nine-quarter horizon.  In 

CCAR, our qualitative assessment of a firm’s capital planning is integrated with the 

quantitative results of both the supervisory and company-run stress tests.   

 The Federal Reserve continues to increase the transparency of our stress testing 

process, the results of the exercises, and our assessments of banks’ capital planning.  The 

original SCAP set a new standard of supervisory transparency in disclosing bank-by-bank 

estimates of stress losses by type of exposure.  This departure from the traditionally 

confidential treatment of supervisory information, as I noted earlier, was intended to 

restore public confidence by providing much-needed information about banks’ potential

 A capital plan describes a firm’s capital planning strategies and its processes for measuring potential 

capital needs both under expected and stressed operating environments and for ensuring that it is holding 

adequate capital to be able to continue to function even under stress.  See Board of Governors of the
