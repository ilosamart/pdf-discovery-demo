the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), or the Rural Housing Service (RHS).  

Data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act indicate that the share of 

purchase mortgages guaranteed or insured by the FHA, the VA, or the RHS rose from 5 

percent in 2006 to more than 40 percent in 2011 (figure 8).

  But here, too, loan 

originations appear to have contracted for borrowers with low credit scores.  The median 

credit score on FHA purchase originations increased from 625 in 2007 to 690 in 2013, 

while the 10th percentile has increased from 550 to 650 (figure 9).

Part of the contraction in loan originations to households with lower credit scores 

may reflect weak demand among these potential homebuyers.  Although we have little 

data on this point, it may be the case that such households suffered disproportionately 

from the sharp rise in unemployment during the recession and thus have not been in a 

financial position to purchase a home. 

There is evidence that tight mortgage lending conditions may also be a factor in 

the contraction in originations.  Data from lender rate quotes suggest that almost all 

lenders have been offering quotes (through the daily “rate sheets” provided to mortgage 

brokers) on mortgages eligible for sale to the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) 

to borrowers with credit scores of 750 over the past two years.

 Staff calculations suggest that the FHA and VA market share dipped a bit in 2012 but remained quite 

elevated.  These calculations are based on data provided by McDash Analytics, LLC, a wholly owned 

subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc.

 The shift in the distributions may partly reflect changes in the FHA’s underwriting guidelines.  In 2010, 

the FHA required a minimum credit score of 580 in order to qualify for a loan with a 3.5 percent down 

payment.  In 2013, the FHA required manual underwriting for loans with a credit score less than 620 and a 

debt-to-income ratio greater than 43 percent.  See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
