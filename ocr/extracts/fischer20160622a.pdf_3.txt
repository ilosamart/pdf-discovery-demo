firms from failing.  Unfortunately, the fears proved well founded: The bankruptcy of 

Lehman Brothers Holdings--the largest bankruptcy filing in American history--

significantly exacerbated the crisis.3 

To increase the viability of the Bankruptcy Code as a framework for resolving 

failed financial firms without major systemic consequences, section 165(d) of the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) 

requires large banking organizations to produce resolution plans, also known as living 

wills, demonstrating how they could be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code in an 

orderly fashion in the event of failure. 

Although the Bankruptcy Code provides the default legal framework for the 

resolution of a failed bank holding company, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act creates a 

backup resolution framework, called the orderly liquidation authority, to be used if the 

resolution of a failed financial company under the Bankruptcy Code would have serious 

adverse effects on U.S. financial stability.  If that criterion and several others are met, 

Title II allows the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint the FDIC as receiver for the failed 

financial company as an alternative to a bankruptcy resolution overseen by a judge.  The 

orderly liquidation authority has several features that could reduce the systemic effect of 

a financial company’s failure relative to a bankruptcy resolution, including an orderly 

liquidation fund to provide government liquidity support for the failed firm and 

provisions to prevent the unwinding of the failed firm’s derivatives and other qualified 

financial contracts while they are transferred to a solvent firm. 

                                                 
3 Lehman’s pre-bankruptcy total assets were $691 billion.  The second-largest bankruptcy in American 
history was the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual, Inc., the savings and loan holding company that owned 
Washington Mutual; its pre-failure total assets were nearly $328 billion.  Both Lehman and Washington 
Mutual filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.
