occupations such as retail sales, food preparation, manual labor, home health care, and 

customer service.3   

Furthermore, wage growth has remained more muted than is typical during an 

economic recovery.  To some extent, the rebound is being driven by the low-paying 

nature of the jobs that have been created.  The slow rebound also reflects the severe 

nature of the crisis, as the slow wage growth especially affects those workers who have 

become recently re-employed following long spells of unemployment.  In fact, while 

average wages have continued to increase steadily for persons who have remained 

employed all along, the average wage for new hires have actually declined since 2010.4   

 The faces of low-wage Americans are diverse.  They include people of varying 

employment status, race, gender, immigration status, and other characteristics.  Many 

such Americans are attached to the workforce and are deeply committed to both personal 

success and to making a contribution to society.  For purposes of reference, in 2011, low 

wage was defined as $23,005 per year or $11.06 per hour.5   

Today, about one-quarter of all workers are considered “low wage.” They are 

sanitation workers, office receptionists, and nursing assistants; they are single mothers of 

three who worry: How will I be able to send my children to college? What if my landlord 

raises the rent this year?  Tens of millions of Americans are the people who ask 

themselves these questions every day.

observed during the recessions of the early 1990s and early 2000’s—the so-called “jobless recoveries”—but not prior 
to then.

working life are especially severe when the job loss occurs during a recession. See Steven J. Davis and Till von
