the course of the economy.  So it is informative to look at how the finances of this group were 

impacted by the crisis and how they have changed their outlook as a result. 

As was the case for families overall, experiences varied widely.  The share of families in 

the 50-to-61 age group that saw a substantial increase in their net worth--more than six months of 

their usual income--was nearly the same as for families overall (figure 5).  But 49 percent of the 

age group saw a decline of more than six months of their usual income, compared with 42 

percent of families overall. 

Implications for Behavior 

It would be reasonable to expect households’ plans and attitudes to vary based on the 

individual wealth outcomes they experienced.  But in comparing responses from boomer families 

that lost wealth to those that gained wealth, we found remarkably similar answers.   

In 2009, more than two-thirds of the preretirement group reported that their expected 

retirement age was at least a year later than what they reported in 2007.  The share of families 

expecting to extend their working life was very similar regardless of their change in wealth.  This 

likely suggests increased uncertainty about the future, no matter what their experience during the 

financial crisis, as also suggested by other results in the survey.  

In terms of asset management, more than half of the preretirement families reported that 

they plan to make no changes at all in the next few years; this result holds across all wealth-

change groups.  But among those who do expect to make changes, increased savings was the 

most commonly reported goal. 

Boomer families’ reported willingness to take on financial risk also changed over the 

panel period.  Regardless of the change in their wealth, these families were more likely to report 

being more unwilling to take financial risk in 2009 than in 2007 (figure 6).
