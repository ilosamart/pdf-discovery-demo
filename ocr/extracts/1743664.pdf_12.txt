Federal revenue sharing to State and local entities were diminished, 

some sources of taxation would need to be turned back to the State 

and local entities for their use.

Finally, we should mention monetary policy as one of the 

uncertainties of the coming year. You can be assured that monetary 

policy will be reactive to the deficits of Federal Government 

financing. In reality, we have little choice because when the 

Federal Government creates a major deficit and finances that deficit 

in the market, there must be some accommodation by the central bank 

or the financing issues would fail. Monetary policy also will react 

to commercial bank lending patterns. If the demand for bank credit 

by business were to continue as slow in 1976 as it was in 1975, 

you could expect one reaction by the central bank, whereas, if 

business borrowing moves up sharply, another eventual reaction could 

be reflected in monetary policy. Monetary policy must also be 

reactive to bank lending terms and conditions, for the central bank 

will need to try to foster confidence in both borrowers and lenders 

and improve bank lending attitudes. One must admit quickly that 

monetary policy can do very little toward changing the attitudes of 

people, except tangentially through its basic policy moves. Finally,
