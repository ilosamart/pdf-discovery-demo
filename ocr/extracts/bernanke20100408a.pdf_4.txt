depressions than countries in which the banking system was more stable, such as Great 

Britain.2 

The lesson has been learned.  In the current episode, in contrast to the 1930s, 

policymakers around the world worked assiduously to stabilize the financial system.  As 

a result, although the economic consequences of the financial crisis have been painfully 

severe, the world was spared an even worse cataclysm that could have rivaled or 

surpassed the Great Depression. 

 That lesson brings me to the second one--policymakers must respond forcefully, 

creatively, and decisively to severe financial crises.  Early in the Depression, 

policymakers’ responses ran the gamut from passivity to timidity.  They were 

insufficiently willing to challenge the orthodoxies of their day--such as the liquidationist 

doctrine of Mellon and others, or the rigid adherence to the variant of the gold standard 

adopted after World War I.  A key turning point, in the United States, came with Franklin 

Roosevelt’s commitment to bold experimentation after his inauguration in 1933.  Some 

of his experiments failed or were counterproductive, but his decisions to declare a bank 

holiday upon taking office in March 1933 and to sever the link between the dollar and 

gold helped arrest the descent of the U.S. financial system and set off a strong, albeit 

incomplete, recovery. 

In the Depression, effective policy responses came only after three to four years 

of financial crisis and economic contraction.  In our own time, policymakers acted sooner

Great Depression:  An International Comparison,” in R. Glenn Hubbard, Financial Markets and Financial 
Crises (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press for NBER). 

The historical linkages between financial stability and economic performance have been explored in 
great detail in recent work.  For example, see Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff (2009), This 
Time is Different:  Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (Princeton and Oxford:  Princeton University Press).
