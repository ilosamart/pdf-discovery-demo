Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be with you, and it is good to be back in 

Providence.  As many of you know, I attended Brown University, and the city I see today

8 percent of the stateâ€™s employment.  U.S. economic output fell more than 4 percent 

nationally, the most since the Great Depression, and many of the hardest-hit industries,
