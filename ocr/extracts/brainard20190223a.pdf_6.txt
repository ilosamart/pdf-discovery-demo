Today, you will hear from several, including Dr. Julianne Malveaux, Dr. Willene 

Johnson, and Dr. Lisa Cook, who will share with you their perspectives and discuss their 

important and interesting work.   

So what might you find by pursuing economics?  As I have noted, you can 

influence peopleâ€™s lives for the better.  You can craft policy to change our world.  You 

can teach and help shape the next generation.  You can find the answers to questions that 

matter most to you.  You can develop the intellectual framework and tools that will 

enable you to pursue a range of opportunities, not just in economics, but also in business, 

finance, policy, and nonprofits.   

Conclusion 

  I hope you will take away the message that the field of economics would be the 

richer from your engagement and has much to offer as you decide how to make your 

contribution.  There are many opportunities for you in the field of economics, both here 

and abroad, in government, academia, and the private sector.  Dr. Sadie Alexander 

knocked down the door, and I hope you will consider following her through it.
