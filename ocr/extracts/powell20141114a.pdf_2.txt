Our panel’s topic--“Monetary Policy Spillovers and Cooperation in a Global 

Economy”--is surely a timely one.  I will offer brief introductory thoughts and then 

discuss some recent research by Federal Reserve Board economists that has bearing on 

these matters.1   

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is motivated by the dual mandate, which 

calls upon us to achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment.  While 

these objectives are stated as domestic concerns, as a practical matter, economic and 

financial developments around the world can have significant effects on our own 

economy and vice versa.  Thus, the pursuit of our mandate requires that we understand 

and incorporate into our policy decision-making the anticipated effects of these 

interconnections.  And the dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve, transaction, and 

funding currency requires us to consider global developments to help ensure our own 

financial stability. 

Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has pursued a highly 

accommodative monetary policy, which has had important effects on asset prices and 

global investment flows.  With unconventional tools, the scale and scope of these effects 

were difficult to predict ex ante.  Nor is it possible to predict with confidence how 

markets will react day to day as policy returns to normal.  The Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) has gone to great lengths to provide transparency about its policy 

intentions.  Yet, since Chairman Bernanke first discussed the end of the asset purchase 

program in mid-2013, volatility has surprised both on the upside (the “taper tantrum”) 

and on the downside (the actual taper and the low volatility throughout most of 2014).  In
