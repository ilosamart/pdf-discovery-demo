losses and capital needs.  In last month’s results, in addition to projected losses and 

revenues, we disclosed for the first time whether we had objected to each firm’s capital 

plan.

  Also for the first time, banks were required to disclose their own estimates of 

stressed losses and revenues.  The disclosures by banks give investors and analysts an 

alternative perspective on the test results; they also help them form judgments about 

banks’ appetites for risk and their risk-management practices, particularly their abilities 

to measure losses in a severe downturn.  Even outside of a period of crisis, the disclosure 

of stress test results and assessments provides valuable information to market participants 

and the public, enhances transparency, and promotes market discipline. 

 In the four years since the SCAP, the Federal Reserve’s stress testing program has 

been expanded and strengthened through both statute and regulation.  The Dodd-Frank 

Act widened the scope of stress testing to all bank holding companies with $50 billion or 

more in total consolidated assets (approximately 11 companies in addition to the original 

SCAP participants) and to nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council as systemically important, and therefore subject to 

consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve.  Dodd-Frank also requires these 

companies to conduct their own stress tests twice a year.  In October, the Federal Reserve 

Board adopted rules implementing these requirements.

  The 11 additional companies 

with assets of $50 billion or more will be subject to DFAST and CCAR for the first time 

next year.
