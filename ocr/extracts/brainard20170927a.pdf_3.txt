similar benefits from gender diversity.  A study of 2.5 million research papers across the 

sciences found that those written by ethnically diverse research teams received more 

citations and had a greater influence than papers by authors with the same ethnicity.2 

As a bank regulator, the Federal Reserve has an interest in promoting diversity in 

the financial services industry.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is 

actively engaged in developing diverse talent in the financial services industry as a key 

partner of the Financial Services Pipeline Initiative (FSP).  The FSP is a collaborative of 

about 20 financial services organizations that are working together to increase the 

representation of Latinos and African Americans, at all levels, within the Chicago-area 

financial services industry. The members of this initiative recognize they have a 

collective interest in developing a diverse pipeline of talent.  They are more likely to be 

more successful in achieving their internal pipeline goals if they succeed in improving 

diversity and inclusion in the finance workforce more broadly.  

Another example of our work to promote diversity at banking institutions is the 

standards developed by the Boardâ€™s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion to promote 

transparency and awareness of diversity policies and practices within banking 

institutions.  The Board encourages banking institutions not only to provide their policies, 

practices, and self-assessment information to the Board, but also to disclose this 

information to the public.  We hope that this new self-assessment tool will help 

individual banks achieve their own diversity and inclusion goals and contribute to greater 

diversity in the banking industry more generally.
