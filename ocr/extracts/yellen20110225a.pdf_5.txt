economic conditions.  Since November 2009, the Committee has specifically indicated 

that the relevant economic conditions include “low rates of resource utilization, subdued 

inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations.”  An important consequence of such 

conditionality, serving to enhance the effectiveness of the guidance, is that incoming 

information about economic and financial developments has led forecasters and investors 

to revise their outlook for the path of the funds rate even in the absence of a change in the 

forward guidance language.  

The evolution of financial market expectations concerning the funds rate path 

over the past year illustrates that the conditional nature of the FOMC’s forward guidance 

allows incoming economic data to shift market views.  For example, as shown in the left 

panel of figure 2, the expected path of the funds rate shifted down markedly during the 

spring and early summer of last year in the wake of weaker readings on economic activity 

and prices and of some concerns about potential spillovers from developments in Europe.  

Those expectations shifted down somewhat further during late summer and early autumn.  

Conversely, as shown in the right panel, funds rate expectations have shifted upward over 

the past several months in response to more-positive economic news and greater 

confidence that a self-sustaining economic recovery may be taking hold. 

Down the road, once the recovery is well established and the appropriate time for 

beginning to firm the stance of policy appears to be drawing near, the FOMC will 

naturally need to adjust its “extended period” guidance and develop an alternative 

communications strategy to shape market expectations about the policy outlook.  

However, if there were an unexpected faltering of the recovery or a substantial widening 

of downside risks to economic activity and inflation, the forward guidance now in place
