notably, consumer spending and business fixed investment--must ultimately take the lead.  

On the whole, in the United States, that critical handoff appears to be under way. 

However, although private final demand, output, and employment have indeed 

been growing for more than a year, the pace of that growth recently appears somewhat 

less vigorous than we expected.  Notably, since stabilizing in mid-2009, real household 

spending in the United States has grown in the range of 1 to 2 percent at annual rates, a 

relatively modest pace.  Households’ caution is understandable.  Importantly, the 

painfully slow recovery in the labor market has restrained growth in labor income, raised 

uncertainty about job security and prospects, and damped confidence.  Also, although 

consumer credit shows some signs of thawing, responses to our Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggest that lending standards to households 

generally remain tight.2

The prospects for household spending depend to a significant extent on how the 

jobs situation evolves.  But the pace of spending will also depend on the progress that 

households make in repairing their financial positions.  Among the most notable results to 

emerge from the recent revision of the U.S. national income data is that, in recent 

quarters, household saving has been higher than we thought--averaging near 6 percent of 

disposable income rather than 4 percent, as the earlier data showed.

  On the one hand, 

this finding suggests that households, collectively, are even more cautious about the 

economic outlook and their own prospects than we previously believed.  But on the other 

hand, the upward revision to the saving rate also implies greater progress in the repair of
