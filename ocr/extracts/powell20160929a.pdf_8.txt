Figure 9 shows those local banking markets in which the number of community banks 

decreased over the 20 years from 1995 to 2015 (in white) and those markets in which the 

number of community banks increased or stayed constant (in blue).  As you can see, there 

are markets in every state where the number of community banks has declined.  

However, there also are markets in every state where community banks have maintained 

or increased their presence.  In fact, the number of local markets that saw their population 

of community banks hold constant or increase between 1995 and 2015 was more than 

double the number of local markets that experienced a decline in the number of 

community banks over this period.  And, perhaps surprisingly, the share of rural markets 

experiencing a decrease in the number of community banks (about 32 percent) was 

slightly lower than the share of urban markets facing such a decline (about 35 percent).  

As we saw, the vast majority of the decline in the number of community banks 

involved banks with less than $100 million in assets.  This next figure (figure 10) shows 

changes in the number of banks in this smallest size category together with changes in the 

number of all community banks.  The local markets that are shaded in dark blue are those 

where both the number of banks with less than $100 million in assets and the number of 

all community banks declined between 1995 and 2015.  The light-blue markets are those 

where the total number of community banks remained constant or increased despite a 

decline in the number of banks in the smallest size category.  There are just over twice as 

many markets shaded in light blue as there are shaded in dark blue, indicating that in two-

thirds of the markets where the number of very small community banks declined, the 

number of community banks overall did not decline.  Markets in white are those where
