special about these asset purchases that would make them especially likely to weigh on 

the dollar.  

 In fact, the evidence available to date suggests that the asset purchases have had 

only moderate effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  This point is 

illustrated in table 3, which reports the change in U.S. dollar exchange rates against four 

other currencies (the Canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, and yen) on each of the four 

dates referred to in table 1.  These movements in exchange rates are not particularly large 

when compared with the fluctuations that can occur in any given week or month.  Indeed, 

as shown in figure 6, these exchange rate movements are very modest in the broader 

context of developments over the past several years. 

 A related concern raised by some observers is that the Federal Reserveâ€™s asset 

purchases may induce excessive capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMEs)--

inflows that in turn could put unwelcome upward pressure on the currencies of those 

EMEs and perhaps even contribute to asset price bubbles.  As shown in figure 7, net 

private capital flows to Latin American and Asian EMEs (reported as a share of the 

aggregate GDP of those EMEs) were substantial in the second half of 2009 and the first 

half of 2010 but were not obviously outsized compared with levels prior to the crisis.18  A 

similar pattern is evident in figure 8, which depicts the net inflows since 2007 into mutual 

funds investing in EME bonds and equities.  In each case, the strong inflows over the past 

year or so reflect a recovery in the wake of the large outflows that occurred during the 

crisis.  In fact, the stock of claims on EMEs has only returned to its pre-crisis trend.  

                                                 
18 For the purposes of this discussion, the EMEs comprise Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong 
Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and 
Venezuela.
