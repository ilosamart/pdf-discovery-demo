commercial real estate.7  Bearing this in mind, we will continue to study and assess the impact of 

the various factors at work in determining the total level of credit outstanding.8 

Conclusion 

Credit plays a critical role in our economy.  That is why policymakers invested so much 

money and energy into ensuring the survival of our financial system.  There really is no single 

step that can be taken to quickly unclog all lending markets.  Just as the causes for the decline in 

lending are multifaceted and complex and took time to evolve, the solutions will likely be 

equally difficult and will take time to fully work.  The financial condition of the banking system, 

the evolving regulatory climate, the financial condition of businesses and consumers, and the 

path of the economy will all influence supply and demand for credit.  We at the Federal Reserve, 

meanwhile, will continue to do everything we can to encourage a return to a healthy credit 

environment.  

Banks are an important source of credit, providing a way for people to save as well as 

providing loans to fund everything from college tuition, to business start-ups, to maintaining 

inventories.  Thus, as bankers, you serve a vital role in your communities. The fate of banks is 

deeply intertwined with that of the cities and regions they serve.  Returning to a normal lending 

environment--whatever that might be in the months and years ahead--will require constant 

                                                 
7 For comparison, the average pattern of inflation-adjusted credit following business-cycle troughs is that consumer 
credit and commercial mortgage volumes increase from their levels at the trough, and home mortgage volumes and 
nonfinancial credit take about ½ year and 1 ¼ year, respectively, to return to their levels at the trough. (Note that the 
business-cycle expansions that we consider here are those that followed the 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2001 troughs.  
The expansion following the 1980 business-cycle trough is excluded from these average calculations because the 
1981–82 recession followed quite quickly after the end of the recession.)

and D. Hancock (2009), “U.S. Credit Cycles: Past and Present,” available at 
http://www.financialstability.gov/docs/CPP/Report/Fed%20US%20Credit%20Cycles%20072409.pdf.  Note, 
however, that whereas this previous analysis focused on the evolution of credit following business-cycle peaks, staff 
analysis is now focused on the evolution of credit following business-cycle troughs.
