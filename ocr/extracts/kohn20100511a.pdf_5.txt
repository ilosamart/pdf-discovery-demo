and gaps led to a vulnerable, overleveraged financial system with inadequate capital and liquidity 

buffers.  These problems were amplified by the eagerness of U.S. households to take on huge 

amounts of mortgage debt and of lenders to advance them the credit, justified by overly 

optimistic expectations for house price appreciation as the real estate boom progressed.   

But these financial sector problems were enabled, if not encouraged, by developments in 

the global economy.  The capital outflows associated with the persistent current account 

surpluses were large even in net terms and, combined with relatively restrained business capital 

spending in many advanced economies (including the United States), put downward pressure on 

real interest rates globally.4

From a purely theoretical perspective, there is no compelling reason to believe that low 

real interest rates, by themselves, pose a particular risk to global economic and financial stability, 

as real interest rates should be driven by underlying forces to balance the global demand for 

saving and investment.  Capital inflows from abroad can be beneficial if they are invested 

prudently.  But in an environment in which the financial sector is prone to excess and the 

supervisory structure does not respond sufficiently, the interaction of low interest rates and 

financial vulnerabilities can clearly be dangerous.  Notably, the generally stable macroeconomic 

environment that prevailed before the crisis may have exacerbated this problem, as it contributed 

to overly sanguine perceptions of risk. 


Rather than financing productive business investment, capital inflows too often facilitated 

spending on housing and consumer goods.  This circumstance was particularly true in the United 

States, where an innovative and entrepreneurial financial system aggressively competed for the
