as our rulemaking process moves forward, I want to comment now on a couple of arguments, 

since they seem to reflect a misunderstanding of our stress testing program or of the regulatory 

structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

One such argument is that it is duplicative to include both the anticipated losses under 

stress and the GSIB surcharge in a firmâ€™s capital requirement because two elements of our 

current stress test, the global market shock and the counterparty default shock, only apply to 

GSIB firms.  However, these additional scenario components capture direct losses to which any 

firm engaged in material trading activity is exposed.  The market shock measures the trading 

mark-to-market losses associated with sudden changes in asset prices.  The large counterparty 

default measures the losses associated with repricing counterparty exposures based on the market 

shock, and then assuming the default of the counterparty that represents the largest net exposure.  

These components of the stress test do not capture the adverse impact of a GSIB failure on the 

financial system as a whole--the risks that are the basis for the GSIB surcharge.  

These components of our stress test currently apply only to GSIBs because GSIBs are the 

only firms currently in CCAR for which these exposures are material.  Non-GSIBs currently do 

not have material trading activities and so would suffer only small direct trading losses as a result 

of severely stressed market conditions or the failure of a major derivatives or repurchase 

agreement (repo) counterparty.  As the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banks 

with more material trading businesses in their U.S. operations are added to CCAR, we intend to 

revisit whether the global market shock and counterparty default component should be applied to 

firms beyond the U.S. GSIBs.  

Another argument offered against inclusion of the surcharge as an element of post-stress 

capital expectations is that the material distress or failure of a GSIB no longer poses a significant
