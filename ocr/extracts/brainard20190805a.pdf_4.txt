In determining the path forward, we are building on the Federal Reserve’s long history of 

operating payment systems as a core part of the nation’s payment infrastructure. Since they 

opened for business around the country in 1914, as directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve 

Banks have provided payment and settlement services—in healthy competition with private-

sector providers—to achieve public benefits ranging from resiliency to innovation to equal 

access. When you look across the current payment infrastructure, whether in check processing, 

automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers, you will see a Federal Reserve 

service operating alongside private-sector providers. The General Accountability Office has 

concluded that the Federal Reserve’s provision of payment services has benefited the U.S. 

payment system and its users.6  

The Federal Reserve does not have regulatory authority over the pricing set by a private-

sector system or to require a private-sector system to extend the service to banks of all sizes, 

particularly the last mile. In some other countries, central banks have been assigned the 

responsibility for regulating payment systems. However, this is not the approach that Congress 

has taken. Instead, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has long been seen as an effective 

approach to promote accessible, safe, and efficient payments in the United States.  

Through the FedNow Service, we will provide a foundation for the future—a modern 

payment infrastructure that allows innovation and competition to flourish and delivers faster 

payments safely and securely for all. To ensure fast payments are available to everyone, FedNow 

will be accessible to all banks, no matter the size. Given our long-standing service connections
