 In a dynamic variant of this policy, minimum down payments prescribed by 

regulators could be implemented and would automatically vary over the credit cycle, 

tightening in booms and relaxing in busts.  Tighter minimum down payment 

requirements in good times would likely reduce defaults and build lender resilience to 

later losses due to asset price declines.  At the same time, by actively leaning 

progressively harder against property-related credit expansion, they may restrain 

excessive credit growth and property price appreciation, and reduce the chances--and 

magnitude--of a sharp price bust.  There has been some experience with this type of 

policy in Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.  In Hong Kong, for example, 

tighter down payment rules reduce household leverage and the sensitivity of defaults to 

changes in property prices, and have been shown to slow property appreciation. 


Prudential Supervision for All Financial Institutions 

 I donâ€™t mean to suggest that all asset bubbles can be addressed by merely implementing 

some set of regulatory policies. Indeed, how easy our jobs would then be! 

In practice, such policies work best if they are part of a system of prudential 

supervision for all financial institutions. Of course, in the U.S. economy, savers and 

borrowers are linked not only through intermediaries like banks, but also through 

nonbanks, such as money market mutual funds and hedge funds, and through the capital 

markets and securitization. Regulation can only build resilience in, and affect 

intermediation and lending by, the parts of the system that are, in fact, regulated. 

Regulatory policies that aim to increase the resilience of regulated institutions, and lean 

against asset bubbles by restraining the growth of lending by such institutions, can be
