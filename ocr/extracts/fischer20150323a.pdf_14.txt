for the decisions made by the FOMC, but in reaching their interest rate decision,

To ensure that monetary policy operates in as stabilizing a way as possible, the 

FOMC will continue to set out, as clearly as it can, the basis of every decision that it 

makes, and to provide guidance on its expectations of future decisions.  And on the basis 

of the information provided by the FOMC, of their understanding of the historical record 

of Fed policy decisions, and of their analysis and expectations of the state of the economy 

and, particularly, the financial markets, market participants will make the best decisions 

they can.
