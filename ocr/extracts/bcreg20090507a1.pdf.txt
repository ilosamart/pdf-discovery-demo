The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: 

Overview of Results 

May 7, 2009 
I. Introduction and Summary 
A banking organization holds capital to guard against uncertainty. Capital reassures an 
institution's depositors, creditors and counterparties--and the institution itself--that an event such as an 
unexpected surge in losses or an unanticipated deterioration in earnings will not impair its ability to 
engage in lending to creditworthy borrowers and protect the savings of its depositors. During this 
period of heightened economic uncertainty, U.S. federal banking supervisors believe that the largest 
U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) should have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow 
them to meet the credit needs of their customers in a more severe recession than is anticipated. For 
this reason, the Federal Reserve and other bank supervisors embarked on a comprehensive 
simultaneous assessment of the capital held by the 19 largest U.S. BHCs in February of this year. 
This unprecedented exercise-known as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)-
allowed supervisors to measure how much of an additional capital buffer, if any, each institution would 
need to establish today to ensure that it would have sufficient capital if the economy weakens more 
than expected. Those BHCs needing to augment their capital coming out of this assessment will have a 
month to design a detailed plan, subject to supervisory approval, for the steps they will take to put the 
SCAP buffer in place, and then implement that plan by early November of this year. 
The unprecedented nature of the SCAP, together with the extraordinary economic and financial 
conditions that precipitated it, has led supervisors to take the unusual step of publically reporting the 
findings of this supervisory exercise. The decision to depart from the standard practice of keeping 
examination information confidential stemmed from the belief that greater clarity around the SCAP 
process and findings will make the exercise more effective at reducing uncertainty and restoring 
confidence in our financial institutions. To this end, a detailed white paper on the SCAP data and 
methodology was released on April 24th 1 [Footnote 1. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(2009) "The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation" white paper (Washington 
DC: Board of Governors, April 24). http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20090424a.htm.

This companion paper reports—for each of the 19 institutions individually and in the aggregate 
—the SCAP estimates of losses and loss rates across select categories of loans and securities; the resources 
available to absorb those losses; and the resulting necessary capital buffers. 
There are a number of points to keep in mind when interpreting the SCAP findings: 
• The estimates reported here are those of the teams of supervisors, economists, and analysts that 
conducted this exercise, and they may or may not line up with what the firms themselves or 
external analysts and researchers might have produced, even using a similar set of basic 
assumptions. These estimates benefit from the input of extremely detailed information 
collected from each of the 19 BHCs, the extensive review and analysis of that information by the 


SCAP teams, and the judgment of supervisors and other experts. The breadth and depth of the 

resources brought to bear in formulating these estimates are unparalleled. 

• The estimates are not forecasts or expected outcomes; they are the products of a two-year-

ahead ‘what-if’ exercise conducted under two alternative macro scenarios. Roughly speaking, 

the first scenario--referred to as the "baseline"--was an assumed path for the economy that 

followed the then-current consensus forecast, and the second--the "more adverse" scenario--

was a deeper and more protracted downturn than the consensus. Not only is it virtually certain 

that the economy will not evolve in lockstep with either of these scenarios, but there were also 

other factors that had to be assumed constant for the purpose of conducting this exercise, and 

any of those factors could change materially from what was implicitly or explicitly assumed in 

this process. 

• The SCAP was a deliberately stringent test. It was designed to account for the highly uncertain 

financial and economic conditions by identifying the extent to which a BHC is vulnerable today 

to a weaker than expected economy in the future. By ensuring that these large BHCs have a 

capital buffer now that is robust to a range of economic outcomes, this exercise counters the 

risk that uncertainty itself exerts contractionary pressures on the banking system and the 

economy. In the event the economy weakens more than expected, the firms will have adequate 

capital; in the event the economy follows the expected path, or an even stronger path, the firms 

will still be viewed as stronger today for having higher levels of capital in an uncertain world. 

• The SCAP focused not only on the amount of capital but also on the composition of capital held 

by each of the 19 BHCs. That is, SCAP assessed the level of the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and 

the proportion of Tier 1 capital that is common equity.2 [Footnote 2. Tier 1 capital, as defined in the 

Board's Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Guidelines, is composed of common and non-common equity 

elements, some of which are subject to limits on their inclusion in Tier 1 capital. See 12 CFR part 225, 

Appendix A, § II.A.1. These elements include common stockholders' equity, qualifying perpetual preferred 

stock, certain minority interests, and trust preferred securities. Certain intangible assets, including 

goodwill and deferred tax assets, are deducted from Tier 1 capital or are included subject to limits. 

See 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A, § II.B. End footnote 2.] The SCAP's emphasis on what is termed 

"Tier 1 Common capital" reflects the fact that common equity is the first element of the capital 

structure to absorb losses, offering protection to more senior parts of the capital structure and 

lowering the risk of insolvency. All else equal, more Tier 1 Common capital gives a BHC greater 

permanent loss absorption capacity and a greater ability to conserve resources under stress by 

changing the amount and timing of dividends and other distributions. To determine the size of 

the SCAP buffer for each firm, supervisors used their estimates of each firm's losses and 

resources for the more adverse scenario to answer the following two questions: 

o If the economy follows the "more adverse" scenario, how much additional Tier 1 capital 

would an institution need today to be able to have a Tier 1 risk-based ratio in excess of 6 

percent at year-end 2010? 
o If the economy follows the "more adverse" scenario, how much additional Tier 1 

Common capital would an institution need today to have a Tier 1 Common capital risk-

based ratio in excess of 4 percent at year-end 2010? 


• The SCAP buffer does not represent a new capital standard and is not expected to be maintained 

on an ongoing basis. Instead, that capital is available to help BHCs absorb larger-than-expected 

future losses, should they occur, and to support the BHCs ability to serve their customers, 

including lending to creditworthy borrowers during the economic downturn. 

The results of the SCAP suggest that if the economy were to track the more adverse scenario, 

losses at the 19 firms during 2009 and 2010 could be $600 billion. The bulk of the estimated losses -

approximately $455 billion - come from losses on the BHCs' accrual loan portfolios, particularly f rom 

residential mortgages and other consumer-related loans. The estimated two-year cumulative losses on 

total loans under the more adverse scenario is 9.1 percent at the 19 participating BHCs; for comparison, 

this two-year rate is higher than during the historical peak loss years of the 1930s. Estimated possible 

losses from trading-related exposures and securities held in investment portfolios totaled $135 billion. 

In combination with the losses already recognized by these firms since mid-2007, largely from charge-

offs and write-downs on the values of securities, the SCAP results suggest financial crisis-related losses 

at these firms, if the economy were to follow the more adverse scenario, could total nearly $950 billion 

by the end of 2010. 

The potential losses facing these 19 firms have to be weighed against the potential resources 

available to them to absorb those losses. At year-end 2008, capital ratios at all 19 BHCs exceeded 

minimum regulatory capital standards, in many cases by substantial margins, and most met supervisory 

expectations on the composition of capital. Tier 1 capital at these firms totaled about $835 billion in Q4 

2008. The practical implication of this capital is that many of the BHCs already had substantial capital 

buffers in place to absorb their share of the estimated $600 billion of losses. In addition, banks will 

realize revenues f rom ongoing businesses to absorb losses, though at a lower level in the weak 

economic conditions of the stress scenario than in the baseline. However, some of those revenues will 

need to go into building loan loss reserves against credit problems in 2011. 

After taking account of losses, revenues and reserve build requirements, in the aggregate, these 

firms need to add $185 billion to capital buffers to reach the target SCAP capital buffer at the end of 

2010 under the more adverse scenario. There are two important things to note about this estimate. 

First, the $185 billion accrues to 10 of the 19 firms, meaning 9 of the 19 firms already have capital 

buffers sufficient to get through the adverse scenario in excess of 6 percent Tier 1 capital and 4 percent 

Tier 1 Common capital. Second, the vast majority of this $185 billion comes from a shortfall in Tier 1 

Common capital in the more adverse scenario, with virtually no shortfall in overall Tier 1 capital. This 

result means that while nearly all the firms have sufficient Tier 1 capital to absorb the unusually high 

losses of the more adverse scenario and still end 2010 with a Tier 1 risk-based ratio in excess of 6 

percent, 10 of these firms had capital structures that are too strongly t i l ted toward capital other than 

common equity. Thus, each of the 10 firms needing to augment their capital as a result of this exercise 

must do so by increasing their Tier 1 Common capital. 

The $185 billion estimated additional capital buffers correspond to the estimate that would 

have applied at the end of 2008. But a number of these firms have either completed or contracted for 

asset sales or restructured existing capital instruments since the end of 2008 in ways that increased their 

Tier 1 Common capital. These actions substantially reduced the final SCAP buffer. In addition, the pre-

Provision net revenues of many of the firms exceeded what was assumed in the more adverse scenario 

by almost $20B, allowing them to build their capital bases. The effects of these transactions and 

revenues rendered the additional capital needed to establish the SCAP buffer equal to $75 billion. 


As mentioned above, any BHC needing to augment its capital buffer will be required to develop 

a detailed capital plan to be approved by its primary supervisor, after consultation with the FDIC and the 

Treasury, over the next 30 days, and to implement that plan in the next six months. BHCs are 

encouraged to design capital plans that, wherever possible, actively seek to raise new capital f rom 

private sources. These plans can also include actions such as restructuring current capital instruments, 

sales of assets, and restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases, and will have benchmarks for firms 

to achieve in specified t ime frames. 

Some firms may choose to apply to the U.S. Treasury for Mandatory Convertible Preferred 

(MCP) under its Capital Assistance Program (CAP) as a bridge to private capital in the future. MCP can 

serve as a source of contingent common capital for the f i rm, convertible into common equity when and 

if needed to meet supervisory expectations regarding the amount and composition of capital. In 

addition, the Treasury will consider requests to exchange outstanding preferred shares sold under the 

Capital Purchase Program (CPP) or Targeted Investment Program (TIP) for new MCP. The 19 firms have 

U.S. Treasury preferred equity securities of $216 billion. 

Strong banks with ample capital are essential for a robust economy. By making a careful 

evaluation of the potential vulnerabilities of the largest 19 U.S. BHCs—which together hold two-thirds of 

assets and more than one-half of the loans in the U.S. banking system—the SCAP will help to ensure the 

strength of the U.S. banking sector. The SCAP is also an important complement to the U.S. Treasury's 

support of the U.S. banking system, and helps to protect the taxpayers' investments in U.S. financial 

institutions. Both of these programs, by increasing the quantity and quality of capital held by large U.S. 

BHCs, will help reduce uncertainty about the impact of potential losses, and allow the U.S. banking 

system to play its role in supporting a stronger, faster, and more sustainable economic recovery. 

II. SCAP Loss and Resource Projections 

The participating BHCs were asked to estimate their potential losses on loans, securities, and 

trading positions, as well as pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) and the resources available from the 

allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) under two alternative macroeconomic scenarios. These 

estimates were reviewed and analyzed by supervisors and then evaluated against independent 

benchmarks developed by supervisors to arrive at the supervisors' loss estimates. Care was taken to 

ensure that the loss and resource estimates reflected the risk and business lines of each BHC, and that 

they were consistent with the macroeconomic environment specified in the two economic scenarios, 

especially for the more adverse scenario that forms the basis of the capital buffer calculations. This 

section reports the results of this process, first in aggregate for the 19 participating BHCs and then for 

individual firms. 

II.A. Loss and Resource Estimates by BHCs 

Each participating BHC was instructed to estimate potential losses on its loan, investment 

securities, and trading portfolios, including off-balance sheet commitments and contingent liabilities and 

exposures, over the two-year horizon beginning with year-end 2008 financial statement data. For loans, 

the BHCs were instructed to estimate forward-looking, undiscounted credit losses - that is, losses due to 

failure to pay obligations ("cash f low losses") - rather than discounts related to mark-to-market values. 

To guide estimation, the firms were provided with a common set of indicative loss rate ranges for 

specific loan categories under conditions of the baseline and the more adverse economic scenarios (see 


table 1). Firms were allowed to diverge f rom the indicative loss rates where they could provide 

evidence that their estimated loss rates were appropriate.

Second/Junior Lien Mortgages: HELOCs 6 – 8 8 – 11

Credit Cards 
12 – 17 18 – 20 

Other Consumer 
4 – 6 8 – 12 

Other Loans 
2 – 4 4 – 10 

The indicative loss rate ranges were derived using a variety of methods for predicting loan 

losses, including analysis of historical loss experience at large BHCs and quantitative models relating the 

performance of loans or groups of loans to macroeconomic variables. Supervisors viewed these 

indicative ranges as useful indicators of industry loss rates and in that way they can serve as a general 

guide, but recognized that they might not adequately capture differences across individual firms that 

could affect the performance and losses in significant ways. Thus, supervisors asked firms to provide 

granular data about the particular characteristics of their portfolios in order to make more tailored 

quantitative assessments of loss. Loss estimates for the SCAP thus relied ultimately on firm-specific 

information about factors such as past performance, origination year, borrower characteristics, and 

geographic distribution. 

II.B. Aggregate Loss Estimates 

The two-year loss estimates total close to $600 billion in the more adverse scenario for the 19 

BHCs (table 2). Estimated SCAP losses on residential mortgages are substantial over the two-year 

scenario, consistent wi th the sharp drop in residential house prices in the past two years and their 

projected continued steep fall in the more adverse scenario. Expected loss rates on first-liens and 

second/junior liens are well outside the historical experience of commercial banks. The effects of 

reduced home prices on household wealth and the indirect effects through reduced economic activity, 

also push up estimated losses on consumer credit, including losses on credit cards and on other 

consumer loans. Together, residential mortgages and consumer loans (including credit card and other 


consumer loans, not shown) account for $322 billion, or 70 percent of the loan losses projected under the more adverse scenario.3 [Footnote 3.Some of these losses have already 
been taken, however, in the form of discounts on impaired loans acquired during mergers. These discounts reduce future estimated credit losses on residential mortgage and 
consumer loans by approximately $57 billion, which was incorporated when calculating the additional capital for the SCAP buffer. End footnote 3.] Estimated loss rates on 
commercial real estate loans, especially those related to land development, also are elevated in the more adverse scenario, reflecting realized and projected substantial declines 
in real estate values. For commercial and industrial loans, estimated loss rates are within the range of those experienced in business downturns in past recent recessions.

Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding 

In total, the estimated loan loss rates under the more adverse scenario are very high by 

historical standards. The two-year cumulative loss rate on total loans equals 9.1 percent in the more 


adverse scenario. As shown in Figure 1, this loss rate is higher than two-year loss rates observed for U.S. commercial banks from 1920 to 2007/2008. 
In addition to the sharpest two-year drop in residential house prices since then, and a projected further steep decline in the what-if adverse scenario, 
he rise in the unemployment rate in the scenario would be more severe than any U.S. recession since the 1930s.4 [Footnote 4.Another reference for the 
estimated loss rates in the SCAP is where they stand relative to estimates made recently by other analysts. Unfortunately, many of the loss estimates 
are not directly comparable because they are for different time horizons (for example, lifetime losses) or are based on different economic scenarios. 
However, based on assessments that we can make with the available information, the SCAP estimates appear to be about in the middle of the range 
of these other estimates. End footnote 4.]

Table 2 also reports aggregate projections for losses on securities held in the available-for-sale 
(AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) investment portfolios and, for BHCs with trading account assets 
exceeding $100 billion, losses on trading and counterparty credit risk losses. These losses represent a 
significant share of the total. 
To evaluate losses for securities in the AFS and HTM portfolios, supervisors focused on securities 
subject to credit risk. At the end of 2008, the 19 BHCs held $1.5 trillion of securities, more than one-half 
of which were Treasury, agencies, or sovereign securities, or high-grade municipal debt, and so are 
subject to no or limited credit risk. Only about $200 billion was in non-agency mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) and only a portion of these were recent vintage or were backed by riskier nonprime 
mortgages. Remaining material exposures included corporate bonds, mutual funds, and other asset-
backed securities. For securitized assets, supervisors assessed if the security would become impaired 
during its lifetime. If the current level of credit support was considered insufficient to cover expected 
losses, the security was written down to fair value with a corresponding "other than temporary 
impairment" (OTTI) charge, equal to the difference between book and market value. These OTTI 
charges equaled $35 billion in the more adverse scenario, with almost one-half of the estimated losses 
coming from the non-agency MBS.5 

[Footnote 5. 
To recognize losses in the more adverse scenario, supervisors chose a conservative approach. Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-
Than-Temporary Impairments, April 9, 2009, regards debt securities held in the AFS and HTM accounts and 
focuses on whether firms intend to sell an impaired security or whether it is more-likely-than-not that firms will be 
required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. If either of these conditions is met, the firm must 
recognize OTTI. The FASB’s guidance holds that a firm’s determination of its ability to hold a security to recovery 
should consider sources of uncertainty. Supervisors believed it prudent to incorporate the possibility that firms may 
not be able to hold a security to recovery under conditions more stressful than expected. Thus for those securities 
estimated or recommended by supervisors to be other than temporarily impaired, the loss was equal to the 
difference between the investment’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. End footnote 5.] 


In addition, firms with trading assets of $100 billion or more were asked to estimate potential 
trading-related market and counterparty credit losses under a market stress scenario provided by the 
supervisors, based on the severe market shocks that occurred in the second half of 2008. The estimated 
losses from trading-related exposures were substantial, close to $100 billion across the five firms to 
which it was applied. The primary drivers of potential stress losses were private equity holdings, other 
credit-sensitive trading positions, and possible losses stemming from counterparty credit exposures to 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading counterparties. The possible losses from counterparty credit 
exposures were measured using credit valuation adjustment methods based on stressed exposure levels 
and expected deterioration of the creditworthiness of counterparties under the more adverse scenario. 
The total loss estimate of $600 billion for the 19 BHCs is in addition to the substantial losses that 
have already been taken by these firms in the past couple of years.6 [Footnote 6. Past losses, however, are 
recognized in the starting regulatory capital levels used to calculate the SCAP capital buffer, as discussed in the 
next section of the paper. End footnote 6.] That is, the 
forward-looking losses in the SCAP do not include the losses that have already occurred since the assets were 
originated and are already reflected in the firms' balance sheets. Losses taken in the six quarters through the 
end of 2008 by these firms and firms they acquired are substantial, estimated at approximately $400 billion. 
They include charge-offs, write-downs on securities held in the trading and in the investment accounts, 
and discounts on assets acquired in acquisitions of distressed or failed financial institutions. As an 
offset, about $65 billion in these merger-related discounts are captured in the SCAP loss projections (the 
so-called purchase accounting adjustments) which reflect that a substantial part of estimated losses on 
the assets purchased were already recorded. Thus, a more comprehensive measure of losses totals at 
least $935 billion for the 19 participating BHCs in the more adverse scenario.7[Footnote 7. These losses are not full 
lifetime losses because the SCAP loss projections are for a two-year forward horizon and thus do not capture losses 
occurring beyond the end of 2010. However, given the profile of the more adverse scenario, which includes a return 
to positive real GDP growth within the two years, this horizon seems likely to capture a large portion of losses from 
positions held as of the end of 2008. The impact of some losses after 2010 is also captured in the overall SCAP 
exercise through the calculation of year-end 2010 reserves, which are calibrated to be sufficient to cover projected 
2011 losses. End footnote 7.] 

II.C. Firm-level Loss Estimates 

As discussed earlier, the SCAP loss estimates were made using considerable firm-specific data 
about the risk and likely future performance of the portfolios. Because the exercise made extensive 
use of this information, the resulting loss rates vary significantly across BHCs. Table 3 summarizes 
the results for each of the 19 BHCs that participated in the SCAP. The table reports loss amounts 
and loss rates, along with projections of resources to absorb losses, and total capital need at each 
institution. The appendix contains separate tables for each of the 19 BHCs.

Figure 2 shows the ratio of total estimated two-year losses to year-end 2008 risk-weighted 

assets (RWA) in the more adverse scenario for the 19 participating BHCs. Clearly, there is substantial 

variation across firms in the size of estimated losses rates, reflecting differences in business lines and 

asset quality. The median loss-to-RWA ratio equals 7.5 percent, and the ratio ranges from 3.0 percent 

to 11.8 percent across the firms. These estimates are not forecasts of expected losses, but are 

estimates of losses that would occur under economic conditions more stressed than anticipated. Higher 

loss estimates do not necessarily imply a need for more capital to meet the SCAP buffer, as some firms 

will also have higher estimated resources and capital.

for More Adverse Scenario 

[Graphic. Bar chart. Unit is percent. For details, refer to the text immediately preceding this figure. 
End of graphic.] 

The next five charts illustrate selected loss rates by loan type across the 19 BHCs. Loss rates are 

calculated as cumulative, two-year losses divided by beginning-of-period loan balances. The loss rates 

do not reflect adjustments to recognize write-downs of loan portfolios acquired during mergers. The 

charts also show the median loss rate across the firms. 

As with overall losses, there are significant differences in loss rates by loan type across BHCs. 

For example, while the median two-year loss rate on first-lien mortgages was 8 percent across the 15 

BHCs with a material amount of mortgages, the rates varied f rom a low of 3.4 percent to a high of nearly 

12 percent. For second and junior lien mortgages, the range among 14 BHCs was 6 percent to 21 

percent, and a median rate of about 13 percent. Such variation reflects substantial differences in the 

portfolios across the BHCs, by borrower characteristics such as FICO scores, and loan characteristics such 

as loan-to-value ratio, year of origination, and geography. These differences result in significant 

variation in loss estimates at the f irm level as compared with applying a single loss rate per asset 

category to all BHCs.

II.D. Resources to Absorb Losses 

Supervisors reviewed the BHCs' submissions of resources they would have available to absorb 

losses over the two-year horizon under both scenarios. These resources consist of PPNR - net interest 

income, fees and other non-interest income, net of non-credit-related expenses - and reserves already 

established for probable incurred losses at December 31 , 2008. Supervisors also developed 

independent estimates based on the historical relationship between components of PPNR and 

macroeconomic activity. In addition, supervisors developed estimates of the size of the allowance for 

loan and lease losses (ALLL) needed to cover anticipated losses for the year following the end of the 

scenario (2011). If the estimate of the year-end 2010 ALLL exceeded the ALLL as of year-end 2008, then 

the BHC was presumed to have to make provisions to cover this increase, representing a drain on 

resources available to absorb losses. Estimates of aggregate future resources to absorb losses - PPNR 

and changes in the ALLL-total $363 billion for 2009 and 2010, reflecting the weak economic outlook 

specified in the more adverse scenario. For the 14 BHCs for which historical data on BHCs are most 

relevant, the combined PPNR-to-assets ratio is estimated to remain almost 15 percent below the past 

twenty-year average for each of the next two years. Estimates of ALLL needs at 2010 suggest that most 

BHCs will need to build reserves over the scenario horizon, representing a net drain on resources. 

Figure 8 shows the ratio of estimated PPNR minus any additional reserve needs over the two-

year horizon (or plus any reserve releases) to risk-weighted assets for the 19 BHCs in the more adverse 

scenario. Available resources vary considerably across firms. Some of this variation is inherent in the 

business focus of particular firms and the extent to which the firms generate high (low) pre-credit cost 

revenue as an offset to high (low) average credit costs. Another part of the variation reflects differences 

in the estimated stability of revenues and expenses in a stressed economic environment such as the 

more adverse scenario.

percent to about 11.4 percent, and the median was about 4.9 percent. End of graphic.] 

III. The SCAP Capital Buffer 
Minimum capital standards for a BHC are intended to serve only as a guide for supervisors in 
determining the adequacy of the BHCs capital relative to its risk profile. In practice, supervisors expect 
all BHCs to have a level and composition of Tier 1 capital well in excess of the 4 percent regulatory 
minimum, and also to have "voting common stockholders' equity" as the dominant element of Tier 1 
capital. In this regard, the use of Tier 1 Common capital in the SCAP is consistent with the Board's long-
held belief that common equity should be the dominant form of Tier 1 Capital.8 [Footnote 8. Tier 1 Common 
capital is calculated as Tier 1 capital less non-common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, 
qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries, and qualifying trust preferred securities. End footnote 8.] 
Under the SCAP, 
supervisors evaluated the extent to which each of the 19 BHCs would need to alter either the amount or 
the composition (or both) of its Tier 1 capital today to be able to exceed minimum regulatory 
requirements in Q4 2010, even under an unexpectedly adverse economic outcome. 
Specifically, the SCAP capital buffer for each BHC is sized to achieve a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at 
least 6 percent and a Tier 1 Common capital ratio of at least 4 percent at the end of 2010 under the 
more adverse macroeconomic scenario. By focusing on Tier 1 Common capital as well as Tier 1 capital, 
the SCAP emphasized both the amount of a BHCs capital and the composition of its capital structure. 
Once the SCAP upfront buffer is established, the normal supervisory process will continue to be used to 
determine whether a firm's current capital ratios are consistent with regulatory guidance. 
By its design, the SCAP is more stringent than a solvency test. Each BHCs capital was rigorously 
evaluated against a two-year-ahead adverse scenario that is not a prediction or an expected outcome 
for the economy, but is instead a "what if" scenario. Thus, any need for additional capital and/or a 
change in composition of capital to meet the SCAP buffer builds in extra capital against the unlikely 


event the adverse scenario materializes and, in that way it may help to prevent that adverse event from 

occurring. 

The illustration below shows how the buffer works for a hypothetical BHC needing to augment 

its capital at the end of the SCAP. The left hand side of the exhibit shows the BHCs initial capital level 

upon the completion of the SCAP on May 7 and its capital level after it builds the SCAP buffer over the 

six months from May 7 to November 9. Much like the stress assessment exercise undertaken in the 

SCAP, the right hand side of the exhibit shows what would happen to the BHCs capital under two 

alternative scenarios for the macro economy. In the expected, or baseline, scenario, the BHC would end 

the period with even higher capital levels that are well above regulatory minimums, while in the worse-

than-expected, or more adverse scenario, the BHC would end the period with capital near or slightly 

above appropriate levels. 

The presence of this one-time buffer will give market participants, as well as the firms 

themselves, confidence in the capacity of the major BHCs to perform their vital role in lending even if 

the economy proves weaker than expected.

[Graphic. Bar chart. For details, refer to the text immediately preceding this figure. End of graphic.] 

IV. Calculation of Additional Capital to Build SCAP Buffer 
To calculate the amount of additional capital to build the SCAP buffer, supervisors began with 
estimates of credit and trading losses from PPNR and ALLL to estimate the pre-tax change to retained 
earnings.9 [Footnote 9. If analysis indicated that the ALLL could be lower at Q4 2010 than it was at Q4 2008, 
then the commensurate reserve release was added to pre-provision net revenue as an additional loss-absorbing 
resource. End footnote 9.] Pre-tax changes to retained earnings were allocated to an after-tax portion and a 
tax-related portion using a 35 percent average tax rate. The tax-related portion of any losses was applied to the 


stock of total deferred tax assets to estimate the pro forma value, in accordance with existing capital rules. 
Finally, after-tax changes to retained earnings were combined with projected preferred dividend 
payments to estimate the change in equity capital and pro forma equity capital for year-end 2010.10 [Footnote 10. 
Common dividends were assumed to be zero in the more adverse scenario. End footnote 10.] Pro forma risk-weighted assets were 
defined as RWA from 4Q 2008 plus any assets brought onto the balance sheet in accordance with FAS 140.11  

[Footnote 11. The supervisors conducting the credit analysis worked closely with accounting specialists in the 
agencies to ensure that the firms' projections were consistent with existing accounting standards. Additionally, 
supervisors evaluated the potential impact of proposed changes to FAS 140 and FIN 46(R) which are expected 
to be finalized in May 2009 and implemented in January 2010. The agencies' accounting specialists discussed the 
amendments with FASB members and staff and other experts to assess the reasonableness of firm estimates of 
assets likely to be brought on to the balance sheet starting in 2010 as a result of the amendments. The on-boarding 
of assets were also factored into our assessment of risk-weighted assets and the associated ALLL needs. . 
End footnote 11.] 
A BHC was considered to require an additional SCAP buffer if its pro forma Tier 1 ratio was below 6 percent or if its 
pro forma Tier 1 Common ratio was below 4 percent at the end of 2010. For many firms, if a buffer was required to 
meet the Tier 1 Common capital ratio of 4 percent, the additional common or contingent common equity that would 
be raised would be sufficient to bring its Tier 1 ratio to or above 6 percent. 
The initial supplemental capital buffer estimates are based on year-end 2008 capital and risk- weighted assets, 
adjusted for FAS 140. These estimates thus do not reflect developments affecting the firms' capital positions and 
corporate structure since the end of the year. To capture these effects, the estimates for the initial capital buffers 
were adjusted to reflect certain "capital actions," representing a direct increase or decrease in the determination of 
capital needs. These adjustments were based on information supplied by participating BHCs, subject to consultation 
and review by supervisors. Capital action adjustments reflect factors such as contracted material sales or 
dispositions of businesses, holdings or discontinued operations, contracted exchanges of securities with a BHCs 
capital structure, and the amount (if any) of mandatory convertible preferred to convert to common by year-end 
2010. The results were also adjusted to reflect Q1 2009 operating performance. The final supplemental capital 
buffer is the initial estimate plus or minus the impact of these adjustments. 
V. Indicated Additional Capital Buffers under SCAP 
V.A. Aggregate SCAP Buffer 
The initial results using data through Q4 2008 suggest that the aggregate capital needed for the 19 BHCs 
to reach the SCAP capital buffer targets in the more adverse scenario is $185 billion, the vast majority of which 
needs to be in the form of Tier 1 Common capital (table 2). Capital needs are mainly in the form of Tier 1 Common 
capital, which reflects the fact that while many institutions have a sufficient amount of capital, they need to take steps 
to improve the quality of that capital. 
The final capital buffer incorporates capital actions and the impact of Q1 2009 operating performance. These 
adjustments are substantial, reflecting strong pre-provision net revenues at some firms in the first quarter and, to a 
much larger degree, efforts already taken by some firms prior to the conclusion of the SCAP to raise common equity 
by selling subsidiaries, converting preferred stock, or issuing common shares. After taking into account the 
completed or contracted capital actions and the 


effects of the first-quarter operating results, the supplemental capital needs equals $75 billion in the 

aggregate. 

V.B. Firm-level SCAP Buffers 

As shown in table 3, for 9 of the 19 BHCs, the indicated SCAP buffer is zero. That is, existing 

capital, including that provided by the U.S. Treasury, and estimated resources that will be available to 

cover estimated losses in the more adverse scenario are sufficient for the firms to meet the 4 percent 

Tier 1 Common capital and 6 percent Tier 1 capital ratios without any additional capital or changes to 

the composition of capital. Nonetheless, most of these firms have taken actions since year-end 2008 to 

strengthen their capital positions, as illustrated in the "capital actions" row of table 3. 

For 10 of the participating BHCs, supervisors expect these firms to raise additional capital or 

change the composition of their capital. As noted above, much of this need is for additional Tier 1 

Common. For all of these firms, a raise of new common equity of the amount indicated would be 

sufficient to ensure they will also have at least a 6 percent Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2010. The ratio of 

the indicated SCAP buffer to risk-weighted assets for these 10 firms ranges f rom 0.9 percent to 9.3 

percent at year-end 2008. After considering Q1 2009 operating performance and capital actions for 

these firms, the SCAP buffer to risk-weighted assets ranges f rom 0.6 percent to 6.6 percent.
