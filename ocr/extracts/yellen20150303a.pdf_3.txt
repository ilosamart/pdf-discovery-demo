The financial crisis and the recession caused great hardship for millions of 

individuals and families in this city and in communities throughout our country.  I believe 

all Americans share a common interest in working to make sure that our financial system 

is strong, resilient, and able to serve a healthy and growing economy.  A critical part of 

our work since the crisis to promote a stable financial system has therefore involved 

greater effort to ensure that large institutions are operating safely and soundly and are 

prepared to continue serving households and businesses even when faced with stressful 

financial conditions. 

In the run-up to the crisis, large firms failed to adequately anticipate and manage 

risks that grew and concentrated in their increasingly sprawling, diverse, and complex 

operations.  Partly as a result, these firms had trouble retaining the trust of markets and 

creditors when the financial system came under stress.  Doubts quickly mounted about 

whether these institutions could sustain losses in the value of many assets they held.  

Further doubts were raised about whether these firms had enough cash and other liquid 

assets to meet the immediate or potential demands of short-term creditors and large 

institutional customers.  In the lead-up to the crisis, many large institutions had become 

heavily reliant on very short-term borrowing, at relatively low rates, to fund lending and 

other operations providing higher returns.  While this approach may have appeared to be 

an easy source of profit, it had the disadvantage of leaving those banks exposed to 

devastating runs if short-term funding dried up, as it did in the crisis.   

Large financial institutions, of course, were not alone in failing to see these risks.  

The checks and balances that were widely expected to prevent excessive risk-taking by 

large financial firms--regulatory oversight and market discipline--did not do so.
