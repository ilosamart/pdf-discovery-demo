hold onto past progress that they have made in building up the physical infrastructure and 

human capital of their communities, while others have lost ground and are beginning the 

process of rebuilding.  

 While the scale of the problems has been exceptional, many of the problems 

themselves are not new for lower-income families and communities that were already

or recovering from setbacks.  The same is true for communities that were already 

relatively poor, with fewer community assets and insufficient drivers of economic 

growth. 

 To solve problems, we must first understand them.  Like many of you here today, 

the Federal Reserve has been engaged for some time in research and analysis of the 

economic challenges faced by neighborhoods and communities as well as by individuals 

and families.  For example, in 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of
