Basel III.  Domestically, the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests examine the effects of 

unexpected macroeconomic shocks on asset classes held within all major regulated firms.  The 

Dodd-Frank Act gave the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) authority to bring

large banks based on their systemic importance.  There is also an initiative to parallel U.S. efforts 

to identify non-bank systemically important firms.  The Basel Committee and the Financial 

Stability Board have developed international principles for resolution authority, though most of 

the rest of the world is behind the United States in actually implementing those principles. 

 But meeting the macroprudential challenge will require measures beyond a more 

comprehensive, cross-firm approach to microprudential regulation.  Much academic and policy 

work of the past several years has revived and elaborated the previously somewhat heterodox 

view that financial instability is endogenous to the financial system, or at least the kind of

Shadow banking, which refers to credit intermediation partly or wholly outside the limits of the 

traditional banking system, involves not only sizeable commercial and investment banks, but 

many firms of varying sizes across a range of markets.  While some of the more notorious pre-
