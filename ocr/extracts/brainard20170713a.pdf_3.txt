tightening of short-term rates, or undertaking both in tandem.  Shrinking the balance 

sheet and raising the policy rate can both contribute to achieving the domestic goals of 

monetary policy, but it is an open question whether alternative normalization approaches 

might have materially different implications for the composition of demand and for cross-

border spillovers, including through exchange rates and other financial channels.   

Before discussing the cross-border effects of normalization, it is worth noting that 

the two tools for removing accommodation--raising policy rates and reducing central 

bank balance sheets--appear to affect domestic output and inflation in a qualitatively 

similar way.  This means that central banks can substitute between raising the policy rate 

and shrinking the balance sheet to remove accommodation, just as both were used to 

support the recovery following the Great Recession.   

Insofar as a range of approaches is likely to be consistent with achieving a central 

bank’s domestic objectives, the choice of normalization strategy may be influenced by 

other considerations, including the ease of implementing and communicating policy 

changes, or the desire to minimize possible credit market distortions associated with the 

balance sheet.  In the case of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had 

reached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions 

deteriorate, thus guarding against the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) 

in an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate.3  The greater familiarity 

and past experience with the federal funds rate also weighed in favor of this instrument
