bank since the shock can be distributed among all banks in the system.  In the incomplete 

network, funding is not diversified.  A liquidity shock at one bank is more likely to cause 

liquidity problems at other connected banks because the same shock is spread over fewer 

banks and is therefore larger and more destabilizing.  The principle behind this result is 

familiar and basic to economics:  Diversification reduces risk and improves stability.  

While this idea is compelling, both economic research and the events of the financial 

crisis suggest that it is incomplete.    

In their classic paper on bank runs, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig showed 

how rational and prudent actions by individual depositors to limit their own risks may be 

highly destabilizing to an institution designed to transform short-term liabilities into long-

term assets.

  Xavier Freixas, Bruno Parigi, and Jean-Charles Rochet show that a similar 

kind of collective action problem can arise in a network akin to a modern check-clearing 

system in which credit extensions among banks allow claims on one institution to be 

fulfilled by another.

  Such a system is socially useful because it allows depositors to shift 

funds among banks without forcing banks to sell illiquid assets, thus enabling society as a 

whole to undertake more productive, long-term investment.  But in times of stress or 

uncertainty, such systems can be subject to coordination failures:  A “gridlock” 

equilibrium can arise in which depositors at each bank withdraw funds early in order to 

avoid losses arising from credit extensions to other banks whose depositors are also 

expected to force an early liquidation of assets.  In Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000), 

interbank credit extensions, while useful, can result in institutions that are “too 

interconnected to fail.”  These models underscore that the pattern of connections
