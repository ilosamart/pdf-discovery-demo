administrative law features such as notice, opportunity for hearing, a statement of reasons for 

decision, and judicial review.    

The combination of this legal structure and my earlier delineation of the ways in which a 

distressed firm can contribute to systemic risk suggests that the designation of firms under 

section 113 is both an important tool for safeguarding financial stability and a limited one.  It is 

important because the recent financial crisis made clear that the failure of certain financial 

institutions outside the perimeter of mandatory prudential regulation could have major systemic 

effects.  Moreover, if and as other firms outside that perimeter grow so as to pose similar risks--

whether because of the migration of risky activities from the regulated sector or for other 

reasons--it will be important to apply prudential standards and consolidated supervision in a 

timely fashion. 

 Still, the tool of designating firms is a limited one.  The structure established by Congress 

itself suggests that the standard for designation should be quite high.  Congress could, for 

example, have made every financial firm with more than $50 billion in assets subject to 

prudential standards and consolidated supervision, but it chose not to do so.  Instead, it required 

an administrative determination on the basis of a list of factors which, though not by its own 

terms exclusive, leans heavily toward characteristics associated with the first two kinds of 

systemic effects from failed firms. 

Furthermore, the rationale for regulation provided by the potential for contagion effects is 

really an argument for sound regulation of the type of financial firm or instrument under 

consideration.  If a small money market fund’s travails can provoke a run on the entire industry, 

then all such funds should be subject to requirements that reduce the fragility of their business
