these rural communities.  Frequently, community bankers’ ties to local agricultural 

businesses include running family farms, ranches, orchards, and dairies.  In other 

instances, members of the boards of directors that help to oversee community banks are 

heavily involved in the business of agriculture.  These close connections to local 

agricultural businesses provide community banks with a unique and important 

perspective in helping to meet local agricultural credit needs. 

 Additionally, community banks can be more agile than their larger competitors, 

as they employ lenders with a deep understanding of local products and conditions and 

are able to offer customized funding options in response to changing lending conditions.  

This agility ultimately allows for better informed lending decisions and provides 

agricultural borrowers with the means to fund their operations and sustain their 

communities.   

As bank supervisors, we pay close attention to the performance of all banks, 

including agricultural banks.  Before we start our conversation today, I would like to 

discuss how the Federal Reserve approaches bank supervision with a focus on agriculture 

lending and the challenges our farmers and the community banks that support these 

operations are facing.
