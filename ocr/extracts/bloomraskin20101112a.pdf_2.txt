 Good afternoon.  I would like to thank the National Consumer Law Center 

(NCLC) for inviting me to speak here at the Consumer Rights Litigation Conference.  

Iâ€™m particularly pleased to share my thoughts with you in my first public speech since 

joining the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last month.   

 These are challenging times for policymakers because they are profoundly 

challenging times for millions of Americans.  Many families have suffered significant 

declines in their net worth over the past several years, especially as the value of their 

homes and other assets has plummeted.  Many households have faced job losses or large 

reductions in the number of hours worked, events that have reduced family income and 

well-being.  Retirees are feeling heightened anxiety as companies and local and state 

governments debate measures to restrict retiree pensions.  The ability of households to 

borrow has also shrunk as underwriting standards have tightened, placing more weight on 

existing debt obligations of consumers.  For households trying to navigate these 

difficulties, the work that many of you do to directly help consumers deal with the legal 

dimensions of their financial lives is of great importance.  I commend you for your 

ongoing and persistent contributions to stabilizing family and community life in our 

country. 

 One aspect of the financial crisis that touches directly on your work is foreclosure.  

As you well know--and in fact you were among the first to predict the problem--millions 

of homeowners have gone through foreclosure in recent years; many more will go 

through it in the near future; and countless others are struggling to keep their payments 

current even as the housing market and the overall economy make it hard to do so.
