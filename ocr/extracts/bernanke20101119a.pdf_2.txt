The global economy is now well into its second year of recovery from the deep 

recession triggered by the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression.  In 

the most intense phase of the crisis, as a financial conflagration threatened to engulf the 

global economy, policymakers in both advanced and emerging market economies found 

themselves confronting common challenges.  Amid this shared sense of urgency, national 

policy responses were forceful, timely, and mutually reinforcing.  This policy 

collaboration was essential in averting a much deeper global economic contraction and 

providing a foundation for renewed stability and growth.   

In recent months, however, that sense of common purpose has waned.  Tensions 

among nations over economic policies have emerged and intensified, potentially 

threatening our ability to find global solutions to global problems.  One source of these 

tensions has been the bifurcated nature of the global economic recovery:  Some 

economies have fully recouped their losses while others have lagged behind.  But at a 

deeper level, the tensions arise from the lack of an agreed-upon framework to ensure that 

national policies take appropriate account of interdependencies across countries and the 

interests of the international system as a whole.  Accordingly, the essential challenge for 

policymakers around the world is to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial 

outcome--namely, a robust global economic expansion that is balanced, sustainable, and 

less prone to crises.   

The Two-Speed Global Recovery 

International policy cooperation is especially difficult now because of the two-

speed nature of the global recovery.  Specifically, as shown in figure 1, since the recovery 

began, economic growth in the emerging market economies (the dashed blue line) has far
