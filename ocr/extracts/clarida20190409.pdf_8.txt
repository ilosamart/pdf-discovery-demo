policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the 

inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to 

undershoot the inflation target).  Central banks are generally believed to have effective 

tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the effective lower bound on 

interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely.  Persistent inflation shortfalls 

carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become 

anchored below the stated inflation goal.16 

In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup” 

strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation 

deviations from target.  Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a 

multiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the 

price level around a constant growth path.17  These strategies could be implemented 

either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances.  For 

example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the 

ELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on 

                                                 
16 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be 
insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB.  For related discussions, see Reifschneider 
and Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016). 
17 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB 
entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion.  Nessén and 
Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting.  There 
is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.  Central banks 
that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon--
typically a couple years ahead or over the “medium run”--without regard to past inflation deviations.  One 
exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of “2-3 per cent, on 
average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence.  However, 
Ruge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts 
observed in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation goal.  The only known 
historical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933 when the country 
abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level.  The temporary adoption of 
price-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome that contrasted with that 
in countries that stayed on the gold standard.  See Berg and Jonung (1999).
