home equity to pay for emergency health expenses or their children’s college educations.  

Mobility may be affected to some degree; underwater borrowers who have difficulty 

selling their homes may find it more difficult to move to take new jobs.  Moreover, 

homeowners with underwater mortgages may find it difficult or impossible to take 

advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages, even if they are current on 

their payments.

The state of housing and mortgage markets may also be holding back the recovery 

of our financial system and the normalization of credit conditions.  Mortgage 

delinquencies surged between 2007 and 2009 and remain high, imposing losses on 

lenders, mortgage insurers, and investors.  Although some of the losses were the result of 

poorly underwritten mortgages, an increasing share of losses have arisen from prime 

mortgages that were originally fully documented with significant down payments, but 

that have defaulted due to the weak economy and housing market.  The Federal Reserve 

and other bank regulators have used stress tests and other tools to help ensure that banks 

have enough capital to cover mortgage losses while continuing to lend.  On the margin, 

though, some lenders might be inclined to respond to losses by tightening credit terms or 

being more cautious about extending loans rather than by raising additional capital.

 The effect of bank capital on lending is a critical determinant of the linkage between financial conditions 

and real activity, and has received special attention in the recent financial crisis.  Modest effects of bank 

capital ratio changes on lending are reported in Jose M. Berrospide and Rochelle M. Edge (2010), “The 

Effects of Bank Capital on Lending:  What Do We Know, and What Does It Mean?”  International Journal 

of Central Banking, vol. 6 (December), pp. 5-54.

an important role in determining asset prices and economic activity, see Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Sim
