within the Districts they serve for many years.  We believe this approach ensures that 

Federal Reserve supervision of community banks is consistent and disciplined but also 

reflects a local perspective that can take account of differences in regional economic 

conditions.  For example, in the Midwest, where many community banks specialize in 

agricultural lending, Federal Reserve examiners maintain a special expertise in the 

agricultural economy and the associated lending practices.  They also draw frequently on 

the expertise of regional and agricultural economists in the Districts to maintain an up-to-

date understanding of local conditions.  So while many bankers tell us that Federal 

Reserve examiners are analytical and tough, few tell us that they are unfair or uninformed 

about whatâ€™s going on in the local economy.  We believe that this kind of response 

speaks to the effectiveness of our supervisory program for community banks, and we take 

pride in the professionalism and quality of our community bank examiners.   

One particularly valuable aspect of our federal structure is that, over the years, it 

has provided policymakers in Washington with a way to keep in close touch with the 

continent-spanning, highly varied economy of the United States.  When I attend board of 

directors meetings at regional Reserve Banks, which I do regularly, one of the most 

interesting portions is the go-round, during which each director provides his or her 

perspective on local economic developments.  Quite often, the directors who are 

community bankers provide some of the most valuable contributions.  That fact should 

not be surprising.  By their nature, community banks interact with many parts of the area 

economy--consumers, small businesses, large businesses, real estate developers, even 

local governments.  This breadth of vision, together with a good sense of the underlying 

economic forces at work in each locality, gives community bankers a unique perspective
