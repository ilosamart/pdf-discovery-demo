higher inflation and inflation expectations in the longer run, with no offsetting benefits in 

terms of greater output or employment.3 

Additionally, in some situations, a government that controls the central bank may 

face a strong temptation to abuse the central bank’s money-printing powers to help 

finance its budget deficit.  Nearly two centuries ago, the economist David Ricardo 

argued:  “It is said that Government could not be safely entrusted with the power of 

issuing paper money; that it would most certainly abuse it.…There would, I confess, be 

great danger of this, if Government--that is to say, the ministers--were themselves to be 

entrusted with the power of issuing paper money.”4  Abuse by the government of the 

power to issue money as a means of financing its spending inevitably leads to high 

inflation and interest rates and a volatile economy. 

These concerns about the effects of political interference on monetary policy are 

far from being purely theoretical, having been validated by the experiences of central 

banks around the world and throughout history.  In particular, careful empirical studies 

support the view that more-independent central banks tend to deliver better inflation 

outcomes than less-independent central banks, without compromising economic growth.5  

In light of all these considerations, it is no mystery why so many observers have come to 

see central bank independence as a critical component of a sound macroeconomic

pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (1978).  This problem is analyzed in the context of 
monetary policy by Barro and Gordon (1983).
