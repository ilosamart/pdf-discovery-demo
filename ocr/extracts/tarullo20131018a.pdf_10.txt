The single-point-of-entry approach does not involve a government guarantee that 

subsidizes systemic financial firms by protecting their investors from downside risk.  The 

resolution would result in a recapitalization of a failed firm by the firm’s own investors.  Any 

protection received by the creditors of a failed firm’s operating subsidiaries would be provided 

by the equity and debt holders of the failed firm’s parent holding company.  And even if any 

temporary losses were suffered by the government because of its provision of liquidity, Dodd-

Frank requires that the government be reimbursed through assessments on large financial firms. 

The work being done by the FDIC in building out its approach to Title II will continue, 

and the FDIC has indicated that it will explain this thinking in further detail in a public release 

later this year.  In addition to the FDIC’s work, there are other ways that the credibility of Title II 

can be enhanced.  For example, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC can use their joint 

responsibility for overseeing the resolution plans, which are required by Dodd-Frank, for large, 

prudentially regulated firms to improve the resolvability of systemically important financial 

institutions.6  The largest U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations 

submitted their first annual resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in 2012 and 

have recently submitted a second round of resolution plans.  These plans have yielded valuable 

information that is being used to identify, assess, and mitigate key challenges to resolvability 

under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and to support the FDIC’s development of backup resolution 
                                                 
6 Dodd-Frank Section 165(d), 12 U.S.C. §5365(d).  Resolution plans are also required of non-bank financial firms 
designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as of systemic importance and thereby subject to supervision 
by the Federal Reserve.  These plans are also useful supervisory tools that have helped the Federal Reserve and the 
firms focus on opportunities to simplify corporate structures and improve management systems in ways that will 
help the firms be more resilient and efficient, as well as easier to resolve.  Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve 
issued supervisory guidance relating to operational resilience, including supervisory expectations regarding 
collateral management; payment, clearing, and settlement activities; liquidity and funding; management information 
systems; and shared and outsourced services.  This guidance was informed by the cross-firm comparative review of 
the first round of resolution plans and reflected initial supervisory judgments of those practices and capabilities 
necessary to support effective recovery and resolution planning efforts.  Going forward, supervisory assessments 
will require firms to demonstrate their capabilities in these areas.  The resolution planning process has been designed 
to be iterative; there is still much work to be done in this area by firms, domestic and foreign supervisors, and 
national governments.
