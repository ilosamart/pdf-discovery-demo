Nonetheless, if the decline in homeownership among young people proves 

persistent, the implications for asset building for the future could be of concern, since 

homeownership remains an important avenue for accumulating wealth, particularly for 

those with limited means.  Even after taking into account the risks associated with 

homeownership that were brought into sharp focus by the financial crisis, there is still a 

strong case that homeownership positively contributes to household balance sheets.27  

The benefit is largely due to the forced savings associated with homeownership--not just 

for the down payment, but also for the regular monthly paydown of principal.  While 

renters could, in theory, save and invest money on a monthly basis to achieve a similar 

result, the evidence suggests most do not.  

Moreover, study after study has shown that homeownership positively contributes 

to the wealth accumulation of lower-income and minority households, albeit in smaller 

amounts than for higher-income and white households.28  This finding is particularly 

important because housing also accounts for the majority of the assets held by these 

households.  Lower-income and minority renters, on the other hand, have been found to 

accrue little or no wealth over time.29
