for taking this action to facilitate transfers of ownership of small banks.  For example, while 

exempting more bank holding companies could result in increased leverage, subsidiary banks 

remain subject to normal capital requirements.  Supervisory and applications approval processes 

are available to limit instances in which holding companies could take on excessive debt.  

Similarly, because most bank holding companies under $1 billion have limited activities outside 

of their banks, and we will still receive detailed quarterly bank data, the reduced regulatory 

reporting requirements for qualifying holding companies should not be problematic for 

supervisors. 

Of course, the policy statement was issued by the Board and thus one might think the 

Board could raise the threshold on its own.  However, the Collins amendment to Dodd-Frank19 

effectively eliminates any authority of the Board to extend the capital treatment in the policy 

statement to holding companies with assets greater than the threshold in effect on May 19, 2010, 

or to savings and loan holding companies of any size.  Thus, we would need legislative action to 

effect these changes.  

Tiered Supervision 

Federal banking regulators have long organized supervision into portfolios of institutions 

based predominantly—though for larger firms, not exclusively—on asset size.  Various 

provisions of Dodd-Frank motivated the Federal Reserve to modify the composition of the 

portfolios somewhat.  We have four such groups: (1) community banks, (2) regional banking 

organizations, (3) large banking organizations, and (4) firms overseen by the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC).20  This arrangement is not simply a matter of

organizations are those with total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion, large banking organizations are those 

with total assets over $50 billion, and LISCC firms are the subset of large banking organizations that are largest and
