SCAP teams, and the judgment of supervisors and other experts. The breadth and depth of the 

resources brought to bear in formulating these estimates are unparalleled. 

• The estimates are not forecasts or expected outcomes; they are the products of a two-year-

ahead ‘what-if’ exercise conducted under two alternative macro scenarios. Roughly speaking, 

the first scenario--referred to as the "baseline"--was an assumed path for the economy that 

followed the then-current consensus forecast, and the second--the "more adverse" scenario--

was a deeper and more protracted downturn than the consensus. Not only is it virtually certain 

that the economy will not evolve in lockstep with either of these scenarios, but there were also 

other factors that had to be assumed constant for the purpose of conducting this exercise, and 

any of those factors could change materially from what was implicitly or explicitly assumed in 

this process. 

• The SCAP was a deliberately stringent test. It was designed to account for the highly uncertain 

financial and economic conditions by identifying the extent to which a BHC is vulnerable today 

to a weaker than expected economy in the future. By ensuring that these large BHCs have a 

capital buffer now that is robust to a range of economic outcomes, this exercise counters the 

risk that uncertainty itself exerts contractionary pressures on the banking system and the 

economy. In the event the economy weakens more than expected, the firms will have adequate 

capital; in the event the economy follows the expected path, or an even stronger path, the firms 

will still be viewed as stronger today for having higher levels of capital in an uncertain world. 

• The SCAP focused not only on the amount of capital but also on the composition of capital held 

by each of the 19 BHCs. That is, SCAP assessed the level of the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and 

the proportion of Tier 1 capital that is common equity.2 [Footnote 2. Tier 1 capital, as defined in the 

Board's Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Guidelines, is composed of common and non-common equity 

elements, some of which are subject to limits on their inclusion in Tier 1 capital. See 12 CFR part 225, 

Appendix A, § II.A.1. These elements include common stockholders' equity, qualifying perpetual preferred 

stock, certain minority interests, and trust preferred securities. Certain intangible assets, including 

goodwill and deferred tax assets, are deducted from Tier 1 capital or are included subject to limits. 

See 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A, § II.B. End footnote 2.] The SCAP's emphasis on what is termed 

"Tier 1 Common capital" reflects the fact that common equity is the first element of the capital 

structure to absorb losses, offering protection to more senior parts of the capital structure and 

lowering the risk of insolvency. All else equal, more Tier 1 Common capital gives a BHC greater 

permanent loss absorption capacity and a greater ability to conserve resources under stress by 

changing the amount and timing of dividends and other distributions. To determine the size of 

the SCAP buffer for each firm, supervisors used their estimates of each firm's losses and 

resources for the more adverse scenario to answer the following two questions: 

o If the economy follows the "more adverse" scenario, how much additional Tier 1 capital 

would an institution need today to be able to have a Tier 1 risk-based ratio in excess of 6 

percent at year-end 2010? 
o If the economy follows the "more adverse" scenario, how much additional Tier 1 

Common capital would an institution need today to have a Tier 1 Common capital risk-

based ratio in excess of 4 percent at year-end 2010?
