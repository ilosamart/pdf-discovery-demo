Practical Proposals for the Stabilisation of the 

Value of Money

“According to our line of approach, they [proposals for stabilizing the 

value of money] can attain their objective only in so far as they exert 

an indirect influence on the money rate of interest, and bring it into line 

with the natural rate …” (p.188)

But “This does not mean that the [central] banks ought actually to 

ascertain the natural rate before fixing their own rates of interest.  ….. 

The procedure should rather be simply as follows: So long as prices 

remain unaltered, the banks’ rate of interest is to remain unaltered.  If 

prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised …… “ and likewise 

mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.  (p.189)
