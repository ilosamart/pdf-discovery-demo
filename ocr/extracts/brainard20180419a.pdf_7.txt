History suggests that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards 

and an attendant increase in risky debt levels.  I would be reluctant to see our large banking 

institutions releasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the 

past few years, at a time when cyclical pressures and vulnerabilities in the broader financial 

system are building. 

Indeed, if cyclical pressures continue to build and financial vulnerabilities broaden, it 

may become appropriate to ask the largest banking organizations to build a countercyclical 

buffer (CCyB) of capital to maintain an adequate degree of resilience against stress.  The CCyB 

is an additional margin of capital that the nationâ€™s largest banks can be asked to build to sustain 

resilience when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often follow periods of 

rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth.  This buffer is intended to be released as the 

economy weakens in order to allow banks to lend more when it is most needed.  Countercyclical 

capital requirements can lean against rising financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of 

monetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent with 

the dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability.  Moreover, countercyclical capital 

requirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy. 

The CCyB framework, which was finalized in September 2016, requires the Federal 

Reserve Board to vote at least once per year on the level of the CCyB.  While other jurisdictions 

have developed some experience with the use of countercyclical buffers, in the United States, the 

CCyB has so far not yet been activated.  The condition set out in September 2016 for raising the 

CCyB above its minimum value of zero is that financial system vulnerabilities are meaningfully 

above normal.
