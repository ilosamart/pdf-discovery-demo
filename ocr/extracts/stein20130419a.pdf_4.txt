perhaps the most fundamental and a natural starting point for discussion.  By way of 

motivation, note that before the financial crisis, we had a highly developed regime of 

capital regulation for banks--albeit one that looks inadequate in retrospect--but we did not 

have formal regulatory standards for their liquidity.3  The introduction of liquidity 

regulation after the crisis can be thought of as reflecting a desire to reduce dependence on 

the central bank as a lender of last resort (LOLR), based on the lessons learned over the 

previous several years.  However, to the extent that some role for the LOLR still remains, 

one now faces the question of how it should coexist with a regime of liquidity regulation. 

To address this question, it is useful to take a step back and ask another one:  

What underlying market failure is liquidity regulation intended to address, and why can’t 

this market failure be handled entirely by an LOLR?  I will turn to this question first.  

Next, I will consider different mechanisms that could potentially achieve the goals of 

liquidity regulation, and how these mechanisms relate to various features of the LCR.  In 

so doing, I hope to illustrate why, even though liquidity regulation is a close cousin of 

capital regulation, it nevertheless presents a number of novel challenges for policymakers 

and why, as a result, we are going to have to be open to learning and adapting as we go. 

The Case for Liquidity Regulation 

One of the primary economic functions of banks and other financial 

intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, is to provide liquidity--that is, cash on demand--in 

various forms to their customers.  Some of this liquidity provision happens on the 

liability side of the balance sheet, with bank demand deposits being a leading example.  

But, importantly, banks also provide liquidity via committed lines of credit.  Indeed, it is 

                                                 
3 Although bank liquidity was not regulated prior to the crisis, it played an important part in the supervisory 
process.  For example, in the CAMELS ratings used by supervisors, the “L” stands for “liquidity.”
