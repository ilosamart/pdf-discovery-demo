This observation then raises the question of why monetary policy might be able to 

influence real term premiums.  Here is where we draw our inspiration from Raghu’s 

work, in particular his hypothesis that low nominal interest rates can create incentives for 

certain types of investors to take added risk in an effort to “reach for yield.”  While an 

emerging body of empirical research investigates this hypothesis in the context of credit 

risk--documenting that banks tend to make riskier loans when rates are low--our focus is 

instead on the implications of the reach-for-yield mechanism on the pricing of interest 

rate risk, also known as duration risk.

The theory we sketch involves a set of “yield-oriented” investors.  We assume 

that these investors allocate their portfolios between short- and long-term Treasury bonds 

and, in doing so, put some weight not just on expected holding-period returns, but also on 

current income.  This preference for current yield could be due to agency or accounting 

considerations that lead these investors to care about short-term measures of reported 

performance.  A reduction in short-term nominal rates leads them to rebalance their 

portfolios toward longer-term bonds in an effort to keep their overall yield from declining 

too much.  This, in turn, creates buying pressure that raises the price of the long-term 

bonds and hence lowers long-term yields and forward rates.  

Thus, according to this theory, an easing of monetary policy affects long-term real 

rates not via the usual expectations channel, but rather via what might be termed a 

“recruitment” channel--by causing an outward shift in the demand curve of yield-oriented

 The idea that banks take on more credit risk when rates are low is explored in, for example, Gabriel 

Jiménez, Steven Ongena, José-Luis Peydró, and Jesús Saurina (forthcoming), “Hazardous Times for 

Monetary Policy:  What Do 23 Million Bank Loans Say about the Effects of Monetary Policy on Credit 

Risk-Taking?” Econometrica.
