equity ratio has gone up from 7 percent to 11 percent for these institutions.  The increase 

in the ratios understates the increase in capital because it does not adjust for tougher risk 

weights in the denominator.  In addition, the buffers of HQLAs held by the largest 

banking firms have more than doubled since the end of 2007, and their reliance on short-

term wholesale funds has fallen considerably. 

At the same time, the introduction of macroeconomic supervisory stress tests in 

the United States has added a forward-looking approach to assessing capital adequacy, as 

firms are required to hold a capital buffer sufficient to withstand a several-year period of 

severe economic and financial stress.  The stress tests are a very important addition to the 

toolkit of supervisors, one that is likely to add significantly to the quality of financial 

sector supervision. 

 Macroprudential Policy and Supervision 

In practice, there are two uses of the term “macroprudential supervision.”8  The 

first relates to the supervision of the financial system as a whole, with an emphasis on 

interactions among financial markets and institutions.  The second relates to the use of 

regulatory or other non-interest-rate tools of policy to deal with problems arising from the 

behavior of asset prices.9  For instance, when central bank governors are asked how they 

propose to deal with the problem of rising housing prices at a time when the central bank 

for macroeconomic reasons does not want to raise the interest rate, they generally reply 

8 The word “macroprudential” appears to have been invented in the late 1970s and was used by Andrew 
Crockett and others at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in the 1990s and later.  It began to come 
into central banker usage in the first decade of this century.  But it was the consequences of the failure of 
Lehman Brothers that made it a household word.  See Piet Clement (2010) “The Term ‘Macroprudential’: 
Origins and Evolution,” BIS Quarterly Review, March, pp. 59-67.
