new structure of macroprudential supervision and regulation in the United States, and 

explain how we at the Fed are doing our part to implement the macroprudential approach 

to financial oversight.  

Macroprudential Supervision and Regulation 

Ultimately, the goal of macroprudential supervision and regulation is to minimize 

the risk of financial disruptions that are sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage 

on the broader economy.  The systemic orientation of the macroprudential approach may 

be contrasted with that of the traditional, or “microprudential,” approach to regulation 

and supervision, which is concerned primarily with the safety and soundness of 

individual institutions, markets, or infrastructures. 

Relative to traditional regulation and supervision, executing a macroprudential 

approach to oversight can involve heavier informational requirements and more-complex 

analytic frameworks.  In particular, because of the highly interconnected nature of our 

financial system, macroprudential oversight must be concerned with all major segments 

of the financial sector, including financial institutions, markets, and infrastructures; it 

must also place particular emphasis on understanding the complex linkages and 

interdependencies among institutions and markets, as these linkages determine how 

instability may be propagated throughout the system.  Moreover, broadly speaking, 

macroprudential regulators must be concerned with at least two types of risks.  The first 

type encompasses aspects of the structure of the financial system--such as gaps in 

regulatory coverage or the evolution of shadow banking--that pose ongoing risks to 

financial stability.  The second class of risks are those that vary over time with financial
