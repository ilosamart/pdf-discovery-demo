Contrast this approach with the communications required of central banks when targeting 

a specific inflation rate.  For example, central banks targeting a 2 percent inflation rate typically 

put that target prominently on their webpage.  If those banks were instead targeting a price level 

growing at 2 percent, their webpages would have to provide a table of inflation rate targets for a 

variety of horizons, and the targets would change each month.  I fear that rather than anchoring 

people’s expectations about prices, it could leave them perplexed.   

As you can tell, I see compelling reasons why central banks should stick to their current 

inflation objectives.  Those reasons relate most importantly to the effect of a central bank’s 

communications and behavior on its credibility and on the public’s expectations.  More study 

leading to a better understanding of the linkage between central bank actions and expectation 

formation should improve the ability of central banks to achieve society’s inflation and output 

objectives more effectively under a variety of circumstances, including in a severe negative 

shock of the type we recently experienced. 

Conclusion 

 Many central bankers and economists, myself included, were a little complacent coming 

into the crisis.  We thought we knew enough about the basic structure of the markets and the 

economy to achieve economic and price stability with relatively minor perturbations.  And we 

thought we had the tools necessary to deal with liquidity shortages and maldistributions.  The 

reality is that we didn’t understand the economy as well as we thought we did.  Central bankers, 

along with other policymakers, professional economists and the private sector failed to foresee or 

prevent a financial crisis that resulted in very serious unemployment and loss of wealth around 

the world.  We must learn from our experience.  The questions I’ve posed are tough, but
