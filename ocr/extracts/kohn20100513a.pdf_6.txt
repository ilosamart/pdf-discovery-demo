Among other things, the structures exposed the banking system to risks that neither participants 

in financial markets nor regulators fully appreciated.  Banks became dependent on liquid markets 

to distribute the loans they had originated.  And some parts of the securitized loans were sold to 

off-balance-sheet entities in which long-term assets were funded by short-term borrowing with 

implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees provided by the banks.  Securitization markets essentially 

collapsed when banks became unwilling to increase their exposure to such risks during the crisis, 

when the liquidity guarantees were invoked, and when other lenders in securitization markets 

became unwilling to supply credit.    

Although the Federal Reserve’s lending actions during the crisis were innovative and to 

some degree unprecedented, they were based on sound legal and economic foundations.  Our 

lending to nonbank institutions was grounded in clear authority found in section 13(3) of the 

Federal Reserve Act permitting a five-member majority of the Federal Reserve Board to 

authorize a Reserve Bank to lend to individuals, partnerships, or corporations in “unusual and 

exigent circumstances.”  These actions also generally adhered to Walter Bagehot’s dictum, a 

time-honored central banking principle for countering a financial panic:  Lend early and freely to 

solvent institutions at a penalty rate and against good collateral.3

  Central banks are uniquely 

equipped to carry out this mission.  They regularly lend to commercial banks against a wide 

variety of collateral and have the infrastructure to value and perfect their interest in the 

underlying collateral.  During a panic, market functioning is typically severely impaired, with 

investors fleeing toward the safest and most liquid assets, and the resulting lack of liquidity, even 

for sound banks with sound assets, can result in funding pressures for financial institutions and 

others.  By lending to solvent institutions against illiquid collateral, central banks effectively step
