sale.  While the numbers are difficult to measure precisely, we estimate that in the second 

quarter of 2011, roughly 500,000 to 600,000 of the 2 million vacant homes for sale in the 

United States were REO properties.  This extra supply is particularly problematic because 

demand is quite low.  High unemployment and tight credit standards are currently 

precluding many families from buying homes, and other potential buyers may be staying 

out of the market due to uncertainty about their incomes.  Even ignoring the potential 

inventory represented by the large backlog of distressed loans that have not yet been 

foreclosed upon, the current inventory of existing homes for sale represents 

approximately nine months of sales compared with a norm of five to six months, 

suggesting additional pressure on house prices as the market struggles to clear the excess 

inventory.  Second, the downward pressure on prices is compounded by the high 

proportion of sales considered to be distressed sales.  Currently, around 40 percent of 

sales transactions are considered to be distressed sales--that is, short sales or sales of 

REO properties.  And third, high vacancy rates and the low level of maintenance that 

often characterize foreclosed properties make a neighborhood a less desirable place to 

live and thus depress the value of surrounding homes.2    

In contrast to the market for owner-occupied houses, the market for rental housing 

has been strengthening of late.  For example, apartment rents have turned up in the past 

year, and vacancy rates on multifamily rental properties have dropped noticeably.  The 

relative strength of the rental market reflects increased demand as families who are 

unable or unwilling to purchase homes because of tight mortgage conditions or income
