in a more robust economy.  As I argued more fully in a recent speech, I believe that long-

term unemployment might fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6  

The low level of labor force participation may also signal additional slack that is 

not reflected in the headline unemployment rate.  Participation would be expected to fall 

because of the aging of the population, but the decline steepened in the recovery.  

Although economists differ over what share of those currently outside the labor market 

might join or rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy, my own view is that some 

portion of the decline in participation likely represents labor market slack.7   

Lastly, economists also look to wage pressures to signal a tightening labor market.  

At present, wage gains continue to proceed at a historically slow pace in this recovery, 

with few signs of a broad-based acceleration.  As the extent of slack we see today 

diminishes, however, the FOMC will need to monitor these and other labor market 

indicators closely to judge how much slack remains and, therefore, how accommodative 

monetary policy should be. 

Is inflation moving back toward 2 percent? 

A second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the 

recovery is whether inflation is moving back toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run 

objective, as envisioned in our baseline outlook.  As the most recent FOMC statement
