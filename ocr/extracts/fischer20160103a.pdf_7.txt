2014 and twice cut it further, most recently to minus 0.30 percent in December.  

The Riksbank has lowered its key repurchase agreement, or repo, rate to a similar 

level, while the central banks of Denmark and Switzerland have cut their key 

policy rates more deeply, to minus 0.75 percent, in large part to offset 

considerable appreciation pressures on their currencies.

In each of these countries, short-term money market rates declined along with 

policy rates.  Moreover, while it is hard to distinguish the effects of the rate cuts 

from those of concurrent asset purchase expansions, the easing appears to have 

been transmitted to assets of longer maturity and greater risk.  Bond yields and 

bank lending rates declined, and, in the euro area, the volume of lending to 

corporations and households picked up notably.  In addition, the rate cuts into 

negative territory have acted as expected through the exchange rate channel.  

Negative policy rates have generally not been associated with the problems that 

likely were anticipated.  Adverse effects on money market functioning have been 

limited.  Cash holdings have not risen significantly in these countries, in part 

because of nonnegligible costs of insuring, storing, and transporting physical 

cash.  These favorable outcomes may be partly because significant shares of 

deposits at central banks in these countries are not subject to negative rates.  It is 

unclear how low policy rates can go before cash holdings rise or other problems 

intensify, but the European experience has certainly shown that zero is not the 

effective lower bound in those countries.

Could negative interest rates be a policy response that the Federal Reserve could 

choose to employ in a future crisis?  One possible concern with a strategy of this
