punch bowl” is always a challenge for central bankers, but that is true whether they are 

using traditional or nontraditional policy tools.  I can assure you that my colleagues and I 

will carefully consider how best to foster both of our mandated objectives, maximum 

employment and price stability, when the time comes to make these decisions. 

How Does the Fed’s Monetary Policy Affect Savers and Investors? 
 
 The concern about possible inflation is a concern about the future.  One concern 

in the here and now is about the effect of low interest rates on savers and investors.  My 

colleagues and I know that people who rely on investments that pay a fixed interest rate, 

such as certificates of deposit, are receiving very low returns, a situation that has involved 

significant hardship for some. 

However, I would encourage you to remember that the current low levels of 

interest rates, while in the first instance a reflection of the Federal Reserve’s monetary 

policy, are in a larger sense the result of the recent financial crisis, the worst shock to this 

nation’s financial system since the 1930s.  Interest rates are low throughout the developed 

world, except in countries experiencing fiscal crises, as central banks and other 

policymakers try to cope with continuing financial strains and weak economic conditions. 

A second observation is that savers often wear many economic hats.  Many savers 

are also homeowners; indeed, a family’s home may be its most important financial asset.  

Many savers are working, or would like to be.  Some savers own businesses, and--

through pension funds and 401(k) accounts--they often own stocks and other assets.  The 

crisis and recession have led to very low interest rates, it is true, but these events have 

also destroyed jobs, hamstrung economic growth, and led to sharp declines in the values 

of many homes and businesses.  What can be done to address all of these concerns
