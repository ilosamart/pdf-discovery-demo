set of prudential requirements for large, internationally active banking firms.  These efforts 

include the agreements reached in December on the major elements of the new Basel III 

prudential framework for large, globally active banks.  Basel III should make the financial 

system more stable and reduce the likelihood of future financial crises by requiring large banks 

to hold more and better-quality capital and more-robust liquidity buffers.  A more stable

We are working to adopt the Basel III framework in the United States in a timely manner. 

A central issue that we and the other banking agencies face in implementing Basel III in 

the United States is deciding how these capital rules will be applied for banks that are not 

systemic or internationally active.  We recognize the importance of striking the right balance 

between promoting safety and soundness throughout the banking system and keeping the 

compliance costs for smaller banking firms as low as possible.  Also, to minimize the impact of 

the new capital rules on credit availability while the global economy is still recovering, we and 

our international colleagues have agreed to allow long transition periods for the implementation 

of the new standards. 

In addition to stricter regulation and supervision of large financial firms, the Dodd-Frank 

Act places new checks on the growth by acquisition of our major financial firms.  It expands 

current restraints on acquisitions by bank holding companies to include a broader range of 

acquired firms (not just banks) and a broader range of liabilities (not just deposits).  This 

expansion reflects a financial system that has changed in important ways since 1994, when the 

Congress first adopted concentration limits for banks and bank holding companies.  

The act also imposes new restrictions on the capital markets activities of banking firms--

restrictions that will disproportionately affect the structure and profitability of the largest banking
