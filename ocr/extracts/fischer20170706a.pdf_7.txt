spots do exist:  Capital expenditure by leading IT companies--Google, Amazon, and the 

like--has soared since 2010, and investment in the energy sector has returned to life.  

Nevertheless, firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest. 

This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the 

policy environment.  By one measure, U.S. policy uncertainty was elevated for much of 

the recovery, subsided in 2013, and then rose again late last year, underpinned by 

uncertainty about policies associated with health care, regulation, taxes, and trade.10  

Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues, but 

mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future 

direction of government policy is highly desirable--particularly if the direction of policy 

itself is desirable.   

Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as 

well.  For example, the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity 

in the 1950s and 1960s.11  That highway system and many other federally supported 

roadways, waterways, and structures have been neglected in recent years.  Indeed, real 

infrastructure spending (that is, adjusting for inflation) has fallen nearly 1 percent per 

year since 2005.12  This area of government investment deserves more attention. 

                                                 
output has returned to its apparent long-run trend.  That said, Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2017) argue that 
the recent rapid declines in the price of IT capital may presage an uptick in investment in response. 
10 As discussed in Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012), the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, 
available on the EPU website at www.policyuncertainty.com, is constructed from component measures for 
references to policy uncertainty in major newspapers, the number of tax code provisions set to expire in 
future years, and disagreement among economic forecasters. 
11 See Fernald (1999). 
12 Although the share of nominal public spending devoted to infrastructure in recent years has been similar 
to the share dating back to the 1980s, Congressional Budget Office (2015) notes that real spending has been 
held down by the relatively rapid increase in the price of inputs used for construction.
