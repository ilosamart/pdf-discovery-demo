Most recently, we are also seeing welcome signs of progress on the second leg of 

our dual mandate after a protracted period of shortfalls from the FOMC target of 2 

percent inflation.  Recent months have seen a step-up in longer-run inflation 

compensation, which had dropped to worrisomely low levels last year raising concerns 

about a softening of inflation expectations to the downside.  Both market- and some 

survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain somewhat low, but there has 

been some movement in the right direction in the past few months.  Inflation has moved 

up lately as the effect of past increases in the dollar and declines in energy prices have 

faded.  The 12-month change in headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 

prices was 1.9 percent in January, although this partly reflects a temporary boost from 

energy prices.  Core PCE inflation--which strips out volatile food and energy prices and 

is a good gauge of future inflation--has also increased.  At 1.7 percent in January, the 12-

month change is 0.1 percentage point higher than a year ago.  Still, core inflation has 

been below our 2 percent target for almost all of the past eight years, and further progress 

is necessary to reach and sustain our symmetric inflation goal.   

Recent indicators of aggregate spending suggest we will continue to edge closer 

to our goals in the months ahead.  Consumption growth has been encouraging, supported 

by continued job gains, rising wealth, and greater confidence.  Business investment 

changed little the past two years, but there are currently signs of renewed growth.  The 

contrast with the situation a year ago is sharp.  Then, risk spreads on corporate bonds had 

risen noticeably--often a precursor to downturns--measures of business sentiment were 

relatively depressed, and corporate profits had declined over 10 percent.  In recent 

quarters, the environment has become more favorable.  Risk spreads have moved back
