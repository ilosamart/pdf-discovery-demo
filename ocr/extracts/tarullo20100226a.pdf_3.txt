liability side of bank balance sheets, in the form of more-attractive savings vehicles such 

as money market mutual funds, and on the asset side, with the growth of public capital 

markets and international competition.  Large commercial banks reacted, among other 

ways, by seeking removal or relaxation of the regulations that confined bank activities, 

affiliations, and geographic reach--a request to which supervisory agencies and 

legislators were generally sympathetic because of the potential threat to the viability of 

the traditional commercial banking system.   

The period of relative legal and industry stability that followed the New Deal 

legislation thus gave way in the 1970s to a nearly 30-year period during which many 

prevailing restrictions on banks were relaxed, both through administrative action by the 

bank regulatory agencies and through a series of legislative changes culminating in the 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.  By the turn of the century, the Depression-era cluster 

of restrictions on commercial banks had been replaced by a regulatory environment in 

which they could operate nationally, conduct a much broader range of activities, and 

affiliate with virtually any kind of financial firm.  

These changes enabled a series of acquisitions that resulted in a number of very 

large, highly complex financial holding companies centered on large commercial banks.  

At the same time, independent investment banks had grown into a group of very large, 

complex, and highly leveraged firms.  Of course, financial engineering had been rapidly 

changing the character of the financial services sector as a whole.  Among other things, 

securitization and associated derivative instruments were merging capital markets and 

traditional lending activities, thereby fueling the growth of the shadow banking system.
