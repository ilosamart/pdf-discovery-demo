$100,000, with substantial numbers of these applying for less than $25,000.17  However, smaller 

firms often struggle to qualify for bank credit, and among firms that were denied, low credit 

scores and insufficient credit history were the most frequently cited reasons.  In addition, our 

survey suggests that some low-credit-risk minority- and women-owned firms are less likely than 

low-risk white-owned and male-owned firms to receive financing; and if they are approved, it is 

for less than the amount sought.18 

Second, there have been shifts in the composition of commercial bank lending to small 

businesses.  Large banks’ share of small business lending has grown, especially among the 

smallest loans.  This represents a change from 20 years ago when small businesses relied more 

on a relationship with local community banks for access to credit.  For loans under $100,000, 

small banks of less than $1 billion in assets now hold a 19 percent share, down from 60 percent 

two decades ago.  Today, it is the largest banks--those with greater than $50 billion in assets--

that account for more than 60 percent.  Some of this trend may be due to industry consolidation, 

which has reduced the number of very small banks.   

The composition of credit offered also is shifting.  Loans entail high fixed costs that are 

roughly the same regardless of whether a loan is for $100,000 or $1 million, reducing the 

profitability of smaller-dollar loans.19  Our data suggest that the growing share of small business 

                                                            
17 While there are many working definitions of “small,” figures from the Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS) use 
firms with less than 500 employees as a proxy for small businesses. Some 28 percent are seeking credit in amounts 
less than $25,000 and 42 percent reported seeking between $25,000 and $100,000. The SBCS is available at

18 According to special analyses of the Joint Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit Survey, among low- 
credit-risk firms, 60 percent of minority firms that were approved received only partial funding, whereas 68 percent 
of low-risk, non-minority firms were approved for the full amount of financing requested. Women-owned firms also 
reported a funding gap. Among low-credit-risk firms, 48 percent of women-owned firms received all of the 
financing requested, compared to 57 percent of men-owned firms. Reports are available at
