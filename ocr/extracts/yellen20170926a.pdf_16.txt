Policy Implications 

What are the policy implications of these uncertainties?  For one, my colleagues 

and I must be ready to adjust our assessments of economic conditions and the outlook 

when new data warrant it.  In this spirit, FOMC participants--like private forecasters--

have reduced their estimates of the sustainable unemployment rate appreciably over the 

past few years in response to the continual flow of information about the always changing 

economy.27  To the extent these assessments change over time, so too will the outlook 

and judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Importantly, even if 

resource utilization is currently lower than we estimate or if longer-run inflation 

expectations are running at levels consistent with longer-run PCE price inflation 

somewhat below 2 percent, the FOMC can still achieve its inflation goal.  Under those 

conditions, continuing to revise our assessments in response to incoming data would 

naturally result in a policy path that is somewhat easier than that now anticipated--an 

appropriate course correction that would reflect our commitment to maximum 

employment and price stability. 

Similar considerations apply to other important sources of uncertainty, such as the 

value of the neutral real interest rate--that is, the inflation-adjusted level of the federal 

funds rate consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.  Estimates of 

this rate have declined considerably in recent years, and, by some estimates, the real 

neutral rate is currently close to zero.  But the neutral rate changes over time as a result of 

the interaction of many forces, including demographics, productivity growth, fiscal 

                                                 
27 The median of FOMC participantsâ€™ projections of the longer-run unemployment rate has declined almost 
a full percentage point over the past five years; the revision in the long-run consensus forecast reported in 
the Blue Chip Survey between October 2012 and March 2017 was slightly larger.
