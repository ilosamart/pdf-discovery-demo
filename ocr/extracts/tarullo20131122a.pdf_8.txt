because the securities still required financing during the day, cash borrowers relied on 

uncommitted secured credit, backed by their overall portfolio of securities and provided by the 

clearing bank.  Transactions were re-wound at the end of the day, with specific securities 

allocated as collateral to each lender at that time.    

Cash lenders in the tri-party repo market thus came to expect that the two clearing banks 

would always unwind their maturing trades in the morning, returning cash to their account, 

despite the absence of a contractual provision requiring them to do so.  As a result, they grew 

comfortable in the belief that they held a cash-equivalent asset that was perfectly safe and liquid.  

But as the crisis deepened, cash lenders became aware of the fact that the clearing banks were 

not contractually obligated to unwind repo trades and that the dealers that were the primary 

borrowers in the tri-party repo market could fail, leaving lenders with collateral that they had 

little or no capacity to manage at a juncture when its value and liquidity was open to doubt.  This 

resulted in several distinct episodes during the crisis when cash lenders, despite holding 

collateral, quickly withdrew financing from dealers perceived to be facing potential financial 

distress.  The tri-party repo market might have suffered a full-scale run in the absence of public-

sector intervention. 

Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has led an effort to reduce reliance on intraday credit 

in the tri-party repo market.  Work to date has reduced the amount of intraday credit provided by 

the clearing banks from 100 percent of the tri-party repo market to approximately 30 percent, and 

commitments by market participants suggest that this amount will fall to 10 percent by the end of 

next year.  This operational change, in addition to enhancing the resiliency of the settlement 

process, should help limit the likelihood that tri-party repo lenders return to believing that 

lending in the tri-party repo market is a risk-free proposition.  As a result, tri-party repo lenders
