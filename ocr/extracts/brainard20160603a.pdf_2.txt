In recent months, financial conditions have eased, and there are encouraging signs 

that consumption has regained momentum.  On the other hand, there are tentative signs of 

slowing in the labor market and risks remain.1  We cannot take the resilience of our 

recovery for granted.   

Recent Developments 

 As we consider the appropriate posture of policy going forward, the most 

immediate question is whether the data provide confidence that domestic economic 

activity has strengthened notably following two disappointing quarters.  This is critical 

for making progress on the Committee’s dual mandate objectives of full employment and 

2 percent inflation.  The data in today’s labor market report on balance suggest that the 

labor market has slowed.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased at an average monthly 

pace of 116,000 over the last three months--well below the 220,000 per month average 

pace over the preceding twelve months.  The unemployment rate moved lower, reaching 

4.7 percent, a new low in the current recovery, but involuntary part-time employment 

increased and the labor force participation rate declined.   

Even so, there are reasons to expect that the labor supply still has room to respond 

if labor demand increases.  Importantly, the employment to population ratio for prime-

age workers still remains 1-3/4 percentage points below pre-crisis levels.  The recent data 

on wage inflation suggest a similar conclusion.  Although there have been some signs of 

increasing wage growth recently, the step-up has been modest, and growth in the broad 

measures of wages remains quite low.  For example, the average change over the past
