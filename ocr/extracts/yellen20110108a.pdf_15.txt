it makes sense to be prepared, and hence we have followed this “belt and suspenders” 

approach. 

Finally, we can sell portions of our holdings of MBS, agency debt, and Treasury 

securities if we determine that doing so is an appropriate way of tightening financial 

conditions when the time comes.  The redemption or sale of securities would have the 

effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as well as further 

reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system.  Restoring the size and 

composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term 

objective of our policies. Any such sales would be at a gradual pace, would be clearly 

communicated to market participants, and would entail appropriate consideration of 

economic conditions. 

In short, the range of tools we have developed will permit us to raise short-term 

interest rates and drain large volumes of reserves when it becomes necessary to achieve 

the policy stance that fosters our macroeconomic objectives--including the objective of 

maintaining price stability.   

Will the Asset Purchase Program Result in Adverse Financial Imbalances? 

The Committee’s intention in implementing asset purchases is to hold down the 

level of longer-term interest rates to make credit more affordable for businesses and 

households.  A reasonable fear is that this process could go too far, encouraging potential 

borrowers to employ excessive leverage to take advantage of low financing costs and 

leading investors to accept less compensation for bearing risks as they seek to enhance 

their rates of return in an environment of very low yields.
