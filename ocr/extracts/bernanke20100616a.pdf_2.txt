The Squam Lake Report--the centerpiece of this conference--is a valuable 

contribution to the ongoing analysis of the causes of the financial crisis and the 

appropriate policy responses.1  I commend the organizers for bringing together an 

impressive group of scholars both to produce the report and to continue the discussion of 

these important policy issues at this meeting.  

I think we all agree on the key questions facing financial regulators:  How do we 

strengthen the financial system and its oversight so as to minimize the risk of a replay of 

the recent financial crisis?  And should a crisis occur, how can we limit its economic 

costs?  The report identifies two core principles that should be among those that guide us 

in answering these questions.  First, financial policymakers and supervisors must 

consider more than the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, as 

important as that is; they should also consider factors, including interactions of 

institutions and markets, that can affect the stability of the financial system as a whole.  

In the jargon of economists and regulators, supervisors need a macroprudential as well as 

a microprudential perspective. 

The second core principle put forth in the report is that the stakeholders in 

financial firms--including shareholders, managers, creditors, and counterparties--must 

bear the costs of excessive risk-taking or poor business decisions, not the public.  The 

perception that some institutions are “too big to fail”--and its implication that, for those 

firms, profits are privatized but losses are socialized--must be ended.
