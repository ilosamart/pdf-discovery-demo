 Too many accounts of shoddy operating procedures--lost paperwork, slow 

response times, and sloppy recordkeeping--cast a dark shadow on this part of the industry 

that links mortgage borrowers and lenders.  The broad grant of delegated authority that 

servicers enjoy under pooling and servicing agreements (PSAs), combined with an 

effective lack of choice on the part of consumers, creates an environment ripe for abuse.  

Moreover, the inability of some servicers to maintain complete and accurate records, and 

to transfer servicing rights cleanly, causes additional uncertainties and vulnerabilities.  

 The impact of poor business practices can linger on even after the foreclosure 

sale.  In managing foreclosed properties in lenders’ inventories, servicers may be 

motivated by timeliness measures in PSAs to induce the former homeowner or bona fide 

tenant to vacate before they are legally required to do so, sometimes under the threat of 

eviction.  Once the properties are vacant, servicers exercise great discretion in deciding 

whether or not to repair foreclosed property based on the likelihood that the servicer’s 

advances are recoverable from the sale proceeds.  With real estate owned (REO) 

inventories projected to reach one million by the end of 2010, servicer actions will 

heavily influence the effectiveness of neighborhood stabilization efforts at a time of 

persistent decline in home values and in fragile markets already weakened by a glut of 

vacant and abandoned properties, particularly in low-wealth communities. 

 Finally, we face a cluster of problems surrounding loan modification.  Servicers’ 

significant concerns about the U.S. Treasury’s Home Affordable Modification Program 

(HAMP) are well-known.  That said, we do not know enough about how well servicers 

are complying with the requirements of that program, or whether all of the HAMP 

modifications that should be made are indeed being made.  Many servicers, in fact,
