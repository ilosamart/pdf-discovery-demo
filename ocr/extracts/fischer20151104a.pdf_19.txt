Conclusion 

The economic environment has changed considerably in the quarter-century since 

economists began the careful study of the theory and evidence on the potential benefits of 

monetary policy independence.  Over that time, central bankers have had to make use of 

their tools--some of them not used previously--to meet unprecedented challenges.  

Without the independence to pursue their mandates, this work would have been 

impossible.  But following the global financial crisis, we are living in a different world, 

one in which issues of financial stability have moved out of the shadows and into the 

center of our concerns.  The resulting challenges are only beginning to be understood--

and they need to be understood and taken seriously if we are to reduce the probability of 

future financial crises.
