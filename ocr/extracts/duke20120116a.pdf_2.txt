It is certainly a pleasure to be here at the University of Richmond and take part in 

the Robins Executive Speaker Series.  Tonight I have been asked to share with you some 

of the memorable experiences and amazing opportunities that have shaped my journey 

from theater major to part-time drive-through teller to Federal Reserve Governor.

I’ll describe how my banking career led me to a seat on the Federal Reserve Board and 

how that unique perspective helped me add value after I arrived there.  I will then explain

institution like no other.  I’ll end with a few thoughts that might resonate with the 

students in the audience as they conclude their studies and prepare to join the workforce.

 The president of the bank was a man named Burt Harrison.  Burt was an old-

fashioned community banker and a natural teacher.  He taught me everything he knew 

about banking, and that was plenty.  Fifteen years later, when he died suddenly of a
