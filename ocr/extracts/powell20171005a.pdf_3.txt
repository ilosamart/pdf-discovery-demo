Buffettâ€™s biography, The Snowball, and it is a good illustration of why we need the TMPG.  I 

reread that chapter every couple of years, and it still gives me nightmares.1    

After the dust settled, we had to grapple with the wider implications of the scandal for the 

market itself and particularly the role of regulatory oversight.  We certainly could have used a 

TMPG to help us with this work, but none existed at that time.  Our recommendations were 

summarized in a joint report to the Congress issued by the Treasury Department, the Securities 

and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Board.  Among the issues we 

considered were how to encourage a level playing field for all market participants, and when and 

where regulators should respond to the periodic technical difficulties the market sometimes 

experienced.   

  As we drew up the report, we were deeply aware of the importance that Treasury markets 

held for the American economy.  The sale of Treasury bonds, notes, and bills finances the U.S. 

government, and those securities are in turn a primary vehicle for savings for a wide range of 

U.S. households.  Treasury securities are also an important source of collateral within the 

financial system.  This last role has become all the more critical in recent years as regulations 

have required banks to hold larger amounts of high-quality liquid assets so that they can safely 

meet their potential liquidity needs.   

We also knew that, despite the misconduct by Salomon Brothers, Treasury markets 

generally worked quite well.  These markets are and have long been among the deepest and most 

liquid markets in the world.  It was important to make the auction system more robust to 

potential manipulation, and we made several recommendations to do so and to open up the
