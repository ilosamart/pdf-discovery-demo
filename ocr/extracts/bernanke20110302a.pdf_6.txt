ahead of--expectations.  Accordingly, considerably fewer states are facing midyear 

budget gaps that will need to be addressed before the end of the current fiscal year than 

the 40 or so that reported such gaps in 2009 and 2010. 

Much will depend on the continuation of the economic recovery.  If the economy 

continues to strengthen at about the pace projected by the Federal Reserve and many 

private forecasters, states and localities may start to get a little breathing space.  Tax 

collections will rise with income and spending, and the use of Medicaid and other income 

support programs should ease as the labor market improves.  However, because the pace 

of near-term economic growth expected by most forecasters is relatively modest given 

the depth of the downturn, some time will likely be required before state and local fiscal 

conditions return to something approximating normal. 

  Continued evidence that states and localities are addressing fiscal shortfalls 

should help calm the municipal bond market.  Generally, that market seems to be 

functioning reasonably well.  Around the turn of the year, though, investor concerns 

about the fiscal situations of many governments, including those of some populous states, 

resulted in increased yields on municipal bonds relative to Treasury bonds as well as a 

widening of credit default swap spreads for a number of states.  Fortunately, although 

these measures of risk in the municipal bond market remain elevated, they have been 

looking somewhat better recently, presumably reflecting expectations of continuing 

improvement in the finances of states and localities.  The Federal Reserve will continue 

to monitor the municipal bond market closely.
