long--could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28  Given that inflation 

has been running below the FOMC’s objective for several years now, such concerns 

reinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which 

remains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping 

return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29 

Before turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook 

and monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order.  The Phillips-curve approach to 

forecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed 

monetary policy decisionmaking around the globe.  But the theoretical underpinnings of 

the model are still a subject of controversy among economists.  Moreover, inflation 

sometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a 

                                                 
28 My interpretation of the historical evidence is that long-run inflation expectations become anchored at a 
particular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for 
many years.  For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary 
policy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation 
expectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future.  
Although such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and 
professional forecasters to shift their expectations, other members of the public are probably much less 
likely to do so.  Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had 
sufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for 
the average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policy--a process that might take years, based 
on U.S. experience.  Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke 
and others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows 
the adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative 
monetary regimes. 
29 Some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of 
labor costs.  In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation; 
indeed, the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral--in which higher price inflation led workers to push 
for higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs 
accelerated--was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s.  The wage-price spiral no 
longer seems to provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process.  In fact, some evidence suggests 
that, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a 
likely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.  
(See Peneva and Rudd, 2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.)  More generally, movements 
in labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements.  (This 
development does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information:  Because wage growth is 
influenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of 
how close the economy is to full employment.)
