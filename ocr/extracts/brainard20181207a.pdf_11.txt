Calibrating Policy over the Cycle 

The assessment of financial vulnerabilities that I have outlined naturally raises the 

following question for policymakers:  What is the appropriate risk tolerance?  It goes 

without saying we must take all appropriate steps to prevent another Great Financial 

Crisis from causing the greatest contraction in global economic activity since the Great 

Depression.  But it is also worth remembering that financial imbalances played a key role 

in each of the past three U.S. downturns--the risky investments and maturity mismatches 

associated with the savings and loan crisis and junk bond collapse; the tech boom and 

bust; and, most dramatically, the subprime crisis.  This suggests policy might seek to 

moderate financial vulnerabilities when they are likely to materially exacerbate an 

economic downturn, leading to deeper declines in output and higher levels of 

unemployment. 

Each of the past three U.S. recessions featured important financial imbalances, 

although they differed in important ways.  Both economic theory and econometric 

evidence point to the risk that excesses in corporate debt markets could similarly amplify 

adverse shocks and contribute to job losses.8  The economics are straightforward.  Over-

indebted businesses may face payment strains when earnings fall unexpectedly, and they 

may respond by pulling back on employment and investment.  The slowdown in activity 

lowers investor demand for risky assets, thereby raising spreads and depressing 

valuations.  In turn, business losses accumulate, and delinquencies and defaults rise, 

reducing the willingness or the ability of banks to lend.  This dynamic feeds on itself, 

                                                 
8 For example, López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017) present empirical evidence linking corporate debt 
excesses to contractions in U.S. economic activity and review related research.
