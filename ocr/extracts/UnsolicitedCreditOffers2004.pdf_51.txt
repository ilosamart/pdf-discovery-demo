Potential Effects of Further Restrictions on Written 
Offers of Credit or Insurance 

The fifth issue that section 213(e)(3) of the Fact Act asks the Board to address is 
“whether further restricting the ability of lenders and insurers to provide written offers of 
credit or insurance to consumers would affect: (i) the cost consumers pay to obtain credit 
or insurance; (ii) the availability of credit or insurance; (iii) consumers’ knowledge about 
new or alternative products and services; (iv) the ability of lenders or insurers to compete 
with one another; and (v) the ability to offer credit or insurance products to consumers 
who have been traditionally underserved.” 

As discussed in this report, it appears that written offers of credit and insurance sent 
directly to consumers, often resulting from prescreened solicitation lists using credit 
records in the files of CRAs, have the potential to increase competition in the market for 
the relevant consumer financial services. Available evidence suggests that the markets 
for credit cards and insurance have become more competitive over time, and it seems that 
prescreened solicitations have contributed to this development. 

As noted, the primary benefits of competition consist of lower prices and an increased 
availability of the product or service in question. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude 
that further restrictions on the ability of lenders and insurers to provide written offers of 
credit or insurance to consumers would on balance result in a less competitive 
marketplace and thus relatively higher prices and reduced availability. 

It is difficult to see how further restrictions on the ability of lenders and insurers to 
provide written offers of credit or insurance to consumers would improve the condition of 
those individuals or groups of individuals who might have been underserved in the past. 
More competition would presumably serve the interests of consumers better than less 
competition. Also, prescreening allows marketing to a larger audience of creditworthy 
individuals, including those in the low- and moderate-income bracket who have a need 
for credit but may not otherwise apply due to fear of being turned down. 

It also is difficult to see how reducing the amounts of direct, tailored information sent to 
consumers on the availability and pricing of financial services would improve their 
“knowledge about new or alternative products and services.” In today’s marketplace, 
consumers receive vast amounts of information about the availability of credit and 
insurance. Those sending the prescreened solicitations must tailor the offerings to the 
actual conditions of recipients because they must be “firm offers of credit or insurance.” 
Such information is much more likely to reflect actual market conditions than 
advertisements that have few restraints on the claims made or the characteristics of the 
underlying arrangements. Without prescreening, consumers would be less certain about 
whether or not they would qualify for favorable terms on the various credit or insurance
