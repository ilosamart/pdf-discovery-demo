decisions, thus strengthening the Bank of Japan’s autonomy in setting monetary policy. 

Although the Federal Reserve was established as an independent central bank in 

1913, its effective degree of independence has gradually increased over time.  Initially, 

the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency sat on the Board; they

of Board members from 10 years to 14 years; the long, staggered terms of Board 

members have also served as a brake on political influence.

well anchored.
