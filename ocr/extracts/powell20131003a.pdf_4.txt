community banking area.  As a new member of this subcommittee, I look forward to helping 

ensure that community bank concerns receive the attention they deserve in every Federal 

Reserve policy decision.  I also look forward to having the opportunity to help shape the 

important community banking research that is being conducted by staff across the Federal 

Reserve System.   

As Chairman Bernanke mentioned yesterday, this conference was conceived as a result of 

discussions that took place during a community bank subcommittee meeting.  I don’t know about 

you, but I think that, so far, the conference has been a great success.  The quality and policy-

relevance of papers presented here have been excellent.  This work will, no doubt, spur 

continued research as well as policy discussions about ways in which we can better tailor 

regulations to meet our legal and prudential goals while reducing burdens on smaller financial 

institutions. 

In my view, the research presented at this conference reaffirms the importance of 

community banks to our economy.  In the rest of my talk, I’ll try to summarize and tie together 

what I’ve learned from the research that has been presented,2 suggest some areas where further 

research would be helpful, and discuss what I believe should be the focus for supervision and 

regulation of community banks going forward. 

Yesterday afternoon’s session on the role of community banks provided ample evidence 

of their continued viability and importance.  The Lee and Williams paper provides evidence of 

the importance of small businesses to job creation in our economy and the important contribution 

that community bank lending makes to the survival of small businesses.  Focusing on start-ups,
