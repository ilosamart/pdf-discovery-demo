More than five years after the failure of Bear Stearns marked an escalation of the 

financial crisis, and nearly three years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, debate 

continues over the appropriate set of policy responses to protect against financial 

instability.  In recent months, there has been, in particular, a renewal of interest in 

additional measures to address the too-big-to-fail problem.  In some respects, the

fundamentals of financial regulation.   

 Continuing discussion of these issues is part of a protracted policy debate over 

financial regulatory reform.  Some argue that little has changed and that the needed 

reform is a single, dramatic policy change (though that single policy differs considerably

to ensure financial stability.  Still others contend that there has already been too much of 

a regulatory response, which is suppressing credit extension and faster economic 

recovery.   

 I think most of us would acknowledge, upon reflection, that a good bit has been 

done, or at least put in motion, to counteract the problems of too-big-to-fail and systemic

addressing the risks posed by short-term wholesale funding markets.  This afternoon I 

would like both to highlight the importance of what has already been accomplished and, 

at somewhat greater length, to identify what I believe to be the key steps that remain.  

Before turning to these subjects, though, I begin with a brief reprise of the origins of the
