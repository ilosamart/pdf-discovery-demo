path for the federal funds rate from the June SEP surrounded by a 70 percent confidence 

interval based on the historical accuracy of private and government forecasts.25  I 

reproduce that figure here (figure 10), updated for the September 2016 SEP.26  Note that 

the tan confidence interval in the figure is much wider than the disparity of views as 

represented by the central tendency of the projections (the black dashed lines).  This 

uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of our world, and it should probably feature more 

prominently in our communications. 

Conclusion 

To sum up, the FOMC and individual participants communicate a great deal these 

days--much more than in the past.  Some of those communications are designed to 

express the consensus, and some are designed to show the diversity of views.  In my 

view, communications should do more to emphasize the uncertainty that surrounds all 

economic forecasts, should downplay short-term tactical questions such as the timing of 

the next rate increase, and should focus the public’s attention instead on the 

considerations that go into making policy across the range of plausible paths for the 

economy. 

                                                 
25 The reason for the confidence interval is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus 
rarely evolves as predicted.  See Janet L. Yellen (2016), “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit:  
Past, Present, and Future,” speech delivered at “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the 
Future,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
August 26, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm. 
26 The confidence interval equals the median SEP path for the federal funds rate plus or minus average root 
mean squared prediction errors of the three-month Treasury bill rate (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis 
points), for horizons from zero to three years ahead, based on forecast errors made over the past 20 years.  
For general information on the methodology used to construct confidence intervals using historical 
forecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the 
Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-60
