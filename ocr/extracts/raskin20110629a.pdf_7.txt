Similarly, check cashers generally charge customers 2 to 3 percent of the amount of a 

check, even for those issued by the government.  It is not hard to see how such fees can 

add up to several hundred dollars per year--real money for any consumer, but as a 

percentage of income, much more costly for those with limited disposable incomes.6   

For some consumers, these services may be seen as more convenient or customer-

friendly than those offered by traditional banks.  But this convenience comes with a hard 

price: it further exacerbates the precarious financial state of many families and, in many 

cases, locks them into a downward cycle of deteriorating finances.  

This is not to say that mainstream financial services are inexpensive.  Free 

checking accounts are quickly disappearing, replaced by accounts with rising fees.  

Overdraft fees on checking accounts can also be pricy, ranging from $10 to $38 with a 

median fee of $27.  These fees are not insignificant, particularly when applied to small 

dollar transactions.7  

In sum, the financial crisis has left many lower- and moderate-income Americans 

in danger. With fewer assets to rely upon and deteriorating credit, many people find it 

harder to enter, or stay in, the financial mainstream.  In analyzing the state of economic 

and financial inclusion, the crisis both expanded the number of Americans excluded from 

the economy and dramatically raised the barriers to enter it. 

Why Does Financial Inclusion Matter?   

Broad financial inclusion is essential because it bolsters American consumption 

and savings, which drives macroeconomic growth.  In order to promote efficient 

economic growth and stability, Americans must have safe and affordable access to the
