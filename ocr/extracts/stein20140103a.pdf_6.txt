The second fact, which is perhaps just a bit more surprising, is that the asset side 

of banks’ balance sheets--and, in particular, their mix of loans versus securities--is 

considerably more heterogeneous.  In the 2012 cross section, a bank at the 10th percentile 

of the distribution had a ratio of securities to assets of 6.9 percent, while, for a bank at the 

90th percentile, the ratio was almost six times higher, at 40.7 percent.

  One interpretation 

of this heterogeneity is as follows:  While lending is obviously very important for a 

majority of banks, it need not be the case that a bank’s scale is pinned down by the nature 

of its lending opportunities.  Rather, at least in some cases, it seems that a bank’s size is 

determined by its deposit franchise, and that, taking these deposits as given, its problem 

then becomes one of how best to invest them.  Again, this liability-centric perspective is 

very different from how we are used to thinking about nonfinancial firms, whose scale is 

almost always presumed to be driven by its opportunities on the asset side of the balance 

sheet. 

The third stylized fact, illustrated in figure 1, is the one that I found most eye- 

opening:  While banks might be quite heterogeneous in their mix of loans and securities, 

within the category of securities, they appear to have well-defined preferences.  As can be 

seen in the figure, banks hold very little in the way of Treasury securities and securities 

issued directly by the government-sponsored agencies:  These two categories accounted 

for just 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent of total securities holdings, respectively, on a value-

weighted basis in 2012.  The large bulk of their holdings is in MBS guaranteed by the 

agencies and other types of mortgage-linked securities--such as CMOs and commercial

 These figures on securities holdings do not include banks’ holdings of cash and reverse repos, which 

averaged 10.2 percent and 4.1 percent of assets, respectively, on a value-weighted basis in 2012.
