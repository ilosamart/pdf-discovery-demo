 On the other hand, it seems reasonably apparent that the increased granularity of the 

standardized risk-weighted capital requirements put in place after the crisis, while necessary to 

deal with the range of risks in larger banks, is unduly complicated for community banks.  It’s not 

that these requirements have increased appreciably the amount of capital community banks hold, 

but more that the complexity of compliance and reporting imposes costs that are 

disproportionately much greater for these banks, given that they have much smaller balance 

sheets over which to amortize the associated costs.  For this reason, I believe we should be 

moving toward a much simpler capital regime for community banks.  The federal banking 

agencies have already taken some steps in this direction, and they can take a few more.  But it 

may be helpful to amend the law so as to make clear that the agencies would have the flexibility 

to create a simple capital regime applicable only to community banks. 

 There has been much discussion of late of the leverage ratio requirement, from multiple 

perspectives.  There are proposals to make a higher leverage ratio requirement either mandatory 

or optional for banks, which would then be relieved of risk-weighted capital requirements and 

many other prudential regulations.  There are also those who have questioned the relative cost-

benefit tradeoff of the “enhanced supplementary leverage ratio,” the 2 percent surcharge 

applicable to all eight U.S. G-SIBs. 

 Increasing the current 4 percent or 5 percent leverage ratio requirement to, say, 10 

percent would certainly yield a very well-capitalized set of banks based on the current balance 

sheets of large banks.  But one needs to look at the dynamic effects of such a requirement.  Since 

a higher leverage ratio would also make banks less profitable, and with the constraints of risk-

based capital and liquidity requirements lifted, they would be strongly incentivized to change the 

composition of their balance sheets dramatically, shedding safer and more liquid assets like
