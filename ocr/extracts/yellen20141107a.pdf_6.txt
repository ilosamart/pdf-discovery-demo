A third critical lesson pertains to the importance of having a sound and resilient 

financial sector with strong capitalization and prudent risk management, supported by 

effective regulation and supervision.  The recent crisis has appropriately increased the 

focus on financial stability at central banks around the world.  At the European Central 

Bank (ECB), the recent comprehensive assessment is an important step toward building 

confidence in euro-area banks.  I wish the ECB great success as it takes on its new 

responsibilities at the center of the single supervisory mechanism.  At the Federal 

Reserve, we have devoted substantially increased resources to monitoring financial 

stability and have refocused our regulatory and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of 

systemic risk.  This macroprudential approach to promoting financial stability will be an 

important complement to our other tools for promoting a healthy economy.   

Looking Ahead 

In advanced economies, the current macroeconomic policy mix generally remains 

one of extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and somewhat contractionary fiscal 

policy.  Considering the headwinds that continue to weigh on growth, employment, and 

prices, this situation is hardly ideal.  Policymakers face difficult choices as they seek to 

balance the need for long-term fiscal sustainability with the need to support their 

economies in the near term.   

Even so, I continue to anticipate that the headwinds associated with the financial 

crisis will wane.  As employment, economic activity, and inflation rates return to normal, 

monetary policy will eventually need to normalize too, although the speed and timing of 

this normalization will likely differ across countries based on differences in the pace of 

recovery in domestic conditions.  This normalization could lead to some heightened 

financial volatility.  But as I have noted on other occasions, for our part, the Federal
