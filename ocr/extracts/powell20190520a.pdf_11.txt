Businesses, investors, and lenders need to focus on these vulnerabilities—as will the 

Federal Reserve. 

In addition, regulators, investors, and market participants around the world would 

benefit greatly from more information on who is bearing the ultimate risk associated with 

CLOs.  We know that the U.S. CLO market spans the globe, involving foreign banks and 

asset managers.  But right now, we mainly know where the CLOs are not—only 

$90 billion of the roughly $700 billion in total CLOs are held by the largest U.S. banks.  

That is certainly good news for domestic banks, but in a downturn institutions anywhere 

could find themselves under pressure, especially those with inadequate loss-absorbing 

capacity or runnable short-term financing.  The Federal Reserve is participating in 

international efforts, under the auspices of the FSB, to improve our knowledge of these 

key issues.  Through the FSB, we are focused on determining the size of the global 

leveraged loan market and the holders of the loans as an important step toward a better 

understanding of the underlying risks. 

Beyond monitoring markets and collecting new data, several supervisory efforts 

are also under way.  To complement the quantitative analysis in our stress tests, our 

supervisors have been qualitatively assessing how well banks are managing the risks 

associated with leveraged lending.  Through the Shared National Credit Program, which 

evaluates large syndicated loans, our supervisors are continuing to work with their 

counterparts at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation to ensure that banks are properly managing the risks of losses they 

face from participating in the leveraged lending market.
