The recovery has also encountered some unusual headwinds.  The fiscal and 

financial crisis in Europe has resulted in a euro-area recession and contributed to slower 

global growth.  Europe’s difficulties have blunted what had been strong growth in U.S. 

exports earlier in the recovery by sapping demand worldwide.   

Let me say a few words now, and more later, about the role of monetary policy in 

this recovery.  The Federal Reserve typically plays a large role in promoting recoveries 

by reducing the federal funds rate and keeping it low until the economy is again on a 

solid footing.  Reducing the federal funds rate tends to reduce other interest rates and 

boost asset prices, thus encouraging spending and investment throughout the economy.   

As it has before, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2007 started 

reducing the federal funds rate at the first signs of economic weakness and made sharper 

rate cuts as the recession deepened.  As in some past recoveries that were disappointingly 

slow, the FOMC has kept rates low well after the end of the recession.  

But unlike the past, by December 2008 the Committee had reduced the federal 

funds rate effectively to zero.  Because that rate, for practical purposes, cannot be cut 

further, this level is referred to as the effective lower bound.  Without the option of using 

its conventional policy tool, and with the recession getting worse, the FOMC decided to 

employ unconventional tools to further ease monetary policy, even though the efficacy of 

these tools was uncertain and it was recognized that their use might carry some potential 

costs.  The better known of these tools is the purchase of large amounts of longer-term 

government securities, which is commonly referred to as quantitative easing.  The other 

unconventional tool is known as forward guidance--providing information about the 

future path of short-term interest rates anticipated by the Committee.  Both of these
