policy strategy.10  This statement laid out, for the first time, the rates of inflation and 

unemployment that the FOMC considers consistent with the dual mandate.  Specifically, 

it stated that the longer-run inflation goal most consistent with the FOMC’s price stability 

mandate is 2 percent, and that the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of 

the longer-run normal rate of unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent.  

As the statement also made clear, economic developments may cause inflation 

and unemployment to temporarily move away from the objectives, and the Committee 

will use a balanced approach to return both, over time, to the longer-run goals.  On the 

one hand, for example, the current rate of unemployment, at 7.7 percent, is far above the 

5.2 to 6 percent range in the statement and is expected to decline only gradually.  

Inflation, on the other hand, has been running at or below 2 percent and is expected to 

remain at similar levels for several years.  In this circumstance, both legs of the dual 

mandate call for a highly accommodative monetary policy.  With unemployment so far 

from its longer-run normal level, I believe progress on reducing unemployment should 

take center stage for the FOMC, even if maintaining that progress might result in 

inflation slightly and temporarily exceeding 2 percent.  The Committee reaffirmed this 

statement in January 2013, and I expect it to remain a valuable roadmap for many years 

to come, indicating how monetary policy will respond to changes in economic 

conditions.11
