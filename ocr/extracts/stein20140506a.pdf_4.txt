Let me give you a particular example that illustrates the wisdom of Shin’s 

observation.  In early May 2013, long-term Treasury yields were in the neighborhood of 

1.60 percent.  Two months later, shortly after our June 2013 FOMC meeting, they were 

around 2.70 percent.  Clearly, a significant chunk of the move came in response to 

comments made during this interval by Chairman Bernanke about the future of our asset 

purchase program.  For example, in his June 19 press conference, he said:   


If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the 

Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to 

moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year.  And if the 

subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current 

expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the 

pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next 

year, ending purchases around midyear.

Perhaps it is not surprising that news about the future course of the asset purchase 

program would have a strong effect on markets.  But here is the striking fact:  According 

to the Survey of Primary Dealers conducted by the New York Fed, there was hardly any 

change over this period in the expectation of the median respondent as to the ultimate 

size of the program.

  Chairman Bernanke’s comments may have clarified the FOMC’s 

intentions, but, according to the survey, they did not have any clear directional 

implications for the total amount of accommodation to be provided via asset purchases.  

Thus, FOMC communications in this period did not appear to be meaningfully hawkish.

 For example, between the April and July 2013 dealer surveys, the respondents’ distributions of the size of 

the System Open Market Account portfolio at the end of 2014 actually increased somewhat.  See the 

responses to question 10 on the April survey and question 8 on the July survey; the survey results are
