be.  Similarly, supervisory stress testing and CCAR, while central to ensuring strong capital 

positions for large firms, are not the only important elements of our supervisory program.  

Having said that, however, I hope you will take at least these three points away from my remarks 

today.   

First, supervisory stress testing has fundamentally changed the way we think about 

capital adequacy.  The need to specify scenarios, loss estimates, and revenue assumptions--and to 

apply these specifications on a dynamic basis--has immeasurably advanced the regulation of 

capital adequacy and, thus, the safety and soundness of our financial system.  The opportunities 

it provides to incorporate macroprudential elements make it, in my judgment, the single most 

important advance in prudential regulation since the crisis. 

Second, supervisory stress testing and CCAR have provided the first significant form of 

supervision conducted in a horizontal, coordinated fashion, affording a single view of an entire 

portfolio of institutions, as well as more data-rich insight into each institution individually.  As 

such, these programs have opened the way for similar supervisory activities and continue to 

teach us how to organize our supervisory efforts in order most effectively to safeguard firm 

soundness and financial stability. 

Finally, supervisory stress testing and CCAR are the exemplary cases of how supervision 

that aspires to keep up with the dynamism of financial firms and financial markets must itself be 

composed of adaptive tools.  If regulators are to make the necessary adaptations, they must be 

open to the comments, critiques, and suggestions of those outside the regulatory community.  For 

this reason, transparency around the aims, assumptions, and methodologies of stress testing and 

our review of capital plans must be preserved and extended.
