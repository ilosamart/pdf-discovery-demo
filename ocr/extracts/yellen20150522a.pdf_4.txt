I say “approaching,” because in my judgment we are not there yet.  The 

unemployment rate has come down close to levels that many economists believe is 

sustainable in the long run without generating inflation.  But the unemployment rate 

today probably does not fully capture the extent of slack in the labor market.  To be 

classified as unemployed, people must report that they are actively seeking work, and 

many people without jobs say they are not doing so--that is, they are classified as being 

out of the labor force.  Most people out of the labor force are there voluntarily, including 

retirees, teenagers, young adults in school, and people staying home to care for children.  

But I also believe that a significant number are not seeking work because they still 

perceive a lack of good job opportunities.  

In addition to those too discouraged to seek work, an unusually large number of 

people report that they are working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs, and 

I suspect that much of this also represents labor market slack that could be absorbed in a 

stronger economy.  Finally, the generally disappointing pace of wage growth also 

suggests that the labor market has not fully healed.  Higher wages raise costs for 

employers, of course, but they also boost the spending and confidence of customers and 

would signal a strengthening of the recovery that will ultimately be good for business.  In 

the aggregate, the main measures of hourly compensation rose at a rate of only around 

2 percent through most of the recovery.  And in Rhode Island, average hourly earnings 

have not risen at all in the past year.  Nationally, there are at least some encouraging 

signs of a pickup so far this year.2  The fact that some large companies, such as Wal-Mart 

2 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) employment cost index--which measures both wages 
and the cost of employer-provided benefits--hourly compensation in private industry rose 2-3/4 percent 
over the year ended in March after having averaged gains of about 2 percent per year during most of the 
recovery.  However, some other prominent aggregate wage measures have remained softer.  For example,
