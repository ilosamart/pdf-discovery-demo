means limited to that area.  Let me repeat here what all three federal banking agencies have 

explained in the clearest possible terms, both publicly, in examiner training, and in one-on-one 

discussions with bankers: that Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) and Comprehensive Capital 

Analysis and Review requirements and expectations for enterprise-wide capital stress testing do 

not apply to community banking organizations, either explicitly or implicitly.22  For example, 

while it may be sensible supervisory practice to inquire of a growing $9 billion bank if it has 

begun thinking about how it would meet DFAST requirements should it reach the current $10 

billion statutory threshold, that bank does not need to start meeting those requirements until it 

has actually crossed the threshold.  And there is simply no reason for examiners to make a $5 

billion bank begin to develop capital stress testing capabilities. 

Third, the relatively straightforward business model of community banks, along with 

their relatively small scale and number of branches, provides the opportunity to increase the use 

of off-site supervisory oversight, in accordance with informing principles of risk-based 

supervision.  For example, last year we pilot-tested a voluntary program under which some 

aspects of the loan review process were conducted off-site, relying on the bank’s electronic 

records to assess loan quality and underwriting practices.  Overall, community bankers that were 

part of the pilot expressed strong support for this approach, which reduced the time examiners 

needed to spend on-site at bank offices.  As a result, we plan to continue using this approach in 

future examinations at qualified banks that maintain electronic loan records and wish to 

participate in this approach.  This initiative could tangibly reduce burden on community banking 

organizations.
