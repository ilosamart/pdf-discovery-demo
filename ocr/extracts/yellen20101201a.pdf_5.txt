plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while 

also addressing the economyâ€™s short-term needs.

gains have continued to be subpar, and the unemployment rate remains near its highest

unemployment is likely to remain high for some time.  Meanwhile, measures of 

underlying inflation have continued to trend lower and are now below the levels the
