models in submitting to LIBOR rather than actual transactions.  Many of them have become 

justifiably uncomfortable with a system that pins hundreds of trillions of dollars’ worth of 

financial contracts to that type of judgement call.  

People may have some general sense of this, but because IBA does not release data on 

the transactions that actually underlie LIBOR, many may not be aware of how truly thin these 

markets have become.  At the last roundtable, Jay Powell showed data on the volume of 

borrowing in wholesale unsecured U.S. dollar markets.  That chart can be found in the ARRC’s 

Second Report, which estimated that on a typical day the volume of three-month funding 

transactions was about $500 million. On many days there is much less.  By way of comparison, 

we estimate that there are roughly $200 trillion of financial securities referencing U.S. dollar 

LIBOR.  

To help provide some further transparency, I will show data that we have on the number 

of transactions involved.  These data are based on the information available to the Federal 

Reserve, which is fairly comprehensive but still may differ in some respects from that available 

to IBA, so I should caution that this is merely an informed estimate of the number of transactions 

underlying U.S. dollar LIBOR and may not be exact.  As you can see in the slide, there are a few 

more transactions at the shorter LIBOR maturities.  On average, we observe six or seven 

transactions per day at market rates that could underpin one- and three-month LIBOR across all 

of the panel banks.  The longer maturities have even fewer transactions.  There are two to three 

transactions each day for six-month LIBOR.  On average, there is only one transaction that we 

see underlying one-year LIBOR, and many days there are no transactions at all.
