November, this would suggest that the 7 percent unemployment goal is likely to be 

further away, and the remainder of the program would be extended accordingly. 

  In sum, I believe that effective communication for us at this stage involves the 

following key principles:  (1) reaffirming the data-dependence of the asset purchase 

program, (2) giving more clarity on the type of data that will determine the endpoint of 

the program, as the Chairman did in his discussion of the unemployment goal, and (3) 

basing interim adjustments to the pace of purchases at any meeting primarily on the 

accumulated progress toward our goals and not overemphasizing the most recent 

momentum in the data.   

I have been focusing thus far on our efforts to enhance communications about 

asset purchases.  With respect to our guidance on the path of the federal funds rate, we 

have had explicit links to economic outcomes since last December, and we reaffirmed 

this guidance at our most recent meeting.  Specifically, we continue to have a 6.5 percent 

unemployment threshold for beginning to consider a first increase in the federal funds 

rate.  As we have emphasized, the threshold nature of this forward guidance embodies 

further flexibility to react to incoming data.  If, for example, inflation readings continue 

to be on the soft side, we will have greater scope for keeping the funds rate at its effective 

lower bound even beyond the point when unemployment drops below 6.5 percent. 

 Of course, there are limits to how much even good communication can do to limit 

market volatility, especially at times like these.  At best, we can help market participants 

to understand how we will make decisions about the policy fundamentals that the FOMC 

controls--the path of future short-term policy rates and the total stock of long-term 

securities that we ultimately plan to accumulate via our asset purchases.  Yet as research
