Unfortunately, in the public’s view, little has happened to restore their trust and 

confidence in financial institutions.  Since the crisis, the public’s views of banks have been 

informed--for better or worse--by their experiences and those of their families and neighbors, 

who may have lost their homes, their jobs, or their household wealth.  Many attempted 

unsuccessfully to modify their underwater mortgages, even when they were current on their 

payments.  Against this backdrop, the public’s lack of trust and confidence has been magnified 

by, among other things, the Occupy Wall Street movement, payday loans, overdraft fees, rate-

rigging settlements in London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) cases, executive compensation 

and bonuses that seem to bear no relationship to performance or risk, failures in the foreclosure 

process, and a drumbeat of civil litigation.   

In the Internet age, the impact of consumer distrust is amplified: anyone can easily, 

cheaply, and anonymously create, organize, and participate in a protest.  Participants do not have 

to gather physically to make their action felt.  A recent survey found that 

 60 percent of American adults use social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, and 

 66 percent of those social media users (39 percent of all American adults) have used social 

media to engage on civic and political issues, including by encouraging other people to take 

action on a political or social issue.

Take, for example, the impact of the consumer backlash that erupted in late 2011 when one 

of the nation’s largest banks attempted to charge a $5 monthly fee for its debit card.  A 

California woman, frustrated with the bank’s decision to impose the fee, created a Facebook 

                                                                                                                                                             
Banker reader poll conducted from December 17–23, 2012, found that a mere 8 percent of readers who responded 

thought authorities took the right course in the case of enforcement against HSBC for money laundering violations.  

As many as 47 percent said the Justice Department should have prosecuted the bank, while another 45 percent said 

authorities should have gone after the individuals responsible for the violations.
