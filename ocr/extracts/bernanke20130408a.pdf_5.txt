More than 90 percent of the public capital injections that were used to stabilize the 

banking system have been repaid, and the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary liquidity 

programs and the FDIC’s temporary guarantees for uninsured business deposits and bond 

issues have largely been wound down.  

 The results of the most recent stress tests and capital planning evaluations 

continue to reflect improvement in banks’ condition.  For example, projected aggregate 

loan losses under this year’s most stressful scenario (the so-called severely adverse 

scenario) were 7 percent lower than the comparable figure last year, in part because the 

riskiness of banks’ portfolios continues to decline.  The comparison of today’s bank 

capital levels with those at the time of the SCAP is particularly striking.  Over the past 

four years, the aggregate tier 1 common equity ratio of the 18 firms that underwent the 

recent tests has more than doubled, from 5.6 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of 

2008 to 11.3 percent at the end of 2012--in absolute terms, a net gain of nearly $400 

billion in tier 1 common equity, to almost $800 billion at the end of 2012.  Indeed, even 

under the severely adverse scenario of the latest stress test, the estimate of these firms’ 

post-stress tier 1 common capital ratio is more than 2 percentage points higher than 

actual capital levels at the end of 2008.

  Higher capital puts these firms in a much better 

position to absorb future losses while continuing to fulfill their vital role in the economy.  

In addition, a majority of the 18 CCAR firms already meet new internationally agreed-

upon capital standards (the proposed Basel III capital requirements), and the others are on 

track to meet these requirements as they are phased in over time.

 On an individual firm basis and taking into consideration planned capital actions--that is, capital raises or 

distributions--all but 1 of the 18 firms evaluated this year had post-stress capital ratios above the regulatory 

minimum.
