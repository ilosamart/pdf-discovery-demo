People often think of these relationships between CCPs and clearing members in 

terms of credit exposures, but there are also important interconnections in the need for 

and use of liquidity.  Historically, some CCPs viewed liquidity in terms of daily 

operational needs.  From a macroprudential perspective, this view of liquidity is far too 

narrow.  If a CCP is to act as a buffer against the transmission of liquidity shocks from a 

clearing member’s default, the CCP itself must have a buffer of liquidity it can draw on 

to make its payments on time even during periods of market stress.  The PFMIs 

introduced a new liquidity standard that requires CCPs to cover, at a minimum, the 

liquidity needs of the CCP on the failure of the single clearing member and its affiliates 

with the largest aggregate position, in extreme but plausible market conditions.  Liquidity 

needs are to be met with a predefined list of liquid resources, starting with cash.   

Moreover, the largest clearing members participate in many CCPs around the 

world.  Cash management at these clearing members, particularly intraday cash 

management, involves interconnected cash flows to and from a clearing member’s 

various CCPs, other market infrastructures, and other financial institutions.  If a clearing 

member were to default, cash flows and needed financial services could be disrupted 

simultaneously at several CCPs.  Failure of one or more CCPs to pay margin or settle 

obligations as promised could impair the ability of a clearing member to meet other 

obligations and transmit liquidity risk to others in the financial system.  Accordingly, 

CCPs require a liquidity profile that will allow them to absorb rather than amplify the 

liquidity shocks that are likely to materialize during a period of financial stress following 

a member’s default.
