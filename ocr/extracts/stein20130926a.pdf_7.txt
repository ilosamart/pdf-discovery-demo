collectively, although it is difficult to say how much of an effect is due to any one of 

them.   

However, beyond trying to understand the market dynamics that drove changes in 

rates over the period from May through June, it is also useful to ask a question about the 

starting levels:  What explains why real and nominal rates were as low as they were at the 

beginning of May?  Clearly, our accommodative policies--the combination of forward 

guidance and asset purchases--played an important role.  But I want to draw a key 

distinction between two views of how our policies might have mattered.  One view would 

be that the configuration of market rates in early May was largely a direct hydraulic 

outcome of our policies.  For example, according to this view, a nominal 10-year yield of 

1.63 percent in early May could be explained to a first approximation based on the 

expected path of the federal funds rate, plus a negative term premium that was itself 

primarily a function of the cumulative amount of duration that we were expected to 

remove from the market via our asset purchase program.  Let’s call this the “direct Fed 

control” view. 

An alternative hypothesis is that our policies were indeed responsible for the very 

low level of long-term rates, but in part through a more indirect channel.  According to 

this view, real and nominal term premiums were low not just because we were buying 

long-term bonds, but because our policies induced an outward shift in the demand curve 

of other investors, which led them to do more buying on our behalf--because we both 

gave them an incentive to reach for yield, and at the same time provided a set of implicit 

assurances that tamped down volatility and made it feel safer to lever aggressively in
