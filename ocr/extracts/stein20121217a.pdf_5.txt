This last result is similar to one in recent work by my Fed colleagues Ricardo 

Correa, Horacio Sapriza, and Andrei Zlate.7  They documented that the U.S. branches of 

foreign banks that experienced the most shrinkage in their dollar-denominated large time 

deposits--funding that had been mostly provided by money market funds prior to mid-

2011--cut their U.S.-based commercial and industrial lending by more than banks that 

fared better on this score. 

Taken together, these findings have two types of policy implications:  one for 

central bank responses to dollar funding pressures and another for measures to regulate 

foreign banking firms that rely heavily on short-term wholesale funding. 

This analysis underscores that the Federal Reserve’s temporary dollar liquidity 

swap lines with the European Central Bank and other central banks are an effective 

response to stresses in dollar funding markets.  Last week, the FOMC approved the 

extension of these swap lines through February 1, 2014.  These lines have helped avert 

fire sales of dollar assets and maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and firms.  

Although we documented cutbacks in dollar lending in the latter half of 2011 by foreign 

banks reliant on wholesale dollar funding, those cutbacks likely would have been more 

pronounced in the absence of the swap lines 

I will now turn to regulation.  It is useful to bear in mind that our current 

regulatory regime evolved during a period when the U.S. operations of foreign banks 

were largely net recipients of funding from their parents.  However, their reliance on less 

stable, short-term wholesale funding increased significantly in the decade leading up to
