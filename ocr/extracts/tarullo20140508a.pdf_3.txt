of a bank.  Yet the remaining chapters of the casebooks treated bank regulation as a more or less 

unitary endeavor—with prudential rules applicable in about the same way to the activities and 

affiliations of all banking organizations, and only to banking organizations.   

To be sure, topics such as bank affiliations with nonbank financial institutions were, for 

practical reasons, more focused on larger banks.  And there were a few measures directed at the 

more complicated balance sheets of larger banks, such as the Basel II internal ratings-based 

(IRB) approach to regulatory capital, although there was no evidence the underlying purpose of 

capital regulation differed.  But in all the chapters elaborating applicable doctrine and rules, there 

was little hint that the purposes and principles of bank regulation might vary across the bank 

population.  And, to the extent that nonbank financial institutions such as broker-dealers, 

investment companies, or insurance companies were covered, the pedagogical point seemed to 

be that the aims of regulating these kinds of firms were dominantly investor and customer 

protection—not prudential considerations such as limiting moral hazard, much less fostering 

financial stability. 

 The reason for this disconnect was, to a great extent, that pre-crisis statutes and 

regulations reflected what I have termed a unitary approach to banking regulation.  The core of 

banking regulation could be explained with a relatively simple narrative, by which deposit 

insurance and access to the discount window had been granted to depository institutions in order 

to forestall runs and panics.  The resulting moral hazard and the use of insured deposits as a 

funding source for these institutions justified everything from capital requirements to limitations 

on banks getting into nonbanking businesses.  Even when traditional banks were permitted to 

affiliate with other kinds of financial firms, laws such as the Bank Holding Company Act
