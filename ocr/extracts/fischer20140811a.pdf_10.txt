year in U.S. GDP per capita.  At this rate, American standards of living would double 

every 35 years. 

However, productivity growth in recent years has been disappointing.  Over the 

past decade, U.S. total factor productivity growth declined to 1 percent, which some 

argue may represent the real norm for the U.S. economy.9  In this view, the long period of 

rapid productivity growth spurred by the technological innovations of the first and second 

Industrial Revolutions ended in the 1970s and the economy has continued at a lower 

productivity growth rate since then, except for a brief burst in the mid-1990s.  In 

particular, these authors argue that the information technology (IT) revolution of the past 

several decades--including the diffusion of computers, the development of the internet, 

and improvements in telecommunications—was an anomaly and is unlikely to generate 

the productivity gains prompted by earlier innovations such as electrification and mass 

production. 

Obviously, future productivity growth in the United States and in the world is yet 

to be determined.  Possibly we are moving into a period of slower productivity growth--

but I for one continue to be amazed at the potential for improving the quality of the lives 

of most people in the world that the IT explosion has already revealed.  Possibly,
