with more than 10,000 banks across the country, the Federal Reserve is uniquely placed to 

deliver this outcome.  

The bar is high when we assess whether the Federal Reserve should provide a new 

payment and settlement service, as it should be. We have carefully analyzed the criteria of the 

Monetary Control Act and long-standing Federal Reserve policies, considered the comments 

provided by a wide range of stakeholders, and studied the experiences of foreign central banks.7 

We are not making this decision lightly. On balance, after carefully weighing important 

considerations on both sides, we have concluded it is our responsibility to take action in support 

of a real-time payment infrastructure accessible to all. While we will work hard to stand up the 

FedNow Service in a timely manner, our most important goal is to achieve nationwide access for 

all, reflecting our public mission. 

Building a Modern Payment Infrastructure  

A key foundation of the payment infrastructure is interbank clearing and settlement—the 

movement of funds and the associated information between banks. Today, the U.S. retail 

payment infrastructure lags behind many other countries. Europe, Mexico, and Australia have 

already implemented real-time interbank clearing and settlement capabilities. In contrast, here in 

the United States, the gap between the transaction capabilities in the digital economy and the 

underlying payment and settlement capabilities continues to grow.8   

Early adopters of fast payment services rely on a legacy infrastructure that was not 

designed to support faster payments. For example, some services offer real-time funds 

availability to certain consumers, but they conduct interbank settlement on a deferred basis using
