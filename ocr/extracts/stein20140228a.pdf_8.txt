With this framing in mind, let me comment briefly on the empirical work in the 

paper.  There is a lot of it, and I will just touch on a couple of points.  A first observation 

is that the heavy focus on flows in and out of funds is a bit at odds with the theoretical 

model.  As I mentioned earlier, the model, taken literally, is one of closed-end funds with 

fixed AUM.  If one were interested in testing the specific mechanism in the model most 

directly, it seems to me that one would want to look not at fund flows but rather at the 

portfolio allocations within each fund.  For example, the model suggests that, during the 

unfolding of an episode of bond market volatility like the one in the spring and summer 

of last year, we should see a coordinated shift among bond managers out of long-term 

bonds and into bills so that the average durations of their portfolios would co-move 

strongly together.  There is a well-developed empirical literature on herding among fund 

managers in their portfolio allocations, but, as far as I know, this work has not looked at 

how such herding responds to changes in the monetary policy environment.

  So this 

avenue seems like a potentially promising one to pursue. 

The paperâ€™s focus on flows in and out of funds is, however, well suited to 

thinking about mechanisms related to AUM-run dynamics.  In this regard, a particularly 

interesting set of findings has to do with the ability of flows to forecast future asset 

returns, even controlling for past returns.  And, most notably, this forecasting effect is 

much stronger in the less liquid high-yield and emerging market categories than it is in 

U.S. Treasury securities; indeed, it is essentially nonexistent in the latter category.  While 

not a decisive test, this pattern is consistent with one of the necessary preconditions for 

the existence of strategic complementarities and run-like dynamics.  Again, the key idea
