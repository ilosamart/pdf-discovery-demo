initially.  Separately, for those central banks that, unlike the Federal Reserve, moved to 

negative interest rates, there may be special considerations associated with raising policy 

rates back into positive territory.   

One question that naturally arises is whether the major central banks’ 

normalization plans may have material implications for cross-border spillovers--an 

important issue that until very recently had received scant attention.  This question is a 

natural extension of the literature examining the cross-border spillovers of the 

unconventional policy actions taken by the major central banks to provide 

accommodation.   

Although this literature suggests there are good reasons to expect broadly similar 

cross-border spillovers from tightening through policy rates as through balance sheet 

runoff, the effects may not be exactly equivalent.  The balance sheet might affect certain 

aspects of the economy and financial markets differently than the short-term rate due to 

the fact that the balance sheet more directly affects term premiums on longer-term 

securities, while the short-term rate more directly affects money market rates.  As a 

result, similar to the domestic effects, while the international spillovers of conventional 

and unconventional monetary policy may operate broadly similarly, the relative 

magnitude of the different channels may be sufficiently different that, on net, the two 

policy strategies have distinct effects.  For example, as will be discussed at greater length 

shortly, the two strategies may have very different implications for the exchange rate.  

Moreover, as was evident with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) asset purchases in 

late 2014 and early 2015, and as we have seen again in reverse in recent weeks, in 

addition to the standard demand and exchange rate channels, expected or actual asset
