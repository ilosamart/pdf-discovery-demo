throughout most of the expansion.  Indeed, as of the first quarter of this year, productivity 

in the nonfarm business sector rose 2.4 percent over the previous four quarters, its fastest 

pace since 2010 when the U.S. economy was coming out of the Great Recession.  By 

contrast, in both the 2001–07 and 1982–90 economic expansions, productivity growth 

was actually slowing relative to its average pace during those expansions.  That said, 

while identifying inflection points in trend productivity growth in real time is notoriously 

difficult, a pickup in trend productivity growth relative to the pace that prevailed earlier 

in the expansion is a possibility that we should not, I believe, dismiss.8  

Another structural change relevant for monetary policy is that price inflation 

appears less responsive to resource slack than it did in the past.  That is, the short-run 

price Phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic 

relationship between inflation and employment.9  A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a 

proverbial double-edged sword.  It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment 

more aggressively during downturns—as was the case during and after the Great 

Recession—because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve 

is flatter.10  However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic 

output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, a

9 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among 
others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for 
International Settlements (2017). 
10 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary 
policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such 
a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and 
Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a 
central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the 
adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary 
policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to 
shocks.
