A third short-term priority is to address the settlement process for triparty repurchase 

agreements.  Some progress has been made since 2008, but clearly more remains to be done.  An 

industry-led task force established in 2009 orchestrated the implementation of some important 

improvements to the settlement process.  The unwind, with its reliance on vast amounts of 

discretionary and uncommitted intraday credit from the two clearing banks, was pushed to later 

in the day, reducing the period during which the intraday credit was extended.  In addition, new 

tools were developed for better intraday collateral management, and an improved confirmation 

process was instituted.   

Though these were useful steps, the key risk reduction goal of the effective elimination of 

intraday credit has not yet been achieved.  A second phase of triparty reform is now underway, 

with the Federal Reserve using its supervisory authority to press for further action not only by 

the clearing banks, who of course manage the settlement process, but also by the dealer affiliates 

of bank holding companies, who are the clearing banksâ€™ largest customers for triparty 

transactions.  But this approach alone will not suffice.  All regulators and supervisors with 

responsibility for overseeing the various entities active in the triparty market will need to work 

together to ensure that critical enhancements to risk management and settlement processes are 

implemented uniformly and robustly across the entire market, and to encourage the development 

of mechanisms for orderly liquidation of collateral, so as to prevent a fire sale of assets in the 

event that any major triparty market participant faces distress.   

In the medium term, a broader reform agenda for shadow banking will first need to 

address the fact that there is little constraint on the use of leverage in some key types of 

transactions.  One proposal is for a system of haircut and margin requirements that would be 

uniformly applied across a range of markets, including OTC derivatives, repurchase agreements,
