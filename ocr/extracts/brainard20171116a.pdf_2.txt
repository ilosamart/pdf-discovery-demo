The new generation of fintech tools offers the potential to help consumers manage their 

increasingly complicated financial lives, but also poses risks that will need to be managed as the 

marketplace matures.1 

In many ways, the new generation of fintech tools can be seen as the financial equivalent 

of an autopilot.  The powerful new fintech tools represent the convergence of numerous 

advances in research and technology--ranging from new insights into consumer decisionmaking 

to a revolution in available data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI).  They operate 

by guiding consumers through complex decisions by offering new ways of looking at a 

consumer’s overall financial picture or simplifying choices, for example with behavioral nudges.  

As consumers start to rely on financial autopilots, however, it is important that they 

remain in the driver’s seat and have a good handle on what is happening under the hood. 

Consumers need to know and decide who they are contracting with, what data of theirs is being 

used by whom and for what purpose, how to revoke data access and delete stored data, and how 

to seek relief if things go wrong.  In short, consumers should remain in control of the data they 

provide. In addition, consumers should receive clear disclosure of the factors that are reflected in 

the recommendations they receive.  If these issues can be appropriately addressed, the new 

fintech capabilities have enormous potential to deliver analytically grounded financial services 

and simplified choices, tailored to the consumers’ needs and preferences, and accessible via their 

smartphones.2
