demand, one-time cash-for-clunkers to move inventory, and temporary business tax credits to 

spur investment. 

These programs may well have boosted gross domestic product (GDP) for a quarter or

must do more than reacquaint consumers with old, bad habits.  And sensible fiscal policymakers 

should set their sights higher than merely coaxing businesses to do today what they would 

otherwise do tomorrow. 

Policymakers should also take notice of the critical importance of the supply side of the 

economy.  The supply side establishes its productive capacity.  It is a function of the quality and 

quantity of labor and capital assembled by our companies.  Recovery after a recession demands 

that capital and labor be reallocated.  But, the reallocation of these resources to new sectors and 

companies has been painfully slow and unnecessarily interrupted.  We are now feeling the ill 

effects. 

If policymakers fail to give the supply side of the economy more considered attention, we 

will find the new normalists to be right.  If untreated, the cyclical becomes structural.  Persistent 

weakness in the labor markets, in effect, permanently disqualifies more workers from a place in 

the labor force.  The natural rate of unemployment moves higher and potential GDP falls.  And 

substantial harm is done to our well-being, threatening to demoralize our populace who knows 

better.  But, this need not be so. 

Fiscal authorities should resist the temptation to increase government expenditures 

continually to compensate for shortfalls of private consumption and investment.  A strict
