variety of unsecured transactions.  These data, along with other available data, will help 

us understand whether there is enough borrowing activity to support a fully transactions-

based rate.10  It will take some time to assess these data and, in particular, to analyze the 

depth of the markets under different conditions and during different times of the year.  

But preliminary analysis, which is reinforced by research done by the Market Participants 

Group (MPG) that was assembled by the FSB, suggests that there may be enough 

borrowing activity to create a transactions-based U.S. dollar LIBOR rate.   

Basing U.S. dollar LIBOR more on transactions could modestly increase the 

volatility of the rate.  However, I see nothing wrong with a reference rate that more 

accurately reflects the volatility of the market it represents.  We are working closely with 

the LIBOR administrator, IBA, and with its regulator, FCA, to explore these issues.  In 

this regard, cooperation with IBA is crucial if LIBOR is to be strengthened--U.S. dollar 

LIBOR is produced in the United Kingdom and is not regulated here in the United States.  

The IOSCO review found that IBA has made progress in implementing most of the 

19 IOSCO principles; the changes I have discussed are designed to continue this 

progress, and I believe that IBA is well motivated to continue its efforts.11   

Alternatives Needed 

Improving U.S. dollar LIBOR alone cannot eliminate all of the weaknesses in the 

current system.  In the FSB’s opinion and that of the MPG, a large portion of the 

derivatives that currently reference U.S. dollar LIBOR would be better served by
