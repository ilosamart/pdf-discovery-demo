fiscal agent for the U.S. government and, by nature of its frequent activity in these markets, in 

conducting monetary policy operations.  And of course, the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission regulates Treasury futures markets.  The agencies work well together, but there is 

real value in having an industry group help to identify issues that cross regulatory boundaries.    

I’ll give two examples.  First, in 2016, the TMPG conducted a study of financial 

benchmarks and uncovered uses of ICAP’s federal funds open rate that had not previously been 

well understood.2  As ICAP decided to stop publishing the rate, the TMPG also helped to guide 

market participants to an alternative that is aligned with the International Organizations of 

Securities Commissions Principles for Financial Benchmarks while steering the market away 

from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a potential alternative--a move that now 

seems prescient given the subsequent news around the long-run risks to LIBOR.  More recently, 

the TMPG has been busy creating a map of clearing and settlement in Treasury markets, work 

that I am sure all of the regulatory agencies will find to be of great interest.  

All of this is incredibly valuable.  In fact, my only regret about the TMPG is that we 

didn’t think of creating something like it earlier.  As regulators, we fully support your work, and 

will continue to make sure that our own rules support these markets.  The Financial Industry 

Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA’s) new collection of the Treasury transactions of its members 

through its Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, or TRACE system, will do much to 

improve the regulatory agencies’ understanding of the dynamics of this market.  But as in the 

past, we should also be concerned about creating a level playing field.  For that reason, the Board 

                                                           
2 The ICAP Fed Funds Open rate was a daily indicator published by ICAP, a broker in the federal funds market, as 
to where a representative federal fund transaction would be priced at the start of the U.S. trading day. ICAP did not 
consider the rate to be International Organizations of Securities Commissions compliant, although it was nonetheless 
used as a financial benchmark by some market participants.  ICAP ceased publication of the index in September 
2016.
