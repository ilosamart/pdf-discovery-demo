either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances.  For 

example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the 

ELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on 

average, run at the target rate.19  Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in 

policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than 

otherwise would be the case.20  In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup 

strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and 

thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.21 

The benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms 

believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes—

for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 

2 percent.  As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, 

are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, 

conditions at that time will not warrant doing so.  Because of this time inconsistency, any 

makeup strategy, to be successful, would have to be understood by the public to represent 

a credible commitment.  That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the 

academic literature, in which central bank “commitment devices” are simply assumed to 

exist and be instantly credible on decree.  Thus, one of the most challenging questions is 

                                                 
19 See Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of such a strategy.  See Hebden and López-Salido (2018) for a 
quantitative assessment of that and other strategies.  See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in 
which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for 
below-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns. 
20 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule 
makes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy 
rate lower than otherwise.  The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 
Monetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018b, 
pp. 37–41).

nominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.
