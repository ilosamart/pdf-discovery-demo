Each of these policy tools tends to generate spillovers to other financial markets, 

such as boosting stock prices and putting moderate downward pressure on the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar.  My reading of the evidence, which I will briefly review, is 

that both unconventional policy tools--the use of forward guidance and the purchases of 

longer-term securities--have proven effective in easing financial conditions and hence 

have helped mitigate the constraint associated with the zero lower bound on the federal 

funds rate.  

The Effectiveness of Forward Guidance  

I will begin with an assessment of the FOMC’s forward guidance concerning the 

federal funds rate, which began when the FOMC reduced its funds rate target to a range 

of 0 to 1/4 percentage point.  In particular, the December 2008 FOMC meeting statement 

indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for some time.”  Identical guidance was reiterated in January 2009, and 

in March 2009 the phrase “for some time” was changed to “for an extended period.”   

Figure 1 suggests that the provision of guidance concerning the future path of the 

federal funds rate likely contributed to more accommodative financial market conditions.  

In particular, the consensus outlook of professional forecasters regarding the path of the 

funds rate shifted down markedly in the Blue Chip survey published at the beginning of 

February 2009 (the solid line) compared with the survey published two months earlier 

(the dashed line).3   

A crucial feature of the FOMC’s policy communications is that the Committee’s 

forward guidance has been framed not as an unconditional commitment to a specific 

federal funds rate path, but rather as an expectation that is explicitly contingent on
