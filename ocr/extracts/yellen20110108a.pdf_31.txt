     Note:  The table displays the percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar against four other currencies (the Canadian dollar, the  
British pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen) on selected dates associated with news about the first round of the Federal Reserve’s 
asset purchases.  Each rate is expressed in units of foreign currency per U.S. dollar; thus, a negative number corresponds to a 
depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the specified foreign currency. The daily change is computed using Bloomberg  
data for the close of business on the day of the announcement relative to the close of business the day before the announcement.
