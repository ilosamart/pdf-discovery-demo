quality short- and intermediate-duration assets to match their shorter-term liabilities.  Many 

community banks have increased their holdings of longer-term mortgage assets, including 

mortgage securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and the government-sponsored enterprises, in an 

effort to enhance both credit quality and earning asset yields.  While such holdings advance 

public policy interests in reviving the mortgage market, they nevertheless pose the potential for 

increasing interest rate risk exposures, in part because of the embedded options in residential 

mortgages.  

Additionally, some banks appear to be assuming more-complex exposures to interest rate 

risk through purchases of structured products.  The recent crisis has focused attention on the 

problems and complexity of structured products in the form of collateralized debt obligations, 

which carved up the credit risk of underlying assets into various tranches--a product that, it 

turned out, too few investors understood.  But similar lessons were learned with regard to interest 

rate risk management in the early 1990s when many institutions purchased various types of 

structured collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) with embedded interest-rate options that 

were not fully understood--and then incurred substantial and unexpected losses when interest 

rates rose in 1994.  Many CMOs turned out to have durations that fluctuated sharply in response 

to even small changes in market rates, resulting in significant declines in the value of the 

instruments and in many cases increasing the asset-liability mismatches they were intended to 

mitigate.  Capital losses as longer-term interest rates rise are a risk facing even asset-sensitive 

banks.  As bankers prepare to meet the uncertainties that lie ahead, they must not forget these 

hard-learned lessons and must make sure they fully understand how the securities they purchase 

will perform in different economic and financial market environments, including an environment 

of rising short- and long-term interest rates.
