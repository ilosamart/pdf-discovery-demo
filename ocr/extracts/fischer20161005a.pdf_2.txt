I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for establishing this 

seminar 40 years ago and for maintaining it since then.  This event has always been a 

useful forum for sharing knowledge and experiences among the world’s central banks, 

something that has become especially valuable in the years since the Great Recession.  

This seminar has also fostered a stronger sense of community among central banks, 

whose interactions undergird the global financial system.1 

I will talk today about an issue that currently confronts almost all central banks:  

historically low interest rates.  Indeed--as shown in figure 1--in an increasing number of 

countries, they have even dipped below zero.  Ultralow interest rates have not been 

limited to the short end of the yield curve, which is most directly affected by monetary 

policy.  Figure 2 shows that longer-term interest rates--which embed market participants’ 

expectations of where real short-term rates and inflation are likely to be in the future--

have also been exceptionally low.  

The low interest rate environment presents us with four key questions:  (1) Are 

ultralow interest rates part of the so-called new normal for the global economy, or are 

they mostly transitory?  (2) How concerned should we be, if at all, about the current 

interest rate environment?  (3) What determines the level of interest rates over the longer 

run?  (4) What can policymakers do about chronically low interest rates?  

The fact that interest rates have remained so low in the United States over the past 

eight years--well into the recovery from the severe strains of the Great 

Recession--suggests that ultralow rates may reflect more than just cyclical forces.  Here is
