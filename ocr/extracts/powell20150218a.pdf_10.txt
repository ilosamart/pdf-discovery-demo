The case of the leveraged loan market is an interesting one, because it sits at the 

intersection between core financial institutions and credit markets and illustrates the 

challenges supervisors face in thinking about intervention in credit markets.  I will turn to 

that market now in some detail.   

The term portions of leveraged loans are typically not held in the arranging banks’ 

portfolios, but rather sold to a wide range of institutional investors--collateralized loan 

obligations (CLOs), retail loan funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, 

and others (figures 1 and 2).  This “originate-to-distribute” model is now dominant across 

a range of markets and reflects the movement over several decades of credit 

intermediation from portfolio lending (from the firm’s perspective, the “storage 

business”) to the capital markets (the “moving business”).  This practice transfers and 

disperses credit and liquidity risks from the core of the financial sector to capital market 

investors that are willing to bear such risks for what they deem appropriate compensation.  

While the risks do not disappear, the system can, in principle, be safer if the ultimate 

institutional investors pose lower risk to the system than banks.  For example, movement 

of credit exposure to speculative grade firms from a bank’s balance sheet to a vehicle that 

is stably funded by sophisticated, deep-pocket institutional investors could be a net gain 

to financial stability.  Movement of such loans to a highly leveraged, runnable vehicle 

beyond the regulatory perimeter could have the opposite effect.   

Pre-crisis conditions in leveraged finance markets were, with the benefit of 

hindsight, clearly in bubble territory.  Deal leverage was at historically high levels (figure 

3), and spreads were at historic lows (figure 4).  Interest coverage ratios were quite low 

over a five-to-seven-year period; differences across industries and companies are also to be taken into 
consideration.
