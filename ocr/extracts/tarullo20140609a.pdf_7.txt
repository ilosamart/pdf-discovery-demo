term wholesale funding.  This objective, long neglected in financial regulation, is prominently 

featured in post-crisis statutory, regulatory, and supervisory reforms.  The Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) explicitly establishes financial 

stability and the containment of systemic risk as the aim of dozens of new regulatory provisions.5  

Thus, for example, any firm whose failure could pose systemic risk is subject to prudential 

regulation, quite apart from its relationship with IDIs. 

A second objective of macroprudential regulation is to avoid a harmful contraction of 

credit availability in significant regions or sectors of the economy, even if there were little 

chance of a financial crisis.  This outcome could ensue were banks accounting for a material 

portion of credit extension simultaneously to come under solvency or funding pressures that 

caused them to pull back from lending.  The importance of both macroprudential objectives is 

that the regulatory framework should aim to reduce the chances of transmission of systemic risk 

by such firms to a greater extent than traditional, microprudential regulation would.  

But even stipulating these crucial objectives, why should prudential regulation need to 

involve itself with corporate governance?  After all, there are many important forms of 

regulation applicable to corporations.  A regulatory field may establish certain behavioral norms, 

require conformity with certain product or byproduct characteristics, or prohibit certain 

activities.  Corporations are expected to conform to these obligations, many of which are 

extensive and detailed.  While some regulatory systems require certain procedures within the 

regulated entities--particularly as remedial measures following violations--few, if any, create 

specific and significant ongoing requirements for corporate decisionmaking or oversight.
