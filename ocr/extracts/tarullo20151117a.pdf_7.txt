 Even as the risks associated with specific forms of nonbank intermediation are evaluated, 

it is important also to bear in mind the specific economic benefits of those activities.  Nonbank 

intermediaries can increase the diversity of the economy’s capital providers.  For example, the 

creation and eventual proliferation of equity mutual funds offered a variety of savings options to 

American households for which ownership of a diversified portfolio of equities is either 

practically burdensome or financially impossible.  This development posed a challenge for the 

liability side of banks’ balance sheets, as households reduced the share of their savings in 

traditional bank deposits.  But it is hard to argue that this challenge would have merited limiting 

the availability of mutual funds. 

Nonbank intermediaries can also provide credit to borrowers that are underserved or 

unserved by traditional banks.  It could be argued that one example of such nonbank activity is 

online marketplace lending that uses new sources of data and new technologies to lower the 

fixed costs of making credit decisions, rendering lending to some individuals and small 

businesses more cost-effective.  Of course, it matters a great deal whether this competition to 

traditional banks arises because risks are genuinely lower or useful new products have been 

created, on the one hand, or because well-grounded prudential or consumer regulations have 

been successfully avoided, on the other.3   

A key implication of the fact that the activities often grouped under the heading shadow 

banking are not monolithic is that the level of a particular activity is less important than the 

degree of vulnerability that it creates.  Not all of what some might call shadow banking activity 

represents a market failure that creates excessive risk to financial stability, and so it would be
