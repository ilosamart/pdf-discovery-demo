unemployment rate stable over the longer run.1  The unemployment rate is now close to 

estimates of its longer-run normal level, and other measures of labor utilization have 

improved appreciably.  As shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor 

underutilization--the U-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also 

people working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would 

like a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that 

occurred as a result of the recession.2  

Other indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered 

from the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis.  As illustrated 

by the red dashed line in figure 2, the quits rate--an indicator of workers’ confidence 

about leaving an existing job to pursue new opportunities--is nearly back to its pre-

recession level.  And some indicators, such as small businesses’ assessments of the 

difficulty of hiring, shown by the solid black line, as well as the average length of time it 

takes firms to fill vacancies and the job openings rate, even suggest that the labor market 

is a bit tighter than before the financial crisis.  Of course, both the labor force 

participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they 

were a decade ago.  But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely 

disappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other 

secular trends.3  Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to 

be reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of 

                                                           
1 The sustainable longer-run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as 
the growth rate of the working-age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the 
prevalence of self-employment and multiple job holdings, so it cannot be predicted with precision. 
2 The normal level of the U-6 measure may now be somewhat higher than it was prior to the financial crisis 
because of a trend toward greater reliance on part-time workers in many sectors.  See Golden (2016).
