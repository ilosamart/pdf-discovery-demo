communities--those that can weather economic downturns--not only provide decent 

housing, but also have the resources to support individuals and families and to create a 

dynamic business environment.  For this reason, community development today is a 

multidisciplinary exercise that challenges us to think holistically about how housing 

relates to jobs, educational opportunities, transportation, healthcare, and other services 

and amenities. 

Neighborhood Stabilization 

Taking a well-rounded approach is essential now, as weak national economic 

conditions have caused particular hardships in lower-income communities, and have 

stretched the federal, state, and local resources available to address neighborhood 

stabilization and revitalization.  In some areas, high rates of vacant and abandoned 

properties resulting from foreclosures have depressed housing values, drained the coffers 

of local governments, and created breeding grounds for crime and other social ills in what 

were otherwise stable, albeit low-income, communities.  The result has been a shift in 

focus in community development, from building new housing to preserving or disposing 

of existing housing. 

In recent years, local governments and community-based organizations have 

struggled to counter the effects of foreclosures on neighborhoods.  Some communities 

have found success by establishing land banks to manage low-value properties that might 

otherwise sit vacant if left to the private market. 1  Land banks are typically public or
