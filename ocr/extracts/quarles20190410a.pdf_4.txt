Committee (ARRC) continues to make progress on industry-led approaches to the 

transition, the transition paths away from LIBOR will become clearer for banks of all 

sizes.   

While we expect you to take on this responsibility, we in the public sector must 

also recognize our need to help.  The FSB has supported this transition globally, and, in 

the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has supported the ARRCâ€™s 

work.  It is important that we continue to do so, and I want to thank you all today for the 

thoughts you have shared with us on this transition and what is needed to make it 

succeed.
