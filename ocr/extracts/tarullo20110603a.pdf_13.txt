 The argument is even weaker in the context of an additional charge limited to SIFIs.  To 

the degree that systemically important institutions find the additional capital requirement makes 

some lending unprofitable, that lending could be assumed by smaller banks that do not pose 

similar systemic risk and thus have lower capital requirements.  To be sure, there may not be 

perfect substitution, particularly not in the short term.  In part for that reason, we contemplate a 

fairly generous transition period to the SIFI capital regime.  In addition, though, it is worth 

recalling that not every additional dollar of lending or capital market activity is necessarily 

socially optimal.  Just as monetary policy must at times induce higher credit costs in order to 

forestall the wider problems that high inflation would bring, so some checks on the scale of SIFIs 

are warranted to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. 

 A second objection lodged by opponents is that what they characterize as the 

“punishment” of size and interconnectedness is shortsighted, because SIFIs are needed in a 

global financial system.  But as earlier noted, while there are good reasons for firms to be big, 

there is little if any research showing that firms need to have balance sheets with the size and 

composition some do in order to achieve genuine economies of scope and scale.  Moreover, a 

SIFI capital requirement would not prohibit the size and interconnectedness of today’s firms.  

Rather, it would incentivize firms to maintain those dimensions only if there are risk-adjusted 

returns for activities that require this scale.  If research does establish some true economies for 

the largest, most interconnected firms, those benefits would need to be balanced with the societal 

risks associated with their potential distress or failure. 

 A third objection is that establishing SIFI metrics and capital requirements will actually 

increase, rather than mitigate, moral hazard by identifying which firms are considered too-big-to-

fail.  For those of us in the United States, Congress has already rejected this argument by its
