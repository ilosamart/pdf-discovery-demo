New technological breakthroughs in many areas--robotics, biotech, and artificial 

intelligence to name just a few--have led others to take a more optimistic view.10  They 

point to substantial productivity gains from innovation in areas such as energy production 

and e-commerce.  In addition, the optimists point out that advances in technology often 

take decades to work their way into the economy before their ultimate effects on 

productivity are felt.  That delay has been observed even for game-changing innovations 

like the steam engine and electrification, which ultimately produced broad increases in 

productivity and living standards.  In this view, we just need to be patient for new 

technologies to diffuse through the economy.  Only time will tell who has the better 

view--the record provides little basis to believe that we can accurately forecast the rate of 

increase in productivity.    

The other principal contributor to output growth is hours worked.  Hours growth, 

in turn, is largely determined by growth in the labor force, which has averaged just 1/2 

percent per year since 2010, well below the average in previous decades (figure 13).  One 

reason for slower growth of the labor force is that baby boomers are aging and retiring, 

and that trend will continue.  But another reason is that labor force participation of people 

between the ages of 25 and 54--prime-age individuals--declined from 2010 to 2015 and 

remains low.  Indeed, the participation rate for prime-age men has been falling for more 

than 50 years, while women’s participation in this age group rose through the 1990s but 

then turned downward, and it has fallen for the past 20 years.
