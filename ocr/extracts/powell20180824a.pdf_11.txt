believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear.  And meeting after meeting, 

inflation gradually declined. 

In retrospect, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend “let’s wait one 

more meeting,” given that inflation was low and falling.  Conventional wisdom at the 

time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk--even 

when that risk was gleaned mainly from hazy, real-time assessments of the stars.  With 

the experience in the new-economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate 

that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller 

risk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan’s “wait and see” approach would become a 

significant problem.  

Risk Management in the Face of Shifting Stars 

Given what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the 

sort of risk-management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than 

ever before.  That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing 

literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.  

Experience has revealed two realities about the relation between inflation and 

unemployment, and these bear directly on the two questions I started with.  First, the stars 

are sometimes far from where we perceive them to be.  In particular, we now know that 

the level of the unemployment rate relative to our real-time estimate of u* will sometimes 

be a misleading indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation.  Second, the 

reverse also seems to be true:  Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a 

tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization.  Part of the reason inflation 

sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations
