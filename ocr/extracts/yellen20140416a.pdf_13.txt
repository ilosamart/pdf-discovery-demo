FOMC said it expected that conditions would warrant keeping the federal funds rate near 

zero for “some time.”  This period before the “liftoff” in the federal funds rate was 

described in increasingly specific, and (as it turned out) longer, periods over time--“some 

time” became “an extended period,” which was later changed to “mid-2013,” then “late 

2014,” then “mid-2015.”19  This fixed, calendar-based guidance had the virtue of 

simplicity, but it lacked the automatic stabilizer property of communication that would 

signal how and why the stance of policy and forward guidance might change as 

developments unfolded, and as we learned about the extent of the need for 

accommodation.   

More recently, the Federal Reserve, and I might add, other central banks around 

the world, have sought to incorporate this automatic stabilizer feature in their 

communications.20  In December 2012, the Committee reformulated its forward 

guidance, stating that it anticipated that the federal funds rate would remain near zero at

appeared in the FOMC statements of, respectively, December 2008, March 2009, August 2011, January 
2012, and September 2012.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2008), “FOMC

20 The Bank of England introduced threshold-based forward guidance in August 2013 and adopted more-
qualitative forward guidance in February 2014; see Bank of England, “Forward Guidance,” webpage, 
www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx.  The European Central Bank 
recently linked its forward guidance more explicitly to its assessment of economic slack, as discussed in 
President Mario Draghi’s press conference on March 6, 2014; see Mario Draghi (2014), “Introductory
