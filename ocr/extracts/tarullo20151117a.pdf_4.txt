though, let me review how the phrase does capture well the activities that played such a large 

part in precipitating and exacerbating the financial crisis.1 

Before 2007, large banks provided credit and liquidity support, whether explicit or 

implicit, for a range of intermediation entities, including finance companies, nonbank mortgage 

lenders, SIVs, and asset-backed commercial paper conduits.  All of these entities engaged in 

maturity and liquidity transformation, frequently accompanied by significant leverage.  Many 

created, through securitization or otherwise, assets that were viewed as cash equivalents--safe, 

short-term, and liquid.  That is, at least in normal times, they were seen as comparable to demand 

deposits created by the traditional banking sector.  Thus, what we might refer to as the 

prototypical form of shadow banking presented the kind of risk associated with traditional 

banking prior to the creation of deposit insurance--that of destabilizing short-term creditor runs 

that lead to defaults and asset fire sales.   

Bank sponsorship contributed to the illusion that the shadow banks’ short-term liabilities 

were virtually as good as cash.  Large banks also relied on short-term wholesale funding 

provided by the shadow banking sector as a source of cheap financing.  Then, questions arose 

about the quality of the mortgage loans and other assets underlying the liabilities of SIVs and 

asset-backed commercial paper conduits and, simultaneously, about the continued willingness 

and capacity of their sponsors to support them.  Suddenly, asset-backed commercial paper was 

no longer seen as a cash equivalent, and a run ensued.  Large investment banks also experienced 

dramatic runs on their short-term, secured wholesale funding.  Another powerful run occurred,
