Let me begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to participate in this 

important dialogue on the role of finance in society.  The financial sector is vital to the 

economy.  A well-functioning financial sector promotes job creation, innovation, and 

inclusive economic growth.  But when the incentives facing financial firms are distorted, 

these firms may act in ways that can harm society.  Appropriate regulation, coupled with 

vigilant supervision, is essential to address these issues.    

Unfortunately, in the years preceding the financial crisis, all too many firms took 

on risks they could neither measure nor manage.  Leverage, interconnectedness, and 

maturity and liquidity transformation escalated to dangerous levels across the financial 

system.  The result was the most severe financial crisis and economic downturn since the 

Great Depression.  Almost 9 million Americans lost their jobs, roughly twice as many 

lost their homes, and all too many households ended up underwater on their mortgages 

and overburdened with debt.  To be sure, some individuals and families borrowed 

unwisely, but too often financial institutions encouraged the behavior that resulted in 

such excessive debt.   

In my remarks today I will discuss some important reasons why the incentives 

facing financial institutions were distorted and the steps that regulators are taking to 

realign those incentives.

Before discussing the incentives that contributed to the buildup of risk at financial 

institutions, I would like to highlight the important contributions that the financial sector 

makes to the economy and society.  First and foremost, financial institutions channel 

societyâ€™s scarce savings to productive investments, thereby promoting business formation
