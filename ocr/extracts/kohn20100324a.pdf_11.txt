experiencing speculative activity.  Moreover, small policy adjustments may not be very effective 

in reining in speculative excesses.  Our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial 

increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot-com stock speculation in the first 

episode or on house price increases in the second.  And larger adjustments would incur greater 

incremental costs.  As a consequence, using monetary policy to damp asset price movements 

could lead to more variability in output and inflation around their objectives, at least in the 

medium term.  Among other things, greater variability in inflation could lead inflation 

expectations to become less well anchored, diminishing the ability of the central bank to counter 

economic fluctuations.  

We simply do not have good theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in 

using short-term interest rates to limit financial speculation.  Given our current state of 

knowledge, my preference at this time would be to use regulation and supervision to strengthen 

the financial system and lean against developing problems.  Monetary policy would be used only 

if imbalances were building and regulatory policies either were unavailable or had proven 

ineffective.  The homework assignment is to improve our ability to identify incipient financial 

imbalances and understand their interactions with changes in policy interest rates.   

A related issue, which I’ll assign for extra credit, is critical for the conduct of policy in 

the future.  Some observers have attributed the bubbles observed in some asset prices in recent 

years to a decades-long downward trend in real interest rates.  In this view, the decline in interest 

rates has caused investors to reach for yield by purchasing riskier assets with higher returns, 

driving the prices on riskier assets above fundamental values.  Many critics of central banks 

ascribe the drop in real rates to monetary policy decisions that kept rates unusually low, on 

average, over the business cycle  From my perspective, the decisions the central banks were
