2-1/4 percent per year since 2009, about 1 percentage point less than the average rate 

seen over the 25 years preceding the Great Recession.  In Ohio, economic output has 

increased at about the same pace as in the nation as a whole in recent years.  In the labor 

market, the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent in June, around half as high as 

its peak after the recession and close to many economists’ assessment of its longer-run 

natural rate--the level that can be sustained without risking excessive inflation.  The U.S. 

economy has created 12 million jobs since the labor market’s low point, and total 

nonfarm payrolls are now 3-1/2 million greater than just prior to the recession.  Ohio’s 

unemployment rate has declined even more during the recovery than the nation as a 

whole, and at 5.2 percent in May, it was somewhat below the U.S. average in that month.  

Nevertheless, although nonfarm payrolls in Ohio have increased by around 400,000 jobs 

since the low point for the state’s employment, payrolls have yet to surpass their level 

just prior to the recession. 

Manufacturing is important to Ohio, and people here are keenly aware of the 

challenges that American manufacturing has faced for many years.  U.S. manufacturing 

output--as measured in the Federal Reserve’s index of industrial production--plunged 

about 20 percent during the recession.  That’s substantially more than the overall 

percentage decline in economic output.  Partly as a result, U.S. manufacturing 

employment fell 2-1/4 million during 2008 and 2009, a significantly larger percentage 

decline than occurred in overall employment.  And while manufacturing employment

Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to have 
helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David
