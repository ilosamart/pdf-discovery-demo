likely to experience a range of negative outcomes, including exposure to crime and 

violence, physical and mental health problems, and weak academic performance.35  Low-

skilled workers who live far from potential employers or accessible transportation 

networks have more difficulty finding and keeping jobs.36   

These effects of geography on opportunity can stretch from one generation to the 

next.  Raj Chetty and his collaborators have shown that upward mobility varies 

immensely across the country and even within a single metro area.37  Taken together, this 

research underscores the urgency of understanding how we can make communities work 

better for all their members. Since communities play a central role in determining 

opportunity, policy to promote inclusion often focuses on improving local conditions.  

With our presence in communities around the country and our efforts under the 

Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve is a source of high-quality research 

and region-specific expertise as well as a trusted convener and catalyst on community 

development approaches for lenders, community groups, and local and regional 

governments.   

One important area of focus is housing, which connects families concretely to 

place and can be a source of strength or fragility.  Last year, I met with Milwaukee 

community development groups and residents in one of the more racially segregated 

                                                 
35 In an early evaluation of the Moving to Opportunity program, Katz, Kling, and Liebman (2001) find 
improvements of better neighborhoods on children’s health and safety.  Sampson (2016) summarizes much 
of the recent evidence. 
36 Kain (1968) first advanced the “spatial mismatch” hypothesis.  More recently, Hellerstein, Neumark, and 
McInerney (2008) find evidence for a “spatial-racial mismatch”--namely, that employment among low-
skilled black men depends on proximity to employers who hire black workers.     
37 In one of many studies on opportunity, Chetty and others (2014) use Internal Revenue Service tax return 
data from 40 million adult children to estimate the relative upward mobility across the 741 commuting 
zones (both metro and rural) in the United States.
