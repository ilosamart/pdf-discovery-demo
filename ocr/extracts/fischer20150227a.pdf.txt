Thank you.  It is a great pleasure to be here to discuss some of the important 

issues facing the Federal Reserve and other central banks in conducting monetary policy 

with a large balance sheet.  I will focus on two main sets of issues that the Fed has faced 

and will continue to face for some time.  The first involves our ongoing assessment of the 

effects of the asset purchases.  The second concerns policy normalization in the presence 

of a very large balance sheet.  

To set the stage, consider the size of the Fed’s balance sheet over the past several 

years.  Assets have risen from about $900 billion in 2006 to about $4.5 trillion today, or--

as seen in figure 1--from 6 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) to about 

26 percent of nominal GDP.  The net expansion over this period reflects primarily our 

large-scale asset purchase programs. 

Of course, many other central banks have expanded their balance sheets 

substantially over recent years as well.  For example, assets of the Bank of Japan have 

increased from about 20 percent of nominal GDP to more than 60 percent of nominal 

GDP over this period, and assets of the Swiss National Bank have increased from 

20 percent of nominal GDP to more than 80 percent of nominal GDP.  The net increase in 

assets of the European Central Bank has so far been more modest, with assets increasing 

from less than 10 percent of nominal GDP to more than 20 percent of nominal GDP--but 

their quantitative easing (QE) program is not yet under way. 

For the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on the Fed, beginning with some 

remarks about the asset purchase programs.

The Federal Reserve Asset Purchase Programs 

The nature of our purchase programs has changed over time.  In the early 

programs--that is to say, QE1, QE2, and the program we call the MEP, or the maturity 

extension program, otherwise known as “Operation Twist”--the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) specified the expected quantities of assets to be acquired over a 

defined period.  Early in the crisis, this strategy seemed to help bolster confidence that 

the Fed was acting aggressively to offset the tightening in credit conditions and the steep 

downturn in economic activity.   

The communication of asset purchases changed with QE3.  In September 2012, 

the FOMC launched an open-ended asset purchase program in which it directed the New 

York Fed’s Open Market Desk to conduct purchases at an announced monthly pace until 

there was “significant improvement” in the outlook for the labor market.  Later, the 

FOMC noted that the monthly pace of purchases was data dependent, allowing the pace 

to be revised up or down based on its assessment of progress toward its long-run 

objectives. 

Both of these types of asset purchase programs were aimed at putting downward 

pressure on long-term yields.1  Table 1 provides a summary of various studies’ estimated 

effects of these programs on the term premium on 10-year Treasury securities.  For 

example, the decline in 10-year Treasury yields associated with the first purchase 

1 The Fed staff analysis has focused mostly on the so-called stock effects of the purchase programs--that is, 
persistent shifts in asset prices observed as the result of a QE program.  While these stock effects are well 
documented in the literature, there have been relatively fewer studies of “flow effects” that may occur at 
the time of QE transactions (for example, see Stefania D’Amico and Thomas B. King (2013), “Flow and 
Stock Effects of Large-Scale Treasury Purchases:  Evidence on the Importance of Local Supply,” Journal 
of Financial Economics, vol. 108 (May), pp. 425-48, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.11.007; and 
John Kandrac and Bernd Schlusche (2013), “Flow Effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” Economics 
Letters, vol. 121 (November), pp. 330-35, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.09.003).

program is estimated to have been as large as 100 basis points.  The documented effects 

associated with subsequent programs are generally smaller.  These results raise the 

question of whether the marginal effect of asset purchases has declined over time.  While 

that question is a valid one, our conclusion is that asset purchases over more recent years 

have provided meaningful stimulus to the economy, and continue to do so.  

Figure 2 provides a current estimate, based on Fed staff calculations, of the effect 

on the term premium on 10-year Treasury securities from the combination of all asset 

programs.2  The results suggest that the Fed’s balance sheet programs are currently 

depressing 10-year Treasury yields by about 110 basis points.  And, with the Fed 

continuing to hold these securities, they should apply downward pressure on rates for 

some time.   

The declines in long-term yields have led to an associated drop in long-term 

borrowing costs for households and firms and higher equity valuations.  Thus, the asset 

purchases have helped make financial conditions overall more accommodative and have 

provided significant stimulus for the broader economy.  As shown in figure 3, a recent 

study estimates that the QE programs along with increasingly explicit forward guidance 

have reduced the unemployment rate by 1-1/4 percentage points and increased the 

inflation rate by 1/2 percentage point relative to what would have occurred in the absence 

2 The estimates shown in figure 2 are based on an extension of the work done in Ihrig, Klee, Li, Schulte, 
and Wei (2012).  Because the term premium effect depends on both the Fed’s current and expected future 
asset holdings, most of this effect--without further unexpected policy actions--will likely wane over the 
next few years as the balance sheet begins to normalize.  See Jane Ihrig, Elizabeth Klee, Canlin Li, Brett 
Schulte, and Min Wei (2012), “Expectations about the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet and the Term 
Structure of Interest Rates,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2012-57 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July), 
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2012/201257/201257pap.pdf.

of these policies.3  Moreover, the estimates imply that these macroeconomic effects are 

only now manifesting themselves in full, reflecting the inherent lags in the monetary 

transmission mechanism.  Of course, such estimates have a wide band of uncertainty 

around them.   

As is well known, a number of potential costs might be associated with QE and 

the Fed’s elevated balance sheet.  Among these are the possibility that elevated securities 

holdings and low interest rates could pose risks to financial stability, possible effects on 

the Fed’s income and remittances to the U.S. Treasury, and possible difficulties in 

conducting policy normalization.4  Such potential difficulties arise because the level of 

reserve balances will be very high when the FOMC begins to raise the federal funds rate, 

and, consequently, the Federal Reserve will employ new tools, which have their own 

benefits and costs, to implement monetary policy.   

Despite these potential costs, we think that asset purchases have had a meaningful 

effect in promoting economic recovery and helping to keep inflation closer to the 

FOMC’s 2 percent goal than would otherwise have been the case. 

Policy Normalization 

Turning to policy normalization, the FOMC and market participants anticipate 

that the federal funds rate will be raised sometime this year.  We have for some years 

been considering ways to operate monetary policy with an elevated balance sheet.

Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary Policies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series

4 Reflecting securities holdings from the asset purchases, the Federal Reserve has remitted about 
$500 billion to the U.S. Treasury from 2008 to 2014 and is expected to have cumulative net income from 
2008 to 2025 that is far higher than would have been the case in the absence of these asset purchases.

Prior to the financial crisis, because reserve balances outstanding averaged only 

around $25 billion, relatively minor variations in the total amount of reserves supplied by 

the Desk could move the equilibrium federal funds rate up or down.  With the nearly 

$3 trillion in excess reserves today, the traditional mechanism of adjustments in the 

quantity of reserve balances to achieve the desired level of the effective federal funds rate 

may well not be feasible or sufficiently predictable.   

As discussed in the FOMC’s statement on its Policy Normalization Principles and 

Plans, which was published following the September 2014 FOMC meeting, we will use 

the rate of interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) as our primary tool to move the federal 

funds rate into the target range.5  This action should encourage banks not to lend to any 

private counterparty at a rate lower than the rate they can earn on balances maintained at 

the Fed, which should put upward pressure on a range of short-term interest rates.   

Because not all institutions have access to the IOER rate, we will also use an 

overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, as needed.  In an ON RRP 

operation, eligible counterparties may invest funds with the Fed overnight at a given rate.  

The ON RRP counterparties include 106 money market funds, 22 broker-dealers, 24 

depository institutions, and 12 government-sponsored enterprises, including several 

Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Farmer Mac.  This facility 

should encourage these institutions to be unwilling to lend to private counterparties in 

money markets at a rate below that offered on overnight reverse repos by the Fed.  

5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues Statement on 
Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” press release, September 17, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.

Indeed, testing to date suggests that ON RRP operations have generally been successful 

in establishing a soft floor for money market interest rates.6 

The Fed could also employ other tools, such as term deposits issued through the 

Term Deposit Facility and term RRPs, to help drain reserves and put additional upward 

pressure on short-term interest rates.  We have been testing these tools and believe they 

would help support money market rates, if needed.   

Finally, with regard to balance sheet normalization, the FOMC has indicated that 

it does not anticipate sales of agency mortgage-backed securities, and that it plans to 

normalize the size of the balance sheet primarily by ceasing reinvestment of principal 

payments on its existing securities holdings when the time comes.  As illustrated in 

figure 4, cumulative repayments of principal on our existing securities holdings from now 

through the end of 2025 are projected to be about $3.2 trillion.  As a result, when the 

FOMC chooses to cease reinvestments, the size of the balance sheet will naturally 

decline, with a corresponding reduction in reserve balances.   

Conclusion 

I will close by highlighting that the Fed’s asset purchases have been a critical 

means by which the FOMC has provided policy accommodation at the zero lower bound 

on nominal interest rates.  In other words, the Fed--and other central banks--can 

implement an expansionary monetary policy even when the policy interest rate is at the 

6 Policymakers have discussed benefits and costs of an ON RRP facility.  For further discussion on this 
topic, see, for example, the FOMC minutes for June 2014, July 2014, and January 2015 available on the 
Board’s webpage “Federal Open Market Committee:  Meeting Calendars, Statements, and Minutes (2009-

zero lower bound.  The current high level of securities holdings will present some 

challenges for policy normalization, but we are confident that we have the tools necessary 

to remove accommodation at the appropriate time and at the appropriate pace.
