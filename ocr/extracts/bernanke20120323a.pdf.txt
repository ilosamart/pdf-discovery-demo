March 23, 2012



Distinguished guests, colleagues, and friends:  It is my privilege to welcome you 

to this conference on “Central Banking:  Before, During, and After the Crisis,” which is 

jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the International Journal of Central 

Banking.

  We hope that the conference will foster discussion among policymakers and 

researchers about the evolving challenges facing central banks around the world.  To help 

get that discussion started, the conference will feature original research on monetary 

policy, macroprudential regulation, and the provision of liquidity, topics that are 

obviously highly relevant to the public policy missions of the Federal Reserve and other 

central banks.  The proceedings from this conference will be published in a special issue 

of the journal and disseminated to researchers in central banks and academic institutions 

worldwide. 

Needless to say, the events of the past few years pose serious challenges to the 

conventional, pre-crisis views and approaches of central banks and other financial 

supervisors.  The crisis, the recession it sparked, and the subsequent slow recovery, 

especially in the advanced economies, have demonstrated that we have much to learn 

about the workings and vulnerabilities of our modern, globalized financial system and its 

interactions with the broader economy.  In responding to these stressful financial and 

economic developments, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have had to deploy 

a variety of new tools and approaches to carry out their responsibilities regarding 

monetary policy and the provision of liquidity, tools about which we still have more to 

learn.  Finally, in the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory 

agencies have been charged with challenging new responsibilities in the area of

macroprudential supervision, with the objective of promoting financial stability and 

reducing the likelihood and the costs of a future financial crisis.  Although much progress 

has been made, we are still at an early stage in understanding how best to meet these new 

macroprudential responsibilities. 

All of these developments have spurred a great deal of research within central 

banks, in academia, and elsewhere.  This outpouring of research will help shape future 

central bank doctrine and policy approaches and, most importantly, should help central 

banks better carry out their mission to promote the public welfare.  The papers at this 

conference make a variety of welcome contributions to this endeavor.  Two contributions 

consider the implications of recent events for the conduct of monetary policy, both 

conventional and unconventional.

  Another paper addresses the relationship between 

monetary aggregates and financial stability.

  And several papers investigate issues in the 

field of regulation and macroprudential supervision, including the design of an integrated 

framework for regulation, a proposal for dealing with systemically important resolution 

issues in the repurchase agreement markets, and a review of the progress to date in 

reengineering the financial system.

The discussants’ remarks, the general discussions, and the policy panel will surely 

be very helpful in identifying fruitful directions for further research.  I thank our guests 

for coming and participating.  I once again welcome you to Washington and wish you a 

stimulating and productive conference.
