  As we approach the 

centennial of the Federal Reserve System, it is striking how many of the challenges of 

that era remain with us today.  In 1907, the correspondent banking networks that helped 

concentrate reserves in New York and other money centers also made the banking system 

highly interconnected.  Today, our capability to monitor and model financial outcomes is 

vastly greater, and the tools available to the Federal Reserve are vastly more powerful, 

than the private capital and moral suasion that financier J. P. Morgan summoned in 1907 

to stabilize the banks and trusts.  But as we learned during the recent crisis, the financial 

system has also grown much larger and more complex, and our efforts to understand and 

influence it have, at best, only kept pace.  

Complex links among financial market participants and institutions are a hallmark 

of the modern global financial system.  Across geographic and market boundaries, agents 

within the financial system engage in a diverse array of transactions and relationships that 

connect them to other participants.  Indeed, much of the financial innovation that 

preceded the most recent financial crisis increased both the number and types of 

connections that linked borrowers and lenders in the economy.  The rapid growth in 

securitization and derivatives markets prior to the crisis provides a stark example of this 

phenomenon.  As shown in figure 1, between 2000 and 2007, the notional value of 

collateralized debt obligations outstanding increased from less than $300 billion to more 

than $1.4 trillion.

 See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (2012).  Collateralized debt obligations 

(CDOs) are a general class of securitized products consisting of bonds that represent claims on the future 

cash flows generated by a variety of financial assets, including corporate debt and mortgage-backed 

securities.  Growth in notional amounts of CDOs is indicative of the growth in economic exposure.
