federal funds rate settling at about 3 percent in the longer run.15  In contrast, the federal 

funds rate averaged more than 7 percent between 1965 and 2000.  Thus, we expect to 

have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.     

In part, current expectations for a low future federal funds rate reflect the 

FOMC’s success in stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent--a rate much lower than rates 

that prevailed during the 1970s and 1980s.  Another key factor is the marked decline over 

the past decade, both here and abroad, in the long-run neutral real rate of interest--that is, 

the inflation-adjusted short-term interest rate consistent with keeping output at its 

potential on average over time.16  Several developments could have contributed to this 

apparent decline, including slower growth in the working-age populations of many 

countries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity 

to spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and 

                                                 
system during a future emergency.  In particular, such facilities could significantly expand the supply of 

reserves, which would be problematic if the FOMC wished to keep short-term interest rates from falling to 

zero.   
15 In the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey released on June 1, 2016, the consensus forecast for the 

longer-run level of the federal funds rate was 3.2 percent.  FOMC participants in June 2016 generally 

anticipated a slightly lower longer-run level, in that the median of their individual forecasts was 3 percent 

(see table 1 of the June 2016 SEP, available at 

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160615ep.htm).  The latest long-run forecast from 

the Administration (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/16msr.pdf) is also 

close to 3 percent, as was the projection made by the Congressional Budget Office earlier in the year (see 

www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget_economic_data). 
16 Updated estimates from the model developed by Laubach and Williams (2003) indicate that the real 

long-run neutral or “equilibrium” short-term interest rate in the United States is currently about 

2-1/2 percentage points lower than it was on average in the 1980s and 1990s (see Thomas Laubach and 

John C. Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, 

vol. 85 (November), pp. 1063-70; updated estimates are available at www.frbsf.org/economic-

research/economists/john-williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.)  In addition, Holston, 

Laubach, and Williams (2016) find significant but somewhat smaller declines in equilibrium rates for the 

euro area, Canada, and the United Kingdom (see Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams 

(2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest:  International Trends and Determinants,” Working Paper
