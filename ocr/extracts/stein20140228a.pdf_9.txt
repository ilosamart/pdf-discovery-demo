is that, when a fundâ€™s assets are illiquid, outflows today are met in part with drawdowns 

from cash reserves, with the other assets being sold off more gradually over time--hence, 

the predictable downward pressure on prices going forward.  This predictability is what 

creates the incentive for any given investor to pull out quickly if he or she sees a large 

number of co-investors pulling out.

Let me summarize by noting the areas in which I agree most closely with the 

authors and by adding one key qualification.  First, I think they are absolutely on target in 

emphasizing that the rapid growth of fixed-income funds--as well as other, similar 

vehicles--bears careful watching.  As they point out, it would be a mistake to be 

complacent about this phenomenon simply because such funds are unlevered.  Other 

economic mechanisms can mimic the run-like incentives associated with short-term debt 

financing, and one or more of these mechanisms may well be present in fixed-income 

funds. 

Second, I also agree that there is no general separation principle for monetary 

policy and financial stability.  Monetary policy is fundamentally in the business of 

altering risk premiums such as term premiums and credit spreads.  So monetary 

policymakers cannot wash their hands of what happens when these spreads revert 

sharply.  If these abrupt reversions also turn out to have nontrivial economic 

consequences, then they are clearly of potential relevance to policymakers. 

My one qualification is as follows:  In the absence of a general separation 

principle, when one might consider addressing financial stability issues either with

 Indeed, the results in the paper closely parallel those in Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang (2010), who find that 

fund flows forecast future returns more strongly among those equity funds that hold relatively illiquid 

stocks (for example, small-cap stocks).  Moreover, Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang cast their regressions as 

being an explicit test of the strategic-complementarity hypothesis.
