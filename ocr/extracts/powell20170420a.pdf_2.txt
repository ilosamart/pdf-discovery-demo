Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.1  I will begin by looking back at the 

global financial crisis and the great recession, which were arriving on the horizon at about this 

time 10 years ago.  For the United States and many other countries, this would turn out to be the 

most painful economic crisis since the Great Depression.  The fact that we had a severe recession 

but not another depression is a tribute to the aggressive response of those who were in a position 

to act at that time.2     

 In the event, the financial system avoided collapse but incurred severe damage and 

proved incapable, for a time, of performing its key functions.  That was true of the largest 

investment and commercial banks, several of which either failed or required taxpayer support to 

survive.  It was also true of the many pieces of the financial market infrastructure whose 

structural weaknesses contributed to the crisis, such as the triparty repurchase agreement (repo) 

market, the over-the-counter derivative market, and prime money market funds.   

The financial turmoil caused heavy damage to the real economy.  Payroll employment 

declined by almost 9 million; over 7 million people lost their homes.3  Many young people 

entered a terrible job market; research shows that this may adversely affect their careers for 

many years.  Many experienced workers who lost their jobs may suffer permanently lower 

income prospects.4     

The nation faced two big tasks after the crisis.  We had to get the economy growing again 

so people could get back to work and rebuild their financial lives.  And we had to return the
