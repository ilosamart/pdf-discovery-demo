firmâ€™s systemic significance, a factor that unfortunately had not been included in Basel.  I hope 

that when it comes time for a review of the Basel methodology for identifying and grouping G-

SIBs, funding practices and vulnerabilities will receive more attention.  And there may be further 

steps that could increase that sensitivity.  Exploring ideas along these lines seems to me far 

preferable to raising minimum liquidity requirements for all banks, even those with capital levels 

well above the regulatory minimum.  For example, while stress testing has traditionally focused 

on risks to capital, some observers have suggested adding liquidity risks to the stress test. 

 Turning now to some implications for other intermediaries, I will begin with broker-

dealers, which pose perhaps the clearest case of the capital/funding relationship.  Broker-dealers 

tend to hold large amounts of assets that are of longer duration, but that also are relatively liquid 

in normal times (in contrast, say, to whole loans by a bank).  However, as seen most graphically 

in the case of mortgage-backed securities during the crisis, many of these assets can rapidly 

become quite illiquid in periods of stress.  Since broker-dealers generally fund substantial 

portions of these assets with short-term liabilities, such as repurchase agreements (repos) rather 

than insured deposits, there is the potential, again seen in the crisis, for runs reminiscent of the 

bank runs of the era before the advent of deposit insurance.   

To a considerable extent, of course, the Basel framework covers these firms.  In the EU, 

any broker-dealer is covered, whether as a stand-alone entity or as part of a universal bank.  In 

the pre-crisis period in the United States, matters were less clear, since only broker-dealers 

affiliated with bank holding companies were covered by the full panoply of Basel requirements.  

There was partial coverage of the five largest freestanding broker-dealers that needed such 

oversight in order to operate within the EU.  Because, during the crisis, those five firms either 

became bank holding companies or failed and had their continuing operations absorbed by bank
