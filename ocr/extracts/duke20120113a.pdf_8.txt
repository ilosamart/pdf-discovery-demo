supervision of CRE lending and concluded that the guidance warranted clarification.6  Federal 

Reserve staff is working with the other agencies on ways to clarify the expectations of the 

interagency CRE guidance and reduce any unintended restrictions on sound lending. 

 Given the high level of losses experienced on construction and land development projects 

over the past several years and the number of failed banks with high concentrations of such 

lending, it seems prudent for banks to keep construction loan exposures at, or even well below, 

100 percent of capital.  However, losses on loans secured by existing non-owner occupied 

commercial real estate have been much more modest, suggesting that banks’ efforts to maintain 

concentration ratios below 300 percent of capital may constrain lending for some creditworthy 

borrowers. 

 Moreover, to generate loan volume without increasing real estate lending, many banks are 

now targeting growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, a type of lending with which 

they may have less expertise.  In fact, banks have generally experienced higher loss rates on C&I 

loans than on commercial real estate secured loans (excluding construction loan losses), even 

through the crisis.  So this portfolio shift has the potential to increase rather than decrease 

expected losses. 

 For my part, I believe we should retain and perhaps strengthen the 100 percent of capital 

guideline on construction lending and consider dropping or modifying the 300 percent guideline 

for non-owner occupied CRE loans.  Analysis undertaken by Federal Reserve staff suggests that 

retaining only the 100 percent guideline on construction loans would still be adequate to identify 

the banks at greatest risk.  And bankers would still have to manage their loan portfolios
