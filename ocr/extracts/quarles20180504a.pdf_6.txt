One particular liquidity requirement for large banking organizations is the LCR, 

which the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted in 2014.5  The LCR rule requires 

covered firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)--in terms of both 

quantity and quality--to cover potential outflows over a 30-day period of liquidity stress.  

The LCR rule allows firms to meet this requirement with a range of cash and securities 

and does not apply a haircut to reserve balances or Treasury securities based on the 

estimated liquidity value of those instruments in times of stress.  Further, firms are 

required to demonstrate that they can monetize HQLA in a stress event without adversely 

affecting the firm’s reputation or franchise.        

The rules have resulted in some changes in the behavior of large banks and in 

market dynamics.  Large banks have adjusted their funding profiles by shifting to more 

stable funding sources.  Indeed, taken together, the covered banks have reduced their 

reliance on short-term wholesale funding from about 50 percent of total assets in the 

years before the financial crisis to about 30 percent in recent years, and they have also 

reduced their reliance on contingent funding sources.  Meanwhile, covered banks have 

also adjusted their asset profiles, materially increasing their holdings of cash and other 

highly liquid assets.  In fact, these banks’ holdings of HQLA have increased significantly, 

from low levels at some firms in the lead-up to the crisis to an average of about 15 to 

20 percent of total assets today.6  A sizable portion of these assets currently consists of 

U.S. central bank reserve balances, in part because reserve balances, unlike other types of
