leverage of financial intermediaries would help identify where we are in a credit cycle.  

For example, we can look at the marginal leverage of new borrowing by examining data 

on collateral haircuts.  We may also monitor data on repo market activity and haircuts to 

spot vulnerabilities relating to maturity mismatches.  This information can be 

crosschecked against firm- and sector-level data on credit risk exposure.  

One aspect of systemic risk surveillance that has garnered a great deal of attention 

is the identification of asset price bubbles.  Bubbles present systemic danger when major 

financial institutions use leverage to finance investment in risky assets that they hold on 

their balance sheets.  The systemic risk is multiplied when the asset bubble is 

accompanied by a credit bubble that fuels highly leveraged investment.6  So a top priority 

of systemic risk surveillance must be to assess whether asset price movements suggest 

the presence of a bubble and identify at an early stage those that might be particularly 

dangerous.  In practice, of course, we will have highly uncertain notions of when 

excesses evolve into bubbles.  Near the end of a bubble, it’s pretty clear that something is 

amiss.  But by then it’s too late to do much about it. 

We will also need to monitor the cross-sectional correlations of firms’ risk 

exposures.7  In addition, we need information on counterparty exposures through 

derivatives and other financial instruments.  Finally, further development of financial

7 A number of promising measures of measuring systemic risk that take into account the correlations of 
firms’ strategies have recently been developed.  For example, the CoVaR approach aims to measure the 
marginal contribution of a financial institution to systemic risk, where systemic risk is measured by the 
value at risk of all firms together; see Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2009), “CoVaR,” Staff 
Report 348 (New York:  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August), available at
