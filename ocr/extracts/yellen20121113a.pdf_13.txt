tasks for monetary policymakers:  first, setting policy to pursue the longer-run objectives; 

and second, adjusting policy in response to shocks to minimize shorter-run fluctuations 

around those objectives. 

Clarity on longer-run goals, due to the important role of expectations, can itself 

help reduce short-run fluctuations.  In the words of the January consensus statement, 

“communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation 

expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term 

interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment 

in the face of significant economic disturbances.”15   

Put differently, the purpose of providing greater clarity about the FOMC’s longer-

run inflation goal is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly.  These more firmly 

anchored expectations in turn free the Committee’s hand to more actively and effectively 

stabilize short-run fluctuations in economic activity.  The Committee can act in this way 

because the FOMC can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in 

order to more forcefully stabilize employment without needing to worry that the public 

will mistake these actions as the pursuit of a higher or lower long-run inflation objective.  

The instability of inflation, inflation expectations, and employment in response to the oil 

price increases of the 1970s vividly illustrates the threat posed by price shocks when 

longer-term inflation expectations are not well anchored. 

To minimize short-run fluctuations, the FOMC also needs to decide how to 

respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and maximum 

employment.  The goals of stable prices and maximum employment are often
