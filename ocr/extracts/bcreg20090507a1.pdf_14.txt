Figure 7: Supervisor Estimates of Credit Card Loan Loss Rates for More Adverse Scenario 
[Graphic. Bar chart. Unit is percent. The range among 12 BHCs was from about 17.4 
percent to about 37.6 percent, and the median rate was about 22.3 percent. End of graphic.] 

II.D. Resources to Absorb Losses 

Supervisors reviewed the BHCs' submissions of resources they would have available to absorb 

losses over the two-year horizon under both scenarios. These resources consist of PPNR - net interest 

income, fees and other non-interest income, net of non-credit-related expenses - and reserves already 

established for probable incurred losses at December 31 , 2008. Supervisors also developed 

independent estimates based on the historical relationship between components of PPNR and 

macroeconomic activity. In addition, supervisors developed estimates of the size of the allowance for 

loan and lease losses (ALLL) needed to cover anticipated losses for the year following the end of the 

scenario (2011). If the estimate of the year-end 2010 ALLL exceeded the ALLL as of year-end 2008, then 

the BHC was presumed to have to make provisions to cover this increase, representing a drain on 

resources available to absorb losses. Estimates of aggregate future resources to absorb losses - PPNR 

and changes in the ALLL-total $363 billion for 2009 and 2010, reflecting the weak economic outlook 

specified in the more adverse scenario. For the 14 BHCs for which historical data on BHCs are most 

relevant, the combined PPNR-to-assets ratio is estimated to remain almost 15 percent below the past 

twenty-year average for each of the next two years. Estimates of ALLL needs at 2010 suggest that most 

BHCs will need to build reserves over the scenario horizon, representing a net drain on resources. 

Figure 8 shows the ratio of estimated PPNR minus any additional reserve needs over the two-

year horizon (or plus any reserve releases) to risk-weighted assets for the 19 BHCs in the more adverse 

scenario. Available resources vary considerably across firms. Some of this variation is inherent in the 

business focus of particular firms and the extent to which the firms generate high (low) pre-credit cost 

revenue as an offset to high (low) average credit costs. Another part of the variation reflects differences 

in the estimated stability of revenues and expenses in a stressed economic environment such as the 

more adverse scenario.
