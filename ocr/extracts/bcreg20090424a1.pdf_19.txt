adjusted net income (PPNR less credit losses less reserve builds reflected on a net of tax basis) for the 
two-year horizon through equity capital. The estimated losses were on a post-purchase accounting 
basis.11 [Footnote 11 .For purchased impaired loans, the projected Tier 1 Capital and Common Stockholder's 
Equity incorporated credit losses and provisions that reflect consideration of the discounts on purchased impaired 
loans and any adjustments made by the SCAP if the estimated credit losses exceeded the credit loss portion of 
the discounts on the purchased impaired loans as of the acquisition date. End footnote 11.]This effectively treats 
losses and provisions as an instantaneous event that is offset by revenue earned over the period. Projected reserve 
increases over the assessment horizon imply a net need to provision for future losses, which reduced resources 
available to absorb legacy losses and increased capital needs. Finally, supervisors estimated the impact of payments 
of preferred dividends and incorporated the impact of regulatory capital rules such as limits on the inclusion of 
deferred tax assets in Tier 1 Capital. This generated projections of pro forma capital levels absent any further 
changes in capital participation by private investors or the U.S. Treasury. 
To determine the necessary capital buffer, supervisors did not rely on a single indicator of 
capital, but examined a range of indicators of capital adequacy including but not limited to pro forma 
equity capital and Tier 1 capital, including the composition of capital. Tier 1 capital, as defined in the 
Board's Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Guidelines, is composed of common and non-common equity 
elements, some of which are subject to limits on their inclusion in Tier 1 capital.12 [Footnote 12. See 12 CFR part 
225, Appendix A, ยง II.A.l. End footnote 12.] These elements include common stockholders' equity, qualifying 
perpetual preferred stock, certain minority interests, and trust preferred securities. Certain intangible assets, 
including goodwill and deferred tax assets, are deducted from Tier 1 capital or are included subject to limits.13 

[Footnote 13. See 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A, ยง II.B. End footnote 13.] 
Supervisors have long indicated that common equity should be the dominant component of Tier 
1 capital, so a measure of voting common stockholders' equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred 
stock, less qualifying trust preferred securities, and less minority interests in subsidiaries) was also 
examined. The Board's capital adequacy guidelines currently state that voting common stockholders' 
equity generally should be the dominant element within Tier 1 capital, so the approach is consistent 
with existing capital guidelines and does not imply a new capital standard. This analytical work provided 
an initial estimate of capital needs for each BHC to remain appropriately capitalized even if the more 
adverse scenario materializes. 
The initial assessment of the capital need was conveyed to the BHCs in late April. The final 
capital assessment will include actual results year-to-date, including 2009 Ql operating performance 
and corporate activities, such as sales of specific assets or business or capital events, such as a new 
issuance of equity securities. Supervisors evaluated this information considering the safety and 
soundness of individual BHCs and the stability of the broader financial system.
