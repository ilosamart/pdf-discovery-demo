nonfinancial firms.  This characteristic often means that leverage is higher.  It almost always 

means that a large portion of the liability side of the balance sheet is accounted for by such 

customers, who are not well-positioned to evaluate the soundness of these intermediaries’ often-

opaque balance sheets.   

Consider the case of a very traditional life insurance company, which collects premiums 

from customers over a protracted period of time, while promising a payout to beneficiaries if the 

insured dies within the coverage period.  The duration of the exposure, difficulties in evaluating 

the company’s ability to pay, and the potentially high costs of changing coverage to another firm 

even if that evaluation can be done together provide a rationale for insurance company capital 

requirements.  Here the motivation for capital regulation is likely oriented toward the capacity of 

the company to meet these long-term claims as they come due, presumably over a fairly 

extended span.  Investors and counterparties from the financial sector might well be left to fend 

for themselves.  Thus this rationale for capital regulation focuses only on assuring sufficient 

assets over time to satisfy the policyholders’ claims should the company fail, with less attention 

to maintaining the company as a going concern. 

 A second example of how the liability side of an intermediary’s balance sheet suggests 

the appropriate form of capital regulation is presented by the familiar problem of deposit runs on 

banks.  Like a policyholder, a depositor has difficulty gauging the health of the financial 

intermediary.  But unlike a life insurance policyholder, a depositor can withdraw all or most of 

her funds if she has any fear--even an ill-founded fear--that the bank may be in trouble.  Indeed, 

depositors have a rational incentive to act quickly, since the first to withdraw will have the best 

chance of getting all their money back.  Experience with bank runs, and with the more-damaging 

                                                 
They also disproportionately arise from financial transactions – such as accepting deposits or investments – rather 
than for performance of services or delivery of goods.
