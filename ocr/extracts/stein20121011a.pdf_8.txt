Treasury rate by 20 basis points.  A simple way to proceed would be to plug this 20 basis 

point change into one of our econometric models and ask what the consequences are for 

gross domestic product growth and unemployment.  As a concrete case, if you did this 

exercise  with the Fed’s workhorse FRB/US model, it would tell you that the $500 billion 

LSAP should bring down the unemployment rate by approximately two-tenths of a 

percentage point at a two-year horizon.8  This effect is economically meaningful. 

Naturally, all models rely on a host of assumptions, so the true effect could be 

larger or smaller than what comes out of the FRB/US model.  But I will focus on two 

sources of uncertainty in particular.  A first uncertainty relates to a point raised earlier--

that a given impact on Treasury bonds may not pass through fully to other rates that are 

more relevant for consumption and investment decisions, such as corporate bond rates or 

primary mortgage market rates.  The recent academic literature seems divided on this 

point, as some papers argue that the pass-through is near 100 percent while others claim 

that it is quite low.9  My own reading of the evidence is that, thus far, there has been 

substantial pass-through from LSAPs to corporate bonds and mortgages, and some, but 

considerably less, to other, more distant asset categories like equities.   

Leaving aside this set of complications--so that we suppose our $500 billion 

LSAP has an impact of 20 basis points on corporate bond rates as well as on Treasury 

rates--there is a second, perhaps more fundamental, issue.  How should one expect a 

company to respond when its long-term borrowing costs fall not because of a change in 

                                                 
8 See Chung and others (2012). 
9 Papers that examine the pass-through issue include Gagnon and others (2011), Wright (2011), 
Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011), Swanson (2011), and Hancock and Passmore (2011).  
Primary mortgage rates, of course, are distinct from secondary-market rates for assets traded in centralized 
markets.  A variety of factors affect the wedge between the secondary MBS rate and the primary mortgage 
rate, and these factors, and hence the degree of pass-through, may vary over time.
