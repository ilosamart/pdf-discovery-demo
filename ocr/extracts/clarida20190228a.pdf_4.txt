need for further adjustments in our policy stance.2  Going forward, we need, I believe, to 

be cognizant of the balance we must strike between (1) being forward looking and 

(2) maximizing the odds of being right given the reality that the models that we consult 

are not infallible.  For example, were a model to predict a surge in inflation, a decision 

for preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced 

against the considerable cost of the model being wrong.  Given muted inflation and stable 

inflation expectations, I believe we can be patient and allow the data to flow in as we 

determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be 

appropriate to strike this balance. 

We also decided at our January meeting to maintain our current operating 

regime--a “floor” system--for implementing monetary policy.3  The FOMC will continue 

to set the stance of policy by establishing the target range for the federal funds rate.  The 

interest on excess reserves rate will be our primary tool to keep the federal funds rate in 

the target range.  In this regime, we will provide an ample supply of reserves in the 

banking system to ensure that we remain on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve 

and that the federal funds rate is insulated from shocks to reserve demand and supply.  

With this decision on our operating regime made, the Committee can now decide on the 

appropriate timing and pace for concluding our balance sheet drawdown.  In the longer 

run, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will be determined by the demand for Federal 

Reserve liabilities such as currency and reserve balances.
