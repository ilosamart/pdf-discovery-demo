won’t, and perhaps we shouldn’t.  A diversity of views can be a strength.  A robust 

discussion requires a thorough analysis of differing views, which leads to a more 

informed understanding of issues.  This healthy give and take is the fourth reason for 

better communication:  It leads to better outcomes.   

I will cite one example that I know is on the minds of many of you--the  

rulemaking process the agencies are currently engaged in on the community bank 

leverage ratio (CBLR).  Here is an excellent example of where it makes good sense to 

consult closely.  I know you have a lot of knowledge and expertise to bring to bear on 

this issue, which helps explain why Congress has required the agencies to consult with 

the states.  As you know, the Fed and the other agencies are now gathering and evaluating 

comments on the CBLR and getting feedback on this interagency proposal.  So, now is a 

good time to re-engage.  I am committed to re-engaging with you on the interagency 

proposal and ways we might be able to improve it.  I am eager to hear your thoughts.       

I have one more reason for better communication, but first I will give you an idea 

of what I have in mind for that consultation.  The formal means by which CSBS and 

others comment on a rulemaking is important, but I think we would also all benefit from 

more informal, and more frequent contact.  If you have an issue, if you have something to 

say, just pick up the phone.  It is also my intention to be on the road a lot, visiting Federal 

Reserve Districts and talking to bankers, consumers, and community groups.  When I 

come to your state, I hope to see you, and I promise to make time to talk.  

My final reason for better communication brings me back to a point I made at the 

outset: the United States needs a strong community-banking sector.  We need strong 

community banks because they help support strong communities.  Strong communities
