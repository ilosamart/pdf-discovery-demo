indirect contagion risks are high.  Thus, the long-term and short-term liquidity ratios 

might be refashioned so as to address directly the risks of large SFT books. 

 Similarly, existing bank and broker-dealer risk-based capital rules do not reflect 

fully the financial stability risks associated with SFTs.  Accordingly, higher, generally 

applicable capital charge applied to SFTs might be a useful piece of a complementary set 

of macroprudential measures, though an indirect measure like a capital charge might have 

to be quite large to create adequate incentive to temper the use of short-term wholesale 

funding.   

By definition, both liquidity and capital requirements would be limited to banking 

entities already within the perimeter of prudential regulation.  The obvious questions are 

whether these firms at present occupy enough of the wholesale funding markets that 

standards applicable only to them would be reasonably effective in addressing systemic 

risk and, even if that question is answered affirmatively, whether the imposition of such 

standards would soon lead to significant arbitrage through increased participation by 

those outside the regulatory circle. 

 In part for these reasons, a second possibility that has received considerable 

attention is a universal minimum margining requirement applicable directly to SFTs.  The 

Financial Stability Board has already issued a consultative paper, and received public 

comment, on the idea.  Under such a regime, all repo lenders, for example, could be 

required to take a minimum amount of over-collateralization as determined by regulators 

(the amount varying with the nature of the securities collateral), regardless of whether the 

repo lender or repo borrower were otherwise prudentially regulated.  This kind of 

requirement could be an effective tool to limit procyclicality in securities financing and,
