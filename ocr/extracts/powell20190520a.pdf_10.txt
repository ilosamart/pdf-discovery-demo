Addressing the Risks:  Monitoring and Acting 

Overall, vulnerabilities to financial stability from business debt and other factors 

do not appear elevated.  We take the risks from business debt seriously but think that the 

financial system appears strong enough to handle potential losses.  We also know that our 

dynamic financial system does not stand still.  We can always learn more about financial 

markets, and we will always act to address emerging risks.  Together with our domestic 

and international counterparts, we are monitoring developments in business debt markets, 

working to develop and share data on how these markets operate, studying ways to 

further strengthen the system, and working to ensure that banks are properly managing 

the business debt risks they have taken on.  

Through the FSOC, the banking and market regulators coordinate our monitoring 

of financial conditions.  In recent meetings, the FSOC has discussed leveraged lending in 

depth.  We recognize that each regulator directly sees only a part of the larger picture, 

and we are working to stitch these parts together so we can collectively see that larger 

picture and the risks it holds.  For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission is 

examining the potential for liquidity strains at mutual funds, and the Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission is working to understand the use of derivatives to hedge risks 

associated with leveraged loans.   

What else are we watching for?  Business debt growth has moderated somewhat 

since early 2018, but this might be just a pause.  Another sharp increase in debt, unless 

supported by strong fundamentals, could increase vulnerabilities appreciably.
