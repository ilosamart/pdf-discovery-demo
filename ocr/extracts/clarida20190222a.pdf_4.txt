else being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy 

rate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.  That 

development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy 

to support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.4 

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less 

responsive to resource slack.  That is, the short-run Phillips curve appears to have 

flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and 

employment.5  A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.  It 

permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during 

downturns--as was the case during and after the Great Recession--because a sustained 

inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6  However, a flatter 

Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing 

unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, a flatter Phillips curve 

makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at 

levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 

                                                 
4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications 
for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), 
Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019). 
5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among 
others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for 
International Settlements (2017). 
6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary 
policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such 
a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and 
Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a 
central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the 
adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary 
policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to 
shocks. 
7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others 
(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the 
precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review
