tenure by publishing typically overlaps with the period in which many women 

contemplate starting a family, forcing difficult trade-offs.35   

Employers may require the long hours and short absences for good reasons--for 

instance, the work may involve relationships with clients or accumulating a significant 

amount of knowledge about a deal or case in a condensed period of time.  If it is costly 

for employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high 

premium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours.36  

Workplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co-workers, such as 

law partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks.37   

But however sensible such arrangements may be from a business perspective, it 

can be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children.  

The very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely discourages some 

women--as well as men--from pursuing these career tracks.  Advances in technology 

have facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further 

opportunities in this direction.38  Economic models also suggest that while it can be 

difficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were 

to change their model, they and their workers could all be better off.39 

Of course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or 

that impose such severe penalties for taking time off.  But the difficulty of balancing 

work and family is a widespread problem.  In fact, the recent trend in many occupations 

                                                 
35 Unfortunately, in contrast to some of the successful gender neutral policies I discuss below, efforts to 
address the tenure problem by giving all new parents extra time before the tenure decision has actually had 
the effect of reducing female tenure rates and raising those of men. Antecol, Bedrard and Stearns, (2016).
