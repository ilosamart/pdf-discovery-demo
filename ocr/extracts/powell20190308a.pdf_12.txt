the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank’s goal, once 

the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by 

stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target.  In 

standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this 

future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that prospect will promote anticipatory 

consumption and investment.  This can substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB 

spells.10  Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11 For 

example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses 

on either side of the target would be offset.   

By the time of the crisis, there was a well-established body of model-based 

research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12  In light of 

this research, one might ask why the Fed and other major central banks chose not to 

pursue such a policy.13  The answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and 

reality.  For makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and 

businesses must be quite confident that the “makeup stimulus” is really coming.  This 

confidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a 

downturn.  In models, confidence in the policy is merely an assumption.  In practice, 

                                                 
10 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a 
commitment to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions.  See also Wolman (2005) 
for a discussion of the effectiveness of price-level targeting at the ELB.  For a discussion of the relationship 
between price-level targeting and average-inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005).  
11 The strategy in Reifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a 
Taylor rule modified to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes.  Kiley and 
Roberts (2017) study a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during 
normal times to compensate for below-target inflation during ELB episodes.  See also Bernanke (2017) for 
a strategy in which low inflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB.  
12 See, for example, English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015); Hebden and López-Salido (2018); 
Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2019).  
13 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation-overshooting 
commitment” (p. 1).  The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or 
duration of overshoot.
