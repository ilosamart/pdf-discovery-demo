In my view, the language now incorporated into the statement affirmatively 

conveys the Committee’s determination to keep monetary policy highly accommodative 

until well into the recovery.  And the specific numbers that were selected as thresholds 

for a possible change in the federal funds rate target should confirm that the FOMC 

expects to hold that target lower for longer than would be typical during a normal 

economic recovery.  This improved guidance should help the public to accurately adjust 

their expectations for the federal funds rate in response to new financial and economic 

information, which should make policy more effective.

  In addition, I hope that 

improved guidance will help to boost confidence in the outlook and bolster households’ 

unusually depressed expectations for income gains, which in turn will spur a faster 

recovery. 

A considerable body of research suggests that, in normal times, the evolution of 

the federal funds rate target can be reasonably well described by some variant of the 

widely known Taylor rule.

  Rules of this type have been shown to work quite well as 

guidelines for policy under normal conditions, and they are familiar to market 

participants, helping them judge how short-term rates are likely to respond to changing 

economic conditions.   

The current situation, however, is abnormal in two important and related ways. 

First, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been an unusually large and 

persistent shortfall in aggregate demand.  Second, use of the federal funds rate has been 

constrained by the effective lower bound so that monetary policy has been unable to

 The new guidance should serve as an automatic stabilizer in the face of shifts in the outlook.  For 

example, weaker economic data, suggesting that the thresholds will be reached later than previously 

anticipated, should lead market participants to push out the expected timing of liftoff, automatically 

promoting lower longer-term rates and an easing of financial conditions.  See, for example, Yellen (2012b).
