note in this regard that it will be essential that any global SIFI capital standards, as well as Basel 

III, be rigorously enforced in all Basel Committee countries. 

Work on this subject in the Basel Committee started a bit slowly, but it has picked up 

considerably in recent months.  Although there is not yet consensus on some of the key elements, 

discussions have decidedly moved in that direction.  I am hopeful that in the next several months 

we will be able to agree upon a proposal on which the Basel Committee can seek public 

comment.  This international process would roughly coincide with a domestic notice and 

comment process on a proposed Federal Reserve rulemaking covering enhanced prudential 

standards for SIFIs.  The parallelism of the international and domestic processes should facilitate 

the goal of congruence.  Of course, we will in any case apply our enhanced standards, as required 

by Dodd-Frank, to foreign banking organizations operating in the United States. 

Calibrating the Enhanced Capital Standards 

 As I mentioned earlier, the minimum and conservation buffer capital requirements of 

Basel III were calibrated by looking to the loss experience of larger banks.  The intuition behind 

this approach was that historical loss experience provided the best basis for determining the 

amount of capital a bank would need in order to be regarded by counterparties as a viable 

financial intermediary.  The minimum requirement was calculated by reference to the loss 

experiences of larger banks over several decades.  The conservation buffer, intended to be the 

amount of capital necessary for a bank to withstand losses during a period of stress and still be 

above minimum required levels, was calculated by reference to the recent financial crisis.   

 A number of significant assumptions must be made in conducting analyses of this sort.  

For this reason, we found it more sensible to think in terms of ranges of capital requirements 

implied by this approach, rather than a specific number.  Setting the final requirements still
