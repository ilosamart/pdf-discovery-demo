holding companies, all sizeable domestically owned broker-dealers are now covered by Basel 

requirements.   

 However, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the Basel framework itself has not gone as 

far as is desirable in making capital requirements at the largest institutions sensitive to 

macroprudential funding concerns, a circumstance underscored by the balance sheets typical of 

broker-dealers.  Consideration of changes such as refinement of the formula for assigning 

surcharges to G-SIBs would be useful when Basel standards are revisited over time.  In the 

interim, there are more near-term opportunities for supervisory measures that take account of the 

relationship between capital levels and funding vulnerabilities.   

 Perhaps the most interesting application of a liability-side focus on capital regulation is 

the case of insurance companies.  Given the ongoing discussions of capital standards in the 

International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the issue is also a timely one.  Several 

relevant points can be derived from attention to the liability side of insurance company balance 

sheets. 

 First, as shown in my earlier example of how liability structure affects capital needs, the 

largest segment of a traditional insurance companyâ€™s liabilities is composed of contingent claims 

based on the occurrence of specified events, such as the death of an insured person or destruction 

of insured property.  These claims cannot be accelerated at the discretion of the holders of the 

contracts so, unlike deposits in a bank, these liabilities cannot run in any meaningful sense.  

Unless customers decide to sever their relationship with the company, in which case the 

contingent liability will be reduced or eliminated, they will continue to provide funding to the 

firm.  Life insurance, in particular, has an unusually predictable liability pattern, well-refined by 

actuaries over the years.  Thus there is a relative absence of liquidity risk as compared with other
