I expect that economic conditions will support the first rate increase later this 

year.  I do not expect that such an increase or the associated market reaction will 

materially restrain the progress of the economy.  From a macroeconomic perspective, the 

precise timing of liftoff is less important than the path of subsequent additional rate 

increases.  My view is that, if the economy continues on its expected path, it will be 

appropriate for a time to increase rates fairly gradually.  Of course, if the economy 

improves faster or inflation increases more than expected, it will be appropriate to raise 

rates faster.  And if economic performance disappoints or inflation remains lower than 

expected, it will be appropriate to delay liftoff or raise rates more slowly thereafter. 

There are several reasons why it may be appropriate to raise rates somewhat 

gradually, including the proximity of the zero lower bound for interest rates and 

continuing economic headwinds in the wake of the crisis.2  I would like to explore a 

rationale that has received somewhat less attention, which is the unusually high level of 

uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.3  

Uncertainty about the precise level of these indicators becomes more important for policy 

as the expansion continues and the economy approaches its potential, defined as the level 

of output that is consistent with stable prices.

3 The natural rate of unemployment can be thought of as the unemployment rate at which the labor market 
is at its long-run equilibrium and inflation is stable.  We cannot directly observe the natural rate but must 
infer it based on the performance of wages, prices, and labor market indicators.  Most FOMC participants 
estimate that the longer-run normal rate is currently in the range of 5.0 to 5.2 percent.  Confidence intervals 
around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite wide.  For example, 
Staiger, Stock, and Watson estimate a 95 percent confidence range around the natural rate to extend nearly 
1½ percentage points on either side of the point estimate.  See Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark 
W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Christina D. 
Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and Strategy (Chicago:  University of 
Chicago Press).
