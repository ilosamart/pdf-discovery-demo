considerably.2  At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 

4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3  In 

other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.   

With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been 

in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important.  On 

expected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be 

concerned more about undershooting than overshooting.  Although some survey 

measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the 

lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4  Meanwhile, 

market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past 

two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent 

stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate.  Thus, we cannot rule out that the 

sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary 

pressures are weighing on inflation expectations.  

Recognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP) from June 2012 to June 2016.  The SEP forecasts have shown repeated 

mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of 

the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently.

12-month average basis.

University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the average over the prior 

10 years.
