beyond these employment outcomes.  Based on forthcoming SCF data, for example, the 

average annual income for families in metro areas was about $54,000 higher than for 

families in nonmetro areas, and the average wealth holdings for families in metro areas 

exceeded average wealth for families in nonmetro areas by nearly $500,000--and these 

gaps have more than doubled over the past three decades.18  The gaps in many other 

measures of well-being have widened as well.  In small towns and rural areas, college 

attainment rates have increased by less, disability rates have increased by more, divorce 

rates have risen by more, and mortality due to lung disease, cancer, or cardiovascular 

disease have either improved by less or worsened by more.19  Opioid use is also most 

prevalent in less populous metro and rural areas.20   

I have seen many of these challenges first hand.  In the small towns and hollers of 

eastern Kentucky, I visited with community development financial institutions that are 

trying to plug the gap in access to credit so that small businesses can continue operating 

and hiring locally, and so that families can access housing that is safe and affordable.  In 

rural communities in the Mississippi Delta, I learned about diminished access to financial 

services available to rural residents, which can be a barrier to housing and business 

investment and pose vexing challenges to local governments.  In Texas, I learned about 

barriers to economic development in the rural colonias areas on the southern border 

associated with underinvestment in physical and broadband infrastructure.21   

18 Staff estimates from forthcoming SCF data.  Although the difference in average income and wealth has 
grown, there has been little change in differences in median family income and wealth in larger metros 
relative to other areas.  The widening gap for average income and wealth, but not for median income and 
wealth, is because in larger metro areas income and wealth has become increasingly held by wealthier 
families.
