Wicksell follows this opening by discussing the difference between 

the ability of the economic system to adjust to changes in relative prices and 

to changes in the general level of prices.  In the latter case,  

Adjustment can no longer proceed through changes in demand or 

through a movement of factors of production from one branch of 

production to another.  Its progress is much slower, being 

accomplished under continual difficulties, and it is never 

complete; so that a residue, either temporary or permanent, of 

social maladjustment is always left over.   

Wicksell states that both inflation and deflation are evils, but that it 

is generally believed that what is most desirable is a situation “in which prices 

are rising [italics in original] slowly but steadily” (p.3).  He likens the 

arguments for this viewpoint as reminding one “of those who purposely keep 

their watches a little fast so as to be more certain of catching their trains” 

(p.3).  Rational man that he was, he dismisses such behavior--of which I am 

guilty--as not being able to survive in the long run.   

And optimist as he must have been, he concludes the opening 

chapter of his Interest and Prices by saying that “the prevention of these 

troubles by the provision of a constant measure of value cannot, in the present 

state of economic development, be regarded a priori as unthinkable” (p.7) 

2. The Quantity Theory.  Wicksell’s chapter on the quantity theory is very short.  

He states (p.41) that  

The Theory provides a real explanation of its subject matter, and 

in a manner that is logically incontestable; but only on 

assumptions that unfortunately have little relation to practice . . .4   

                                                 
4 He gives several reasons that the assumptions have little relation to practice, including that there is “a kind 

of collective holding of balances, arising out of the acceptance by banks of deposits.”
