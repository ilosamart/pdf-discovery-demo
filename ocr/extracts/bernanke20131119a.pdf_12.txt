available for private-sector portfolios declines.  As the securities purchased by the Fed 

become scarcer, they should become more valuable.  Consequently, their yields should 

fall as investors demand a smaller term premium for holding them.  This argument 

depends importantly on the assumption that the longer-term Treasury and MBS securities 

that the Fed buys are not perfectly substitutable with other types of assets, an assumption 

that seems well supported in practice.12 

As both forward rate guidance and LSAPs affect longer-term interest rates, the 

use of these tools allows monetary policy to be effective even when short-term interest 

rates are close to zero.  However, the Committee does not view these two tools as entirely 

equivalent.  One reason is that we have much less experience with policies designed to 

operate on term premiums, as LSAPs do.  As a result, though a strong majority of FOMC 

members believes that both the forward rate guidance and the LSAPs are helping to 

support the recovery, we are somewhat less certain about the magnitudes of the effects on 

financial conditions and the economy of changes in the pace of purchases or in the 

accumulated stock of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.  Moreover, economists do not 

have as good an understanding as we would like of the factors determining term 

premiums; indeed, as we saw earlier this year, hard-to-predict shifts in term premiums 

can be a source of significant volatility in interest rates and financial conditions.  LSAPs 

have other drawbacks not associated with forward rate guidance, including the risk of 

impairing the functioning of securities markets and the extra complexities for the Fed of 

operating with a much larger balance sheet, although I see both of these issues as 

                                                 
12 I discussed this effect more fully in Bernanke (2012).  As I noted then, both Milton Friedman (2000) and 
James Tobin (1965, 1969) made this argument.  LSAPs may affect financial conditions through other 
channels as well; see Bernanke (2012) for a more complete discussion.  One such channel is a “signaling 
channel,” which works to the extent that the direct action of buying securities increases the credibility of 
communication tools like forward rate guidance (Posen, 2012).
