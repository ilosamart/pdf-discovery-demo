anticipate.  Substantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilibrium real interest 

rate, and, as I will discuss momentarily, market participants appear to be fairly 

pessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time.  Moreover, some recent 

studies have raised the prospect that the economies of the United States and other 

countries will grow more slowly in the future as a result of both demographic factors and 

a slower pace of productivity gains from technological advances.  At an extreme, such 

developments could even amount to a type of “secular stagnation,” in which monetary 

policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical 

norms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly expansive fiscal 

policy.10   

Such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when 

the ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially 

uncertain.  The experience of Japan over the past 20 years, and Sweden more recently, 

demonstrates that a tightening of policy when the equilibrium real rate remains low can 

result in appreciable economic costs, delaying the attainment of a central bank’s price 

stability objective.  International experience therefore counsels caution in removing 

accommodation until the Committee is more confident that aggregate demand will 

10 The concept of “secular stagnation” was first coined back in the late 1930s; see Alvin H. Hansen (1938), 
“The Consequences of Reducing Expenditures,” Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, vol. 17 
(January), pp. 60-72; and Alvin H. Hansen (1939),  “Economic Progress and Declining Population 
Growth,” American Economic Review, vol. 29 (March), pp. 1-15.  This possibility, and its applicability to 
the United States and other developed economies in coming years, has received considerable attention of 
late; see Robert J. Gordon (2014), “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth:  Restatement, Rebuttal, and 
Reflections,” NBER Working Paper Series 19895 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic 
Research, February); Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy from the 
Financial Crisis,” in Jonathan Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29 
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press); and Lawrence H. Summers (2014), “U.S. Economic Prospects:  
Secular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound,” Business Economics, vol. 49 (April), 
pp. 65-73.  For a more skeptical assessment of the secular stagnation hypothesis, see Hamilton and others, 
“The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate,” in note 8.
