also be required to submit so-called living wills to facilitate their orderly resolution if 

necessary.  Additionally, banks must enhance their reporting systems and improve 

disclosure.  These new requirements are critical to safeguard the stability of the financial 

system and to help prevent another costly crisis.  At the same time, regulators appreciate 

that the new rules impose significant burdens on banks.  For that reason, and to minimize 

adverse effects on the supply of credit, many of the most significant rules are being 

phased in gradually and only after extended processes of consultation with industry and 

other stakeholders.   

It is worth reiterating that most of these enhanced regulatory and supervisory 

measures focus on the largest, most interconnected financial institutions, and we are 

working to ensure that community banks are not subjected to rules designed primarily to 

constrain risks at larger institutions.  We have an ongoing dialogue with community 

banks through many channels, including, for example, our Community Depository 

Institutions Advisory Council.  The council, whose membership is drawn from smaller 

banks, credit unions, and savings associations in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, 

meets with the Board in Washington twice a year to discuss supervisory and regulatory 

issues that affect their institutions.  We have also established a special supervisory 

subcommittee of the Board which focuses on community banking issues. 

In addition to strengthened regulatory and supervisory requirements, banks face 

market demands that they operate with more resilient business models.  In many contexts, 

counterparties are demanding greater security in the form of more and better-quality 

collateral or higher margins.  In addition, lenders to banks may be requiring greater 

compensation for risk, thereby raising banksâ€™ funding costs.
