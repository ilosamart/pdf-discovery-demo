edition of Purposes and Functions, published in October of last year, offers a detailed 

and comprehensive account of what, why, and how the Fed carries out its different 

responsibilities.  I think it is a wonderful resource for teaching about the Fed, and copies 

are available via the Board’s website.1 

Each of the Fed’s Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational 

initiatives in the areas of the country they serve, and the outreach to economics teachers 

is coordinated by the group chaired by Amy Hennessy, the Federal Reserve System 

Economic Education Group.   

At the Board, we have for some years operated a program called FedEd, which 

sends Fed employees into schools throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area 

and sponsors events for students here at the Eccles Building.2  FedEd’s outreach to 

schools depends on the time and sacrifice of several dozen research assistants, who are 

typically recent college graduates who work for two or three years at the Board.  

Research assistants who volunteer for FedEd visit schools; help teach about the Fed, 

economics, and finance; and answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.  

The Federal Reserve is committed to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the 

economics profession, and FedEd has furthered these goals by making sure to include 

schools with significant numbers of minority students.    

This past school year, FedEd sent research assistants into nine different schools 

and FedEd volunteers have visited 38 different schools since 2012.  FedEd was back in 

schools last fall, drawing from 48 research assistants who volunteered to participate.
