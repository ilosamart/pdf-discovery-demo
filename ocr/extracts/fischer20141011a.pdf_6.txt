In the Mundell-Fleming framework, as well as in modern developments of the 

same theme, a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy in the United States 

spills over to foreign economies by causing their interest rates to fall--though typically by 

less than in the United States--and their currencies to appreciate against the dollar.  At the 

same time, international capital flows tend to shift toward foreign economies in response 

to their relatively more attractive interest rates.   

The pass-through of changes in U.S. policy rates abroad depends importantly on 

how foreign monetary authorities respond.  A decline in U.S. policy rates has a relatively 

large effect on foreign policy rates in economies that opt to limit exchange rate 

fluctuations, at least for economies with reasonably open capital accounts.  Thus, for 

example, a fall in U.S. policy rates has a commensurate effect on interest rates in Hong 

Kong.  By contrast, the central bank in an economy with a freely floating exchange rate 

might choose to lower its interest rate by a much smaller amount than in the United States 

if it believes that domestic conditions so warrant.  In this case, the country’s exchange 

rate would appreciate as investors rebalance their portfolios in favor of assets 

denominated in its currency in response to the higher interest rate differential.5   

Moving beyond the Mundell-Fleming framework, there is also evidence that 

monetary policy actions can influence investors’ willingness to hold risky assets, the so-

called risk-taking channel.6  Such effects seem to be most potent when financial 

5 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962).  One key implication of the Mundell-Fleming framework is that 
a central bank can exercise full control over both the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate only 
when there are significant barriers to the international capital mobility.  Accordingly, policymakers face the 
constraint of the “impossible trinity,” which states that a country cannot simultaneously have an 
independent monetary policy, free capital movement, and a fixed exchange .

conditions more broadly than the level of safe interest rates.  See Borio and Zhu (2012), Rey (2013), Morris
