that, as I assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy scenarios based on a set of 

policy rules and economic projections, it is important to recognize up front that key 

inputs to this assessment, including u* and r*, are unobservable and must be inferred 

from data via models.10  I would now like to discuss how I incorporate such 

considerations into thinking about how to choose among monetary policy alternatives. 

A monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a 

model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment—and humility!—to formulate, 

and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent with the central bank’s 

objectives.  There are two distinct ways in which I think that the path for the federal 

funds rate should be data dependent.11  Monetary policy should be data dependent in the 

sense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the 

ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.  This information on 

where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into 

interest rate feedback rules—after all, they have to feed back on something.  Data 

dependence in this sense is well understood, as it is of the type implied by a large family 

of policy rules, including Taylor-type rules discussed earlier, in which the parameters of 

the economy needed to formulate such rules are taken as known. 

But, of course, key parameters needed to formulate such rules, including u* and 

r*, are unknown.  As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should be—and in the 

United States, I believe, is—data dependent in a second sense:  Policymakers should and 

                                                 
Governors (2018).  A note, titled “Policy Rules and How Policymakers Use Them,” on the Board’s website 
covers similar ground and is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-rules-and-

else” (quoted in Bennett (1995)).
