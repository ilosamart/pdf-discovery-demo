difficult to precisely disentangle the contribution of changes in inflation expectations, 

liquidity premiums, and inflation risk premiums to this downward shift, some 

decompositions suggest that, while expected inflation may not have declined much, 

market participants may be placing a somewhat greater likelihood than previously on 

episodes of below-potential growth being accompanied by below-target inflation.  Thus, 

the decline in measures of inflation expectations warrants close monitoring.   

The slow progress on inflation, together with the likely low level of the longer-

term neutral real rate and the slow pace at which the very low shorter-term rate may 

move to the longer-term rate, suggest that the federal funds rate is likely to adjust more 

gradually and to a lower level than in previous expansions.  In short, “gradual and low” is 

likely to be the new normal.   

In addition, the combination of a low neutral real rate with slow progress on 

inflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound than in previous 

decades, when the neutral rate was probably much higher.  The lower the longer-term 

nominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to 

push growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate below 

zero to provide accommodation.  Assuming there has not been a material reduction in the 

frequency and severity of negative shocks since the pre-crisis period, the implication is 

that the probability of being constrained by the zero lower bound is greater than prior to 

the crisis.   

Although empirical analysis suggests that unconventional tools affect the 

economy through the same channels as the federal funds rate, even so, there are greater 

costs and uncertainties associated with unconventional policies relative to changes in the
