practitioners from a variety of backgrounds focused on these important issues.  This 

conference is part of our efforts to hear from experts with diverse backgrounds and 

perspectives to better understand the nature and implications of labor market disparities. 

A deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the mission of the 

Federal Reserve because it may help us better assess full employment, where resources 

may be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and overall economic 

activity.  We look forward to hearing what you have to say about these important 

questions and learning what other questions are in need of attention. 

Note: On September 27, 2017, a typo was corrected to change $25,000 to $54,000 in the following 
sentence on page 9: "Based on forthcoming SCF data, for example, the average annual income for 
families in metro areas was about $54,000 higher than for families in nonmetro areas, and the average 
wealth holdings for families in metro areas exceeded average wealth for families in nonmetro areas by 
nearly $500,000--and these gaps have more than doubled over the past three decades." The original 
number incorrectly stated the median instead of the mean.
