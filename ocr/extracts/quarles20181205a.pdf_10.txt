businesses, essentially turning back the clock in Green River by decades, as far as its access to 

the banking system.  Business owners say their work days have been curtailed by the need to 

drive two or three times a week to Moab to obtain change and make deposits.  Businesses have 

become banks for many residents, agreeing to cash their checks.  Because of this new service to 

residents, and the long distance to a real bank, retail businesses say they are carrying much larger 

amounts of cash, which has heightened security concerns and prompted some merchants to 

invest in new safes.  Security is also a concern for residents who no longer have access to safety 

deposit boxes for valuables and important papers.   

Faster and more efficient electronic payments hold some promise to bridge these gaps, 

eventually, and the Federal Reserve is working hard on this and making significant progress.  

But one thing that technology cannot do is replace the knowledge and perspective of a local 

banker who is part of the community.  Relationship-based lending that is the hallmark of 

community banking can stem losses during downturns, since community banks may be able to 

work with borrowers to avoid losses.  Research has shown that small business lending at smaller 

banks declined less severely than at large banks during the last recession. 

Community banks face considerable competition.  One of the reasons that community 

banks continue to succeed in many places is their understanding of their customersâ€™ needs and 

opportunities to invest in families and businesses.  The loss of this relationship, for a community, 

means that needs will go unmet, and opportunities will be lost.  

In some communities, of course, this may be unavoidable, if a town has lost a major 

employer and has no new industry or plan to replace the jobs lost.  But let me remind you of the 

very encouraging data I cited on the growth of small towns in the West.  Overall, rural
