requiring more banks to submit LIBOR data, but doing so would not materially improve the 

situation.  The panels in Figure 1 show the distribution of daily aggregate wholesale dollar 

funding volumes for the 30 global systemically important banks (or GSIBs).  The data here 

include all of the Eurodollar, federal funds, CD, and commercial paper transactions that the 

Federal Reserve has access to--the most complete picture of U.S. dollar unsecured funding that I 

am aware of.  For one-month funding, shown in the top panel, the median daily volume of 

transactions by these banks since money-market reforms took effect last year was just over $1 

billion.  For three-month funding (the middle panel), the most heavily referenced LIBOR tenor, 

the median is less than $1 billion per day.  On some days we see less than $100 million.  If we 

compare this to the more than $100 trillion in outstanding volumes of U.S. dollar LIBOR 

contracts, it should be clear that the activity in this market is miniscule compared to the size of 

the contracts written on it.    

In our view, it would not be feasible to produce a robust, transaction-based rate 

constructed from the activity in wholesale unsecured funding markets.  A transactions-based rate 

from this market would be fairly easy to manipulate given such a thin level of activity, and the 

rate itself would likely be quite volatile.  Thus, LIBOR seems consigned to rely primarily on 

some form of expert judgment rather than direct transactions.   

As we discussed these issues with the officials in the United Kingdom who oversee and 

regulate LIBOR, we also became aware that they were receiving a steady stream of requests, and 

sometimes demands, from banks seeking to leave the LIBOR panels.  The use of expert 

judgment in submissions allows LIBOR to be published every day, but many banks are now 

understandably uncomfortable with being asked to provide judgment about something that they 

do very little of.  In his July speech, Andrew Bailey discussed the efforts of the FCA to keep
