homeownership rate has declined to 66 percent, and national house prices have fallen 

about one-third, while house prices in hard-hit areas, such as Las Vegas, have fallen 

almost twice that amount.  As a result, nearly $7 trillion in housing wealth has been lost. 

Housing Supply 

House prices have been weighed down by the large proportion of distressed 

sales--that is, sales resulting from foreclosures or short sales--and the specter of the large 

shadow inventory currently in the foreclosure pipeline.  High levels of unemployment, 

weak income growth, and negative equity have contributed to a staggering 2.2 million 

loans in the foreclosure process and another 1.7 million loans that are three or more 

payments behind.  Moreover, due to ongoing delays in the foreclosure process, more than 

40 percent of loans in foreclosure are more than two years delinquent. 

While these statistics are indicative of a historic level of homeowner stress, they 

are down from their post-crisis peaks, and there are signs that further gradual 

improvement may lie ahead.  The share of loans entering delinquency for the first time 

has been trending lower for more than two years.  This decline in early-stage 

delinquencies has coincided with sustained reductions in broader measures of 

delinquency--most notably, total loans past due.  These favorable trends likely reflect 

somewhat better economic conditions.  But efforts to resolve troubled mortgages through 

loan modification, short sales, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure should also be credited.  

Further, mortgages that were originated using the tight underwriting that has prevailed 

since 2008 would presumably have lower delinquency rates, and recent vintage loans 

now make up an increasing share of outstanding mortgages.
