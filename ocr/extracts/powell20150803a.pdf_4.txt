reductions in their own risk appetite and the effects of post-crisis regulations.  At the same time, the 

Federal Reserve and foreign owners (about half of which are foreign central banks) have increased 

their ownership to over two-thirds of outstanding Treasuries (up from 61 percent in 2004).  Banks 

have also increased their holdings of Treasuries to meet HQLA requirements.  These holdings are 

less likely to turn over in secondary market trading, as the owners largely follow buy and hold 

strategies.5  Another change is the increased presence of asset managers, which now hold a bigger 

share of Treasuries as well.  Mutual fund investors, who are accustomed to daily liquidity, now 

beneficially own a greater share of Treasuries.     

  Perhaps the most fundamental change in these markets is the move to electronic trading, 

which began in earnest about 15 years ago.  It is hard to overstate the transformation in these markets.  

Only two decades ago, the dealers who participated in primary Treasury auctions had to send 

representatives, in person, to the offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to submit their 

bids on auction days.  They dropped their paper bids into a box.  The secondary market was a bit 

more advanced.  There were electronic systems for posting interdealer quotes in the cash market, and 

the Globex platform had been introduced for futures. Still, most interdealer trades were conducted 

over the phone and futures trading was primarily conducted in the open pit.   

  Today these markets are almost fully electronic.  Interdealer trading in the cash Treasury 

market is conducted over electronic trading platforms.6  Thanks to advances in telecommunications 

                                                           
5 In order to promote the smooth clearing of Treasury and agency securities, the Federal Reserve offers a securities 
lending program to primary dealers.   
6 Many automated trading firms are now able to directly access these platforms.  There is also a sizable amount of 
trading between dealers and their customers that does not take place on these platforms.  While much of that trading is 
still by phone, an appreciable share is also electronic.
