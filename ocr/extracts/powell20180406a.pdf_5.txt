and are available to work.  Others working part time may want a full-time job.  And still 

others who say that they do not want a job right now might be pulled into the job market 

if the right opportunity came along.  So, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also 

look at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as 

well as measures of vacancies and job flows, surveys of households’ and businesses’ 

perceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices.   

Figure 3 shows the headline unemployment rate and two broader measures of 

unemployment, known as U-5 and U-6.4  U-5 includes the unemployed plus people who 

say they want a job and have looked for one in the past year (though not in the past four 

weeks).  U-6 includes all those counted in U-5 plus people who are working part time but 

would like full-time work.  Like the headline unemployment rate, both U-5 and U-6 have 

declined significantly in recent years.  They are now at levels seen before the financial 

crisis, though not quite as low as they were in 1999 to 2000, a period of very tight job 

market conditions. 

The left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much 

difficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago (figure 4).  Likewise, 

the job vacancy rate, shown on the right, is close to its all-time high, as is the average 

number of weeks it takes to fill a job opening.5  Households also are increasingly 

reporting that jobs are plentiful (figure 5), which is consistent with the high level of job 

postings reported by firms.  In addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is 

high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that

and start in 2000.
