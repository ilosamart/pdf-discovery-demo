support levels for the securities. If the current level of credit support was considered insufficient to 

cover projected losses, the security was written down to fair value with a corresponding "other than 

temporary impairment" charge, in accordance with accounting guidelines, equal to the difference 

between book and market value. Each corporate and municipal bond was evaluated for future OTTI 

potential based on indicators of downgrade likelihood, including information from market credit 

spreads. For each equity security, OTTI was determined when the stressed market value was below the 

carrying value. Supervisors evaluated the position marks based on portfolio characteristics and ratings 

to identify anomalies and to identify conservative or aggressive practices and methodological outliers 

among the BHCs. Special attention was paid to institutions that had greater concentrations of 

accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) relative to tangible common equity, as AOCI forms 

the basis of potential recognizable losses in earnings, and hence core capital, in a given period.7 [Footnote 7. 

AOCI is a measure of accumulated unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, based on current carrying and 

market values. End footnote 7.] 

New FASB guidance on fair value measurements and impairments was issued on April 9, 2009, 

after the commencement of the SCAP. For the baseline scenario supervisors considered firms' 

resubmissions that incorporated the new guidance. However, for the more adverse scenario, in order to 

reflect greater uncertainty about realizable losses in stressful conditions, supervisors did not incorporate 

the new FASB guidance. 
Trading Portfolio Losses 

Losses in the trading portfolio were evaluated by applying market stress factors to the trading 

exposures for the five firms with trading assets exceeding $100 billion, based on the actual market 

movements that occurred over the stress horizon (June 30 to December 31, 2008). The supervisors used 

information on trading book positions from the firms' internal risk-management reports to project loss 

amounts under the defined scenario. Supervisors then compared each firm's submission to its own 

scenario and investigated areas where the loss estimates or gains were significantly different from the 

supervisors' estimates. Supervisors reviewed all of the firm's assumptions, such as the shocks to prices 

and spreads, the methodology used by the firm to value the assets, and whether material exposures and 

assets were included in the stress test. Areas where the BHCs' and supervisors' estimates diverged 

were identified and investigated, and final loss estimates were revised accordingly. In addition, the 

SCAP included an incremental default risk (IDR) estimate for firms' trading book positions. 

Counterparty Credit Risk 

Analysis focused on assessing the reasonableness of counterparty credit risk (CCR) loss estimates stemming 
from exposure growth and credit valuation adjustments associated with the market shocks applied to the assets in 
the trading books. Specifically, the supervisors reviewed the firms' loss estimates for mark-to-market losses 
stemming from credit valuation adjustments (CVA) consistent with the trading shock scenario.8 [Footnote 8. A 
credit valuation adjustment taken against a given trading counterparty reflects the decline in the value of the 
obligation owed by that counterparty due to deterioration in the counterparty's creditworthiness, and directly impacts 
a firm's earnings and the value of the its assets. End footnote 8.] During the assessment process, supervisors 
developed a view of the quality of each firm's loss estimate, and made adjustments to the firm's loss estimates 
where appropriate to reflect factors such as consistency in the application of the trading asset shock; the 
comprehensiveness
