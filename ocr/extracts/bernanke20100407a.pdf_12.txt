with training for examiners and outreach to the banking industry.  Our message is a 

simple one:  Institutions should strive to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, and 

the supervisory agencies should do all they can to help, not hinder, those efforts.  We also 

must support sensible efforts to work with troubled borrowers to bring them back into 

good standing.  To help us better understand what is going on in the banks we supervise 

and in the communities they serve, we continue to seek many views.  For example, our 

Reserve Banks across the country are holding meetings with community bankers and 

others to talk about opportunities for and barriers to small business lending.  

Additionally, the Federal Reserve continues to demonstrate its commitment to 

consumer protection in financial services.  We have recently overhauled the regulations 

governing mortgage transactions and implemented enhanced protections for credit card 

accounts and private student loans.  We also have made new rules for overdraft 

protection programs and for gift cards.  In addition, we have expanded our compliance 

program for enforcing consumer protection rules at nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding 

companies and foreign banking organizations. 

In these and other areas, we at the Federal Reserve will continue to improve 

how we regulate and supervise financial firms while continuing to do all in our power 

to identify and mitigate risks that may endanger the financial system as a whole.
