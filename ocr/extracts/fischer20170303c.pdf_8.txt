My take is that rules are extremely useful reference tools, but they are likely to 

work best as inputs into a committee decision.  Why?  Let me reiterate some points I 

made in Warwick.  First, the economy is very complex, and models that attempt to 

approximate that complexity can sometimes let us down.  A particular difficulty is that 

expectations of the future play a critical role in determining how the economy reacts to a 

policy change.  Moreover, the economy changes over time--this means that policymakers 

need to be able to adapt their models promptly and accurately in real time.  And, finally, 

no one model or policy rule can capture the varied experiences and views brought to 

policymaking by a committee.  All of these factors and more recommend against 

accepting the prescriptions of any one model, policy rule, or policymaker.
