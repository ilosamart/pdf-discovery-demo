contention of this paper is that time-based guidance was responsible.  But as the paper 

acknowledges, the open-ended, data-contingent nature of the QE3 program created a 

strong sense that the Fed was “all in” and that the purchases might go on for a long time.  

That powerful commitment “would set things up for some fireworks” when the time 

came to provide more precise guidance as to the timing of tapering, whether that was 

done through time- or data-based guidance.12  While Committee communications are 

subject to fair criticism, I don’t see an important role in this narrative for time-based 

guidance. 

Let’s turn briefly to 2015 and the run-up to last December’s increase in the federal 

funds rate--also an important focus of the paper.  The authors and many market 

participants are critical of communication around the September meeting.  With the June 

2015 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showing that 15 of 17 FOMC participants 

judged that appropriate policy would entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate by 

the end of 2015, markets saw about a 50 percent chance that the first increase would 

occur in September.  This probability fell to about 30 percent after global markets 

experienced a sudden bout of volatility following China’s surprise devaluation of its 

currency in August.  At the September meeting, the FOMC decided to wait to see how 

global markets and the economy evolved, noting in its statement that “Recent global 

economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are 

likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.”13
