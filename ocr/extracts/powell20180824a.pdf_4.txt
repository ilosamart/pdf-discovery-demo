1.  With the unemployment rate well below estimates of its longer-term normal 

level, why isn’t the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off 

overheating and inflation? 

2.  With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy 

at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion? 

These questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee is 

always seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly 

shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing 

overheating.   As I will discuss, the job of avoiding these errors is made challenging today 

because the economy has been changing in ways that are difficult to detect and measure 

in real time.  I will first lay out a standard view of a handful of basic relationships that are 

thought to reflect key aspects of the underlying structure of the economy.   I will then use 

that framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy 

deliberations, focusing on how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.  

Conventional Views of Macroeconomic Structure 

In conventional models of the economy, major economic quantities such as 

inflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuate 

around values that are considered “normal,” or “natural,” or “desired.”  The FOMC has 

chosen a 2 percent inflation objective as one of these desired values.  The other values are 

not directly observed, nor can they be chosen by anyone.  Instead, these values result 

from myriad interactions throughout the economy.  In the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of 

Economic Projections (SEP), participants state their individual views on the longer-run
