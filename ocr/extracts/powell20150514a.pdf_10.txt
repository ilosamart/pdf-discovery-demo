interactions between regulators and community bankers.  For this reason, the Federal 

Reserve System has taken a number of steps to expand its outreach to community banks.  

As you probably know, in 2010 the Board created the Community Depository 

Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives from community banks, 

credit unions, and savings associations from each Federal Reserve District.5  The Board of 

Governors meets twice each year to hear the council’s valuable insights into the most 

pressing concerns of community bankers from across the country.  There is also a council 

for each of the 12 Reserve Banks, which meets regularly with its Reserve Bank leadership. 

We have taken other steps to improve communications with community bankers so 

that we may better explain our supervisory expectations for community banks and hear 

your concerns as well.  Our Reserve Banks have together developed a number of channels 

of communication with community banks over the years, and some of the most promising 

of those initiatives have been expanded nationwide.  Two programs, Ask the Fed and 

Outlook Live, have become quite popular with community bankers who are interested in 

learning more about timely financial or regulatory topics of interest to both bankers and 

supervisors.  Ask the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, holding 

companies, and state bank commissioners.  Outlook Live is a webinar series led by 

Federal Reserve staff that serves as a companion to our quarterly publication, Consumer 

Compliance Outlook.6  Last year I participated in a webinar hosted by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of St. Louis and very much enjoyed hearing directly from community bankers.7
