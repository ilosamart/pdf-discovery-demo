platforms they operate on.  If trading is at nanoseconds, there won’t be a lot of “fundamental” news 

to trade on or much time to formulate views about the long-run value of an asset; instead, trading at 

these speeds can become a game played against order books and the market rules.  We can 

complain about certain trading practices in this new environment, but if the market is structured to 

incentivize those practices, then why should we be surprised if they occur?   

The trading platforms in both the interdealer cash and futures markets are based on a central 

limit order book, in which quotes are executed based on price and the order  they are posted.  A 

central limit order book provides for continuous trading, but it also provides incentives to be the 

fastest.  A trader that is faster than the others in the market will be able to post and remove orders 

in reaction to changes in the order book before others can do so, earning profits by hitting out-of-

date quotes and avoiding losses by making sure that the trader’s own quotes are up to date.  

Technology and greater competition have led to lower costs in many areas of our economy.  

At the same time, slower traders may be put at a disadvantage in this environment, which could 

cause them to withdraw from markets or seek other venues, thus fracturing liquidity.  And one can 

certainly question how socially useful it is to build optic fiber or microwave networks just to trade 

at microseconds or nanoseconds rather than milliseconds.  The cost of these technologies, among 

other factors, may also be driving greater concentration in markets, which could threaten their 

resilience.  The type of internalization now done by dealers is only really profitable if done on a 

large scale, and that too has led to greater market concentration.   

  A number of observers have suggested reforms for consideration.  For example, some 

recent commentators propose frequent batch auctions as an alternative to the central limit order
