Conclusion 

To conclude, recent developments suggest that the macro economy may be at a 

transition.  With full employment within reach, signs of progress on our inflation 

mandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad, it will likely be 

appropriate for the Committee to continue gradually removing monetary accommodation.  

As the federal funds rate continues to move higher toward its expected longer-run level, a 

transition in balance sheet policy will also be warranted.  These transitions in the 

economy and monetary policy are positive reflections of the fact that the economy is 

gradually drawing closer to our policy goals.  How the Committee should adjust the size 

and composition of the balance sheet to accomplish its goals and what level the balance 

sheet should be in normal times are important subjects that I look forward to discussing 

with my colleagues.
