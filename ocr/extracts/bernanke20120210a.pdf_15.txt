careful analysis to ensure that it is effective and meets reasonable cost-benefit tests.  

Experimentation with alternative approaches could help find the best way forward.  

Conclusion  

In sum, the economic recovery has been disappointing in part because U.S. 

housing markets remain out of balance.  Many local markets have an overhang of empty 

and foreclosed homes, and many potentially creditworthy homebuyers cannot obtain 

mortgages.  The weak housing market also impairs homeownersâ€™ financial health and 

diminishes the quality and stability of neighborhoods and communities.  For these 

reasons, and because the troubled housing market depresses construction activity and 

employment, we need to continue to develop and implement policies that will help the 

housing sector get back on its feet.  No single solution will be sufficient.  But sustained 

efforts to address the many interlocking factors holding back the housing market will pay 

dividends in the long run.
