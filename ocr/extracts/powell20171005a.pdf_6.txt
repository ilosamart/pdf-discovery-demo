of Governors is continuing to negotiate with FINRA for it to act as our agent in collecting similar 

data from banks.  We do not want to create a regulatory arbitrage where the same activity done 

within a broker–dealer is treated differently than when it is done within a bank.

regulators and industry leaders address market concerns before they threaten market function.  I 

thank the members for their service and look forward to today’s discussions.
