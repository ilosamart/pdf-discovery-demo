  For example, let’s take the areas of fraud prevention and cybersecurity, where 

supervised institutions may need their own AI tools to identify and combat outside AI-powered 

threats.  The wide availability of AI’s building blocks means that phishers and fraudsters have 

access to best-in-class technologies to build AI tools that are powerful and adaptable.  

Supervised institutions will likely need tools that are just as powerful and adaptable as the threats 

that they are designed to face, which likely entails some degree of opacity.  While so far, most 

phishing attacks against consumers have relied on standard-form emails, likely due to the high 

cost of personalization, in the future, AI tools could be used to make internet fraud and phishing 

highly personalized.17  By accessing data sets with consumers’ personally identifiable 

information and applying open-source AI tools, a phisher may be able to churn out highly 

targeted emails to millions of consumers at relatively low cost, containing personalized 

information such as their bank account number and logo, along with past transactions.18  In cases 

such as this, where large data sets and AI tools may be used for malevolent purposes, it may be 

that AI is the best tool to fight AI.   

Let’s turn to the related issue of the proverbial “black box”--the potential lack of 

explainability associated with some AI approaches.  In the banking sector, it is not uncommon 

for there to be questions as to what level of understanding a bank should have of its vendors’ 

models, due to the balancing of risk management, on the one hand, and protection of proprietary

almost certainly gather more total responses and more viable responses, but would yield lower overall profit. Recall, 
that viability requires that the scammer actually extract money from the victim: those who are fooled for a while, but 
then figure it out, or who balk at the last hurdle are precisely the expensive false positives that the scammer must 
deter.”)
