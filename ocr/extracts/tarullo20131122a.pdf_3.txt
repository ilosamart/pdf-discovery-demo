most dramatic of these episodes were the bank runs of the early 1930s that culminated in the 

bank holiday in 1933.  Just as it was necessary, though not sufficient, to alter the environment 

that led to those successive deposit runs by introducing deposit insurance in order to create a 

stable financial system in the early-twentieth century, today it is necessary, though not sufficient, 

to alter the environment that can lead to short-term wholesale funding runs in order to create a 

stable financial system for the early twenty-first century. 

 As I will describe in a few moments, the Federal Reserve has taken some steps toward 

this end over the past few years.  However, as I will also contend, completion of this task will 

require a more comprehensive set of measures, at least some of which must cover financial 

actors not subject to prudential regulatory oversight.  Before turning to these points, I want to 

develop briefly the comparison between deposit runs of the pre-FDIC period and contemporary 

short-term wholesale funding runs in order better to explain the nature of the regulatory 

challenge.  

Vulnerabilities Created by Short-Term Wholesale Funding 

 There are notable similarities between the bank runs that periodically afflicted the U.S. 

banking system before the creation of federal deposit insurance and the dramatic short-term 

wholesale funding runs that began in 2007.  Each had a cascading, self-reinforcing quality, 

fueled by questions concerning the solvency of borrowing entities--whether deposit-taking banks 

or dealers seeking credit in repo markets.  And, in each case, the opaqueness of the balance 

sheets of the borrowing entities led lenders to fear that an institution holding assets similar to, or 

interconnected through counterparty relationships with, another, troubled institution might itself 

be in trouble.  Significantly, though, in each case, at least some of the lending actors were 

interested not just in eventually recovering the full amount of the funds they had extended, but in
