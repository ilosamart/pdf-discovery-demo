keeping with one of the biggest improvements to the regulatory framework and to stress 

testing since the financial crisis.  I believe the changes and proposed changes to stress 

testing that I have discussed today reinforce the founding principles of the first test, 

administered in the challenging and uncertain spring of 2009, and reflect what we have 

learned each year over the decade since then.  That process of learning and refining 

should and must continue in order to keep stress tests as relevant and effective as they 

have been in helping to reduce the chances of another severe crisis.
