Traditional Oversight of the Federal Reserve Was Extensive and Effective 

The Federal Reserve, like other parts of our democratic system of government, 

must be accountable to the public and its elected representatives.  Given the scale of the 

Fed’s actions during the Crisis, it has been not only appropriate but essential that these 

actions be transparent to the public and subject to close and careful scrutiny by the 

Congress.  And that is exactly what happened.  So it is jarring to hear it asserted that the 

Fed carries out its duties in secret and is unaccountable to the public and its elected 

representatives.  The Federal Reserve is highly transparent and accountable to the public

employment achievable without threatening price stability.  Federal Reserve Board 

members are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate.  The 

Chair of the Fed appears before both the House and Senate oversight committees twice
