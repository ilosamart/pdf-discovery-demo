deficit, triggering a sharp decline in the dollar, a spike in interest rates, and widespread economic 

distress. 

Discussions among policymakers at that time focused on reducing current account 

imbalances to stave off such stresses.3

As is well known, the crisis did not follow this script.  In the event, the dollar weakened 

in the years leading up to the onset of the crisis in 2007, but once the crisis deepened, the dollar 

was pushed up sharply by safe-haven flows as investors sought refuge in U.S. Treasury securities 

from dysfunctional markets and stressed institutions around the world.  Adding to upward 

pressures on the dollar was a severe dollar funding shortage that arose because global banks had 

been funding long-term asset positions with short-term dollar borrowing in wholesale markets, 

resulting in a significant funding crunch when these markets froze up.   

  The United States was encouraged to increase national 

saving, both public and private.  Countries with persistent current account surpluses were 

encouraged to reduce their dependence on external demand by implementing structural reforms 

to boost domestic demand, including investing in social programs and infrastructure and 

reforming labor, product, and financial markets.  It was understood that by reducing distortions, 

these reforms might also boost productivity and improve macroeconomic performance.  For 

some countries, especially China, increasing the flexibility of exchange rates was a key policy 

recommendation.  Despite the considerable attention paid to these issues, limited progress was 

made in actually implementing this agenda or in reducing global imbalances. 

 Instead, the main causes of the crisis originated in the financial sector and stemmed from 

a widespread underappreciation and underpricing of risk.  Failures of risk-management systems, 

incentive problems in securitization and compensation structures, and regulatory shortcomings 

                                                           
3 The leading example of these policy discussions was the International Monetary Fundâ€™s Multilateral Consultation 
on Global Imbalances.  Participants included China, the euro area, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
