 in turn, accelerated the crisis.  The crisis punished investors who accepted more risk than 

they thought they had taken on, it punished consumers who overleveraged themselves, it 

punished Americans who lost their jobs and homes, and it contributed to the decline of once-

vibrant neighborhoods and towns. 

To mitigate the chances of such a crisis occurring again, supervisors need to redouble 

their efforts toward promoting greater transparency of risks and early confrontation of potential 

loss exposures.  We should view these efforts as a set of responsibilities for both banks and 

regulators that are aligned to assure the public and markets that risks can be fully understood and 

accurately estimated and priced. 

In some ways, this perspective is not new territory for bank regulators.  The Federal 

Reserve, for example, issued supervisory guidance in 1995 that identified the six primary risks 

that remain the focus of its supervisory program, and reputational risk is among them.

  Having 

said that, it is still a risk that both banks and supervisors should learn how to identify ex ante 

rather than ex post.

So, while reputational risk is not a new concept by any means, it is an area that is ripe for 

additional work.  For example, the enterprise risk management framework of the Committee of 

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission--the so-called “COSO standard”--does

 The reasons for ineffective supervision can be explored separately; they are beyond the scope of my remarks today.  

It is worth considering, however, whether the reputation of large banks would be enhanced by a belief that 

“regulatory capture” and other manifestations of ineffective supervision could be minimized.

 Other regulators consider reputation risk as part of their supervisory programs.  The Public Company Accounting 

Oversight Board (PCAOB) has integrated reputational risk into its guidance on how an auditor should evaluate a 

company’s internal controls and corporate governance environment.  Other PCAOB standards include reputational 

risk as it relates to executive compensation structures.
