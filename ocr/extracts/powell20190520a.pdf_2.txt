It is a pleasure to be here at this important annual event sponsored and organized 

by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Center for Financial Innovation and Stability.  

The risks in our financial system are constantly evolving.  Fifteen years ago, everyone 

was talking about whether households were borrowing too much.  Today everyone is 

talking about whether businesses are borrowing too much.  This evening, I will focus on 

the implications of the increase in business debt over the past decade and review the steps 

the Federal Reserve and other agencies are taking to understand and limit the associated 

risks.   

In public discussion of this issue, views seem to range from “This is a rerun of the 

subprime mortgage crisis” to “Nothing to worry about here.”  At the moment, the truth is 

likely somewhere in the middle.  To preview my conclusions, as of now, business debt 

does not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that 

would lead to broad harm to households and businesses should conditions deteriorate.  At 

the same time, the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy 

weakens.  The Federal Reserve continues to assess the potential amplification of such 

stresses on borrowers to the broader economy through possible vulnerabilities in the 

financial system, and I currently see such risks as moderate.

business debt over the past few years.  The acronyms have changed a bit—“CLOs” 

(collateralized loan obligations) instead of “CDOs” (collateralized debt obligations), for 

example—but once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the 

income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards.  Likewise, much
