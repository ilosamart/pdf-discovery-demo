turn to the FOMC’s recent actions and describe how I see them promoting this important 

goal. 

Forward Guidance for the Federal Funds Rate 

I’ll begin with the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  The 

FOMC has employed such forward guidance since 2003 but has relied more heavily on it 

since December 2008, when the target for the federal funds rate was reduced to its 

effective lower bound.  In current circumstances, forward guidance can lower private-

sector expectations regarding the future path of short-term rates, thereby reducing longer-

term interest rates on a wide range of debt instruments and also raising asset prices, 

leading to more accommodative financial conditions.  In addition, given the FOMC’s 

stated intention to sell assets only after the federal funds rate target is increased, any 

outward shift in the expected date of liftoff for the federal funds rate suggests that the 

Federal Reserve will be holding a large stock of assets on its balance sheet longer, which 

should work to further increase accommodation.

Starting in March 2009, the FOMC’s postmeeting statements noted that 

“economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds 

rate for an extended period,” and in November of the same year added “low rates of 

resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations” as 

justification for this stance.”

  In August 2011, the Committee substituted “at least 

through mid-2013” for the words “for an extended period.”

  This date was moved further 

into the future several times, most recently last September, when it was shifted to mid-

 Empirical studies of the Committee’s date-based forward guidance suggest that changes in that guidance 

generated an appreciable effect on longer-term yields.  See, for example, Swanson and Williams (2012) and 

Woodford (2012).
