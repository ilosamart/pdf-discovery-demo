guidance to banks, updates to regulations, changes to monetary policy, and analytical 

research contributions.  It also included engagement in national and regional partnerships 

to inform policy and practices around foreclosure prevention and neighborhood 

stabilization in communities hard hit by foreclosures.   

From the onset of the crisis, we called on the expertise of community 

development professionals within the Federal Reserve System to respond to concerns 

from homeowners by crafting strategies to enhance foreclosure mitigation, encourage 

loan modifications, and stave off the rising number of rescue scams.  The Fed also 

strengthened existing collaborations with fellow regulators, community groups, policy 

organizations, financial institutions, and public officials to discuss innovative methods for 

preventing unnecessary foreclosures and the negative impact they have on communities.  

One valuable product of this effort was the development and dissemination of data tools, 

heat maps, and detailed analysis to identify neighborhoods most at risk of foreclosures 

and their damaging effects.  Equipped with this information, community leaders can 

better target limited resources to borrowers and declining communities.  In 2008, as 

interest in market-specific responses to foreclosures grew, the Fed developed a 

conference series entitled “Recovery, Renewal, Rebuilding”1 in five cities that 

represented a variety of housing markets--from older, industrial cities with shrinking 

populations to boomtowns that grew too quickly. 

Meanwhile, we also launched online Foreclosure Resource Centers at each 

Reserve Bank that continue to provide homeowners, prospective homebuyers, and 

community groups with information to help prevent foreclosures and lessen their 

negative influence on neighborhoods.  These centers offer a variety of resources,
