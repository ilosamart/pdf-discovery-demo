As part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past 

communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.  For 

example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of 

policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability. 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

Let me turn now to our review process.25  The Board and the Reserve Banks are 

conducting Fed Listens events, during which we are hearing from a broad range of 

interested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders, community 

development professionals, and academics. 

One of our Fed Listens events was a research conference at the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Chicago in early June, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  I would 

like to give a brief summary of what we heard there:  Janice Eberly, James Stock, and 

Jonathan Wright provided a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s 

monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications since 2009.  Lars Svensson 

evaluated the pros and cons of several monetary policy strategies that have makeup 

features, and argued that average inflation targeting could be more likely than price-level 

targeting to be understood by the public and garner credibility.  Cynthia Wu and Eric 

Sims used a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to analyze the efficacy of 

several policy tools at the ELB—forward guidance, negative interest rates, and asset 

purchases—and the interactions between them.  Stephen Cecchetti and Kermit 

                                                 
projections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of 
FOMC members.  For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).
