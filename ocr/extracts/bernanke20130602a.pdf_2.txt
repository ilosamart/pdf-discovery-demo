It’s nice to be back at Princeton.  I find it difficult to believe that it’s been almost 

11 years since I departed these halls for Washington.  I wrote recently to inquire about 

the status of my leave from the university, and the letter I got back began, “Regrettably, 

Princeton receives many more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can 

accommodate.”1 

I’ll extend my best wishes to the seniors later, but first I want to congratulate the 

parents and families here.  As a parent myself, I know that putting your kid through 

college these days is no walk in the park.  Some years ago I had a colleague who sent 

three kids through Princeton even though neither he nor his wife attended this university.  

He and his spouse were very proud of that accomplishment, as they should have been.  

But my colleague also used to say that, from a financial perspective, the experience was 

like buying a new Cadillac every year and then driving it off a cliff.  I should say that he 

always added that he would do it all over again in a minute.  So, well done, moms, dads, 

and families. 

This is indeed an impressive and appropriate setting for a commencement.  I am 

sure that, from this lectern, any number of distinguished spiritual leaders have ruminated 

on the lessons of the Ten Commandments.  I don’t have that kind of confidence, and, 

anyway, coveting your neighbor’s ox or donkey is not the problem it used to be, so I 

thought I would use my few minutes today to make Ten Suggestions, or maybe just Ten 

Observations, about the world and your lives after Princeton.  Please note, these points 

have nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates.  My qualification for making such 

suggestions, or observations, besides having kindly been invited to speak today by 

President Tilghman, is the same as the reason that your obnoxious brother or sister got to 
                                                 
1 Note to journalists:  This is a joke.  My leave from Princeton expired in 2005.
