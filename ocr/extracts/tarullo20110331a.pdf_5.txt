The fourth effect, relating to an essential role in financial markets, also need not be a 

function of size, though it is surely related to a particular kind of interconnectedness--one that 

may have little to do with the assets of the firm and could instead rest on the firm’s status as a 

node through which an important class of financial transactions flows. 

Implications for Regulatory Policy 

 The foregoing observations inform the execution of two important administrative

instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to develop special prudential standards 

and apply them to any bank holding company with assets of more than $50 billion, as well as to 

any firms designated by the FSOC.  

  With respect to the issue of designation, the difference in congressional approach for 

bank-affiliated and nonbank-affiliated firms is the starting point for analysis.  In specifying that 

all bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets be subject to enhanced 

supervisory and prudential standards, Congress obviated the need for a determination of whether 

the consequences of failure of any of these institutions warrants special regulation.  In contrast, 

with respect to the designation of nonbank institutions, Congress has required the FSOC to 

consider a lengthy list of factors, which collectively emphasize the importance of various 

attributes of size and interconnectedness.  The FSOC’s designation function is governed by
