system.  The purpose of each of these steps is to improve the traditional prudential 

regulation of systemically important firms while fostering greater stability and resilience 

in the banking system as a whole.

Gaps in the regulatory structure, which allowed some systemically important 

nonbank financial firms to avoid strong, comprehensive oversight, were a significant 

contributor to the crisis.  The Federal Reserve has been working with the other member 

agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), established by the Dodd-

interpretive guidance implementing the criteria and process it will use to designate 

nonbank financial firms as systemically important.

  Once designated, these firms would 

be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve and would be required to 

satisfy enhanced prudential standards established by the Federal Reserve under title I of 

Dodd-Frank.  The FSOC’s rule provides detail on the framework the FSOC intends to use 

to assess the potential for a particular firm to threaten U.S. financial stability.  The 

analysis would take into account the firm’s size, interconnectedness, leverage, provision 

of critical products or services, and reliance on short-term funding, as well as its existing 

regulatory arrangements. 

The FSOC’s issuance of this rule is an important step forward in ensuring that 

systemically critical nonbank financial firms will be subject to strong consolidated 

supervision and regulation.  More work remains to be done, however.  In particular,
