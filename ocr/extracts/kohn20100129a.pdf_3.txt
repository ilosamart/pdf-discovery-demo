are taking on their loan portfolios.  The recent crisis has been a stark reminder that borrowing 

short and lending long is an inherently risky business strategy.  As the financial markets became 

disrupted, the liquidity risks of this strategy became painfully evident.  Intermediaries need to be 

sure that as the economy recovers, they aren’t also hit by the interest rate risk that often 

accompanies this sort of mismatch in asset and liability maturities.      

Interest Rate Movements   

 Interest rates are difficult to forecast in the most settled or normal of times, and their path 

is especially uncertain in the current circumstances.  Short-term rates will rise at some point, but 

when, how quickly, and by how much will depend on the outlook for economic activity and 

inflation as the Federal Reserve pursues its objectives of maximum employment and stable 

prices.  The historical record shows that short-term rates have moved in a variety of patterns in 

economic recoveries from recession:  Sometimes rates began to rise shortly after the economy 

turned around; at other times it took a while for policy tightening to begin; and in other instances, 

rates continued to decline even after the economic recovery took hold, as during the 1991-92 

period and, to a much lesser extent, during the 2002-03 period.  We are now just beginning to 

recover from the deepest recession since World War II.  Most economists expect only moderate 

growth and a slow decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years, importantly 

because it will take time for banks to rebuild their capital and begin competing more vigorously 

for loan business again.  Clearly, we are in uncharted waters for monetary policy and the 

financial markets.   

 When the Federal Reserve begins to raise short-term rates, the yield curve usually 

flattens--but not always.  Longer-term rates can respond in a multitude of ways, with important 

implications for financial intermediaries.  Recall that in 1994, long-term rates actually rose more 

than short-term rates for a time, steepening the yield curve and imposing substantial capital
