about 18 percent used personal assets to guarantee or collateralize loans for their businesses and 

a similar fraction made at least one loan to the business.  Thus, the condition of household net 

worth is often relevant to the ability of some small businesses to obtain credit.  With declines in 

house prices since 2006 and consequent weakened household balance sheets, the ability of many 

small business owners to borrow has likely been impaired.   

 Despite general improvements in financial market conditions and in bank stock prices 

and earnings during the second half of 2009, lending is likely inhibited by various problems 

afflicting many banks, both large and small.  Banks with capital positions that have been eroded 

by losses or those with limited access to capital markets may be reducing risky assets to improve 

their capital positions, especially amid continued uncertainty about the economic outlook and 

possible future loan losses.  Indeed, with the number of problem banks having risen to 702 

institutions with $402.8 billion in assets, many firms are capital constrained and may be unable 

to increase lending.  And, even though deposits are now plentiful, some banks have funding 

concerns.  Bank funding markets were badly impaired for a time, and some banks have 

accordingly decided to hold larger buffers of liquid assets than before.  A number of other factors 

are also likely in play.  Higher deposit insurance assessments increase funding costs.  Some 

securitization markets remain impaired, reducing an important source of funding for bank loans.  

Finally, changes to accounting rules, beginning in 2010, will require many banks to move a large 

volume of securitized assets back onto their balance sheets, perhaps putting further pressure on 

bank capital.    

 During the financial crisis, a number of lending relationships have been severed as 

individual banks sought to reduce loan portfolios, or concentrations within those portfolios, or as 

banks failed or merged.  Established banking relationships are particularly important to small
