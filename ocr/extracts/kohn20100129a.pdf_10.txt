that both explicit and embedded interest rate options can pose to the performance and safety and 

soundness of an institution.   

Clearly, every financial institution, regardless of size, must understand the risks it is 

taking, and how to control and mitigate those risks.  We have seen too well and too painfully in 

the past several years, in the largest banks and in the smallest, what happens when systems and 

management understanding are not commensurate with the risks being taken.  The consequences 

fall not only on bank owners, staff, and customers, but potentially on the entire economy.  We 

cannot allow that experience to be repeated, and this conference is one step in making sure that 

interest rate risk does not undermine the safety and soundness of our nation’s most important 

lenders--banks, thrifts, and credit unions.
