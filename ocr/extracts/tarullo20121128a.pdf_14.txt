they would be subject to the activity restrictions applicable to branches and agencies today as 

well as to certain additional measures discussed below.   

Second, the same capital rules applicable to U.S. BHCs should also apply to U.S. IHCs.  

These rules have been reshaped to counteract the risks to the U.S. financial system revealed by 

the crisis and should be implemented consistently across all firms that engage in similar 

activities.  Similarly, other enhanced prudential standards required by the Dodd-Frank Act--

including stress testing requirements, risk management requirements, single counterparty credit 

limits, and early remediation requirements--should be applied to the U.S. operations of large 

foreign banks in a manner consistent with the Boardâ€™s domestic proposal.

Third, there should be liquidity standards for large U.S. operations of foreign banks.  

Standards are needed to increase the liquidity resiliency of these operations during times of stress 

and to reduce the threat of destabilizing runs as dollar funding channels dry up and short-term 

debt cannot be rolled over.  For IHCs, the standards should be broadly consistent with the 

standards the Federal Reserve has proposed for large domestic BHCs, pending final adoption and 

phase-in of quantitative liquidity requirements by the Basel Committee.

  That is, they should be 

designed to ensure that, in stressed circumstances, the U.S. operations have enough high-quality 

liquid assets to meet expected net outflows in the short term.  There should also be liquidity 

standards for foreign bank branch and agency networks in the United States, although they may 

be less stringent, in recognition of the integration of branches and agencies into the global bank 

as a whole.    

By imposing a more standardized regulatory structure on the U.S. operations of foreign 

banks, we can ensure that enhanced prudential standards are applied consistently across foreign
