former engineer--discovered what later became the Phillips curve.  The difference 

between the short- and long-run Phillips curves, which is now a staple of textbooks, was 

developed by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, and the effect of making 

expectations rational or model consistent was emphasized by Robert Lucas, whose 

islands model provided an imperfect information reason for a nonvertical short-run 

Phillips curve.  In Okun’s law, the Okun coefficient--the coefficient specifying how much 

a change in the unemployment rate affects output--appears to have declined over time.  

So has the trend rate of productivity growth, which is a critical determinant of future 

levels of per capita income.   

In (3), the monetary equilibrium condition, the monetary policy decision was 

typically represented by the money stock at the LSE and perhaps also at the 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after the Keynesian revolution (after all, 

“L” represents the liquidity preference function and “M” the supply of money); now the 

money supply rule is replaced by an interest-rate setting rule, for instance a reaction 

function of some form, or by a calculated “optimal” policy based on a loss function.   

The development of the flexible inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy is 

one of the major achievements of modern macroeconomics.  Flexible inflation targeting 

allows for flexibility in the speed with which the monetary authority plans on returning to 

the target inflation rate, and is thereby close to the dual mandate that the law assigns to 

the Fed.   

A great deal of progress has been made in developing the credit and financial 

intermediation block.  As early as the 1960s, each of James Tobin, Milton Friedman, and 

Karl Brunner and Alan Meltzer wrote out models with more fully explicated financial
