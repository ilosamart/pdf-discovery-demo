Stress Capital Buffer 

Many of you are familiar with the Federal Reserve’s proposed stress capital buffer 

(SCB), which would replace the current fixed buffer requirement of 2.5 percent of risk-

weighted assets with one based on each firm’s stress test results.2  I believe the proposal 

represents an important milestone in crafting an integrated capital regime, and in keeping 

with its importance, we have received extensive and thoughtful public comments, 

identifying elements of it that could benefit from further refinement.  I described several 

of these elements last week, including my views on some areas which I believe we should 

revisit: improving measurement of risks in the trading book; encouraging less sticky 

forms of capital distribution without requiring dividend pre-funding; and reevaluating the 

interaction of the capital buffer with capital distributions.  Today, I want to highlight 

three elements in particular. 

Foremost among these is the volatility of stress test results.  Some volatility in 

annual results is necessary to preserve the dynamism of the stress test, and to reflect 

changes in macroeconomic conditions, salient economic risks, and the composition of 

firm balance sheets.  However, when the largest banks in the system are fully meeting 

their capital requirements, a highly variable capital requirement from year to year can 

present a significant management challenge.  I believe there is an important balance to 

strike in this area, which will let us preserve dynamism while reducing volatility, and we 

plan to seek comment on a relevant proposal in the not-too-distant future.  

The second is the sequencing of stress test results with capital plan submissions.  

Currently, and under the SCB proposal, a firm must decide whether to increase or 

decrease its planned dividends and share repurchases for the upcoming year without 

knowledge of a key constraint: the results of the stress test.  Initially, this phasing 

reflected the view that firms should think rigorously about their capital uses and needs, 

rather than relying primarily on the results of the supervisory stress test to guide those 

plans.  However, now that we all have several years’ experience with this system, firms 

have told us that they would be able to engage in more thoughtful capital planning if they
