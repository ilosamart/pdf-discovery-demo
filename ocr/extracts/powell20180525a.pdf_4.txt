of the financial system’s ability to service households and businesses, they may have also 

contributed to the erosion of public trust. 

Central banks are assigned narrow but important mandates.  For monetary policy, 

the Fed’s mandate is to keep inflation low and stable and to achieve maximum 

employment.  For financial sector supervision and regulation, part of our mandate is to 

foster the safety and soundness of individual institutions.  In addition, we have a 

responsibility, shared with other government agencies, to promote financial stability.  I 

view this responsibility as being highly complementary to other aspects of our mission:  

Financial stability promotes sustainable economic growth, and a stable, well-functioning 

financial system is an effective transmission channel for monetary policy.  Indeed, there 

can be no macroeconomic stability without financial stability.  

Within our narrow mandates, to safeguard against political interference, central 

banks are afforded instrument independence--that is, we are given considerable freedom 

to choose the means to achieve legislatively-assigned goals.  While the focus is often on 

monetary policy independence, research suggests that a degree of independence in 

regulatory and financial stability matters improves the stability of the banking system and 

leads to better outcomes.3  For this reason, governments in many countries, including the 

United States, have granted some institutional and budgetary independence to their 

financial regulators. 

                                                 
3 Technical implementation and oversight are two areas where instrument independence may be especially 
helpful.  See Hogue, Labonte, and Webel (2017) and the references therein.  Also, the need for some 
regulatory independence is not exclusive to the central bank; see Bernanke (2017) for a discussion.
