dealers now possess autoquoting capabilities and deploy them on Treasury trading 

platforms.  Several primary dealers have even entered direct partnerships with proprietary

technologies, or fintech, have arisen in recent years to provide dealers and other market 

participants with back-office tools that reduce costs by automating routine processes, 

streamlining regulatory reporting, and more efficiently allocating capital, collateral, and 

margin among competing uses.  On the front end, dealers are increasingly offering their 

customers web-based research and analytic tools, trading and execution engines, and 

even apps that allow clients access to internal software for pricing and structuring 

transactions. 

The landscape for proprietary trading firms has changed considerably in recent 

years, too.  Since 2015, we have witnessed the first initial public offering by a proprietary 

trading firm, as well as a few high-profile mergers and acquisitions.3  The industry is 

contending with declining revenue growth and diminished returns by expanding 

operations into new asset classes and geographies.  Proprietary trading firms are also 

adapting in other ways.  Some have begun to offer broker-dealer services themselves or 

appear to be contemplating such a business model change.  Still others have entered joint
