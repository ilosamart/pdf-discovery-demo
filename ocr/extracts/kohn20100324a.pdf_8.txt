 But by how much?  Uncertainty about the likely effect complicated our calibration of the 

purchases, and the symmetrical uncertainty about the effects of unwinding the actions--of 

reducing our portfolio--will be a factor in our decisions about the timing and sequencing of steps 

to return the portfolio to a more normal level and composition.  Good studies of these sorts of 

actions are sparse.  Currently, we are relying in large part on studies that examine how much 

interest rates dropped when purchases were announced in the United States or abroad.  But such 

event studies may not be an ideal means to predict the consequences of reducing our portfolio, in 

part because the economic and financial environment will be very different, and also because 

event studies do not measure effects that develop or reverse over time.  We are also uncertain 

about how, exactly, the purchases put downward pressure on interest rates.  My presumption has 

been that the effect comes mainly from the total amount we purchase relative to the total stock of 

debt outstanding.  However, others have argued that the market effect derives importantly from 

the flow of our purchases relative to the amount of new issuance in the market. Some evidence 

for the primacy of the stock channel has accumulated recently, as the prices of mortgage-backed 

securities appear to have changed little as the flow of our purchases has trended down.   

A second issue involves the effect of the large volume of reserves created as we buy 

assets.  The Federal Reserve has funded its purchases by crediting the accounts that banks hold 

with us.  Those deposits are called “reserve balances” and are part of bank reserves.  In our 

explanations of our actions, we have concentrated, as I have just done, on the effects on the 

prices of the assets we have been purchasing and the spillover to the prices of related assets.  The 

huge quantity of bank reserves that were created has been seen largely as a byproduct of the 

purchases that would be unlikely to have a significant independent effect on financial markets 

and the economy.  This view is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the
