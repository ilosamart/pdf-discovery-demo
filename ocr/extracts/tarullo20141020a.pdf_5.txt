Review (CCAR) and informs the emphasis of our supervision throughout the year.  Each year, in 

conjunction with our supervisory stress tests, we provide an assessment to every participating 

firm of their risk-management and capital planning processes, indicating where specific 

improvements are needed.  The interactions between supervisors and firms on these matters are 

extensive, focused, and consequential.  For this reason, I think we have gained considerable 

insight into, if not precisely the “culture” of the firms, then at least the attitudes of senior and 

mid-level management toward these risk functions.  

In some firms the attitude we perceive is one of a mere compliance exercise.  The firm 

proceeds to address the deficiencies identified by the Fed in a discrete, almost check-the-box 

fashion.  To oversimplify a bit, I would say that our sense is that management at these firms 

wants the hurdle to capital distribution removed, but once the specific problems have been 

remedied, they want to move on.  If this is the attitude we perceive, I suspect the working level 

employees of such firms do the same.  The supervisory reaction in such cases is quite likely to be 

an inclination toward greater scrutiny. 

Other firms, by contrast, seem to have internalized the aims of the risk-management 

processes and systems that we expect of them.  In these firms the dialogue can be quite different, 

with supervisors observing that, even as a specific problem is addressed, such as deficiencies in 

estimating losses for a particular loan portfolio in a tail event, the firm has gone back to think 

about how the identified shortcomings fit into their overall risk decision-making and 

management processes.  These firms will, on their own, then consider whether changes in other 

areas are needed.  Again, I suspect that the line employees in these firms are also hearing a 

different message and presumably, to at least some degree, will behave in accordance with that
