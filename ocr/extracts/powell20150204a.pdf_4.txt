financial system and the interests of depository institutions and consumers.  And when possible, 

the agencies will act to implement regulatory burden relief before the end of the EGRPRA 

review period.  For example, in December of last year, Congress passed legislation--which was 

supported by the Federal Reserve Board--that would increase the consolidated asset limit for 

small bank holding companies from $500 million to $1 billion under the Small Bank Holding 

Company Policy Statement and that extends the same treatment to savings and loan holding 

companies of less than $1 billion.  Last Thursday, the Federal Reserve issued for public 

comment both proposed and interim final rules for public comment that would implement that 

legislation.1  The rules would reduce regulatory burden on small entities by excluding many 

bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets 

of less than $1 billion from the consolidated capital requirements.  Of course, regulatory capital 

requirements will continue to apply to the depository institution level.  The rules also would 

reduce the burden of regulatory reporting for these companies.  The Federal Reserve currently 

estimates that the proposed revisions to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement 

would impact over 4,200 organizations.   

The final results of our EGRPRA review will be contained in the agencies’ report to 

Congress that summarizes the issues raised and the agencies’ conclusions about the need for 

regulatory or legislative changes.   

Thank you for coming today.
