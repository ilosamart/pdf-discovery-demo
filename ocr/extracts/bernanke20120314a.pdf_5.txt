nationally.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis organizes national “Ask 

the Fed” calls to provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve staff 

discuss recent policy initiatives and issues that examiners are encountering in the field.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts consumer compliance 

webinars, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes a quarterly overview 

of consumer compliance issues that allows Federal Reserve staff to address questions 

from banks.

  We are exploring options for building on these initiatives.  It is critical to 

keep the communications channels open if supervisors and banks are to work together 

constructively.   

The Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks 

Bank supervision requires a delicate balance--particularly now.  The weak 

economy, together with loose lending standards in the past, has put pressure on the entire 

banking industry, including community banks.  To protect banks from new problems 

down the road, and to safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund, supervisors must insist on 

high standards for lending, risk management, and governance.  At the same time, it is 

important for banks, for their communities, and for the national economy that banks lend 

to creditworthy borrowers.  Lending to creditworthy borrowers, after all, is how banks 

earn profits. 

We also know that supervision imposes costs on institutions, and we recognize 

that new regulations and supervisory requirements may impose disproportionate costs on 

community banks.  Thus, we take quite seriously the importance of evaluating the costs
