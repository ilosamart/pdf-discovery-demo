complemented by other information, including measures of volumes, liquidity, and 

market functioning, as well as intelligence gleaned from market participants and outside 

analysts.  In light of the current low interest rate environment, we are watching 

particularly closely for instances of “reaching for yield” and other forms of excessive 

risk-taking, which may affect asset prices and their relationships with fundamentals.  It is
