Apart from the questions as to whether LIBOR will continue or whether IBA or the FCA 

may judge that it is not representative, market participants should consider whether a rate with so 

few transactions underlying it is really their best option.  Do we really need or want to use other 

tenors of LIBOR in municipal or financial floating-rate notes?  For some, the answer to this may 

still be yes, but it is then imperative that they work to incorporate safer fallback language into 

their contracts as quickly as they can.  This is something that the ARRC has been working on 

intensively this year and much of today’s roundtable will discuss. But for others, the safest thing 

you can do would be to move away from using LIBOR.  Regardless of your answer to this 

question, we all have a stake in the ARRC’s work, both in promoting SOFR and in promoting 

better contract language.  I want to thank you all for coming to this roundtable, and want to thank 

Sandie and the ARRC for all the work that has made it possible.
