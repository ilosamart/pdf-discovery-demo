conditions are still supportive of growth by many measures (figure 2), but less so than 

last year.   

There are risks on both sides of the economy’s likely path.  In Europe, there are 

risks associated with deliberations over Italy’s fiscal and debt trajectory and the United 

Kingdom’s deliberations on the Brexit deal.  Here at home, we hear from businesses that 

the uncertainty associated with trade policy and the implications for supply chains may 

weigh on business capital spending.  Although it is reasonable to expect fiscal spending 

to be extended around current levels in real terms after the Bipartisan Budget Act expires, 

we cannot rule out that fiscal policy could become a headwind in 2020.  

The risks are two-sided.  Business contacts report difficulties finding qualified 

workers and increased costs associated with inputs, tariffs, and transportation, along with 

somewhat greater ability to pass through those increases to consumer prices.  Despite 

this, however, inflation remains muted overall.  At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is 

at its lowest level in 49 years, and payrolls have been growing well above the pace that is 

consistent with labor market stabilization.  Historically, the few periods when resource 

utilization has been similarly tight have seen elevated risks of either accelerating inflation 

or financial imbalances. 

Our goal now is to sustain the expansion by maintaining the economy around full 

employment and inflation around target.  The gradual path of increases in the federal 

funds rate has served us well by giving us time to assess the effects of policy as we have 

proceeded.  That approach remains appropriate in the near term, although the policy path 

increasingly will depend on how the outlook evolves.
