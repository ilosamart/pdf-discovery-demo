to devise better language for derivatives, and ISDA’s Scott O’Malia and Katherine Tew Darras 

will discuss that work later this morning.  As people now consider the risks around LIBOR for 

other types of contracts, they will need to go through their documentation to understand what the 

fallback language is and how it can be improved.  We will also discuss those issues today.  This 

is important work, both for the parties to these contracts and for our financial stability.  While 

there may be no perfect contract language or fallback, good risk management requires that we 

work together to find language and fallbacks that are robust and that limit unintended valuation 

changes.  

So, while much work has been done, there is more still to do.  I have been heartened in 

seeing that many market participants are already confronting these issues.  For some, Andrew 

Bailey’s speech was a difficult wake-up call.  But the efforts we have undertaken with the ARRC 

show what is possible when the official sector works collectively with market participants.  If 

market participants are willing to continue to work together, then we can safely achieve the 

transitions needed to create a better and more robust system that will help to ensure our ongoing 

financial stability.
