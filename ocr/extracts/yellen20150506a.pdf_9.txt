In response, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 

2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) expanded the mandate and authority of the Federal Reserve to

activities that are not subject to consolidated supervision and designating those 

institutions and activities for appropriate supervision.  And it is charged with encouraging 

greater information sharing and policy coordination across financial regulatory agencies.
