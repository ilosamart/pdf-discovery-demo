liquidity may be more prone to disappearing at times of stress.  On October 15, for example, market 

depth declined sharply, and we saw a sudden spike in prices that was without precedent for a period 

with little relevant news.  Other events--such as the 2013 “taper tantrum,” the “bund tantrum” last 

spring, and the sharp moves on March 18 in the euro-dollar exchange rate--all broadly show the same 

pattern:  rapidly diminishing liquidity, and large price moves for a given quantum of news.4  But the 

causes and implications of these events are unclear.  Is this the new normal?  We don’t know.  Current 

macroeconomic and market conditions are unprecedented in many respects.  For now, what we have 

is a small number of broadly similar events that bear careful consideration. 

  Most of these considerations apply across markets, but they are particularly important here 

because of the crucial role that Treasury securities play within the global financial system.  In 

addition to serving the financing needs of the U.S. government, Treasury markets are important for 

the conduct of monetary policy.  Treasuries serve as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for a wide 

range of financial institutions, including dealers in the Treasury market, and as collateral in myriad 

transactions conducted bilaterally and through clearing houses and exchanges.  Treasury securities 

are a global reserve asset, and Treasury markets are a key vehicle through which market participants 

manage their interest-rate risk.  The integrity and continued liquidity of the Treasury markets affect 

nearly everyone. 

  Treasury markets have undergone important changes over the years.  The footprints of the 

major dealers, who have long played the role of market makers, are in several respects smaller than 

they were in the pre-crisis period.  Dealers cite a number of reasons for this change, including 

                                                           
4 Between April and June of this year, interest rates on longer-dated German bunds rose sharply and amid considerable 
volatility on certain days, an event that observers coined the “bund tantrum.”  On March 18, 2015, shortly after 4 p.m. 
EDT and two hours after the release of the March FOMC monetary policy statement, the euro rose over 3 percent 
against the dollar in a four-minute period and then reversed most of its gain over the next three minutes.
