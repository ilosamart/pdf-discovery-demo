future.  They may need to turn to costly short-term sources of credit to cover emergency 

expenses.  Some may experience eviction if there is an unexpected expense or loss of income.   

To manage the high cost of housing, workers may be compelled to live far from where 

they work, rent substandard units, or resort to overcrowding.  Research shows that households 

that live far from work often pay a large share of their budget in commuting costs.17 As a society, 

we need to do better in ensuring that affordable housing is available where it is needed.     

The supply of affordable housing is a good example of a problem of national scope 

whose solution must be tailored to local needs and economic conditions.  This audience knows 

better than most about the complex dynamics that affect housing at the local level.  Local 

decisions on land use, zoning, taxes, and leveraging of federal funding, and whether community 

needs are prioritized, are at the heart of whether neighborhoods thrive.  

I’m not going to suggest that there are any easy answers to housing affordability.  Still, 

the CRA is one of the important policy levers that can make a difference by encouraging 

solutions that are tailored to local needs and circumstances.  It does this by encouraging banks to 

provide affordable and sustainable mortgage products to qualified low- and moderate-income 

families. This helps those families have a chance to purchase homes sustainably and build equity.  

In addition, by encouraging banks to work with the community to identify tailored rental and 

homeownership investment opportunities, the CRA helps encourage the construction of 

affordable housing where it is needed most.
