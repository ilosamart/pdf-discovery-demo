to, well, nothing.  I could talk more about this particular job--noting the fact that even at 

the age of 10 I found this job to qualify as one of the most tedious known to mankind. 

I knew as a kid, however, that in order to buy a ticket to go to the movies with my 

friends, I was going to have to number around 400 pages, and if I did more pages than 

that and invested the money in a savings account at a bank at a compounded annual 

interest rate of 4-1/2 percent, I could eventually afford to buy some popcorn, too.  Or take 

a brief vacation from numbering.  But if I wanted to cut back the number of pages and 

still accumulate enough to go to the movies sometime, I would need to find an interest 

rate out there for my earnings of three or more times what the bank was offering--not 

likely for a very young investor with limited funds.  I share these stories to illustrate that I 

grew up with a keen sense of working and saving, subjects now central to my work at the 

Federal Reserve; I understood the importance of earning enough interest on my savings 

to pay for the things I wanted. 

And this morning, that is what I want to talk about.  I’d like to provide some 

perspective on the implications of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy stance 

for savers and, in particular, to explore notions that low interest rates could be hurting 

savers and hindering, rather than helping, the recovery.  In order to explore this idea, we

years from the perspective of the Federal Reserve, as well as the monetary policy 

response to the events that unfolded.  Then we can look at the particular effects that the 

Fed’s monetary policy stance can be having in terms of interest rate levels.  Of course, 

while my remarks are intended to help you understand monetary policy, I should note
