Before turning to the specifics of the review, I want to focus a little more closely 

on the challenges we face today.  For a reference point, at the time of the 1999 

conference, the United States was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 

1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent—not so different from today.4  

Macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the Phillips curve, the level of the 

natural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growth—

questions that are also with us today.5 

The big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 

5.2 percent—which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away 

from the ELB.  Since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of 

interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the 

effective decline is even larger.6  The combination of lower real interest rates and low 

inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will 

fall to the ELB in a downturn.  

As the experience of the past decade showed, extended ELB episodes can be 

associated with painfully high unemployment and slow growth or recession.  Economic

4 The inflation rate referenced is the October 12-month percent change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures excluding food and energy. 
5 The discussion of all these issues was centered on Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s (1998) “New Economy” 
hypothesis that the United States had undergone fundamental changes for the better, leading to the 
otherwise puzzling outcomes. 
6 See, for example, the estimates of the neutral rate reported on the New York Fed’s website at 
https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar.  Rachel and Summers (2019) give reasons why the 
effective change may be larger.
