behavior.  Importantly, any such increases in participation and employment would likely 

be structural, not cyclical, enabling the economy to run at a sustainably higher level.   

New technologies could also make it easier for individuals’ actual hours to match 

their desired hours of work in a day or a week.  Instead of seeing hours per week bunched 

around 40, we may see greater variation in the hours that individuals work.  Lower 

barriers to workforce entry may make it more attractive for more individuals to work only 

a few hours a week if they desire--and can afford--to do so.  At the same time, by making 

it easier to find additional work, new technologies may lead to more individuals working 

greater-than-full-time hours every week.  In addition, we may see individuals changing 

the number of hours they work more frequently, as these changes become less costly. 

Both the EIWA and Upwork surveys confirm that gig work does, indeed, lower barriers 

to workforce entry and increase hours and flexibility for some individuals.   

The increasing prevalence of gig work may also affect the unemployment rate and 

productivity. To the extent that gigs provide an easy entryway to employment, 

unemployment may decrease.  However, if gig work is less stable, it may increase job 

loss.  The net effect on unemployment is, thus, unclear.  Regarding productivity, gig 

work could lower aggregate productivity to the extent that it requires less human capital 

or specialized knowledge than traditional jobs, or if it primarily increases hours worked 

by lower-skilled individuals.  That said, gig work, especially when enabled by new 

technologies, may allow hours to respond more flexibly to changes in demand and 

individuals to more easily connect with many different clients or employers.  As a result, 

workers’ downtime and the time required to acquire new clients and manage existing 

clients may decrease, in which case resource utilization and productivity may increase.
