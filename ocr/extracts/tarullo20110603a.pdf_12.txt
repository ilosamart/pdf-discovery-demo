Objections to Enhanced Capital Standards 

As we draw closer to the January 2012 statutory date for a rule on enhanced prudential 

standards for SIFIs, and as the Basel Committee makes progress on a SIFI surcharge, various 

objections have been raised to additional capital charges for SIFIs.  Some have suggested that the 

statutory requirement for stricter capital requirements could be formally met by lowering capital 

requirements for banks with less than $50 billion in assets, or by modestly increasing the 

consequences of falling below the Basel capital buffer for banks with more than $50 billion in 

assets.  

 An examination of these objections does not, I believe, undermine the case for the type 

of SIFI capital standard I have described.  On the contrary, some of these objections actually 

strengthen the case by revealing certain misplaced assumptions about the financial system that 

are embedded in the arguments of those who oppose a meaningful additional capital requirement.   

 A first objection is that equity is expensive - that the enhanced standard will force SIFIs 

to reduce their balance sheets because, with higher capital ratios, they cannot earn the rate of 

return that will be demanded by their investors.  The purported result would be reduced 

intermediation, with consequent costs to the economy.  This argument is conceptually 

incomplete, if not flawed, even when applied to generally applicable capital requirements.  To 

the extent that equity investors demand higher rates of return from financial firms than from non-

financial firms, it is largely because financial firms are so much more highly leveraged.  Thus the 

risk of loss is greater, even as the prospect for outsized returns on the limited equity is improved.  

The lower leverage that would result from higher capital requirements should lead to at least 

some reduction in the required return on equity.
