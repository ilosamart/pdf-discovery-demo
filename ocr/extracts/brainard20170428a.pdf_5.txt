another. 

So as fintech companies and banks are catching up to the interconnected world, the 

various players are sorting out how best to do the connecting.  Much of the work so far has been 

focused on the technical challenges, which are notable.  Most banks’ core systems are amalgams 

of computing mainframes built decades ago before the Internet or cloud computing were widely 

available and, in many cases, stitched together over the course of mergers and consolidations.10  

It takes a lot of investment to securely convert that infrastructure to platforms that can operate in 

real-time with ready access for Internet-native third-party developers.  

But important policy, regulatory, and legal questions also demand attention.  And that is 

where the smartphone analogy loses its power.  On balance, bank activities are much more 

highly regulated than smartphones.  Those regulations enable consumers to trust their banks to 

secure their funds and maintain the integrity of their transactions.  While “run fast and break 

things” may be a popular mantra in the technology field, it is ill suited to an arena where a 

serious breach could undermine confidence in the payments system.  Indeed, some of the key 

underpinnings of consumer protection and safety and soundness in the banking world--that 

consumers should be exceptionally careful in granting account access, that in certain conditions 

banks could be presumed to bear liability for unauthorized charges, and that banks can be held 

responsible for ensuring that service providers and vendors do right by their customers--sit

exchanges to convert their fiat currency to virtual currency and vice-versa.
