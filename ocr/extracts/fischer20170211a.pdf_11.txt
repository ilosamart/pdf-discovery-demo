outcomes relative to policymakers’ goals; in this case, the optimal policy path is 

computed using the FRB/US model and takes the staff’s baseline outlook as given.20  In 

principle, optimal policy simulations deliver better outcomes than simple policy rules, but 

those outcomes are conditional on some strong assumptions.21 

The black line in figure 3 shows the optimal policy path in the August 2011 

Tealbook conditional on interest rates being constrained to remain above zero.  

Comparing the black line with its counterpart from the Tealbook prepared for the 

previous FOMC meeting in June--the red dotted line--you can see that the date at which 

the policy rate was expected to rise above zero had moved out by about a year.  Even an 

optimal policy path (the blue dashed line) that was not constrained by the zero lower 

bound--and was therefore infeasible--did not cross into positive territory until mid-2014.  

Thus, the prescriptions of optimal policy were saying not only that the Committee’s 

interest rate should remain at zero for some time to come, but also that that period of time 

should be considerably longer than previously thought. 

At the August 2011 FOMC meeting, most members agreed that the economic 

outlook had deteriorated by enough to warrant a response.  Some of them judged that 

additional stimulus was called for because they thought the economy would not get back 

                                                 
20 More formally, optimal policies are the solution to an optimal control problem in which a search 

procedure is used to solve for the path of the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of an assumed loss 

function, conditional on a baseline outlook and on allowing for feedback of differences in the federal funds 

rate from its baseline to real activity and inflation.  See, for example, Svensson and Tetlow (2005).  For a 

concise description of its computation in conjunction with the FRB/US model, see Brayton, Laubach, and 

Reifschneider (2014b); for an exposition of the use of optimal control, see Yellen (2012). 
21 Optimal policy simulations assume that policymakers do not doubt their model or the baseline outlook.  

In addition, the particular optimal policy shown in figure 3 is known as a “commitment policy,” meaning 

that it is assumed that policymakers can bind themselves and future committees to follow the strategy--but 

not necessarily the precise policy rule prescriptions--that comprises the optimal plan.  The restrictiveness of 

these assumptions is one reason why optimal policy simulations are best considered in conjunction with 

other forms of policy advice such as prescriptions from simple rules.
