and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9  The nearly 20 percent increase in 

the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the 

United States.  Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth 

in both 2014 and 2015, while falling non-oil import prices likely subtracted 1/4 

percentage point from the annual rate of core inflation.10   

Finally, the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and views 

regarding the debtâ€™s sustainability can also influence the effects of fiscal policy.  

Research suggests that increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio cause long-term interest rates to 

rise.11  All else being equal, higher long-term interest rates reduce spending on interest-

sensitive goods, possibly damping the direct effect of fiscal expansion on economic 

activity.  The experiences of foreign economies suggest that the relationship between 

debt and interest rates is complex and likely non-linear, with the influence of greater debt 

on interest rates rising as the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches a trajectory at which investors 

have concerns about its sustainability.  In this light, it is notable that the current ratio of 

debt to GDP is substantially larger than it was preceding the fiscal expansions in the early 

1980s and early 2000s and has already been projected to increase further based on 

demographic trends.12 

Guideposts for Monetary Policy 

With any future change in fiscal policy quite uncertain, monetary policy will be 

guided by the current state of the economy, the underlying momentum of economic
