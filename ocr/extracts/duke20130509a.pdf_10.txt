These loans are classified as QMs under the rule.

  The small proportion of mortgages 

originated at present outside of these programs, for the most part, are being underwritten 

to tight standards consistent with the QM definition. 

As lender risk appetite increases and private capital returns to the mortgage 

market, a larger non-QM market should start to develop.  Two aspects of the QM rule, 

though, may make this market slow to develop for borrowers with lower credit scores.  

First, the QM requirement that borrower payments on all debts and some recurring 

obligations must be 43 percent or less of borrower income may disproportionately affect 

less-advantaged borrowers.

 Board staff tabulations based on the Survey of Consumer 

Finances indicate that such households tend to have lower incomes, fewer financial 

assets, and higher mortgage loan-to-value ratios than households with lower payment 

ratios (figure 14).

Second, the QM definition affects lenders’ ability to charge for the risks of 

originating loans to borrowers who are more likely to default.  For example, lenders may 

in general compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan.  

However, if lenders originate a first-lien QM with an annual percentage rate that is 

150 basis points or more above the rate available to the highest-quality borrowers, lenders 

receive less protection against lawsuits claiming violation of the ability-to-repay and QM

 This provision is slated to end no later than January 2021.  The Dodd-Frank Act gives the FHA, the VA, 

the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the RHS the option to write separate QM regulations for their 

mortgages.

 Borrowers with debt-to-income (DTI) ratios greater than 43 percent may still be able to obtain QMs if the 

mortgage is guaranteed by the FHA or eligible for purchase by the GSEs.

 The tabulation is based on households that purchased a home with mortgage credit in the two years 

preceding the Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances for 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 (the surveys are 

available at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm).  About 15 percent of borrowers in the 

2001, 2004, and 2010 surveys and 25 percent in the 2007 survey had DTIs greater than 43 percent.  The 

2007 statistic was reported incorrectly in the March 2013 Mortgage Bankers Association speech (see Duke, 

“Comments on Housing and Mortgage Markets,” in note 1).  DTI is measured at the time of the survey, not 

at the time of the loan origination, and may understate the number of affected households if household 

finances improve after the purchase of a home.
