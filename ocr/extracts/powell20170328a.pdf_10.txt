in scope.  As a result, the Reserve Banks created a committee to coordinate these “open 

market operations.”  But in these years, the Reserve Banks were not bound by that 

committee’s decisions and could derail any attempt at coordinated action. 

This decentralization was thought by some to have undermined the Federal 

Reserve’s response to the Great Depression.16  With that experience in mind, the 1935 

Banking Act modified the distribution of power within the Federal Reserve System, 

giving the Board of Governors 7 of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) (figure 10).17  The other 5 seats are held by the Reserve Banks.  The Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York has a permanent seat, and the other Reserve Banks share the 

remaining 4 seats on a rotating basis.18  While FOMC members are free to dissent from 

the majority decision about open market operations, the Reserve Banks are nevertheless 

required to adhere to that decision in conducting open market operations. 

The structure set out in 1935 has been essentially unchanged to this day and has 

served the country well.  As intended by the framers, the federal nature of the system has 

ensured a diversity of views and promotes a healthy debate over policy.  My strong view 

is that this institutionalized diversity of thinking is a strength of our System.  In my 

experience, the best outcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and 

strongly presented before decisions are made.

17 The FOMC was created by the Banking Act of 1933 but was restructured in 1935 to include members of 
the Board of Governors. 
18 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was made a permanent member of the FOMC in 1942.  From 
1935 to 1942, it alternated annually with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as a member.
