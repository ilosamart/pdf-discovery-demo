of such functioning would threaten the economy. 3  The collateral would have to be of good 

quality and the institutions sound to minimize any credit risk to the Federal Reserve.   

Holding open this possibility is not without cost.  With credit potentially available from 

the Federal Reserve, institutions would have insufficient incentives to manage their liquidity to 

protect against unusual market events.  Hence, the emergency credit would generally be provided 

only to groups of institutions that were regulated and supervised to limit such moral hazard.  If 

the Federal Reserve did not directly supervise the institutions that would potentially receive 

emergency discount window credit, we would need an ongoing and collaborative relationship 

with the supervisor.  The supervisor should ensure that any institution with implicit access to 

emergency discount window credit nevertheless maintained conservative liquidity policies.  The 

supervisor would also provide critical insight into the financial condition of the borrower and the 

quality of the available collateral and more generally whether lending was necessary and 

appropriate.

 The Federal Reserve and other central banks reacted to the deepening crisis in the fall of 

2008 not only by opening new liquidity facilities, but also by reducing policy interest rates to 

close to zero.  Such rapid and aggressive responses were expected to cushion the effects of the 

shock on the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, thereby 

encouraging them to keep spending.  In addition, the Federal Reserve and a number of other 

central banks have provided more guidance than usual about the likely future path of interest 

rates to help financial markets form more accurate expectations about policy in a highly 

                                                       
3 I am not referring here to the loans we extended to individual troubled institutions like American International 
Group, whose disorderly failure would have had catastrophic consequences for the economy.  That sort of lending is 
more appropriately done by the fiscal authorities and conducted only in association with the exercise of new 
authority to regulate and resolve systemically important institutions.
