The issue of fiscal sustainability and its interaction with monetary policy is 

certainly timely.1  Many advanced economies are in an extended period of slow growth 

and high deficits, and face long-term fiscal pressures from aging populations.   

I agree with much in this broad-ranging paper.2  In particular, the authors join 

others in finding that accommodative monetary policy is often associated with successful 

fiscal consolidations.  They conclude that a “tough love” alternative, which would call for 

the Federal Reserve to withhold monetary accommodation until fiscal policymakers enact 

legislation to reduce budget imbalances, is likely to be counterproductive.  Indeed, I 

would argue that the tough love approach also would require the Fed to deviate from the 

dual mandate that the Congress has assigned it, while assuming a role in influencing 

fiscal policy that the Congress has not assigned it.   

I find myself in disagreement, however, with the paper’s assessment that the 

current fiscal policy challenges might interfere in the near-term with the conduct of 

monetary policy in the United States.   

Three important propositions underlie the authors’ argument on this issue:    

1. The federal government’s fiscal path is unsustainable under current 

policies. 

2. If the market concludes that a government either cannot or will not service 

its debt, the central bank may be forced to choose ultimately between
