Compensation arrangements that created high-powered incentives using rewards 

dominantly based on equity had their origins in efforts to align better management and 

shareholder interests.  And compensation arrangements that rewarded incentives for loan officers 

to write more loans or traders to generate more trading revenue were grounded in efforts to 

increase firm profitability.  But the revenues that served as the basis for calculating bonuses were 

generated immediately, while the risks associated with these revenues might not have been 

realized for months or years after the transactions were completed.  When these or similarly 

misaligned incentive compensation arrangements were common in a firm, the very purpose of 

sound risk management could be undermined by the actions of employees seeking to maximize 

their own pay. 

Since the financial crisis, both firms and regulators have devoted considerable attention 

to incentive compensation practices for senior managers and others with substantial decision-

making authority.  Several years ago the bank regulatory agencies issued guidance on incentive 

compensation and then began a horizontal monitoring of practices at large banking 

organizations.4  Prior to the crisis, incentive compensation arrangements at many firms 

incorporated virtually no adjustment for risk.  Today, firms routinely take into consideration 

adverse outcomes.  A greater proportion of pay is deferred, and a greater proportion of that pay is 

at risk of a variety of clawback and forfeiture provisions.   

There is still considerable work to be done in developing and implementing incentive 

compensation arrangements that truly give appropriate incentives to employees.  In many cases 

risk metrics need to be better targeted to specific activities, and risk adjustments should be more
