The risk-based capital regime that has been built since the crisis contains several distinct 

components: a minimum capital requirement, a buffer requirement, and a surcharge on 

systemically important banks.9  Let me explain the rationale for each component.  The minimum 

capital requirement represents the amount of capital that experience suggests a bank needs so as 

to retain the confidence of its customers and counterparties and thus function as an intermediary.  

Recognizing that a bank operating below its minimum capital will be vulnerable to a sudden loss 

of market confidence, the regulatory consequences of falling below the minimum are severe and 

intended to force such a bank to quickly take steps to raise its capital level back above the 

minimum.  The buffer capital requirement is sized so that, if the economy suffers a severe 

recession that leads a bank to suffer a substantial loss, the bank will still be above its minimum 

capital level and thus able to continue operating and lending to support economic growth.  The 

buffer is intended to be useable in times of stress, and the regulatory consequences of falling into 

the buffer are accordingly less severe than the consequences of falling below the minimum.  The 

surcharge on systemically important banks requires systemically important firms to recognize, 

and hold capital against, the costs that their failure would impose on the broader economy. 

The minimum and buffer requirements were calibrated using historical data on bank 

losses across a number of countries in a way that would be appropriate for all large banks across 

a range of countries, although we recognized at the time that these requirements might not reflect 

market circumstances in all situations.  The surcharge for global systemically important banks 

(G-SIBs) was calibrated to provide a sufficient amount of additional capital to reduce sufficiently 

the chances of a G-SIBâ€™s failure so that the impact of its failure, discounted by the probability of 

                                                           
9  In addition to increasing minimum capital ratios, post-crisis reforms also placed more emphasis on the quality of 
regulatory capital by introducing the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, which reflects the focus by bank investors 
and counterparties during the crisis on common equity.
