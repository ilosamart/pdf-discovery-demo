Unfortunately, lending to small businesses has been declining.  Indeed, 

outstanding loans to small businesses dropped from almost $700 billion in the second 

quarter of 2008 to approximately $660 billion in the first quarter of 2010.1  An important 

but difficult-to-answer question is how much of this reduction has been driven by weaker 

demand for loans from small businesses and how much by restricted credit availability.  

To be sure, the distinction between demand and supply is not always easy to make.  For 

example, some potential borrowers have been turned down because lending terms and 

conditions remain tighter than before the financial crisis, perhaps reflecting banks’ 

concerns about the effects of the recession on borrowers’ economic prospects and balance 

sheets.  From the potential borrower’s point of view, particularly a borrower who has 

been able to obtain loans in the past, these changes may feel like a reduction in the supply 

of credit; from the lender’s point of view, the problem appears to be a lack of demand 

from creditworthy borrowers.  Although lenders and borrowers may have different 

perspectives, our collective challenge is to help ensure that creditworthy borrowers have 

access to credit so that, should they choose, they can expand their businesses or increase 

payrolls, helping our economy to recover.  

At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of credit to 

viable small businesses.  We helped in bringing capital from the securities markets to 

small businesses through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility--the TALF 

program.  Our bank stress tests of a year ago also drew private capital to the banking

031 and 041, schedule RC-C, part II, are defined as loans with original amounts of $1 million or less that 
are secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties or commercial and industrial loans. Correction: On July

agricultural production or secured by farmland."
