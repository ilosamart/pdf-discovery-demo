various ideas relating to short-term funding vulnerabilities into a few that have promise as 

discrete, relatively near-term initiatives, while continuing study of other, more comprehensive 

measures.   

 A second, related principle is that initiatives should be focused and manageable, 

reflecting not only the limited capacity of participating national authorities, but also the 

desirability of reaching at least a temporary equilibrium at which firms can get on with the 

business of planning their strategies in a clearer regulatory environment, and regulators can begin 

to take stock of the cumulative effects and effectiveness of the changes that have taken place in 

that environment. 

 A third principle is that, in most instances at least, international efforts to develop new 

regulatory mechanisms or approaches should build on experience derived from national practice 

in one or more jurisdictions.  The challenges encountered during the initial effort to devise an 

LCR in the Basel Committee, with little or no precedent of national quantitative liquidity 

requirements from which to learn, should counsel caution in trying to construct new regulatory 

mechanisms from scratch at the international level.  There will doubtless be exceptions to this 

general principle, such as where the transnational arbitrage incentives of a regulatory measure 

are so strong as to make national efforts difficult to initiate and sustain without substantial loss of 

financial activity to other countries.  And, in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, there was a 

need to harness the broad-based demands for reform and move forward on some priority reforms 

without benefit of learning from national initiatives.  On the other hand, there may also be areas 

where, notwithstanding the importance of a particular regulatory objective for international 

financial stability, it may be preferable to maintain a variety of approaches to achieving that 

objective.
