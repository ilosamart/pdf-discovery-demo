volumes in other term markets.  The alternative reference rate needs to be able to stand the 

weight of having trillions of dollars written on it, and the ARRC has definitely met this standard 

in choosing SOFR.   

 Third, we charged the ARRC with devising plans for a voluntary transition that 

encouraged the use of their recommended rate where appropriate.  We have never told anyone 

that they cannot use LIBOR.  The ARRC did consider whether other cash products could move 

from LIBOR to the rates it evaluated, but their paced transition plan has focused on derivatives 

because that is where the largest gross exposures to LIBOR are, and because it may be easier for 

many derivatives transactions to move away from LIBOR to a new rate.   

Now, however, market participants have realized that they may need to more seriously 

consider transitioning other products away from LIBOR, and the ARRC has expanded its work 

to help ensure that this can be done in a coordinated way that avoids unnecessary disruptions.  

Sandie will discuss plans to eventually create a term reference rate, which may help to smooth 

any transition.   That term reference rate would have to be built by first developing futures and 

OIS markets that reference SOFR.  It will likely never be as robust as SOFR itself, and so 

derivatives transactions will almost certainly need to be based on the overnight rate, but a term 

reference rate could conceivably be used in some loan or other contracts that currently reference 

LIBOR.   

All of the work that we will talk about today will help, but we have to acknowledge that 

the transition will be complicated.  Unfortunately, as I have discussed, we cannot guarantee that 

it wonâ€™t be necessary.  The most complicated aspects involve the legacy contracts that reference 

LIBOR, many of which do not have strong language in place if LIBOR were to stop publication.
