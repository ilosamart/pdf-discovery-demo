Weak foreign demand relative to the United States has pushed down net exports 

and contributed to a nearly 20 percent strengthening of the real trade-weighted dollar 

since mid-2014.  As a result, net exports subtracted a little more than 1/2 percentage point 

from GDP growth in 2014 and 2015, and econometric models suggest that past 

appreciation will lead to close to another 1 percentage point subtraction this year.3 

These effects are especially prominent in the U.S. manufacturing sector, where 

output is sluggish, and the agricultural sector has also been hit hard by the rise in the 

value of the dollar.  In addition, with profits at many firms adversely affected by the rise 

in the dollar and weak demand abroad, business fixed investment increased only 1-1/2 

percent last year after contributing significantly to growth earlier in the recovery. 

On balance, in recent months, financial conditions have tightened somewhat with 

equity prices moving lower and corporate risk spreads widening, although conditions 

have improved in recent weeks.  In addition, progress on inflation has been slow.  Prices 

for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have increased 1.3 percent over the 12 

months through January, well below the Federal Open Market Committeeâ€™s (FOMC) 2 

percent target.  Reductions in energy prices are, in part, responsible for this low rate, and 

if energy prices stabilize, top-line inflation should move higher.  Still, a stabilization in 

energy prices is not assured.  Market participants have been repeatedly surprised by the 

depth and persistence of oil price declines:  Both spot and far futures oil prices, for 

example, have fallen in five out of the past six quarters since mid-2014.
