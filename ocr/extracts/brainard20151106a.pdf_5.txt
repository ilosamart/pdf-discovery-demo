country’s foreign exchange rate, which switches domestic expenditures away from 

foreign exports.  Finally, it eases conditions across financial markets in that country, 

which can lead to financial easing in foreign markets when global financial markets are 

tightly integrated.   

The spillovers are likely to be more positive the greater the expansion of domestic 

demand relative to the expenditure switching effect through the exchange rate and the 

greater is the easing of financial conditions.  The magnitude of the relative cross-border 

effects from each of these three channels will depend on the size of the country that is 

easing monetary policy as well as its relative weight in international financial markets.  

Since 2008, changes in the stance of monetary policy in major economies have 

often elicited strong reactions in other economies.  Whether the global spillovers from 

changes in monetary policy were viewed as benign or challenging depends on the relative 

strength of the three transmission effects described earlier, the relative divergence of 

conditions in foreign economies, and the flexibility of their monetary policy tools to 

offset divergent spillovers. 

To illustrate this point, let’s start with a case where the effect of easing through 

unconventional means was broadly welcomed.  From 2008 through 2009, the Federal 

Reserve eased policy through cuts in its policy rate and through large-scale asset 

purchases.  That easing came in the context of a widespread global slump and severe 

strains in global financial markets, and in these circumstances it had significant positive 

international spillovers.  The boost to domestic demand likely outweighed any effect via 

the exchange rate and contributed to an easing of U.S. and global financial conditions.  

Those positive spillovers were reinforced by widespread easing of conventional monetary
