I would like to thank the Banque de France for inviting me to take part in what I 

expect will be a lively discussion. 

The suddenness and severity of the global financial crisis forced policymakers to 

respond rapidly and creatively, employing a wide range of macroeconomic tools--

including both monetary and fiscal policies--to arrest a steep economic downturn and 

restart the global economy.  Given the slow and unsteady nature of the recovery, 

supportive policy remains necessary. 

Today I would like to briefly review the evolution of monetary and fiscal policies 

following the global financial crisis both in the United States and in other advanced 

economies, since we have faced similar experiences and employed similar policy 

responses.  I will try to draw some lessons and provide some thoughts on the policy mix 

going forward. 

Policy before the Crisis 

 Prior to the global financial crisis, inflation rates in the United States and other 

advanced economies were near their target levels and most of these economies appeared 

to be operating close to their potential.  Policy interest rates were similarly in the vicinity 

of levels considered to be normal.   

Fiscal deficits also appeared to be under control before the crisis.  According to 

the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), general 

government deficits in 2007 were less than 4 percent of GDP in the United States and the 

United Kingdom, about 2 percent in Japan, and less than 1 percent, on average, in the 

euro area.  Still, given relatively buoyant economic conditions, governments probably 

should have been doing more to prepare for the long-term challenge of aging populations,
