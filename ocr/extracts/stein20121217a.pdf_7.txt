starker evidence of the risks that money market funds pose for the broader financial 

system.  In light of these vulnerabilities, I welcome the recent proposed recommendations

the appropriate design of regulation.  The research discussed in conferences such as this 

one will help us better understand and respond to these challenges.  Thank you, and I 

look forward to your questions.
