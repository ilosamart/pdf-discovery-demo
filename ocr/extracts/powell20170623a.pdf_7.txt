Principle seven of the PFMI addresses these liquidity risks, calling for all CCPs to meet a 

“Cover 1 standard”--that is, to hold enough liquid resources in all relevant currencies to make 

payments on time in the event of the default of the clearing member that would generate the 

largest payment obligation under a wide range of potential stress scenarios.  More complex CCPs 

and those with a systemic presence in multiple jurisdictions are encouraged to meet a “Cover 2 

standard.”  The PFMI also provide guidance on the resources that qualify in meeting these 

requirements:  cash held at a central bank or a creditworthy commercial bank, committed lines of 

credit, committed repurchase agreements, committed FX swap agreements, or highly marketable 

collateral that can be converted into cash under prearranged and highly reliable funding 

arrangements.    

There are two sets of risks involved here.  First, where should CCPs put their cash?  As 

central clearing has expanded, CCPs have had to deal with increasingly large amounts of cash 

margin.  CCPs can deposit some of these funds with commercial banks.  But regulatory changes 

have made it more expensive for banks to take large deposits from other financial firms, and in 

some cases banks may be unwilling to accept more cash from a CCP.  And many of the largest 

banks are also clearing members, which introduces a certain amount of wrong-way risk.  A 

clearing-member default could be especially fraught if the defaulting bank also held large cash 

balances for the CCP.  For this reason, CCPs may prudently place limits on the amount deposited 

at a given institution.  In order to diversify their holdings, many also place cash in the repo 

market.  If it is available, the ability to deposit cash at a central bank allows for another safe, 

flexible, and potentially attractive option--a subject I will return to later.   

Second, how can CCPs be assured that they will be able to convert securities into cash or 

draw on other resources in times of stress?  The PFMI uses the words “committed” and “pre-
