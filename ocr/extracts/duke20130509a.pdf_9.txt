the QM standard, however, the lender receives greater protection from such potential 

lawsuits because it is presumed that the borrower had the ability to repay the loan.   

Loans that fall outside the QM standard may be more costly to originate than 

loans that meet the standard for at least four reasons, all else being equal.  The first 

reason is the possible increase in foreclosure losses and litigation costs.  Although these 

costs, in the aggregate, are expected to be small, their full extent will not be known until 

the courts settle any ability-to-repay suits that may be brought forward.

  The second 

reason is that mortgages that do not meet the QM definition will also not qualify as 

QRMs, so lenders will be required to hold some of the risk if these loans are securitized.

The third reason is that loan originators will have better information than investors on the 

quality of the underwriting decision.  Investors may demand a premium to compensate 

them for the concern that originators might sell them the loans most vulnerable to ability-

to-repay lawsuits.  The fourth reason is that the non-QM market, at least initially, may be 

small and illiquid, which would increase the cost of these loans. 

The higher costs associated with non-QM loans should have very little effect on 

access to credit in the near term because almost all current mortgage originations meet 

the QM standard.  The vast majority of current originations are eligible to be purchased, 

insured, or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA, the VA, or the RHS.

 If a mortgage-backed security is collateralized by “qualified residential mortgages,” as defined by federal 

regulators consistent with section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the securitizer is not required to retain any 

risk in the securitization transaction.  Otherwise, the securitizer must retain an economic interest in the 

transaction consistent with section 941 and any regulations established thereunder, which may increase the 

securitizer’s costs.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that Federal regulators set the definition of a QRM to be 

no broader than the definition of a QM.
