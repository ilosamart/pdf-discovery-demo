policies do not inadvertently impede sound lending to businesses, both large and small, and we 

will continue to do so. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve System is hosting meetings with private- and public-

sector partners to highlight concerns facing small businesses.  Some of these meetings focus on 

general small business topics.  Others concentrate on subsegments of the market such as minority 

business owners or businesses located in low- and moderate-income areas.  We are in the midst 

of hosting more than 40 such gatherings across the country to collect data and glean perspectives 

that will help find ways to meet the immediate and intermediate financial needs of small 

businesses.  These meetings seek to identify existing credit gaps, share promising practices, and 

highlight regional differences as well as national themes in credit access and technical support 

for small businesses.  The key findings of these small business gatherings will be presented to 

policymakers later this summer.

determinant of the demand for and availability of small business lending, have improved
