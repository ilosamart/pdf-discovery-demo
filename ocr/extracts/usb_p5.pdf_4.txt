contained in federal and state laws and regula-
tions. The following is representative of some of
the requirements that may be imposed. Any
asset for which:

• Evidence of indebtedness (original signed note
or loan agreement) is not held in the United
States or the state within which the branch is
licensed;

• Evidence of indebtedness is in transit within
the FBO system, either outside the United
States or outside the state in which the branch
is licensed;

• Repayment is to be made in funds not freely
convertible to U.S. dollars;

• Reclassification to an expense category is
pending.

In addition requirements may be imposed on:

• Types of securities and depreciation;
• The documentation and collection of loans;
• The type, location, holding, and depreciation

of fixed assets;
• All amounts due from the head office and

other depository and nondepository offices
and affiliates, including income accrued but
uncollected on such amounts.

The balance of any asset disallowed at the
preceding examination will be treated as ineli-
gible until the underlying reasons for the disal-
lowance have been removed.

Assets Ineligible By Examiner

If an examiner, during the course of an exami-
nation, determines that the value of any nonmar-
ketable bond, note, debenture, or any other asset
would preclude complete repayment, the exam-
iner may consider that asset ineligible for asset
maintenance purposes. The portion considered
unrecoverable is disallowed.

Disallowances of classified assets will differ
based on the criteria or guidelines used by the
various regulatory agencies. The following for-
mula is representative of some of the disallow-
ances that may be used: Loss—100 percent of
book value; Doubtful—50 percent of book value;
Substandard—20 percent of book value, and
Value Impaired—100 percent of the amount
equivalent to the Allocated Transfer Risk
Reserve, plus 20 percent of any residual expo-

sure. In addition, all accrued interest on assets
subject to a Loss, Doubtful, Substandard, or
Value Impaired classification is usually
disallowed.

An examiner may also disallow any loan or
other credit exposure that is not supported by
sufficient credit information (in English) to per-
mit an evaluation of the creditworthiness or
other risks inherent in the asset. Examiners are
to exercise prudence in disallowing assets for
this reason.

Situations may arise where an asset can be
disallowed for both statutory and discretionary
reasons. For example, a loan may be disallowed
by statute because the evidence of indebtedness
is not held in the state where the branch is
located. Additionally, the loan may be classified
Substandard, Doubtful, Loss, or Value Impaired.
In this case, the branch (for periodic reporting to
the regulators) and/or the examiner can disallow
the asset by statute and classify the loan. Of
course, no further disallowance is made on the
basis of the asset classification.

Where an asset is controlled jointly by the
branch and a related party, it is necessary to
determine whether the branch has independent
control ( i.e. the ability to withdraw the asset
without a cosignatory). If so, the item should not
be disallowed simply because another office
retains signing authority.

By definition, a certificate-less security (those
represented by advises or confirmations) cannot
be in the owner’s possession. Nevertheless, this
type of security may be an eligible asset, even if
the depository is located outside the state where
the branch is located, provided that both of the
following conditions are met: (1) The security is
held by the depository in the name of the branch
or in the name of an unrelated broker, agent, or
custodian (the exchange member) who is located
in the state where the branch is licensed; and
(2) The asset is properly shown on the branch’s
records so as to permit the appropriate regula-
tors to freeze the account immediately upon
taking possession of the branch.

Reserves maintained at the local Federal
Reserve Bank, pursuant to Regulation D, and
assets pledged to the FDIC, in connection with
deposit insurance regulations, are eligible assets.
Securities held by the Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral against possible borrowing are eligible
on the same basis as if held by the branch. The
amount of any borrowing must be deducted
from the value determined.
