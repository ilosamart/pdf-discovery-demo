needs, likely leading to a significant loss of wealth in future years.10 

These circumstances emphasize the importance of unrestricted savings, or savings that 

can be used for emergencies or precautionary purposes.  Cobbling together even a minimum 

amount of emergency savings can have a significant impact, especially among lower-income 

households.  In fact, the Consumer Federation of America found that low-income families with 

$500 in emergency savings had better financial outcomes than moderate-income families with 

lower savings.  In addition, recent research found that households that are “liquid-asset poor” are 

two to three times more likely than those with liquid assets to experience “material hardship” 

after a job loss, health emergency, death in the family, or other adverse event.11   

Clearly, emergency savings are important for households at every income level.  For 

some, a tax refund or tax credit is a possible source of emergency funds.  The Federal Reserve 

Bank of St. Louis has a user-friendly publication titled, You've Earned It! What the Earned 

Income Tax Credit Can Do for You.12  This booklet explains how the Earned Income Tax Credit 

(EITC) works and who qualifies for the credit.  Millions of low-income, working Americans are 

unaware that they are eligible for thousands of dollars in tax credits.  Receiving a windfall such 

as the EITC is the perfect opportunity to establish savings that would be available for unexpected 

expenses. And thanks to the IRS form 8888, which has been around just a couple of years now, 

you can send your EITC refund directly and automatically to up to three different accounts.
