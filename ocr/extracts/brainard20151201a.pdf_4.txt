The neutral rate of interest is not directly observable, but we can back out an 

estimate of the neutral rate by relying on the observation that output should grow faster 

relative to potential growth the lower the federal funds rate is relative to the nominal 

neutral rate.  In today’s circumstances, the fact that the U.S. economy is growing at a 

pace only modestly above potential while core inflation remains restrained suggests that 

the nominal neutral rate may not be far above the nominal federal funds rate, even now.  

In fact, various econometric estimates of the level of the neutral rate, or similar concepts, 

are consistent with the low levels suggested by this simple heuristic approach.5   

The Past and Future Neutral Rate 

In assessing the policy path ahead, the critical question is whether a low neutral 

rate is likely to be a “new normal” in the longer run or whether the neutral rate is soon 

likely to increase back to levels considered normal in the decades before the crisis.  To 

answer this question, it is helpful to use economic forecasts, market-implied expectations, 

and econometric models to assess where real interest rates are expected to be in the 

longer run, and compare them with the levels that prevailed in the decades before the 

crisis.  In doing so, it is important to abstract from shocks that are transitory or cyclical 

and thus likely to fade away over a year or two.6 

Starting with economic forecasts, Blue Chip Forecasts publishes projections of 

the federal funds rate and consumer price index (CPI) inflation 6 to 10 years into the 

future, when the economy is typically expected to be near full employment.  The implied 

Blue Chip consensus longer-run real federal funds rate averaged around 2.2 percent in the

6 Hamilton and others (2015) use moving averages of real rates as their measure of the equilibrium real 
rate.  Using a similar measure, in the United States, the 11-year moving average of the short-term real 
interest rate is now at its lowest level since the beginning of the series in the late 1950s.
