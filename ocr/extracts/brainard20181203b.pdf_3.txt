That moment encapsulates Chair Yellen’s consistent orientation to how our work touches 

the lives of American families.  It is perhaps no accident that Chair Yellen delivered her first 

speech as Chair at a community reinvestment conference.3   

In navigating the Federal Open Market Committee’s objectives of price stability and full 

employment, Chair Yellen was attentive to low- and moderate-income communities, recognizing 

that Americans on the most precarious rungs of the ladder often feel the impacts of a downturn 

soonest and the longest.4  Chair Yellen brought the subject of economic disparities to the 

forefront of our conversations, consistently emphasizing the importance of an economy that 

works for everyone.5  

As Chair, Janet Yellen continued her practice of meeting with community members, 

where she had in-depth conversations about disparities in employment, labor force participation, 

income, and wealth, recognizing these direct interactions provide valuable insights no statistic or 

report can fully capture.  For instance, she visited the Manufacturing Technology Center on 

Cuyahoga Community College’s Metropolitan Campus where she participated in a roundtable 

discussion on the state of manufacturing workforce development in Northeast Ohio.6

4 “Differences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during recessions, as 
less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and these differences shrink during recoveries. 
For example, in the second quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 
percentage points higher than for white adult men. This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to the 
smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.” Lael Brainard, “Why Persistent 
Employment Disparities Matter for the Economy’s Health” (speech at “Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are
