Lessons Learned and Suggested Improvements
• “Dot plot” shows individual views on appropriate monetary policy

– Dots not tied to macroeconomic projections

– No information provided on identity of forecaster

– Dots do not provide obvious means to identify Committee reaction 
function

– Economic outlook can change significantly between SEPs

– SEP submitted before meeting; statement reflects Committee 
consensus

• Emphasize uncertainty surrounding projections—fan charts?
