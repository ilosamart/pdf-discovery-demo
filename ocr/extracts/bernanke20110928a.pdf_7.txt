other controls on exports and imports, have been a key element of the growth strategies 

of a number of fast-growing emerging market economies, including China.7  Openness to 

inflows of foreign direct investment has helped many emerging economies import foreign 

management techniques and technologies as well as to attract foreign capital.  More 

generally, greater use of markets improves the allocation of resources, creates incentives 

for more efficient forms of production, and encourages entrepreneurship and innovation.  

However, as I will discuss in a moment, experience has also shown that the success of 

reform programs may depend crucially on how the transition to greater market orientation 

is managed, and in particular on how market reforms are sequenced, issues on which the 

Washington Consensus is largely silent.  

The third part of the Washington Consensus focused on strengthening property 

rights and the rule of law--for example, through effective enforcement of contracts.  The 

evidence suggests that these factors too can be important for development.8  For example, 

the inability to establish clear title to land or buildings has inhibited entrepreneurship and 

investment in some poor countries.  On the other hand, some critics fault the Washington 

Consensus for paying insufficient attention to the role in economic growth of a much 

broader range of institutional factors than property rights alone--standardized accounting 

conventions, political accountability, control of corruption, bankruptcy laws, and capable 

and transparent regulatory agencies, for example.9  Moreover, the Washington Consensus 

provided little specific advice on how to create and sustain a strong institutional 

                                                            
7 See, for example, Chapter 5 of World Bank (2005).  Earlier studies documenting the importance of trade 
openness for growth include Sachs and Warner (1995, 1997) and Frankel and Romer (1999).      
8 For example, Kaufmann and others (2002) provide some evidence linking economic development to the 
presence of institutions that promote the rule of law.  
9 Burki and Perry (1998) and Rodrik (2006) are among those who argue that the Washington Consensus did 
not sufficiently emphasize the development of institutions.
