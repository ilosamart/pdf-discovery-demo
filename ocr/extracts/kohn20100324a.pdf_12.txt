making about their policy rates were shaped by the  underlying determinants of the balance of 

saving and investment, including, in the past decade or so, the high saving propensities of the 

newly emerging Asian economies and the sluggish rebound in investment globally after the 

recession early last decade.  Nonetheless, it is important that we understand the reasons for the 

decline in average real rates and whether low rates are likely to persist--and that very tough 

problem is the extra credit assignment.  For one thing, as the economic expansion gains traction 

and central banks back off the current highly accommodative stance of policy, policymakers will 

need to understand how the longer-term trend in real rates has influenced the point at which the 

policy rate becomes restrictive.  For another, if rates are going to continue to be low by historical 

standards, regulators will need to be especially alert to any signs that a reach for yield by 

investors is contributing to excessive risk-taking.   

Inflation Objectives 

 The final homework assignment concerns the inflation objectives of central banks.  

Central banks have widely chosen to target inflation rates near 2 percent.  The Federal Reserve is 

required by law to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.  

We haven’t announced an explicit inflation rate target consistent with that dual mandate, but the 

Federal Reserve governors and Reserve Bank presidents publish our individual forecasts for 

inflation over the longer run, conditional on our individual views of appropriate monetary policy.  

Those forecasts indicate that most of the FOMC participants believe that inflation should 

converge to 1-3/4 to 2 percent over time.   

 Recently, some prominent economists have called for central banks to raise their inflation 

targets to about 4 percent.  Shifting inflation targets up would tend to raise the average level of
