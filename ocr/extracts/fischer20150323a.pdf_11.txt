interest rates, and thus to the basis on which the FOMC will set interest rates following 

liftoff.   

There has been a lively discussion of one element of the future path of the federal 

funds rate: whether liftoff should be sooner with a gradual rise in the rate, or whether 

liftoff should occur later and be followed by a steeper path of the rate.19  These 

discussions are useful when considering the appropriate timing of the first increase in the 

federal funds rate.  But what comes after the first increase?  Standard interest rate 

projections might incline one to believe that the path of the federal funds rate after liftoff 

will consist of a steady rate of increase from zero to the longer-run normal nominal 

federal funds rate, which will be equal to the natural real rate of interest plus our 2 

percent inflation goal.  One might even look back to the period from 2004 to 2007 and 

conclude that the FOMC will raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points every 

meeting, or every second meeting, or every third meeting, depending on the date of 

liftoff.   

I know of no plans for the FOMC to behave that way.  Why not?  Isnâ€™t that what 

the calculation of optimal control paths shows?  Yes.  But a smooth path upward in the 

federal funds rate will almost certainly not be realized, because, inevitably, the economy 

will encounter shocks--shocks like the unexpected decline in the price of oil, or 

geopolitical developments that may have major budgetary and confidence implications, 

or a burst of greater productivity growth, as the Fed dealt with in the mid-1990s.

or later from the effective lower bound, see, for example, the FOMC minutes for January 2015; see Board 
of Governors (2015).
