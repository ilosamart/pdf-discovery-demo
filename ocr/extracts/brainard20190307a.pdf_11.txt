the expansion was well established, and then it started normalizing the balance sheet once 

normalization of the federal funds rate was well under way. 

Of course, the benchmark for normalization has changed since before the 

financial crisis.  Demand has grown for the Fed’s liabilities from a variety of sources.  

The demand for U.S. currency has grown notably relative to nominal GDP, the Treasury 

Department now holds large balances in its account at the Fed as an important part of its 

cash management, and foreign central banks hold larger deposits than in the past.  In 

addition, the demand from commercial banks for deposits at the Fed--that is, “reserves”--

appears to have increased substantially.  Spurred by new liquidity regulations and their 

own internal liquidity management practices, the largest banks hold substantial amounts 

of so-called high-quality liquid assets to protect against the risk of a sudden “run” on 

their uninsured short-run liabilities, as occurred during the financial crisis.     

So it appears that the new normal size of the balance sheet is likely to remain 

greater relative to the size of the economy than it was before the financial crisis.  How 

much larger is still an open question.  For the past decade, the Federal Reserve has 

operated a regime with reserves that are very abundant relative to banks’ demand for 

reserves.  The current framework relies on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate on reserves 

to control the federal funds rate, in the context of the provision of ample reserves.  In 

contrast, the pre-crisis framework featured a scarce supply of reserves, which the Federal 

Reserve would vary on a daily basis to control the federal funds rate by closely matching 

the demand for reserves.
