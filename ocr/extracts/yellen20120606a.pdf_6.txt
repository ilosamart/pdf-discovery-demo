the perceived risks surrounding the European situation are already having a meaningful effect on 

financial conditions here in the United States, further weighing on the prospects for U.S. growth. 

Given these formidable challenges, most private sector forecasters expect only gradual 

improvement in the labor market and I share their view.  Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate 

together with the median forecast from last month’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), 

the dashed blue line.3  The figure also shows the central tendency of the unemployment 

projections that my FOMC colleagues and I made at our April meeting: Those projections reflect 

our assessments of the economic outlook given our own individual judgments about the 

appropriate path of monetary policy.  Included in the figure as well is the central tendency of 

FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, which ranges from 

5.2 percent to 6 percent.  Like private forecasters, most FOMC participants expect the 

unemployment rate to remain well above its longer-run normal value over the next several years.   

Of course, considerable uncertainty attends this outlook:  The shaded area provides an 

estimate of the 70 percent confidence interval for the future path of the unemployment rate based 

on historical experience and model simulations.4  Its width suggests that these projections could 

be quite far off, in either direction.  Nevertheless, the figure shows that labor market slack at 

present is so large that even a very large and favorable forecast error would not change the 

conclusion that slack will likely remain substantial for quite some time. 

                                                            
3 The SPF released in May provides forecasts on a quarterly basis through mid-2013 and annual projections beyond 
that date.  To construct quarterly forecasts through the end of 2014, I interpolate the annual projections. 
4 The forecast confidence interval is generated using stochastic simulations of the Federal Reserve staff’s FRB/US 
model.  Specifically, a baseline is constructed centered on the median of the SPF projections released in May, and 
then the model is repeatedly simulated with shocks drawn from the set of historical disturbances experienced over 
the period from 1968 to 2011.  Similar estimates of forecast confidence intervals would be obtained if the intervals 
were instead constructed using the actual historical forecast errors of private forecasters; for further discussion, see 
table 2 of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the April Federal Open Market 
Committee minutes, available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal 
Open Market Committee, April 24-25, 2012,” press release, May 16,
