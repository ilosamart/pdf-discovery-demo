take care to avoid a sharp near-term fiscal contraction that could endanger the recovery. 

Third, stresses in credit and financial markets continue to restrain the economy.  

Earlier in the recovery, limited credit availability was an important factor holding back 

growth, and tight borrowing conditions for some potential homebuyers and small 

businesses remain a problem today.  More recently, however, a major source of financial 

strains has been uncertainty about developments in Europe.  These strains are most 

problematic for the Europeans, of course, but through global trade and financial linkages, 

the effects of the European situation on the U.S. economy are significant as well.  Some 

recent policy proposals in Europe have been quite constructive, in my view, and I urge 

our European colleagues to press ahead with policy initiatives to resolve the crisis. 

Conclusion 

 Early in my tenure as a member of the Board of Governors, I gave a speech that 

considered options for monetary policy when the short-term policy interest rate is close to 

its effective lower bound.31  I was reacting to common assertions at the time that 

monetary policymakers would be “out of ammunition” as the federal funds rate came 

closer to zero.  I argued that, to the contrary, policy could still be effective near the lower 

bound.  Now, with several years of experience with nontraditional policies both in the 

United States and in other advanced economies, we know more about how such policies
