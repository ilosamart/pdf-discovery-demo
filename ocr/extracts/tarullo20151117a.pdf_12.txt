desirable to address bank-like risks in the shadow banking sector and to forestall regulatory 

arbitrage. 

 The Board has advocated for international measures to forestall the development of 

highly volatile funding structures outside the regulated sector.  Consistent with this position, we 

will be developing a regulation that would establish minimum haircuts for securities financing 

transactions (SFTs) on a market-wide basis, rather than just for specific classes of market 

participants.  SFTs include repo, reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities 

margin lending--transactions that are the lifeblood of many kinds of shadow banks.  SFTs are a 

key component of the healthy functioning of the securities market.  But, in the absence of 

sensible regulation, they also carry the potential for prompting the fire sale dynamic described 

earlier.  While the haircuts and other conditions associated with SFTs today are considerably 

more conservative than during the period leading up to the crisis, there is good reason to believe 

that this conservatism could be eroded as economic conditions continue to improve and credit 

growth accelerates. 

 A system of numerical haircut floors for SFTs would require any entity that wants to 

borrow against a security to post a minimum amount of excess margin to its lender, with the 

amount varying depending on the asset class of the collateral.  Like the minimum margin 

requirements that U.S. regulators have imposed on derivatives contracts, numerical floors for 

SFT haircuts would serve as a mechanism for limiting the build-up of leverage in the financial 

system.  They could also mitigate the risk to financial stability posed by pro-cyclical margin calls 

during times of financial stress, since putting a regulatory floor under SFT haircuts during good 

times would reduce the amount by which they would increase during periods of stress.
