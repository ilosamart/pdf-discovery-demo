understanding this process--and its implications for the household, business, and financial 

sectors--would be very helpful in the design of monetary and regulatory policies. 

Another issue brought to the fore by the crisis is the need to better understand the 

determinants of liquidity in financial markets.  The notion that financial assets can always 

be sold at prices close to their fundamental values is built into most economic analysis, 

and before the crisis, the liquidity of major markets was often taken for granted by 

financial market participants and regulators alike.  The crisis showed, however, that risk 

aversion, imperfect information, and market dynamics can scare away buyers and badly 

impair price discovery.  Market illiquidity also interacted with financial panic in 

dangerous ways.  Notably, a vicious circle sometimes developed in which investor 

concerns about the solvency of financial firms led to runs:  To obtain critically needed 

liquidity, firms were forced to sell assets quickly, but these “fire sales” drove down asset 

prices and reinforced investor concerns about the solvency of the firms.  Importantly, this 

dynamic contributed to the profound blurring of the distinction between illiquidity and 

insolvency during the crisis.  Studying liquidity and illiquidity is difficult because it 

requires going beyond standard models of market clearing to examine the motivations 

and interactions of buyers and sellers over time.12

I have been discussing needed research in microeconomics and financial 

economics but have not yet touched on macroeconomics.  Standard macroeconomic

impose new liquidity requirements on financial institutions and to require changes in the 

operations of key markets to ensure normal functioning in times of stress, new policy-

relevant research in this area would be most welcome.
