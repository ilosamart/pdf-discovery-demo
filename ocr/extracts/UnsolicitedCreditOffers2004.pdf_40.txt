balances were on cards carrying rates of less than 16.5 percent; by 2002, that proportion 
was more than 70 percent (figure 3). 

Furthermore, during the past decade, when prescreening has been most prevalent in the 
credit card industry, the trade press has reported that large competitors have been active 
in purchasing any available portfolios of card-related receivables. While on its face this 
might appear to be an action consistent with a reduction in competition, the portfolios 
have tended to gravitate toward the most aggressively competitive firms in the industry. 
Furthermore, these purchases have taken place at a time when there are still hundreds of 
active market participants, including dozens of large ones.27 

In the area of insurance, the entry into the marketplace of direct issuers (firms that do not 
rely on agents) who rely heavily on mailed prescreened solicitations for new business 
undoubtedly has enhanced competition and provided new opportunities for consumers. 
To the extent that consumers find this alternative attractive, other market participants 
must respond in order to maintain competitive viability. 

CONSUMERS BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS OF CREDITORS AND INSURERS 

As discussed above, many companies that solicit new credit accounts and insurance 
policies have found prescreening to be a cost-effective way to identify those potential 
consumers who are likely prospects for the products they offer and to control certain risks 
related to offering these products. In a competitive market, cost savings for creditors and 
insurers translates into lower product prices, a greater range of choices, and wider 
availability of credit or insurance for consumers, including those traditionally 
underserved. 

Because it lowers the costs of soliciting new customers, prescreening also gives even 
small companies the ability to make credit and insurance available to consumers over a 
wider geographic area. Such activities can spur competition in local markets. 

27 The Boardâ€™s most recent report on the profitability of credit card plans reveals that twenty-two large 
credit card banks (assets of more than $200 million) together held about 68 percent of bank-type credit card 
credit outstanding (either directly or securitized) at year end 2003. This ratio does not indicate an 
especially high concentration when compared with that of many other industries. Return on assets for these 
specialized institutions is higher than for banks as a whole, but the difference is likely due in part to the 
undiversified nature of their assets by product line (Board of Governors, The Profitability of Credit Card 
Operations of Depository Institutions).
