direct than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial 

stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and 

employment.  As a result, I believe a macroprudential approach to supervision and 

regulation needs to play the primary role.  Such an approach should focus on “through the 

cycle” standards that increase the resilience of the financial system to adverse shocks and 

on efforts to ensure that the regulatory umbrella will cover previously uncovered 

systemically important institutions and activities.  These efforts should be complemented 

by the use of countercyclical macroprudential tools, a few of which I will describe.  But 

experience with such tools remains limited, and we have much to learn to use these 

measures effectively. 

I am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten the incentives 

of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of 

macroprudential measures to address these and other financial stability concerns.  

Accordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be 

appropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability.  Because of this possibility, 

and because transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, it is crucial that 

policymakers communicate their views clearly on the risks to financial stability and how 

such risks influence the appropriate monetary policy stance.  I will conclude by briefly 

laying out how financial stability concerns affect my current assessment of the 

appropriate stance of monetary policy.
