from one job to another.  Most commonly, this involves occupational training through certificate 

and degree programs, but it also includes the training and development workers receive from 

employers.   

Workforce development initiatives primarily focus on making job seekers “job ready.”  

Given the current unemployment rate, governments and community organizations have 

understandably focused on projects and programs that will create new jobs and ensure that 

workers are available to fill them.  Yet, even in this economy, some jobs go unfilled because 

individuals lack the necessary skills.  Skill gaps could constrain long-term employment growth.  

Indeed, some 88 million Americans have at least one educational barrier, such as no high school 

degree, no postsecondary training, or deficient English language skills.  And, as I noted, longer 

average duration of unemployment may be eroding the skills of the jobless.5 

While broad investments in human capital and workforce development are clearly 

needed, it is not easy to determine how to ensure that those investments are effective and cost-

efficient.  The Federal Reserve System is engaged in ongoing research to identify best practices 

and establish methods for measuring the success of workforce development programs.  For 

example, the System’s Community Affairs function studied various workforce development 

needs and responses as part of its examination of the impact of concentrated poverty on lower-

income individuals.  In its report, The Enduring Challenge of Concentrated Poverty in America, 

published in 2008, findings from 16 case studies confirmed that a skilled labor force is a key 

attraction for other drivers of community success, including lower crime rates, outside 

investment, and access to employment.  As a result, many of the case study communities actively
