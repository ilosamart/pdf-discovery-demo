The Low Level of Global Real Interest Rates 
 
 
 

Remarks by 
 

Stanley Fischer 
 

Vice Chairman 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

Conference to Celebrate Arminio Fraga’s 60 Years 
 

Casa das Garcas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

July 31, 2017 
 



 I am very happy to be participating in this conference celebrating Arminio.  My 

tenure at the International Monetary Fund overlapped with the first two and a half years 

of Arminio’s time as president of the Central Bank of Brazil, and in our capacities at the 

time, we had frequent opportunities to interact and converse.  Of course, I watched with 

admiration the remarkable management of the economy by the Malan-Fraga team in the 

run-up to the election that brought Lula to power.  In particular, Arminio and his Central 

Bank team’s management of the exchange rate--which at one point reached 3.95 reais per 

dollar--was masterly and put in place a sound foundation for that essential part of Brazil’s 

economic machinery in the years that followed.   

Subsequently, as I was on the brink of transitioning to the world of central 

banking early in 2005--that is, prior to taking up my position as governor of the Bank of 

Israel--Arminio was able to turn the tables and offered me some hard-edged advice on 

how to be a central banker.  I have kept that advice close since then.  It comes in the form 

of six commandments on a small laminated piece of paper.  Needless to say, it very much 

reflects his values and his behavior.  Let me quote just three of his rules:  “Number 2.  Do 

[the job] in a way that shows you care, but in a way that shows you will serenely pursue 

your goals”--excellent advice, which is easier said than done; “Number 5.  Beware of a 

tendency to be overly conservative once you start wearing the central bank hat”; and 

“Number 6.  Remember, most people lose half their IQ when they take a job such as this 

one.”   

Now I will turn to the main topic of my discussion, the low level of global real 

interest rates, an important and distinguishing feature of the current global economic 

environment.  In the United States, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds is near all-time

lows, with the same being true in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan 

(figure 1).  Yields have also declined in many emerging markets, with interest rates 

falling almost 400 basis points in Korea since the financial crisis and by a similar amount 

in Israel.  As shown in figure 2, the decline has been less apparent in Brazil and South 

Africa, though interest rates in both countries remain well below previous peaks.  

In this talk, I will address two questions:  Why are interest rates so low?  And why 

has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?1 

Global Real Interest Rates Have Declined 

Lower inflation explains a portion of the decline in nominal interest rates.  

Longer-term interest rates reflect market participants’ expectations of future inflation as 

well as the expected path of real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates.  And while lower 

realized inflation and credible central back inflation targets have likely stabilized 

expected inflation at relatively low levels compared with much of the 20th century, 

inflation-adjusted yields have also notably decreased. 

The decline in interest rates also does not appear to be primarily an outcome of 

the economic cycle.  Longer-term interest rates in the United States have remained low 

even as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the short-term 

federal funds rate by 100 basis points and as the unemployment rate has declined below 

the median of FOMC participants’ assessments of its longer-run normal level.   

Rather, it appears as though much of the decline has occurred in the equilibrium 

level of the real interest rate--also known as the natural rate of interest or, alternatively,

r*.  Knut Wicksell, in his 1898 treatise Interest and Prices, wrote, “There is a certain 

level of the average rate of interest which is such that the general level of prices has no 

tendency to move either upwards or downwards.”2  In recent years, the coincidence of 

low inflation and low interest rates suggests that the natural rate of interest is likely very 

low today. 

Wicksell was clearly referring to the natural rate as the real interest rate when the 

economy is at full employment.  The widely cited methodology of my Federal Reserve 

colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams, attempts to gauge the natural rate in the 

longer run after various shorter-term influences, including the business cycle, have 

played out.  In a recent update of their analysis, they find that the natural rate of interest 

has declined about 150 basis points in the United States since the financial crisis and is 

currently about 50 basis points.  We must remember, however, that r* is a function and 

not a constant, and its estimation is subject to a number of assumptions, the modification 

of which can lead to a wide range of estimates.3 

In an extension of this analysis, shown in figure 3, Laubach, Williams, and 

Kathryn Holston, also a Federal Reserve colleague, show that the decline in the natural 

rate of interest is a common feature across a number of foreign economies.4  The fall in 

                                                 
2 Wicksell’s Interest and Prices, published in German in 1898 as Geldzins und Güterpreise by Gustav 
Fischer (Jena), was first published in English in 1936--see Wicksell (1936). 
3 See Laubach and Williams (2003).  See also Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016) and Johannsen 
and Mertens (2016).  It is important to point out that r* is not an observable variable and that estimates 
generally reflect assumptions about how the economy works and should be modeled.  As such, different 
methodologies or underlying economic models can come up with a wide range of estimates of r*.  Lewis 
and Vazquez-Grande (2017) examine parameter uncertainty and alternative specifications in the estimation 
of the natural rate of interest.  Under some specifications, they find an estimated r* at the end of 2016 of 
close to 2 percent, far higher than the about 0.5 percent reported by the methodology of Holston, Laubach, 
and Williams (forthcoming).

equilibrium interest rates was most pronounced at the time of the financial crisis, but 

rates have shown little tendency to increase during the long recovery from the crisis.  

How Should We Think about the Decline in Equilibrium Interest Rates?  An 

Investment and Savings Framework 

There are many factors that could be holding down interest rates, some of which 

could fade over time, including the effects of quantitative easing in the United States and 

abroad and a heightened demand for safe assets affecting yields on advanced-economy 

government securities.  I will focus on some of the more enduring factors that could 

potentially lower the equilibrium interest for some time. 

In attempting to explain why real interest rates have fallen, a useful starting point 

is to think of the natural interest rate as the price that equilibrates the economy’s supply 

of saving with the demand for investment in the long run, when the economy is at full 

employment.  With this framework in mind, low interest rates reflect factors that increase 

saving, depress investment demand, or both.     

Focusing initially on the United States, I will look at three interrelated factors that 

are likely contributing to low interest rates:  slower trend economic growth, an aging 

population and demographic developments, and relatively weak investment.  I will then 

discuss global developments and spillovers between countries.   

But first I would like to interject a quick word on why we as policymakers might 

be concerned about low interest rates.  I highlight three main worries.  First, as John 

Maynard Keynes discussed in the concluding chapters of The General Theory of 

Employment, Interest and Money, a low equilibrium interest rate increases the risks of 

falling into a liquidity trap, a situation where the nominal interest rate is stuck, by an 


 - 5 - 

effective lower bound, above the rate necessary to bring the economy back to potential.5  

Relatedly, but more broadly, low equilibrium interest rates are a key pillar of the secular 

stagnation hypothesis, which Larry Summers has carried forward during the past few 

years.6  Second, a low natural rate could potentially hurt financial stability if it leads 

investors to reach for yield or hurts financial firms’ profitability.  And, third--and perhaps 

most troubling--a low equilibrium rate sends a powerful signal that the growth potential 

of the economy may be limited.7 

Slow trend growth 

One factor contributing to low equilibrium interest rates in the United States has 

been a slowdown in the pace of potential, or trend, growth.  According to the 

Congressional Budget Office (CBO), real potential growth in the United States is 

currently around 1.5 percent, compared with a pace about double that, on average, in the 

two decades leading up to the financial crisis.  A prime culprit in the growth slowdown 

has been the slow rate of labor productivity growth, which has increased only 1/2 percent, 

on average, over the past five years, compared with a 2 percent growth rate over the 

period from 1976 to 2005.8  A declining rate of labor force growth has also worked to 

push down trend growth.  The CBO is projecting that the potential labor force in the 

                                                 
5 In chapter 23, p. 353, Keynes includes an interesting discussion of the “strange, unduly neglected prophet 
Silvio Gesell (1862-1930), whose work contains flashes of deep insight and who only just failed to reach 
down to the essence of the matter.”  He adds that Gesell was a successful German merchant in Buenos 
Aires.  See Keynes (1936).     
6 See Summers (2014, 2015, 2016).  
7 See Fischer (2016a) for a fuller discussion of the risks associated with a low equilibrium interest rate.  
8 See Irwin (2017) for an examination of an alternative pattern of causality, where slow growth--and, in 
particular, weak wage growth--has led to low productivity growth rather than vice versa.  
     I should also remind the reader of Herbert Stein’s observation that the difference between a growth rate 
of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.

United States will grow at about 1/2 percent per year over the next decade, less than half 

the pace observed, on average, in the two decades before the financial crisis. 

Slower growth can both boost saving and depress investment.  As households 

revise down their expectations for future income growth, they become less likely to 

borrow and more likely to save.  Likewise, slower growth diminishes the number of 

business opportunities that can be profitably undertaken, weighing on investment 

demand. 

Demographics  

The aging of the population can work to lower the equilibrium interest rate 

beyond its effect on the size of the labor force and trend growth.  As households near 

retirement, they tend to save more, anticipating having to run down their savings after 

they leave the labor force.  Federal Reserve economists, in one study, estimate that higher 

saving by near-retirement households could be pushing down the longer-run equilibrium 

federal funds rate relative to its level in the 1980s by as much as 75 basis points.9    

Investment    

Another factor weighing on equilibrium real interest rates has been the recent 

weakness of investment.  What explains the tepid response of capital spending to 

historically low interest rates?  As mentioned earlier, low productivity growth has 

certainly been a contributing factor, as firms see fewer profitable investment 

opportunities.  But elevated uncertainty, both political and economic, has likely also 

played a role.  For one, uncertainty about the outlook for government policy in health 

                                                 
9 See Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016), figure 12, p. 45.

care, regulation, taxes, and trade can cause firms to delay projects until the policy 

environment clarifies.   

Firms also seem quite uncertain about the disruptive capacity of new 

technologies.  Technological developments appear to be rapidly reshaping entire 

industries--in retail, transportation, and communications.  Elevated uncertainty about the 

continued viability of long-standing business models could be weighing on investment 

decisions.  Relatedly, it is possible that as the economy evolves in response to new 

technologies, production is becoming less capital intensive than it was in earlier 

decades.10      

Another possible explanation for the weakness of investment in the United States 

has been a decrease in competition within industries, as evidenced by decreasing firm 

entry and exit rates as well as increased industry concentration.11  Less competition 

allows firms to maintain high profits while lowering the pressure on them to increase 

production to maintain market share. 

In an earlier discussion, I attempted to quantify the effect that these factors--slow 

growth, demographics, and investment--might be having on the long-run equilibrium rate 

in the United States.12  According to simulations from the Board’s FRB/US model, the 

slowdown in growth appears likely to be the primary factor depressing the long-run 

equilibrium rate, although the contributions from demographics and weak investment 

demand were also sizable.

Global Links:  Why Has the Decline in Interest Rates Been So Widespread?   

Up until now, I have looked primarily at factors within the United States.  

However, as I have pointed out earlier, the decline in interest rates is a global 

phenomenon.  Why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread? 

One important reason is that many of the same factors that have been driving 

down the equilibrium interest rate in the United States have operated with equal or even 

greater force in many foreign economies.  The slowdown in labor productivity growth 

has been widespread across many countries.  Likewise, the advanced economies and 

some emerging markets have experienced demographic shifts that are in some cases 

much more pronounced than in the United States, with the working-age population in 

some countries even declining over the past decade.     

Another explanation is that we live in an integrated global economy where 

economic developments in one country spill over into other countries via trade and 

capital flows as well as prices, including interest rates and exchange rates.13  In the most 

general sense, these spillovers are captured in the pattern of current balances, shown in 

figure 4.  If we abstract from a somewhat sizable statistical discrepancy, the sum of 

global current accounts should be equal to zero, as, in the aggregate, one country’s deficit 

must be matched by a surplus in some configuration of other countries--but it is not 

always apparent who is spilling over onto whom.   

Current Account Balances and Global Spillovers 

Prior to the financial crisis, it was widely speculated that foreign developments 

were depressing U.S. interest rates.  Former Chairman Bernanke characterized the foreign 

                                                 
13 See Clarida (2017) for a model-based discussion of global factors and neutral interest rates.

forces acting on U.S. interest rates as the “global saving glut,” with particular reference to 

emerging market economies that were running persistent current account surpluses, 

sometimes as a result of specific policy decisions regarding exchange rates, reserve 

accumulation, and fiscal policy.14  The global saving glut was also a factor in the 

“Greenspan conundrum,” or the observation that a series of Federal Reserve rate hikes 

over the period from 2004 to 2006 seemed to have little effect on longer-term interest 

rates in the United States.  As shown in figure 5, the deterioration of the U.S. deficit in 

the early 2000s was matched by growing surpluses in the emerging markets, particularly 

in emerging Asia and China as well as OPEC.  The explosive growth of the U.S. current 

account deficit from 2001 to 2006, coincident with falling interest rates both in the 

United States and globally, supports the notion that higher foreign saving relative to 

foreign investment was likely holding down U.S. interest rates at the time.   

What can the distribution of global current accounts tell us about international 

spillovers in the post-crisis era?  As shown in figure 6, the most notable development has 

been the almost exact reversal of the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit 

observed during the time of the global saving glut.  Has the global saving glut of the mid-

2000s faded away?  Falling interest rates over the period that the U.S. deficit narrowed 

suggest not.15  If a shrinking supply of foreign saving, the reversal of the global saving 

glut, was behind the narrowing of the U.S. deficit, then the tendency would have been for 

equilibrium real interest rates to have increased.16  Rather, falling equilibrium rates 

                                                 
14 See Bernanke (2005).  
15 While it is unsurprising that interest rates fell sharply during the recession that followed the financial 
crisis, it is less apparent that equilibrium rates should have fallen so sharply or remain so low almost a 
decade later following the cyclical recovery in the United States and many other countries. 
16 See Bernanke (2015) for a discussion of the persistence of the global saving glut.

suggest that falling U.S. demand for foreign savings has precipitated the narrowing of the 

U.S. current account deficit.  U.S. demand likely decreased for the reasons discussed 

earlier, including slowing growth, demographics, and weak investment demand. 

Does the marked narrowing of the U.S. current account deficit post-crisis suggest 

that the United States has been the primary source of downward pressure on global 

interest rates over the past decade?  Certainly, if the United States had maintained its 

previous deficit, interest rates would likely be higher around the world.  However, the 

financial crisis revealed that the U.S. capacity to absorb global savings at the pace 

observed prior to the crisis was unsustainable.17  Rather, an alternative explanation would 

be that the sharp decline in global interest rates post-crisis reflects factors that were likely 

well in train before the financial crisis.  The downward trend in interest rates would have 

been more pronounced earlier in the decade had not elevated, and ultimately 

unsustainable, borrowing in the United States slowed the decline in interest rates in the 

years immediately preceding the crisis.  This narrative is consistent with empirical 

evidence that suggests that the slowdowns in global productivity growth and labor force 

growth, both key factors in the slowing pace of global growth and the downward pressure 

on interest rates, predate the global financial crisis.18 

It is notable in figure 6 that the euro area has also seen a sizable increase in its 

current account position post-crisis, suggesting that developments in Europe have also 

played a role in pushing down interest rates.  The increase in the euro-area current 

                                                 
17 This is not to suggest that the global saving glut was the only factor leading to the financial crisis.  
Rather, excessive risk-taking on the part of U.S. households and financial firms, along with structural 
defects in the structure of regulation and failures in supervision on the part of government regulators, also 
played a role. 
18 See Fernald (2015) and Fernald and others (2017).

account in part reflects sharp reversals in the current account deficits of Greece, Portugal, 

Spain, and Ireland--all countries that had witnessed large increases in their deficits during 

the global saving glut period prior to the crisis, in a pattern similar to that experienced by 

the United States.  However, the euro-area increase also reflects increased surpluses in 

Germany and the Netherlands, countries that were already in considerable surplus during 

the pre-crisis period.           

What, If Anything, Can Be Done about Low Interest Rates? 

Given the potential risks around low interest rates I discussed earlier, including 

the impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy and financial stability concerns, what 

should policymakers do to address the problem?   

Monetary policy has a role to play.  Transparent and sound monetary policy can 

boost confidence in the stability of the growth outlook, an outcome that can in turn 

alleviate precautionary demand for savings and encourage investment, pushing up the 

equilibrium interest rate.   

However, as I have said before--and Ben Bernanke before me--“Monetary policy 

is not a panacea.”19  Also, to repeat myself, policies to boost productivity growth and the 

longer-run potential of the economy are more likely to be found in effective fiscal and 

regulatory measures than in central bank actions.  This statement is true not only in the 

United States, but also around the globe.  But it is not to say that monetary policy is 

irrelevant to the growth rate of the economy. 


                                                 
19 See Bernanke (2012).  Of course, there are no panaceas--except, I have been told by experts, aspirin, and 
perhaps also statins.
