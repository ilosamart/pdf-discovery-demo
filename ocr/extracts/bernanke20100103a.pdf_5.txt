half of 2003, a rate insufficient to halt continued increases in the unemployment rate, 

which peaked above 6 percent in the first half of 2003.3  Second, the FOMC’s policy 

response also reflected concerns about a possible unwelcome decline in inflation.  Taking 

note of the painful experience of Japan, policymakers worried that the United States 

might sink into deflation and that, as one consequence, the FOMC’s target interest rate 

might hit its zero lower bound, limiting the scope for further monetary accommodation.  

FOMC decisions during this period were informed by a strong consensus among 

researchers that, when faced with the risk of hitting the zero lower bound, policymakers 

should lower rates preemptively, thereby reducing the probability of ultimately being 

constrained by the lower bound on the policy interest rate.4 

Evaluating the Tightness or Ease of Monetary Policy 

Although macroeconomic conditions certainly warranted accommodative policies 

in 2002 and subsequent years, the question remains whether policy was nevertheless 

easier than necessary.  Since we cannot know how the economy would have evolved 

under alternative monetary policies, any answer to this question must be conjectural. 

One approach used by many who have addressed this question is to compare 

Federal Reserve policies during this period to the recommendations derived from simple 

policy rules, such as the so-called Taylor rule, developed by John Taylor of Stanford 

University (Taylor, 1993).  This approach is subject to a number of limitations, which are

investment in information technology during the boom.  According to this view, the capital overhang both 
inhibited new capital investment and, by leading to ongoing productivity improvements, also limited the 
need for employers to add workers to meet the relatively moderate increases in final demand that were 
forthcoming.  As noted in the text, geopolitical uncertainties as well as corporate scandals added to the 
uncertainties faced by employers.
