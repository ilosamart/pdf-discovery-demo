grow sharply at the end of 2008 and continued to increase until the end of 2014.  Since 

that time, liabilities relative to GDP have fallen appreciably.  To understand these 

changes, it is useful to focus on a snapshot of the balance sheet at three points in time:  

before the crisis, when the balance sheet was at its largest, and a rough projection for the 

end of this year (table 1).   

In 2006, the dominant liability was currency held by the public, and the dominant 

asset was Treasury securities.  The Fedâ€™s asset purchase programs increased the balance 

sheet from just below 6 percent to nearly 25 percent of GDP by the end of 2014.2  

Balance sheets must balance, of course, and the Fed issued reserves as payment for the 

assets purchased.  This action pushed reserves to nearly 15 percent of GDP.  

The Committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered 

normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with 

conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  Just how large that will be is 

uncertain, because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our 

liabilities.  Current estimates suggest, however, that something in the ballpark of the 

2019:Q4 projected values may be the new normal.  The normalized balance sheet may be 

smaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for 

currency rises with the economy.  In all plausible cases, the balance sheet will be 

considerably larger than before the crisis. 

To understand the differences between the new and old normal, consider the final 

column in the table, which shows the change, measured in percentage points of GDP, 

between 2006:Q4 and the 2019:Q4 projection in the table.  In this estimate, relative to 

                                                 
2 This size is similar to that of the balance sheet relative to GDP in the wake of the Great Depression.
