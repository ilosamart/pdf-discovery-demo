further reinforces the market’s initial belief.  In this sense, the Committee’s reaction 

function for the appropriate quantity of asset purchases under the QE3 program is not 

only evolving over time, it is coevolving along with the market’s beliefs. 

In part for this reason, I believe we are currently in a very good position with 

respect to the market’s expectations for our asset purchases going forward.  Market 

participants now appear to almost uniformly expect that, barring a material change in the 

outlook for the economy, the Committee is likely to continue tapering our purchases in 

further measured steps over the remainder of this year.  With these expectations in place, 

the execution of the taper itself becomes much easier, as we no longer have to worry 

about a step-down at each meeting sending a potentially misleading message about our 

intentions with respect to the future path of the federal funds rate.

The case of QE3 illustrates the point that the Committee’s reaction function is 

shaped by market expectations and vice versa.  But I suspect that the point has more 

general applicability.  Consider the well-known phenomenon of “gradualism” in 

monetary policy, whereby changes to the policy rate during an easing or tightening cycle 

tend to come in a series of small and relatively predictable steps.  This phenomenon is 

reflected in the fact that the Committee’s behavior in normal times can be approximately 

described by an “inertial” version of a Taylor rule--one in which, in addition to putting 

weight on inflation and unemployment, the Committee also behaves as if it has an 

aversion to making sudden large changes in the federal funds rate. 

However, such a reduced-form description of the Committee’s behavior does not 

answer the question of why this kind of inertia might be optimal.  Why should the

 However, any deviation from the pattern of measured steps that the Committee has been taking would 

now likely be seen as a highly informative signal, which is something that the Committee would need to 

take into account in responding to changes in the outlook.
