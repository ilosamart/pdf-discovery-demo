An extended 2015 version of the Monnet contention would take the form: “The 

first step on the road to European union was the creation of the Coal and Steel 

Community in 1951.  At the start, we did not have a road map, but we had the goal of 

ensuring that the countries of Europe would never again go to war, and to that end, we 

had to build an institutional structure that would make another European war impossible.  

From time to time we encountered obstacles in that process.  These obstacles often led to 

crises, but the crises were overcome, and from each crisis, the prospects for a united, 

prosperous, and peaceful Europe emerged stronger.  And that is what will happen this 

time too.” 

This leaves us with three questions:  Has modern Europe developed primarily 

through crises?  Will it be stronger when this crisis is over?  And what challenges or 

crises is Europe likely to have to deal with in future?  Despite the fact that political and 

economic aspects of the structure of the European economy have inherently been closely 

intertwined throughout history--and saying this, one thinks of the Romans and later of 

Charlemagne--I will focus on the economic aspects of the European project, and 

primarily on its monetary and financial aspects.6  

Intra-European monetary and exchange rate problems have for centuries 

bedeviled European countries and intra-European trade, and led to the desire for greater 

exchange rate stability--perhaps through some form of treaty or agreement, or even 

through a monetary union.  Of course, the desire for greater exchange rate stability is true 

spoke to Jean-Claude recently to check that this is what he said in 2011.  He replied that he had, but that he 
doubted that he had said “we have been slow,” since he generally states “we have been bold.”
