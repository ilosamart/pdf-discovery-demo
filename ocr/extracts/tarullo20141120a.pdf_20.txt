sanctions, but instead given an opportunity to come back into compliance in a way that does not 

expose either the firm or the system to greater stress.   

Finally, the very progress made in regulating liquidity at large firms may raise a new set 

of regulatory arbitrage problems.  Short-term wholesale funding markets are generally smaller 

today than before the crisis, the average maturity of short-term funding arrangements is 

moderately greater, and collateral haircuts are more conservative.  Yet volumes are still large 

relative to the size of the financial system.  Furthermore, some of the factors that account for the 

reduction in short-term wholesale funding volumes, such as the unusually flat yield curve 

environment and lingering risk aversion from the crisis, are likely to prove transitory.  And, 

while prudentially regulated dealers will continue to play a central role as intermediaries in short-

term funding markets, post-crisis reforms directed at the regulated sector could lead to the 

disintermediation of regulated entities over time.  Financial, technological, and regulatory 

barriers to disintermediation of regulated financial firms could likely be overcome with time and 

sufficient economic incentive.   

During normal times, short-term wholesale funding can help to satisfy investor demand 

for safe and liquid investments, lower funding costs for borrowers, and support the functioning 

of important markets, including those in which monetary policy is executed.  But during periods 

of stress, runs by providers of short-term wholesale funding and associated asset liquidations can 

result in large fire-sale externalities and otherwise undermine financial stability.  To the extent 

that disintermediation of prudentially regulated firms occurs, there will be a need to supplement 

prudential bank regulation with policy options that can be applied on a market-wide basis, such 

as a framework of minimum margin requirements for securities financing transactions.  Last 

month, the Financial Stability Board finalized minimum margin requirements for non-centrally-
