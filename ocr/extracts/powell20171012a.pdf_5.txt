bars) was the largest contributor to the slowdown in flows.  The decline in economic 

growth differentials between the EMEs and advanced economies (the yellow portions) 

was also a major contributor.  In fact, growth differentials became a slightly negative 

contributor in 2015 after being substantially positive in 2010.4  Monetary policies (the 

blue portions) also became less of a factor in 2015 in driving flows to EMEs.   

As for the recent rebound in flows, over the past year the modelâ€™s predicted net 

inflows (the dashed line) have actually been significantly above actual net inflows (the 

solid line), suggesting that there is some room for flows to increase further without 

raising concerns.  The model attributes the recovery of flows primarily to the turnaround 

in commodity prices and, to a substantially lesser extent, to improvements in risk 

sentiment (as seen by some waning of the negative contribution from the slashed green 

bars).  The growth differential is not playing a major role because the rise in EME growth 

has been accompanied by a rise in advanced-economy growth.5   

All in all, this evidence suggests that the recent pickup of capital flows to EMEs 

has not outrun its fundamental determinants, which provides some encouragement that 

these flows will not reverse themselves and endanger EME prospects, a situation that is 

also encouraging for U.S. prospects.   

                                                 
4 This negative contribution reflects that the average growth differential between the selected group of 
EMEs, which does not include China, and the advanced economies itself became negative.  
5 Variants of the model applied to gross capital inflows, rather than net capital inflows, give qualitatively 
similar results.  In particular, the model of gross flows also finds that the pickup in these flows has been 
less strong than predicted by the model.  However, the relative contribution of the risk variables to the 
pickup in EME flows relative to the turnaround in commodity prices is somewhat larger with the gross 
flows model than the net inflows model.  The consequences of net versus gross flows for the recipient 
economies can potentially differ as, for example, Cavallo and others (2015) have argued.
