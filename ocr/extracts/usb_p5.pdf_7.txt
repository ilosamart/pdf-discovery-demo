Asset Maintenance
Examination Procedures
Effective date July 1997 Section 5020.3

The following procedures will determine if the
branch under examination has established satis-
factory periodic reporting, operating standards,
and audit procedures regarding asset mainte-
nance. Examiner discretion is required in apply-
ing these procedures.

1. Review applicable statutes, regulations,
and/or supervisory requirements for asset
maintenance.

2. Test compliance with policies, practices,
procedures, and internal controls for appro-
priate asset maintenance monitoring.

3. Obtain the most recent asset maintenance
report filed with the regulators and deter-
mine its accuracy. If necessary, review pre-
vious submissions to determine any trends
in reporting errors.

4. Verify that eligible assets, as included in the
filed reports, are correct. Ensure that, in
addition to credits, categories such as due
from related parties, securities, fixed assets,
and other assets have been appropriately
adjusted.

5. Test check the asset maintenance computa-
tion for accuracy with statutory and super-
visory requirements. Ensure that liabilities
requiring cover have been appropriately
adjusted.

6. Review assets considered ineligible by the
branch for appropriateness and compliance
with laws, regulations, and supervisory
requirements.

7. Determine that assets purchased by the
branch are properly reflected at fair market
value. While fair market value may be
difficult to determine, it should, at a mini-
mum, reflect both the rate of return being
earned on such assets and an appropriate
risk premium. Determine that appropriate
write-offs are taken on any assets sold by
the branch at less than book value.

8. Review credits acquired from another lend-
ing institution as a result of a purchase,
participation, or asset swap since the previ-
ous examination, to determine that the

branch has appropriate agreements evidenc-
ing the acquisition and credit documentation.

9. Review credit classifications for appropriate
inclusion in asset maintenance reports.

10. Review credits that have been classified
and/or are considered as problems by man-
agement. If credits have been internally
classified, test whether they and their asso-
ciated accrued interest receivable have been
appropriately removed from eligible assets.

11. Determine whether any of the loans trans-
ferred were nonperforming at the time of
transfer, classified at the previous examina-
tion, or, for any other reason, were consid-
ered to be of questionable quality.

12. Scan the delinquency lists submitted to the
head office to determine that reports are
sufficiently detailed to evaluate risk factors
that could possibly identify credits that
might be considered Ineligible By Examiner.

13. Compile a listing of all loans not supported
by current and satisfactory credit informa-
tion, collateral documentation, and evi-
dences of indebtedness.

14. Ascertain whether loans are purchased on a
recourse basis and are sold on a nonrecourse
basis.

15. Verify that asset maintenance monitoring
and reports filed with appropriate regulators
are reviewed for compliance by branch
management and that internal controls are
adequate.

16. Organize and prepare a listing of violations
of asset maintenance laws, regulations, and
supervisory requirements.

17. Prepare the following examination report
pages:
• Ineligible Assets
• Asset Maintenance and Pledge Schedule

18. Prepare comments for the Compliance and
Violation of Laws and Regulations pages, if
necessary.

19. Prepare a complete set of workpapers to
support conclusions and examination report
pages and discuss all material findings with
management.
