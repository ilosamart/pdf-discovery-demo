economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high 

level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy. 

Inflation also was lower than expected, with headline PCE prices rising less than 

1 percent over the course of 2015, instead of around 1-3/4 percent as we had anticipated 

in June 2014.  Much of this shortfall reflected the effects of falling oil prices and the 

appreciation of the dollar.  My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on 

inflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be 

transitory.  However, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline 

in inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already 

been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time.10  These various 

considerations, along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions--which I 

will discuss shortly--explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the 

federal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015, substantially less than the full 

percentage point increase suggested by the median projection of FOMC participants 

reported in June 2014. 

2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to 

proceed cautiously.  During the first half of the year, mixed readings on the job market, 

along with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth, suggested again that 

progress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing 

markedly.  Meanwhile, inflation hovered just below 1 percent as dollar appreciation 

continued to exert downward pressure on import prices, and financial market turbulence 

emanating from abroad--associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the 

                                                 
10 These concerns were reinforced somewhat by a decline in market-based measures of inflation 
compensation.
