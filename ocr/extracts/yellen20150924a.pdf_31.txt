prices should fall about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in both quarters.38  Food prices are 

assumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined 

contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median 

difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation.  Finally, 

nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain 

unchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to 

remain constant at 2 percent.   

After computing historical 𝜖𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, 

the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter-factual 

simulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4.  One by one, each explanatory 

variable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference 

between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that 

particular factor.  Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation 

term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding 

period, rather than its actual value.  As a result, the decompositions incorporate the 

effects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the 

explanatory variables. 

                                                 
38 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest 

downward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if 

one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate.  If the post-2001 pattern persists 

in coming years, then 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE 
inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains 

close to 5 percent (the CBO estimate of the natural rate) and there are no further shocks to the exchange 

rate and other factors.  If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to 

consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with 

inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than 5 percent.
