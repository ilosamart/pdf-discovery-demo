monetary accommodation.  For there to be any meaningful tradeoff, there would have to 

be some sort of asymmetry in the unwinding of these risk premiums, whereby the 

eventual reversal either happens more abruptly, or causes larger economic effects, than 

the initial compression.  Said a little differently, if an easing of Federal Reserve policy 

puts downward pressure on term premiums and credit spreads, and if this downward 

pressure is only gradually reversed as policy begins to tighten, then what is the problem?   

The nice feature of the model is that it speaks to this asymmetry.  That is, it 

features a gradual compression of risk spreads during a period of monetary ease, and 

then, when policy begins to tighten, it delivers a sharp and abrupt correction, driven by a 

particular form of market dynamics.   

Of course, this is just a theoretical prediction.  One thing that the paper does not 

do, but which would be very helpful in assessing the real-world relevance of the model, 

would be to see if this sort of asymmetry in bond returns is present in the data.  In 

particular, if I am interpreting the model correctly, it implies a specific form of 

conditional volatility and skewness in bond returns.  For example, when term premiums 

are unusually low relative to historical norms, the model suggests an elevated probability 

of a sharp upward spike in rates.  I don’t know of any evidence that bears on this 

hypothesis in the bond market, though an analogous pattern does appear in stock market 

returns.

 See Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001).  They document that, consistent with a “bubble popping” view, stock 

returns are more negatively skewed when past returns have been positive and when valuation ratios (for 

example, market-to-book ratios) are high.  Alternatively, the ratio of downside to upside volatility is 

unusually high in such circumstances.
