of a uniform servicer scorecard.  To be meaningful, the ability to transfer servicing from 

low-performing servicers to high-performing ones would have to be enhanced.  The 

creation of common back-office systems across servicers would make transfer less prone 

to error and less costly, and any contractual or legal barriers would need to be reduced to 

allow investors to “fire” a low-performing servicer.  A new contractual regime designed 

along these lines would represent a significant change from the existing world of 

servicing, but it could help create a system in which servicers compete on the quality of 

their performance and are more accountable to both investors and consumers. 

Representations and Warranties 

I turn next to the problem of representations and warranties contained in the 

PSAs.  Underwriting standards declined dramatically in the middle part of the previous 

decade as the housing bubble approached its peak.  For example, the median combined 

loan-to-value ratio on subprime mortgages originated for home purchases rose from 

90 percent in 2003 to 100 percent in 2005--meaning that more than one-half of borrowers 

who purchased homes with subprime mortgages put no money down.  The share of 

mortgages in which borrowers did not document fully their income or assets also 

increased.  In addition, the number of mortgages that defaulted in the first year after 

origination--commonly considered a gauge of poor underwriting--rose appreciably as the 

bubble approached its peak.

The “originate to distribute” model of loan origination may have contributed to 

this decline in underwriting standards.  Under this model, brokers or lenders sell the loan 

to a third party, typically a securitizer, who then issues securities collateralized by
