Banking and Currency--that America needed a central bank.  Our unique structure with 

the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks scattered around the 

country reflected a years-long struggle to balance a variety of competing interests:  

farmers in the heartlands and financiers on Wall Street; populists and federalists; and 

creditors and debtors.  Our central bank and its policy committee importantly reflect the 

deal the Fed’s founders struck to resolve those competing interests and create an 

institution representing America’s economic and geographic diversity.10 

I should add that I find the regional balance created by the membership of the 

FOMC to be a valuable feature of its structure.  In the first round of policymaker 

discussion at a typical FOMC meeting, most of the presidents of the Reserve Banks start 

their presentations with a description of economic developments in their Federal Reserve 

District.11  From these presentations, one understands what a massive and diverse 

economy the United States is and why the politicians who established the Fed were right 

to require its decisions to be made by a committee. 

Robust Rules for Monetary Policy 

I turn now to economic models and monetary policy rules.  I recently gave a 

lecture at the University of Warwick entitled “I’d Rather Have Bob Solow Than an 

Econometric Model, But . . . ,” with the punch line quote from Paul Samuelson saved for 

the end:  “I’d rather have Bob Solow than an econometric model, but I would rather have 

Bob Solow with an econometric model than without one.”12  To summarize, the speech 

                                                 
10 In addition, in more recent times, the Federal Reserve System has placed greater emphasis on other 
aspects of diversity. 
11 While only a subset of Reserve Bank presidents vote at any given FOMC meeting, all of them offer their 
views in our discussions of the economy and of monetary policy.
