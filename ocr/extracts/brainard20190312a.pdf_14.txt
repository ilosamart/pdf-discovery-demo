data should be very helpful when they become available.  Separately, the data collected 

under the CRA on community development loans are not adequate to support the analysis

Collecting data and developing clear metrics will provide the improved clarity 

and ex ante predictability that banks seek.  More and better data will allow for more 

meaningful metrics by which we can evaluate performance criteria, such as the borrower 

and geographic distribution of lending and how a bank’s performance compares with 

other similarly situated banks.  We may also consider providing more baseline 

information that describes a bank’s performance context, such as the demographic and 

economic information that helps to describe the credit needs and opportunities present in 

each assessment area.  In addition, there may be ways to more effectively incorporate 

community engagement into the process--for example, by having the banking agencies 

develop a joint community contacts database to facilitate access to information from local 

community stakeholders. 

Conclusion 

Overall, I have been impressed with the number of organizations that took the 

time to comment on the OCC’s ANPR to and attend the Federal Reserve’s outreach 

meetings.  It is encouraging to see the high level of commitment to the CRA from banks 

and community organizations alike.  As we think about the path forward, it is important 

that we retain the CRA’s core focus on place while improving upon the regulation’s 

flexibility in order to provide meaningful CRA evaluations of banks that largely deliver
