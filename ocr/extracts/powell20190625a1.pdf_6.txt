Last week, my FOMC colleagues and I held our regular meeting to assess the 

stance of monetary policy.  We did not change the setting for our main policy tool, the 

target range for the federal funds rate, but we did make significant changes in our policy 

statement.  Since the beginning of the year, we had been taking a patient stance toward 

assessing the need for any policy change.  We now state that the Committee will closely 

monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as 

appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its 

symmetric 2 percent objective.   

The question my colleagues and I are grappling with is whether these 

uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy 

accommodation.  Many FOMC participants judge that the case for somewhat more 

accommodative policy has strengthened.  But we are also mindful that monetary policy 

should not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment.  Doing 

so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.  We will closely monitor the 

implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as 

appropriate to sustain the expansion.
