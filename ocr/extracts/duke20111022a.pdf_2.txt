Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be here in my hometown of Virginia Beach and to 

welcome all of you to Financial Planning Day.  I am proud to see our city recognizes that helping 

families plan for a more secure financial future is good for citizens and, at the same time, it 

makes the economic base of the entire city stronger.  I am also pleased, and more than a little 

impressed, to see so many of you taking time out of your busy lives to focus on this important 

topic.  I hope you find, as I have, that the time you invest in this endeavor yields a lifetime of 

personal and financial dividends.  Knowledge is power, and I submit that financial knowledge is 

also security. 

Importance of Financial Planning to the Federal Reserve 

You might wonder why a Federal Reserve Board Governor was invited to speak about 

individual household financial planning.  That’s a fair question given that the Federal Reserve 

System’s structure was designed by Congress to give it a broad perspective on the U.S. economy.  

Most of the Fed’s actions are indeed focused on the whole economy.  But the relationship 

between your personal financial interests and the interests of the national economy is more 

closely aligned than you might think.  Let me explain. 

There is, in fact, a direct relationship between household financial stability and the 

stability of the U.S. economy.  As building blocks of the economy, the financial health of each 

household contributes to the financial health of the country as a whole.  Thus, the Federal 

Reserve has an inherent interest in the financial stability and strength of individual households, 

whose spending, saving, and investing significantly impact economic growth.  Financially stable 

families also make the economy run more smoothly as these families face less economic risk and 

have more economic mobility.  Ultimately, financially secure households are the backbone of a 

strong domestic economy.
