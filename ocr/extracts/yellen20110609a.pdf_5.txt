real net worth of about 19 percent over the 2007-09 period.  For some homeowners, the 

loss in net worth was much larger; indeed, nearly one-fourth of homeowners saw their net 

worth drop by 50 percent or more.4 

 House prices have continued to decline, on net, since 2009, and at this time, more 

than one-fourth of mortgage borrowers are underwater--that is, have mortgage balances 

that exceed the current values of their homes.  Because of their negative equity stake, 

many households cannot take advantage of lower interest rates by refinancing their 

mortgages, nor can they easily sell their homes to pursue better job opportunities 

elsewhere.  In addition, borrowers who are underwater--especially those who also 

experience a job loss or a cut in work hours or wages--are more likely to default on their 

mortgages and possibly face foreclosure. 

 One consequence of the weak demand for housing and the sky-high rate of 

foreclosures has been a significant drop in the homeownership rate.  After fluctuating in a 

fairly narrow range around 64 percent for nearly three decades, the homeownership rate 

rose significantly between 1994 and 2004, reaching a peak of 69 percent.  Since then, 

however, the homeownership rate has retraced about half of its earlier increase as many 

former homeowners have moved into rental housing or made other living arrangements, 

such as moving in with family members. 

 Are there any bright spots in this gloomy picture?  As the macroeconomy has 

begun to improve, albeit at an uneven rate, the share of homeowners becoming newly
