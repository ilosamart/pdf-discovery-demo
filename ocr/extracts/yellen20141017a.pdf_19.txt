almost 30 percent of the next 45 percent and 12 percent of the bottom 50.  Inheritances 

are concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution but less so than total wealth.  Just 

over half of the total value of inheritances went to the top 5 percent and 40 percent went 

to households in the next 45.  Seven percent of inheritances were shared among 

households in the bottom 50 percent, a group that together held only 1 percent of all 

wealth in 2013.43   

The average inheritance reported by those in the top 5 percent who had received 

them was $1.1 million.  That amount dwarfs the $183,000 average among the next 

45 percent and the $68,000 reported among the bottom half of households.  But compared 

with the typical wealth of these households, the additive effect of bequests of this size is 

significant for the millions of households below the top 5 that receive them.  

The average age for receiving an inheritance is 40, when many parents are trying 

to save for and secure the opportunities of higher education for their children, move up to 

a larger home or one in a better neighborhood, launch a business, switch careers, or 

perhaps relocate to seek more opportunity. Considering the overall picture of limited 

resources for most families that I have described today, I think the effects of inheritances 

for the sizable minority below the top that receive one are likely a significant source of 

economic opportunity.  

Conclusion 

 In closing, let me say that, with these examples, I have only just touched the 

surface of the important topic of economic opportunity, and I look forward to learning 

                                                 
43 Reported inheritances can have been received at any point in the respondentâ€™s life.  As with other forms 

of wealth cited in these remarks, inheritances have been adjusted for inflation and are expressed in 2013 

dollars.
