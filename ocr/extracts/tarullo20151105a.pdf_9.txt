developments, as well as what remains to be done, it is also useful to begin by recalling the 

situation that prevailed at the onset of the financial crisis.  

In its early years, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s work focused on 

elaborating the responsibilities of home and host regulators of internationally active banks.  The 

principle of consolidated supervision was developed in the early 1980s, and reinforced following 

the failure of the BCCI in the early 1990s, in an effort to ensure that some regulatory authority 

had an overview of a global bank’s consolidated assets and liabilities.  At the same time, though, 

the Basel Committee set out expectations for host country prudential oversight of foreign banks 

that would be similar to that for domestic banks.4   

The financial crisis painfully demonstrated the inadequacy of both home and host country 

regulation.  Home country regulators of some large, internationally active banks clearly did not 

appreciate the risks those firms were assuming overseas.  Host country regulators, including 

those in the United States, had not exercised prudential oversight of some foreign bank activities 

and had not sufficiently appreciated the risks associated with the funding models and other 

activities of some foreign banks that were subject to consolidated prudential regulation.  And 

there were indeed instances of international bank failures in which the home country authorities 

seemed to focus on domestic interests to the possible detriment of the interests of host countries.5  

Of course, regulatory failures were far more pervasive than inattention to the specifically 

cross-border activities of banks.  The substantive rules governing capital and other requirements 

for all banks were woefully inadequate, although the fact that most very large banks around the
