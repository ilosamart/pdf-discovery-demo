IV. Concluding Remarks  

To summarize and conclude, the Fedâ€™s statutory objectives are defined by its dual 

mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability in the U.S. 

economy.  But the U.S. economy and the economies of the rest of the world have 

important feedback effects on each other.  To make coherent policy choices, we have to 

take these feedback effects into account.  The most important contribution that U.S. 

policymakers can make to the health of the world economy is to keep our own house in 

order--and the same goes for all countries.  Because the dollar is the primary international 

currency, we have, in the past, had to take action--particularly in times of global 

economic crisis--to maintain order in international capital markets, such as the central 

bank liquidity swap lines extended during the global financial crisis.  In that case, we 

were acting in accordance with our dual mandate, in the interest of the U.S. economy, by 

taking actions that also benefit the world economy.  Going forward, we will continue to 

be guided by those same principles.
