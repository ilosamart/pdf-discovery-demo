 Good Morning.  On behalf of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System, I’d like to welcome everyone to the last of our series of public hearings held to 

discuss changes to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).  The knowledge and 

feedback we have gained from these hearings will help us to assess the adequacy of 

current mortgage data, examine the need for additional data, and explore possible 

changes to Regulation C, which implements HMDA.  I’d like to thank our colleagues at 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, San Francisco, and Chicago for hosting the first 

three hearings. 

 Our series of hearings kicked off just as Congress passed regulatory reform 

legislation earlier this summer.  The Dodd-Frank Act provides for some changes to 

HMDA data collection and submission, and we look forward to hearing from our 

panelists and members of the public about the implementation of these changes.  The new 

law also transfers authority for HMDA rulemaking from the Board of Governors to the 

new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  All information gleaned from these 

hearings will inform our own work for the time that we continue to have rulewriting 

authority.  When that authority transfers to the CFPB, be assured that we will hand over 

the most current thinking about changes to Regulation C. 

 Over the course of these hearings, we have heard from key players in the home 

mortgage market:  lenders and other market participants, academics and researchers, 

consumer advocacy and community development organizations, data experts, regulators, 

and other public officials.  Although they play different roles, we believe that all share a 

common goal:  To ensure that the mortgage market is responsible, transparent, efficient, 

and serves the needs of consumers and market participants alike.
