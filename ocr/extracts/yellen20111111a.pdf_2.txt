Let me begin by thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for inviting me to 

participate in this important conference on the role of central banks in financial stability.  

As you know, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

(Dodd-Frank Act) assigned the Federal Reserve a central role in the new framework for 

achieving and maintaining financial stability.  I am grateful for this opportunity to explain 

how we, together with other regulators, have been moving forward to fulfill our new 

responsibilities.1   

The Dodd-Frank Act instituted substantial changes to financial-sector supervision 

and regulation in the United States in direct response to the serious deficiencies in the 

regulatory framework that were revealed, all too painfully, by the financial crisis and the 

associated deep recession.  One key change was the requirement that U.S. financial 

regulators take a “macroprudential approach” to supervision and regulation.  In my 

remarks today, I want to describe how this approach is being put into practice at the 

Federal Reserve.  I will touch on both our own regulatory and supervisory responsibilities 

and our responsibilities as a member of the multiagency Financial Stability Oversight 

Council (FSOC), which the Dodd-Frank Act established to promote a more 

comprehensive approach to monitoring and mitigating systemic risk.  

I should note that an important part of putting the macroprudential approach into 

practice is establishing a new regulatory infrastructure, including the FSOC and its 

working-committee structure.  In addition, individual regulatory agencies have made 

organizational changes needed to fulfill their new responsibilities.  At the Federal 

Reserve, we have reoriented our supervision of large bank holding companies, and we 

                                                 
1 I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff members Rochelle Edge, Andrea Kusko, Andrew Levin, and 
Nellie Liang for their assistance in preparing these remarks, which reflect my own views and not 
necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.
