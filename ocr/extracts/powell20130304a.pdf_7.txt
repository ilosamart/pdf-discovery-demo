so that bankruptcy may be a viable resolution strategy for large institutions.    These plans will 

also support development of the FDIC’s backup resolution plans under OLA (Title II plans).   

The resolution plan process is iterative by design.  There is still much work to be done by 

firms, domestic and foreign regulators, and national governments.  We remain committed to 

ensuring that this work is done quickly but responsibly in the coming years. 

That brings us to the question of special resolution regimes.  In October 2011, 

immediately before I was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board, I helped design a public 

simulation of the failure of a large financial institution under OLA.  The cast included former 

senior government officials as well as leading experts from the private sector.  The FDIC, the 

Federal Reserve, and the industry offered their assistance as we developed the simulation. 

From the outset, my earlier experience had led me to be skeptical about the possibility of 

resolving one of the largest financial companies without destabilizing the financial system.  

Today’s global financial institutions are of staggering size and complexity.  I believed that an 

attempt to resolve one of these firms--a firm with multiple business lines carried out through 

countless legal entities, across many jurisdictions and different legal systems--could easily spin 

out of control.  The result could be greatly increased uncertainty for creditors and counterparties, 

which could trigger or accelerate a run on the failed institution that could quickly spread and 

destabilize the whole system. 

As we developed the simulation, however, I came around to the view that it is possible to 

resolve a large, global financial institution.  What changed my mind was the FDIC’s innovative 

“single-point-of-entry” approach, which was just coming into focus in 2011.  This approach is a 

classic simplifier, making theoretically possible something that seemed impossibly complex.
