January, though it remains below the levels it reached in August of last year and in 2011, 

and it last week declined below its average value since the start of the year.  The large 

movements in asset prices likely reflect increased concern about the global outlook, 

particularly ongoing developments in China and the effects of the declines in the prices of 

oil and other commodities on commodity-exporting nations.  Asset price declines may 

also reflect a reassessment of the prospects for growth in Europe and Japan, and perhaps 

also a recognition that U.S. gross domestic product and productivity growth have 

remained stubbornly low.    

If the recent financial market developments lead to a sustained tightening of 

financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global economy that could affect 

growth and inflation in the United States.  But we have seen similar periods of volatility 

in recent years--including in the second half of 2011--that have left little visible imprint 

on the economy, and it is still early to judge the ramifications of the increased market 

volatility of the first seven weeks of 2016.  As Chair Yellen said in her testimony to the 

Congress two weeks ago, while “global financial developments could produce a slowing 

in the economy, I think we want to be careful not to jump to a premature conclusion 

about what is in store for the U.S. economy.”  Of course, the FOMC is closely monitoring 

global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the 

labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook. 

Now, with our next FOMC meeting just three weeks away, I expect most of you 

are less interested in what we did at our previous meetings, and more interested in what 

we are going to do at the next one.  I can’t answer that question because, as I have 

emphasized in the past, we simply do not know. The world is an uncertain place--
