channels for reform initiatives will enhance systemic stability.  

Managing Tradeoffs between Reducing Systemic Risk and Increasing Costs:  

OTC Derivatives Market Reforms  

In addition to the banking reforms I just discussed, the G-20 also committed to 

reduce risk in OTC derivatives markets by enacting reforms to improve transparency and 

decrease counterparty exposures among market participants.  These policies must be 

considered carefully, as they are apt to increase the cost of financial intermediation and 

that of hedging risk.  To illustrate the tradeoffs policymakers and regulators must manage 

when crafting such policies, Iâ€™ll next discuss in some detail a set of initiatives currently 

being implemented by prudential, market, and systemic risk regulators around the world 

to address weaknesses in OTC derivatives markets.  

An OTC derivative is a privately negotiated contract between a pair of 

counterparties to exchange future cash flows that depend on the performance of an 

underlying asset or benchmark index.  Unlike an immediate purchase or sale of assets, 

OTC derivatives require one or both sides of the transaction to make payments in the 

future.  Counterparty risk is therefore a key element of OTC derivatives transactions.  

The scale and significance of counterparty risks in the OTC derivatives markets are large 

and, as we saw, can have economy-wide implications.  The prudent management, 

regulation, and oversight of these risks are critical to ensuring that derivatives markets 

serve to diversify, rather than exacerbate, systemic risk. 

Significant problems with the functioning, regulation, and oversight of derivatives 

markets became apparent during the financial crisis.  These problems are perhaps best 

exemplified by the widespread effects of large losses by American International Group,
