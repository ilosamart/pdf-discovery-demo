response to a severe financial panic, the Panic of 1907.  This panic led to the creation of 

the National Monetary Commission, whose 1911 report was a major impetus to the 

Federal Reserve Act, signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 

1913.  Because the Panic of 1907 fit the archetype of a classic financial panic in many 

ways, it’s worth discussing its similarities and differences with the recent crisis.3 

Like many other financial panics, including the most recent one, the Panic of 

1907 took place while the economy was weakening; according to the National Bureau of 

Economic Research, a recession had begun in May 1907.4  Also, as was characteristic of 

pre-Federal Reserve panics, money markets were tight when the panic struck in October, 

reflecting the strong seasonal demand for credit associated with the harvesting and 

shipment of crops.  The immediate trigger of the panic was a failed effort by a group of 

speculators to corner the stock of the United Copper Company.  The main perpetrators of 

the failed scheme, F. Augustus Heinze and C.F. Morse, had extensive connections with a 

number of leading financial institutions in New York City.  When the news of the failed 

speculation broke, depositor fears about the health of those institutions led to a series of 

runs on banks, including a bank at which Heinze served as president.  To try to restore 

confidence, the New York Clearinghouse, a private consortium of banks, reviewed the 

books of the banks under pressure, declared them solvent, and offered conditional

Crises under the National Banking System, National Monetary Commission (Washington:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office), and, with a focus on its monetary consequences, Milton Friedman and Anna 
Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton 
University Press).  An accessible discussion of the episode, from which this speech draws heavily, can be 
found in Jon R. Moen and Ellis W. Tallman (1990), “Lessons from the Panic of 1907,” Federal Reserve
