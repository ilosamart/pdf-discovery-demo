  Meanwhile, Swiss authorities have explicitly prioritized

Here in the United States, Congress included in the Dodd-Frank Act a number of changes 

directed at the financial stability risk posed by foreign banks.  Sections 165 and 166 instruct the 

Federal Reserve to implement enhanced prudential standards for large foreign banks as well as 

for large domestic BHCs and nonbank systemically important financial institutions.  Dodd-Frank 

also bolstered capital requirements for FHCs, including foreign FHCs, by extending the well-

capitalized and well-managed requirements beyond U.S. bank subsidiaries to the top-tier holding 

company.   

In addition, the so-called Collins Amendment in Dodd-Frank removed the exemption 

from BHC capital requirements granted by the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation 

Letter 01-01.

  The required phase-out of SR 01-01 was clearly intended to strengthen the 

capital regime applied to the U.S. operations of foreign banks; however, the organizational 

flexibility that the amendment gave to foreign banks in the United States has allowed some large 

foreign banks to restructure their U.S. operations  to minimize the impact of this regulatory 

change.  As a result, in the absence of additional structural requirements for foreign banks in the 

United States, the effectiveness of our capital regime for large foreign banks with both bank and 

nonbank operations in the United States depends on the foreign bank’s own organizational 

choices.
