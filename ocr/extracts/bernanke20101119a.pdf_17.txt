system would provide more effective checks on the tendency for countries to run large 

and persistent external imbalances, whether surpluses or deficits.  Changes to accomplish

collective responsibility for bringing about the rebalancing required to preserve global 

economic stability and prosperity.  I hope that policymakers in all countries can work 

together cooperatively to achieve a stronger, more sustainable, and more balanced global 

economy.
