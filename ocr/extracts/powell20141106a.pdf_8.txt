The Road Ahead:  Meeting the Challenges 

As you can see, central clearing represents the confluence of critical market 

infrastructure and systemic financial institutions.  As a result, the regulation and 

supervision of CCPs present particular challenges.  What matters most is the stability of 

the entire system, not that of one sector or another.  In the United States, CCPs are 

primarily regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the 

Securities and Exchange Commission.  Under authority provided by the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve also plays 

a role in supervising and regulating systemically important CCPs and other financial 

market utilities.7  In addition, the Federal Reserve is the holding company supervisor of a 

number of the largest clearing members.  The challenge is to ensure that regulation and 

supervision take into account the broad implications of derivatives trading for CCPs, their 

members, and the broader financial system.  Close collaboration between regulators--both 

domestically and internationally--will be necessary to ensure that central clearing can 

promote the kind of financial system resiliency that will be required when another severe 

crisis threatens.   

While central clearing and CCPs do present a number of complex and unique 

challenges, these challenges are not insurmountable.  Several measures should be 

considered in the near term to further strengthen the market and regulatory infrastructure

of the Dodd-Frank Act.
