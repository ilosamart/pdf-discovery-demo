While I think this model of concentric circles generally holds true for banks of all 

sizes, the complexity of the largest institutions requires far more complex inner circles.  

Arguably, the financial crisis revealed that at many of the largest firms, the sophistication 

of these banksâ€™ governance, controls, and risk management did not keep pace with the 

rapid growth of risk.  Moreover, because the potential cost of a breakdown at the largest 

firms includes losses that are external to the financial institution, it is essential that a 

strong outer circle of effective supervision be in place as an extra buffer to insulate other 

firms and taxpayers from systemic risk.  I would suggest that the outer circle that is 

necessary at a systemically important bank should be far more layered than what is 

needed at a small community bank.    

Community Bank Supervision at the Federal Reserve 

One way we at the Federal Reserve are working to ensure that our supervisory 

program is properly tailored to the wide array of institutions we supervise is to review 

policies that are under development with an eye toward considering the effect that these 

policies might have on smaller institutions.  In this regard, along with my colleague 

Governor Betsy Duke, I serve on a subcommittee of the Board that oversees the 

supervision of community and small regional banking organizations.  Among other 

things, we consider not only whether specific policies are appropriate for community 

banks, but also whether these policies could have the effect of reducing the availability of 

credit to sound borrowers.  We are actively involved in providing greater clarity and 

specificity regarding the applicability of supervisory policies to community banks.  One 

of the things that I try to do whenever I review policies is to draw on my experience of 

working with community banks in Maryland and think about the effects these policies are
