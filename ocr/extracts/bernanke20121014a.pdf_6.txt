economies from the global financial crisis, even as the advanced economies remained 

weak, provided still greater encouragement to these flows.  Another important 

determinant of capital flows is the appetite for risk by global investors.  Over the past few 

years, swings in investor sentiment between “risk-on” and “risk-off,” often in response to 

developments in Europe, have led to corresponding swings in capital flows.  All told, 

recent research, including studies by the International Monetary Fund, does not support 

the view that advanced-economy monetary policies are the dominant factor behind 

emerging market capital flows.1  Consistent with such findings, these flows have 

diminished in the past couple of years or so, even as monetary policies in advanced 

economies have continued to ease and longer-term interest rates in those economies have 

continued to decline. 

Second, the effects of capital inflows, whatever their cause, on emerging market 

economies are not predetermined, but instead depend greatly on the choices made by 

policymakers in those economies.  In some emerging markets, policymakers have chosen 

to systematically resist currency appreciation as a means of promoting exports and 

domestic growth.  However, the perceived benefits of currency management inevitably 

come with costs, including reduced monetary independence and the consequent 

susceptibility to imported inflation.  In other words, the perceived advantages of 

undervaluation and the problem of unwanted capital inflows must be understood as a 

package--you can’t have one without the other.
