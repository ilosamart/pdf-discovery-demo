many years.  We heard of companies, communities, and schools working together to 

bring employers the productive workers they need—and of employers working creatively 

to structure jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of 

family and life beyond the workplace.  We heard that many people who, in the past, 

struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and better 

chapters to their life stories.  All of this underscores how important it is to sustain this 

expansion. 

The conference generated vibrant discussions.  We heard that we are doing many 

things well, that we have much we can improve, and that there are different views about 

which is which.  That disagreement is neither surprising nor unwelcome.  The questions 

we are confronting about monetary policymaking and communication, particularly those 

relating to the ELB, are difficult ones that have grown in urgency over the past two 

decades.  That is why it is so important that we actively seek opinions, ideas, and 

critiques from people throughout the economy to refine our understanding of how best to 

use the monetary policy powers Congress has granted us.   

Beginning soon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will devote time at 

its regular meetings to assess the lessons from these events, supported by analysis by staff 

from around the Federal Reserve System.  We will publicly report the conclusions of our 

discussions, likely during the first half of next year.  In the meantime, anyone who is 

interested in learning more can find information on the Federal Reserve Board’s
