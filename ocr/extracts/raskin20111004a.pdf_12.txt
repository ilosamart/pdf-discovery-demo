believe that these are useful developments and should promote greater consistency in 

governing contracts of mortgage securitizations in the future, thereby facilitating investor 

monitoring of underwriting standards and setting common expectations for resolution of 

breaches of representations and warranties when they occur. 

Nevertheless, standard representations and warranties, no matter how well 

drafted, are unlikely on their own, or even in combination with a well-constructed 

enforcement standard, to go far enough to resolve the crucial problems of misaligned 

incentives and disparities in access to information in the securitization process.  During 

lending and asset booms, there is a temptation for market participants to collectively 

allow underwriting standards to weaken in order to meet a market demand for increased 

lending.  When a crisis then occurs, bankruptcies of originators and securitizers of 

mortgages may prevent investors in practice from obtaining restitution for breaches of 

representations and warranties.   

Thus, other contractual mechanisms are also required to promote a healthy and 

properly aligned securitization market.  For instance, comprehensive disclosures about 

the mortgage loans being securitized are vital to ensure that investors are able to conduct 

meaningful due diligence prior to making a decision to invest in a securitization.  They 

are also vital to investors’ ongoing monitoring of the servicing and administration of 

securitization transactions.  The work of the Securities and Exchange Commission to
