secondary, lean-against-the-wind effect if the higher capital requirements raise the cost 

of, and thus dampen, credit extension.   

 It is probably not surprising that the regulators represented on the Basel 

Committee have chosen capital requirements as a time-varying macroprudential tool.  

Capital regulation is central to prudential regulation and, as already noted, is being used 

in service of macroprudential objectives.  Both regulators and financial institutions are 

accustomed to capital regimes (although the post-crisis changes have altered that regime 

quite significantly).   

Still, it is uncertain just how useful this tool will be.

  In addition to some of the 

limitations affecting use of all time-varying instruments, such as judging when leverage 

or asset prices have become excessive, it is quite blunt.  If “turned on,” it would apply to 

all large banks in all parts of the country.  So it would not be useful to deploy in response 

to asset bubbles or leverage in particular sectors, since the additional capital required for 

lending in those sectors would be no greater than in less frothy parts of the economy.  

Indeed, it could in some circumstances have the unintended effect of encouraging banks 

to do more lending in the booming areas of concern, at the expense of lending in more 

stable areas.  The precise impact on bank lending behavior is further muddied by the one-

year period given to build the additional capital cushion. 

These potential shortcomings notwithstanding, the tool is available in the United 

States to the three federal bank regulatory agencies.  It could, in fact, serve as a 

complement to the more targeted actions available through the supervisory process.  The
