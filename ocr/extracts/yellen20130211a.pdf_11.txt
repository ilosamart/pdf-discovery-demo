for those without a high school diploma is 12 percent.  For young people--workers 16 to 

19 years old--the unemployment rate is 23.4 percent, little changed from the end of the 

recession.  Among African Americans in that age group, 38 percent of those in the labor 

force can’t find a job. 

Another gauge of the effect that this slow recovery has had on workers is how 

long it is taking to find a job.  At its worst point in the 1980s, the median length of 

unemployment for those looking for a job was 12 weeks, but the median since the Great 

Recession has averaged 20 weeks and now stands at 16 weeks.  Three million Americans 

have been looking for work for one year or more; that’s one-fourth of all unemployed 

workers, which is down from 2011’s peak but far larger than was seen before the Great 

Recession. 

These are not just statistics to me.  We know that long-term unemployment is 

devastating to workers and their families.  Longer spells of unemployment raise the risk 

of homelessness and have been a factor contributing to the foreclosure crisis.  When 

you’re unemployed for six months or a year, it is hard to qualify for a lease, so even the 

option of relocating to find a job is often off the table.  The toll is simply terrible on the 

mental and physical health of workers, on their marriages, and on their children.10 

 Long-term unemployment is also a great concern because it has the potential to 

itself become a headwind restraining the economy.  Individuals out of work for an 

extended period can become less employable as they lose the specific skills acquired in 

their previous jobs and also lose the habits needed to hold down any job.  Those out of
