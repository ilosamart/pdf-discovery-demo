and, further, have published a policy statement exploring the aims and factors relevant to 

development of the scenarios.17   

Second is the set of results of the DFAST and CCAR exercises themselves.  Right from 

the start--during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009--we adopted what 

was then the controversial practice of publishing post-stress capital ratio results for each 

participating firm, along with a breakdown of the projected losses by loan type.  Since then, we 

have substantially increased the breadth of the disclosed results, including a summary of the 

reasons for any qualitative objection or conditional non-objection to firms’ capital plans.  During 

the course of our review, suggestions were made for more granular disclosures, such as 

providing more details on different components of projected net revenues.  We will make this 

change, and possibly a few others, over the course of the next cycle or two of stress testing.18 

The third area for transparency involves the supervisory models used in the stress tests.  

Banks involved in DFAST/CCAR have regularly requested more disclosures so that they can 

better understand the likely impact on their firms.  One argument has been that banks will have a 

difficult time in their capital planning if they cannot predict how loss functions and other model 

features will affect their stress losses.  In part to remove the possibility that a bank would receive 

a quantitative objection to its capital plan because of a large gap between their loss estimates and 

those produced by the supervisory model, a few years ago we began allowing banks to revise 

their capital distribution requests following receipt of their DFAST results.  Under the SCB

the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing,” Final Rule; Policy Statement, November 29.   
18 Quite recently some banks have also suggested disclosing some version of the supervisory letters we send 
following the annual CCAR to each participating firm detailing our assessment of their capital planning processes.  
These banks believe that analysts and investors could benefit from knowing more detail on the concerns of the 
supervisors.  We had already been considering how to increase the information provided around qualitative 
objections or conditional non-objections and will factor these latest observations into this decision.
