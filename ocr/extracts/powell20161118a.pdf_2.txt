 It is a pleasure for me to return to the Center for Pacific Basin Studies here at the San 

Francisco Fed.  The global economy is at a critical juncture today.  According to the 

International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook, global gross domestic product 

(GDP) is set to grow at only 3.1 percent this year, the lowest rate of growth since the Global 

Financial Crisis.  Investment and productivity remain subdued, despite extremely low and even 

negative interest rates in many economies.1  One key aspect of global weakness that is of 

particular relevance to emerging Asian economies is the sharp slowdown in global trade.  This 

slowdown represents a notable departure from the “normal” times of the past few decades, and is 

the subject of my remarks today.2   

More specifically, I will discuss four topics.  First, I will review the main features of the 

global trade slowdown and summarize the evidence on its potential causes.  Second, I will 

examine the special role that structural changes in China appear to be playing in the trade 

slowdown.  Third, I will turn to the implications of this slowdown for economic growth in the 

region.  And, finally, I will offer some views on how Asian economies can respond to the 

slowdown by rethinking their “export-led growth” paradigm.   


1 The World Economic Outlook’s headline growth numbers aggregate global growth, using PPP-based GDP weights.  
They also compute growth using GDP weights based on market exchange rates, according to which global growth 
this year is projected to be even lower, at 2.4 percent.   
2 The views I express here are my own.
