measures can readily involve multiple regulatory authorities.  Let me turn now to what I regard 

as three priority areas for the application of macroprudential tools. 

Large Financial Institutions 

By definition, too-big-to-fail problems implicate systemic risk considerations and must 

be addressed in any regulatory system that seeks to preserve financial stability.  More generally, 

the dynamics observed during the financial crisis--including correlated asset holdings, common 

risks and exposures, and contagion among the largest firms--suggest that the well-being of any 

one of these firms cannot be isolated from the well-being of the banking system as a whole.  

Much of the post-crisis reform agenda has been centered on these institutions.  Various 

regulatory measures informed to a greater or lesser extent by macroprudential considerations 

have been developed and are now at various stages of implementation.  I will mention three of 

the most important. 

First is a set of strengthened capital standards, which fit squarely within the objective of 

increasing the resiliency of systemically important institutions.  Basel III fortified the 

microprudential requirements for both the quality and quantity of capital for all internationally 

active institutions.  But, both internationally and in the United States, the post-crisis reform 

agenda includes capital requirements derived in whole or in part from macroprudential aims.   

These include capital surcharges for systemically important firms and stress testing. 

Stress testing, unlike conventional capital requirements, provides a forward-looking 

assessment of losses that would be suffered under adverse economic scenarios.  Moreover, the 

related capital planning process helps ensure that the banking system would continue to have 

adequate capital to provide viable financial intermediation even in the face of adverse conditions.
