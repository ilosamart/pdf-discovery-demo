This theory of a competitive market may help put into perspective the often-cited decline 
in consumer response to the prescreened solicitations for credit cards: one interpretation 
is lack of interest among consumers, but another is that as consumers have continued to 
receive information, markets have become more competitive and consumers are thus less 
frequently receiving offers that are better than their current arrangements. The latter 
possibility is hardly bad for consumers. Although one cannot attribute all changes in 
credit card markets in recent years to the greater availability of information, evidence 
suggests both that many consumers notice the information and that markets have become 
more competitive over time. 

For insurance, the benefits of prescreened solicitations in providing additional 
information to consumers and reducing shopping costs are similar to those for credit 
cards. However, insurance sales typically require an extra step before the benefits can be 
fully realized. Prescreened solicitations for insurance generally do not contain complete 
pricing information tailored to a consumer because it is difficult to set the price of 
insurance solely based on information in CRA files. Specifically, prescreening using 
CRA files reveals something about the creditworthiness of individuals (maybe because it 
reveals something about the reliability of the insured), but it does not reveal any 
information about the property or life to be insured. The insurance company must obtain 
that information through some sort of further contact with the recipient of a prescreened 
solicitation before the underlying insurance price can be specified completely. 
Nonetheless, prescreened solicitations for insurance do provide a point of contact 
between insurance companies actively trying to expand their business and the potential 
customers receiving the solicitations. 

CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WITH PRESCREENED SOLICITATIONS 

To learn more about consumer awareness, attitudes, and responses to prescreened 
solicitations, the Board sponsored a nationwide survey in which consumers were asked a 
series of questions on these topics. About 77 percent of respondents held one or more 
credit cards when interviewed, and 23 percent held none (table 4). Among those with 
credit cards, 95 percent had a general-purpose credit card with a revolving feature, such 
as Discover, MasterCard, Optima, or Visa (data not in table). 

The survey showed that the majority of consumers both with and without credit cards had 
received prescreened solicitations in the mail for credit card accounts in the previous six 
months, although the proportions who received prescreened solicitations differed 
somewhat between the groups. More than 96 percent of those with credit cards had 
received prescreened solicitations for additional or replacement cards in the six months 
preceding the survey, compared with 81 percent of those with no cards. The numbers of 
prescreened solicitations received also varied between the groups, but most of the 
respondents in both groups reported receiving multiple prescreened solicitations per 
month. More than half of the group already holding cards and more than 30 percent of 
those without cards reported receiving six or more prescreened solicitations per month
