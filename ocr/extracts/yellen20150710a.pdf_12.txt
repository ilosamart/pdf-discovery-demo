There are a couple of factors, however, that I expect could restrain economic 

growth.  First, business owners and managers remain cautious and have not substantially 

increased their capital expenditures despite the solid fundamentals and brighter prospects 

for consumer spending.  Businesses are holding large amounts of cash on their balance 

sheets, which may suggest that greater risk aversion is playing a role.  Indeed, some 

economic analysis suggests that uncertainty about the strength of the recovery and about 

government economic policies could be contributing to the restraint in business 

investment.6 

A second factor that could restrain economic growth regards housing.  While 

national home prices have been rising for a few years and home sales have improved 

recently, residential construction has remained quite soft.  Many households still find it 

difficult to obtain mortgage credit, but, more generally, the weak job market and slow 

wage gains in recent years appear to have induced people to double-up on housing.  For 

example, many young adults continue to live with their parents.  Population growth is 

creating a need for more housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that 

continuing job and wage gains will encourage more people to form new households.  

Nevertheless, activity in the housing sector seems likely to improve only gradually.   

Regarding inflation, as I mentioned earlier, the recent effects of lower prices for 

crude oil and for imports on overall inflation are expected to wane during this year.  

Combined with further tightening in labor and product markets, I expect inflation will 

move toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years.  Importantly, a 

                                                 
have been otherwise.  See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook:  2015 to 2025
