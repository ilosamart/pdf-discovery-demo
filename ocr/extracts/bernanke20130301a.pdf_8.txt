Treasuries.  Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities currently amount to about 

$5-1/2 trillion, roughly half of the total amount of marketable Treasury debt outstanding.  

The global economic and financial stresses of recent years--triggered first by the financial 

crisis, and then by the problems in the euro area--appear to have significantly elevated the 

safe-haven demand for Treasury securities at times, pushing down Treasury yields and 

implying a lower, or even a negative, term premium.

Federal Reserve actions have also affected term premiums in recent years, most 

prominently through a series of Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programs.  These 

programs consist of open market purchases of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed 

securities, and longer-term Treasury securities.  To the extent that Treasury securities and 

agency-guaranteed securities are not perfect substitutes for other assets, Federal Reserve 

purchases of these assets should lower their term premiums, putting downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more broadly.  Although 

estimated effects vary, a growing body of research supports the view that LSAPs are 

effective at bringing down term premiums and thus reducing longer-term rates.

  Of 

course, the Federal Reserve has used this unconventional approach to lowering longer-

term rates because, with short-term rates near zero, it can no longer use its conventional 

approach of cutting the target for the federal funds rate.

 There are some additional more technical features of the Treasury market that push down the term 

premium.  For example, the Treasury term premium is likely also depressed by the global demand for 

Treasury securities for use as collateral or margin in funding or derivatives markets.

 See, for example, Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2011); Li and Wei (2012); Hamilton and Wu 

(2012); D’Amico, English, López-Salido, and Nelson (2012); Rosa (2012); Krishnamurthy and Vissing-

Jørgensen (2011); and Hancock and Passmore (2012).

 Term premiums, calculated using similar methods, have also declined fairly sharply recently in Canada, 

Germany, and the United Kingdom; somewhat less so in Japan.  This result is notable in that the central 

banks of these economies, with the exception of the Bank of England, have not pursued large-scale 

purchases of longer-term securities.
