the CCyB is its potential to limit the buildup of financial vulnerabilities by slowing the 

rate of credit expansion--that is, the possibility that the CCyB may “lean against the 

wind” of credit fluctuations.  This secondary objective, both in the original Basel 

discussions and in the Federal Reserve’s framework, is less central.   

A notable feature of the Board’s current framework is the decision to maintain a 0 

percent CCyB when vulnerabilities are within their normal range.  Because we set high, 

through-the-cycle capital requirements in the United States that provide substantial 

resilience to normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions, it is appropriate to 

set the CCyB at zero in a normal risk environment.  Thus, our presumption has been that 

the CCyB would be zero most of the time. 

Current Assessment of Financial Vulnerabilities 

When, then, would it be appropriate--given this framework--to activate the 

CCyB?  That is, how do we know when financial vulnerabilities are elevated?  The 

Federal Reserve continuously monitors vulnerabilities, as highlighted in our recent 

Financial Stability Report.6  Our approach is organized around tracking four broad 

vulnerabilities that academic research and practical experience have shown can amplify 

negative shocks and result in outsized losses in the real economy.  These are asset 

valuation pressures, household and business debt, funding risk, and financial-sector 

leverage.  As part of this process, the Board considers a number of quantitative 

indicators--one of which is the credit-to-GDP (gross domestic product) gap proposed in 

the Basel Committee guidance--that are indicative of potential vulnerabilities.
