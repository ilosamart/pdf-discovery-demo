Although the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the Fed’s authority to lend to 

insured depository institutions, it has changed, among other things, the reporting 

requirements for such loans.  The act requires the Fed to publish information on any 

discount window loan, including the identity of the borrowers, with a two-year lag.  This 

change is consequential, because an important challenge for the Federal Reserve over the 

years has been the stigma associated with borrowing from the discount window.3  

Discount window access cannot serve as an effective means to backstop insured 

depository institutions’ liquidity if banks fear that borrowing from the discount window 

will signal to the public, their competitors, or their counterparties that the bank is in 

trouble.  Prior to Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve only published information on 

discount window borrowing in aggregate, but stigma was nonetheless an issue.  And I 

suspect that the stigma associated with the discount window is even higher, given the 

public’s incorrect association of ordinary discount window borrowing with “bailouts.”  

While the two-year lag should help limit the increase in stigma associated with the 

increased reporting requirement, the fact that the Fed will no longer be able to assert 

unequivocally that discount window borrowing is strictly confidential will likely add to 

the challenge of reducing stigma.

the Financial Stability Board) identified the stigma associated with borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s 
discount window as a significant threat to financial stability.  See the President’s Working Group on
