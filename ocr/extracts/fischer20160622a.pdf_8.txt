probability of failure by reducing its short-term creditorsâ€™ incentives to run at the first 

sign of distress. 

In short, we and other U.S. regulators are working hard to address the too-big-to-

fail problem by improving the prospects for the orderly resolution of a GSIB in the 

United States.  The Dodd-Frank Act gave us tools to reduce the probability of failure of 

our largest and most complex banking firms and to significantly reduce the damage that 

the failure of such a firm would do to the U.S. financial system and the broader economy.  

We have made a lot of progress toward accomplishing these goals, leaving the U.S. 

banking system fundamentally safer and stronger, and our work in this area will continue. 

Thank you.
