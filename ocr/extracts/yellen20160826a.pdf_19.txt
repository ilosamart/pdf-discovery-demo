Although fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in 

strengthening the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary 

policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy.  New 

policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great 

Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns.  Additional tools 

may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate.  But even if average 

interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under 

most conditions, be able to respond effectively. 

i Note:  On August 29, 2016, a typo was corrected to change the line color cited from “blue” to “red” in the 

following sentence:  “As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if 

policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to fall sharply.”
