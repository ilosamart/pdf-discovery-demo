Second, the fraud control systems of the card issuers work best for situations, such as 
those related to prescreened solicitations, in which the card issuer already knows a bit 
about the customer and can use this information to help with verification of responses to 
the solicitation.35 If, for example, a thief steals a prescreened solicitation and sends a 
false response to the card issuer, the incoming returned document still faces a variety of 
fraud controls, including the requirement that activation of the card be completed with a 
call from the home telephone. In particular, if the thief requests a change of address to 
complete the theft, the returned solicitation is automatically directed to fraud control, 
since it exhibits characteristics that raise concerns. The card issuing firm may still 
eventually issue the card, but not without further screening that often includes manual 
checking of the address change request by telephone or other means out of the control of 
the potential thief. 

Such control systems apparently are a large part of the reason why card issuers estimate 
that only a small portion of credit card fraud arises from prescreened solicitations. There 
is almost no publicly available information about the volume of losses arising from 
prescreened solicitations, but information that is available suggests the total is 
comparatively small. According to a report of an interview with a large card issuer, 
“prescreening has the lowest incidence rate of application fraud versus other application 
channels.” This issuer told the Information Policy Institute that the fraudulent use of 
prescreened solicitations “accounts for less than 20 percent of identity theft losses at the 
company, which in turn constitute only a small fraction of its total fraud losses.” 
According to the issuer, most application fraud involving prescreened offers is committed 
by “someone familiar to the victim,” such as a family member or relative.36 The 
Information Policy Institute concludes that limitations on prescreening as a method of 
new account acquisition likely will increase identity theft because prescreening is now 
such an important channel for acquiring new accounts, and other acquisition channels are 
associated with greater amounts of identity theft than prescreened solicitations.37 

In congressional testimony on June 19, 2003, an executive at Chase Cardmember 
Services documented the infrequent nature of identity theft associated with prescreened 
solicitations and some of the reasons for its infrequency.38 According to Chase, identity 
theft that “involves the unlawful acquisition and use of another person’s information to 
obtain credit, or the use of that information to create a fictitious identity to establish an 
account” amounts to only about 3 percent of their fraud cases. Closely related account-
takeover fraud amounts to about 1 percent of their fraud cases.39
