sometimes significantly so.  Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than 

the Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would need to 

adjust the stance of policy in response.   

Considerable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity.   For 

example, we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the 

domestic economy will continue to fade.  Moreover, net exports have served as a 

significant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial 

developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S. 

economic activity somewhat further.  The Committee is monitoring developments 

abroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on 

the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path 

for policy.  That said, in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity, 

as with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the stance of policy so 

that our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over 

the medium term in the context of maximum employment.   

Given the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask:  Why not hold 

off raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and 

inflation is actually back at 2 percent?  The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary 

policy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag.  If the FOMC were to 

delay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up 

having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly 

overshooting both of our goals.  Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial 

markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession.  In addition,
