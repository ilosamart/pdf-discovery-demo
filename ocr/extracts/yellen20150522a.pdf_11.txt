however, I will need to see continued improvement in labor market conditions, and I will 

need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the 

medium term.   

After we begin raising the federal funds rate, I anticipate that the pace of 

normalization is likely to be gradual.  The various headwinds that are still restraining the 

economy, as I said, will likely take some time to fully abate, and the pace of that 

improvement is highly uncertain.  If conditions develop as my colleagues and I expect, 

then the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability would best be 

achieved by proceeding cautiously, which I expect would mean that it will be several 

years before the federal funds rate would be back to its normal, longer-run level.   

Having said that, I should stress that the actual course of policy will be 

determined by incoming data and what that reveals about the economy.  We have no 

intention of embarking on a preset course of increases in the federal funds rate after the 

initial increase.  Rather, we will adjust monetary policy in response to developments in 

economic activity and inflation as they occur.  If conditions improve more rapidly than 

expected, it may be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly; conversely, the pace 

of normalization may be slower if conditions turn out to be less favorable.

Before I conclude, let me put this discussion into a longer-term context.  The 

Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability do not, by 

themselves, ensure a strong pace of economic growth or an improvement in living 

standards.  The most important factor determining living standards is productivity
