weakness puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and 

reinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth.  In addition, over time, inflation 

has become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization.  This insensitivity can 

be a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high, but it means that much 

greater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target 

in a recovery.  Using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift 

inflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.   

In short, the proximity of interest rates to the ELB has become the preeminent 

monetary policy challenge of our time, tainting all manner of issues with ELB risk and 

imbuing many old challenges with greater significance.  For example, the behavior of 

inflation7 now draws much sharper focus.  When nominal interest rates were around 4 or 

5 percent, a low-side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the 

ELB.  But the world has changed.  Core inflation is currently running a bit below 

2 percent on a trailing 12-month basis.  In this setting, a similar low-side surprise, if it 

were to persist, would bring us uncomfortably closer to the ELB.  My FOMC colleagues 

and I must—and do—take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a 

robust economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in inflation 

expectations.  At the heart of the review is the evaluation of potential changes to our 

strategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation 

objective.   

                                                 
7 For example, based on the Federal Reserve staff’s Greenbook forecast, across forecasts prepared for 
59 FOMC meetings between 1997 and 2004, one-third of the year ahead, four-quarter inflation forecast 
errors were 0.5 percentage point or greater in absolute value.  Error tended to be on the low side, and 
45 percent of low-side misses were greater than 0.5 percentage point in absolute value.
