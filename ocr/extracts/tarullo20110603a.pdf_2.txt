As the one-year anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act approaches, there will be much 

discussion about the progress that has been made in reforming financial regulation.  Today I 

would like to get a head start on this exercise, concentrating on Dodd-Frank’s requirement that 

the Federal Reserve Board establish special prudential standards for systemically important 

financial institutions or, as they are now generally known, “SIFIs.”  My focus will be on the 

requirement for more stringent capital standards, which has generated particular interest. 

Let me begin by placing this regulatory task in context.  The financial crisis spawned or 

strengthened many reform agendas – among them consumer protection, securities and 

commodities market regulation, and traditional bank regulation.  But a focus on systemic risk has 

been central to reform efforts, and fittingly so.  It was, after all, a systemic financial crisis that we 

experienced and that led to the Great Recession that affects us still today.  Regulatory reform in 

the wake of the crisis cannot be judged a success if it does not reduce the incidence and severity 

of future crises. 

The pre-crisis regulatory regime had focused mostly on firm-specific or, in contemporary 

jargon, “microprudential” risks.  Even on its own terms, that regime was not up to the task of 

assuring safe and sound financial firms.  But it did not even attempt to address the broader 

systemic risks associated with the integration of capital markets and traditional bank lending, 

including the emergence of very large, complex financial firms that straddled these two domains, 

while operating against the backdrop of a rapidly growing shadow banking system.   

A post-crisis regulatory regime must include a significant “macroprudential” component, 

one that addresses two distinct, but associated, tendencies in modern financial markets:  First, the 

high degree of risk correlation among large numbers of actors in quick-moving markets, 

particularly where substantial amounts of leverage or maturity transformation are involved.
