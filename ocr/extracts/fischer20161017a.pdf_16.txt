Accordingly, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates is never a binding 

constraint under these circumstances.  Consistent with the definition of a steady state, at 

the start of the simulations, the output gap is closed, the unemployment rate is equal to its 

natural rate of 4.8 percent, inflation is 2 percent, the nominal federal funds rate is 3 

percent, the 10-year Treasury bond rate is 3.5 percent, and potential output growth is 2 

percent.  Except as otherwise noted, tax rates are held fixed at their baseline levels for 

four years, after which fiscal policy is allowed to respond by gradually adjusting the 

federal personal income tax rate to stabilize the ratio of federal government fiscal deficits 

to gross domestic product (GDP) at its assumed baseline target level.  In all instances, 

monetary policy is assumed to be governed by the (non-inertial) Taylor (1999) rule, with 

an intercept shift where applicable. 

Table A.1 summarizes the effects of several shocks on the long-run equilibrium 

real federal funds rate in the FRB/US model.  The details of how these shocks were 

implemented follow.  

Labor force.  The growth rate of the U.S. population (variable N16 in the FRB/US 

model) is assumed to climb over the course of a year to a pace that is 1 percentage point 

faster than in the baseline, with commensurate effects on the labor force, employment, 

potential output, and actual output.  The elevated pace of population growth lasts for 

20 years before returning to baseline rates over the succeeding 5 years. 

Productivity.  The growth rate of total factor productivity (HMFPT) is increased 

0.7 percentage point, which implies an acceleration in labor productivity (output per 

worker hour) of 1.0 percentage point.  The shock lasts for 40 years before fading out at a 

moderate pace.
