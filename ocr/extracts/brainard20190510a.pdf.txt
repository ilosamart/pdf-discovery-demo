“Renewing the Promise of the Middle Class” 
2019 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference 

 
Washington, D.C. 


May 10, 2019 
 



It is good to be here at the Federal Reserve System’s Community Development 

Research Conference.  This year, our conference is focusing on renewing the promise of 

the middle class, a topic that goes to the heart of the American dream and underpins the 

vibrancy of our democracy and society.1  

What Does It Mean to Be Part of the Middle Class? 

Before I dig into the data, I want to touch on what it means to be a part of the 

middle class, recognizing aspirations differ from person to person.  From a purely 

economic perspective, being middle class commonly means having financial security and 

the ability to invest for our futures and for our children.  In turn, having a strong middle 

class implies that families with average incomes have the purchasing power to consume 

and the savings to invest.  So a strong middle class is often seen as a cornerstone of a 

vibrant economy and, beyond that, a resilient democracy.2 

In recent years, households at the middle of the income distribution have faced a 

number of challenges.  That raises the question of whether middle-class living standards 

are within reach for middle-income Americans in today’s economy.

citizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be well-administered in which the middle 
class is large, and stronger if possible than both the other classes.”  See Constitutional Rights Foundation

There are a number of ways to define middle income.  I will primarily focus on 

households between the 40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution.  In 2018, 

these households had incomes between $40,000 and $85,000.3   

To explore the issues associated with financial resilience and intergenerational 

financial well-being, it is necessary to go beyond measures of income and better 

understand household assets and liabilities.   

Today I will share with you findings from a promising new data resource 

developed by Federal Reserve staff, the Distributional Financial Accounts (DFAs).  

These accounts combine household-level data on balance sheets, incomes, and 

demographic characteristics of families in the United States from the triennial Survey of 

Consumer Finances (SCF) with aggregate data from the Financial Accounts of the United 

States to track the distribution of these household assets and liabilities on a quarterly 

basis.4  The timeliness of the data, which are currently available through the fourth 

quarter of 2018, can provide valuable insights into how different types of households are 

faring over the business cycle.   

I will also share some new results from the 2018 Survey of Household Economics 

and Decisionmaking (SHED), which deliver further insights on the financial resilience of 

                                                 
3 This definition errs slightly on the higher side of what might be considered middle income, but the results 
are qualitatively robust to taking the middle third of the income distribution. 
4 For more details on the construction of the DFAs, see Michael Batty, Jesse Bricker, Joseph Briggs, 
Elizabeth Holmquist, Susan McIntosh, Kevin Moore, Eric Nielsen, Sarah Reber, Molly Shatto, Kamila 
Sommer, Tom Sweeney, and Alice Henriques Volz (2019), “Introducing the Distributional Financial 
Accounts of the United States,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2019-017 (Washington:  Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.017.  The

for the data are forthcoming.

households, particularly those with low and moderate income, on an annual basis.5  These 

results are slated for release soon. 

Wealth across Households 

Let us start by taking a look at how the wealth of middle-income households has 

evolved over recent years.6  Over the past three decades, the wealth of middle-income 

households increased an average of about 1 percent per year, adjusted for inflation (figure 

1).7  That compares with average annual growth of 2.6 percent in real gross domestic 

income over this period.  By comparison, the average wealth of the households in the top 

decile of the income distribution has increased three times faster per year, on average, 

than the wealth of middle-income households, more than doubling over the period as a 

whole.   

The past decade is even more sobering.  Middle-income families still have not 

fully recovered the wealth they lost in the Great Recession.  On average, households at all 

levels of income lost wealth as a result of the declines in asset prices and rise in 

unemployment during the crisis (figure 2).  But the recovery in wealth since the Great 

Recession has been much less for middle- and lower-income households than for higher-

income households.  The wealth of the top 10 percent of households is 19 percent higher 

                                                 
5 The SHED is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm. 
6 The published data set includes data on the distribution of nominal wealth by wealth percentiles.  For this 
speech, Board staff analyzed the data, with the wealth distribution by income percentiles and other 
demographic categories.  Wealth and all of its subcomponents are reported here in 2018 dollars using the 
personal consumption expenditures price index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see table 1.1.4, 
which is available at https://www.bea.gov).  Wealth is defined as the sum of assets, including financial and 
nonfinancial assets, net of liabilities, including mortgages, consumer debt, and other liabilities. 
7 Income groups at each point in time are defined here using current household income.  Specific 
households may move across income groups over time.  Since households in the high-income group during 
their working years may, in retirement, move to low- or middle-income groups, some of the wealth 
assigned to low- or middle-income groups in this analysis comes from households with high lifetime 
income.

than before the recession, even after factoring in the decline in stock prices at the end of 

last year.  In contrast, the wealth of middle-income families still has not returned to its 

pre-crisis level, and lower-income families have a wealth shortfall of 16 percent.8   

The gap is also large in absolute terms.  At the end of 2018, the average middle-

income household had wealth of about $340,000, while the average households in the top 

10 percent of the income distribution had wealth of about $4.5 million (figure 3).  The 

average wealth of the top income decile is now 13 times higher than that of the middle-

income group, while it was 7 times higher in 1989.  

Given these developments, it is no surprise that the share of wealth held by 

middle-income households has declined over the past three decades.  However, the extent 

of the decline is nonetheless striking:  Today the 30 percent of households between the 

40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution hold 13 percent of all wealth, down 

from 19 percent over the past three decades (figure 4).  The top 10 percent of households 

by income now own 57 percent of all wealth—up from 47 percent 30 years ago.  The 10 

percent of households with the highest income hold more of the national wealth than the 

remaining 90 percent of households combined.  

Do Middle-Income Households Have Middle-Class Economic Security? 

Having sketched out the contours of the overall level and growth of wealth owned 

by middle-income households, let us now turn to economic security.  Basic financial 

security is one important marker of the middle class.  Wealth is an important source of 

economic resilience for households, allowing them to handle unexpected expenses as 

                                                 
8 Wealth in figure 2 is indexed to the first quarter of 2007, which is between the peak in house prices in 
2006 and the start of the Great Recession at the end of 2007.  As figure 2 shows, household wealth began 
declining before the recession officially began.

well as providing them with the financial security to manage the usual changes in income 

over a lifetime.  When we dig into the various liquid savings, assets, and liabilities that 

underlie the overall wealth numbers for middle-income households, the picture suggests 

limited room to absorb volatility in cash flows.  Many middle-income families have 

relatively little in easily accessible, or liquid, savings, carry a significant amount of debt, 

and are concerned about the adequacy of their retirement savings.   

Liquid savings  

By drawing from several household surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve, 

we can gain important insights into how assets and liabilities of middle-income 

households affect their economic security.  Research based on the 2016 SCF shows that 

only about one-fourth of middle-income households have enough liquid savings to cover 

six months of expenses—the amount often recommended by financial advisers—and only 

4 in 10 could cover three months of expenses.9  The majority of middle-income 

households thus do not have sufficient liquid savings to weather a typical material 

financial disruption—for instance, one associated with a temporary job loss or illness.   

Even modest unexpected expenses could be disruptive for many middle-income 

families.  According to the forthcoming results from the 2018 SHED, one-third of 

middle-income adults said that they would borrow money, sell something, or not be able 

                                                 
9 See Neil Bhutta and Lisa Dettling (2018), “Money in the Bank?  Assessing Families’ Liquid Savings 
using the Survey of Consumer Finances,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, November 19), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2275.  In this study, “middle income” 
refers to households with income between the 25th and 75th percentiles.  Income is defined as the “usual 
amount” of income the household earned in the previous year and could differ from the actual amount.  
Overall expenses are estimated using partial data on household expenses, including rent, mortgages 
payments, car loans, and food.

to pay an unexpected $400 expense (figure 5).10  Drilling down further indicates that 

while 6 percent of middle-income adults said they would not be able to pay the expense 

using any means, 27 percent would borrow or sell something to pay the expense.   

The reliance on credit to meet unexpected expenses is pronounced among those 

already carrying a balance on their credit cards.  Nearly 3 in 10 middle-income adults 

carry a balance on their credit card most or all of the time, and the same households are 

five times as likely to borrow if faced with a $400 expense as those who never carry a 

balance.  

Borrowing money is not the only way that middle-income households cope with 

unexpected expenses.  In 2018, one-fourth of middle-income adults said they skipped 

some kind of medical care because of its cost, suggesting insufficient savings can have 

implications for physical health as well as financial health.  Thus, low levels of savings 

can create a challenging cycle when material disruptions in income, or even smaller 

unexpected expenses, spiral into a broader financial setback.  

Financial security in retirement 

A key component of middle-class financial security is the cushion of savings to 

cover retirement.  Here, the DFAs suggest some progress.  One of the innovations of the 

DFAs is that they include defined benefit plans from the Financial Accounts in addition 

to defined contribution plans, whereas measures of household pension wealth in the SCF 

are confined to the latter.  The balances in defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, in 

which retirement savings accumulate in an account, are typically simpler to measure.  By 

                                                 
10 This statistic and the rest in this subsection are from the 2018 SHED and are only for middle-income 
adults.  The SHED collects ranges of family income, not a dollar amount.  Middle income is defined as the 
ranges of family income from $40,000 to $99,000, which is roughly the 40th to 70th percentiles.

contrast, the value of defined benefit plans requires estimating how much the future fixed 

payments each year in retirement are worth today.  These future payments are a sizable 

asset for households, currently estimated at about $15 trillion, or about 70 percent of total 

pension assets.11   

The DFAs indicate that the average pension wealth for middle-income 

households—including both types of plans—has increased 2.5 percent per year over the 

past three decades (figure 6).  Pension assets are now the largest asset held by middle-

income households, representing 40 percent of their wealth, substantially exceeding the 

22 percent share of home equity in their wealth.  

In part, the growth in pension balances reflects the sustained decrease in long-

term interest rates over this period, which has boosted the value of the future fixed 

payments associated with defined benefit pensions.  It reflects the aging of the 

population, since households near or in retirement age have the largest accumulated 

levels of pension savings and are also likely hold a relatively greater share of defined 

benefit plans (figure 7). 

How do we square the growth in pension assets with survey evidence indicating 

that many households in the middle of the income distribution are concerned that they 

will not have enough to live on in retirement?  Only 35 percent of middle-income adults, 

who are not retired, say that their retirement saving is on track, and 16 percent of middle-

the United States,” table L.117, https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/fof/DisplayTable.aspx?t=l.117.  For

disappearing-employer-pensions-contributing-to-rising-wealth-inequality-20190201.htm.

income adults do not have any money saved for retirement.12  In part, this may reflect the 

long-term shift by employers to defined contribution plans and away from defined benefit 

plans, especially in the private sector.  While in 1989 more middle-income households 

had a defined benefit pension than a defined contribution plan, the reverse has been true 

since 1989.13  With defined contribution plans, employees have to decide how much they 

will save and how they will invest, and they face uncertainty regarding how much 

savings will be available in retirement.  Those who save and invest effectively can help 

secure their retirement.  But those who opt out, save too little, or make investment 

choices that turn out to yield low returns may find themselves unprepared as retirement 

approaches, despite years of hard work.  Two-thirds of middle-income adults who hold 

self-directed accounts, including defined contribution plans and individual retirement 

accounts, say that they have little or no comfort in managing the investments.14 

Assets and liabilities 

Stepping back, it is instructive to look at the evolution of the underlying assets 

and liabilities of middle-class households more broadly.  The liabilities of the average 

middle-income household have nearly doubled over the past three decades, while assets 

have increased only 50 percent (figure 8).  The gap between the relative growth of 

liabilities and assets peaked during the financial crisis and has narrowed somewhat for 

middle-income households more recently.  While mortgages rose and fell sharply around 

                                                 
12 The data are from the 2018 SHED.  Tabulations include only middle-income adults who are not retired. 
Retirement savings in the SHED include pensions, individual retirement accounts, and other savings for 
retirement. 
13 The data source is the SCF (1989–2016).  In 1989, 50 percent of middle-income households had a 
defined benefit pension, and 29 percent had a defined contribution pension, but by 1998, the relative 
ownership of each pension type had reversed to 36 percent and 43 percent, respectively.  Since then, the 
rates have been fairly stable.   
14 The data are from the 2018 SHED.  The tabulation includes only middle-income adults, who have self-
directed retirement accounts.

the Great Recession, the rise in consumer debt, such as credit cards, auto loans, and 

student loans, has been relatively steady.   

The rapid growth in liabilities reflects both short-term cash flow management and 

longer-term investments.  Taking on debt is an important way for middle-income families 

to help buffer unexpected expenses or a temporary loss of income, as indicated by the 8 

in 10 middle-income adults who are at least somewhat confident that they could obtain an 

additional credit card if they applied for it.15  Debt is also a critical mechanism for 

making key middle-class investments, which I turn to next.   

Investing in the Future 

There is a palpable sense that the opportunity to reach the middle class and remain 

in it is receding for many middle-income households.  Many households find it 

challenging to make key middle-class investments because incomes at the middle are not 

keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership, and it is difficult to 

save enough.  Often, making these investments requires having some savings in the first 

place—for instance, to make a down payment on a home, forgo income for a few years 

while paying tuition, or secure credit for a small business. 

Disparities by race and ethnicity 

This challenge is compounded for some racial and ethnic minority groups that 

have experienced large and persistent racial gaps in wealth.  In 2016, the average wealth 

of white households ($933,700) was seven times the average wealth of black households 

($138,200) and five times that of Hispanic households ($191,200).  Even among 

households at the middle of the income distribution, the average wealth in 2016 of white 

                                                 
15 The 2018 SHED is the data source.  Tabulations include only middle-income adults.

households ($277,200) was roughly one and a half times that of black households 

($179,700) and nearly three times that of Hispanic households ($95,400).16  Differences 

in educational attainment cannot fully account for these disparities:  The average wealth 

of black households in which the head had a bachelor’s degree ($271,200) was 26 percent 

less than that of white households in which the head did not attend college ($367,800).17   

This matters not least because disparities in wealth often are inherited.18  The 

prospects that a young person will reach the middle class often depend on attributes he or 

she inherits—such as the income, wealth, education, age, race, and ethnicity of his or her 

parents.19  Beyond financial wealth, children inherit intangible assets that affect their 

ability to access information and social networks that help in obtaining jobs and taking 

advantage of educational and other wealth-building opportunities.   

Homeownership 

Owning a home has been a key marker of middle-class status for many 

Americans.  The accumulation of equity in a home is the primary form of wealth building 

and economic security for many middle-class families.  Homeownership is valued for

nonfinancial reasons as well, such as protection against unwanted moves and the freedom 

to make alterations and investments in the home.20   

However, the financial crisis brought into focus that there are also risks associated 

with homeownership.  Home equity—defined as the difference between the house value 

and the mortgage balance—for an average middle-income household peaked at $90,200 

in late 2005, then declined by almost two-thirds through 2011 (figure 9).  By the end of 

2018, after several years of rising house prices, the home equity of the average middle-

income family was still below the pre-recession peak and not much above the value in 

1989.  

 Middle-income households saw such steep declines in their average home equity 

during the Great Recession because they had taken on a high level of mortgage debt 

relative to their house values.21  This high leverage amplified the effect of the fall in 

house prices on their wealth.  Moreover, the homeownership rates of middle-income 

households also declined during the recession, so they did not benefit as much from the 

subsequent rebound in house prices since 2013 as did higher-income families.   

The recent decline in homeownership rates does not appear to reflect a change in 

attitudes toward homeownership, as recent surveys show that the desire to own a home 

remains strong.22  Instead, it appears house prices are rising faster than income for many

focused on working-age households, and income classifications are based on the “usual amount” of income 
the household earns. 
22 As one example, in March 2019, according to Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey, 69 percent of 
households say they would “buy” if they were going to move.  See Fannie Mae’s March 2019 Data 
Release, which is available on its website at

middle-income families, putting homeownership out of reach.  By 2017, the median sales 

price for a single-family home was about four times median household income, up from 

three times median income in 1988.23   The homeownership rate for middle-income 

families was 68 percent in 2016, down from its peak in 2004 of 74 percent.24  For black 

households, the declines during and after the recession erased a decade of increases in 

homeownership—the homeownership rate for black households across the income 

spectrum was 42 percent in 2018, the same as the rate in the mid-1990s.25  The 

homeownership rate of Hispanics also declined with the recession but has recovered 

somewhat, reaching 47 percent in 2018. 

With homeownership lower and home prices rising faster than incomes, renting is 

also taking a bigger slice of many middle-income households’ earnings, leaving less 

savings for a down payment, an unexpected expense, or other investments.  From 2007 to 

2018, the share of income spent on rent rose from 18 percent to 25 percent for middle-

income renters.26  

Many middle-income families struggle to afford rent, particularly in the high-

demand areas where jobs are most available, underscoring the need for more workforce 

housing.  One way to increase the supply of middle-income housing is to reduce 

exclusionary zoning and other land-use restrictions that limit the supply of housing and

keep prices high.27  Often put in place in areas with single-family homes to block the 

development of affordable, multifamily housing, these policies also have contributed to 

the persistence of racially segregated neighborhoods.  The challenge is to increase 

accessibility to workforce and affordable housing in ways that address legacy 

disparities.28   

Skills, education, and student debt 

Manufacturing and the skilled trades have provided an important pathway to the 

middle class for many workers, enabling them to own their homes, educate their children, 

and retire securely.  Today, though, many face uncertainties associated with the decline in 

manufacturing jobs, the erosion of employee benefits, and reduced bargaining power.  

Increasingly, the onus is on individuals to ensure that their skills are marketable and up-

to-date in a highly competitive global marketplace with growing automation.  

Juan Salgado, the chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago and our closing 

keynote speaker, has emphasized the role of community colleges in offering affordable, 

quality education and training.29  Students can begin with a certificate program in 

advanced manufacturing and continue either to a bachelor’s degree in engineering at a 

nearby public university or to the workplace, acquiring marketable skills likely at lower 

cost than if they had started at a four-year college.  Similar programs around the country 

help provide accessible pathways to the middle class.

For others, college is seen as an important pathway to middle-class economic 

security.  The average wealth of households with a college degree significantly exceeds 

the average wealth of those without a college degree (figure 10).  A key reason is that 

college graduates generally have higher incomes.  Graduates with a bachelor’s degree 

have median weekly earnings that are about 65 percent higher than high school graduates 

and unemployment rates that are 2 percentage points lower, and they are often better 

positioned to adapt to changes in the labor market.30   

However, the cost of higher education has been rising, placing an increasing 

financial burden on many middle-income households.  Between 2008 and 2018, tuition 

and fees at four-year public colleges rose more than six times faster than real median 

incomes.31  Moreover, as Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Evans discussed, 

while there are benefits associated with attending college, there are also some financial 

risks, and the returns to education vary widely.  While two-thirds of individuals with a 

bachelor’s degree or more say that the lifetime financial benefits of their education 

exceed its costs, those who do not complete their degree are half as likely to report net 

benefits from their studies.32  And some groups face higher barriers in accessing college:  

Children of parents who did not attend college are far less likely to attend college due to 

                                                 
30 See Elka Torpey (2018), “Measuring the Value of Education,” Bureau of Labor Statistics, Career 
Outlook (blog), April, https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm.   
31  Net tuition and fees at four-year public colleges increased 44 percent between 2008 and 2009 and 
between 2018 and 2019 (according to data from the College Board, which are available on its website at 
https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-and-board-over-time), 
while income increased about 7 percent in the same period (as indicated by U.S. Census Bureau data, 
which can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED website at 
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=nDPn).  For more information, see College Board (2018), Trends in

financial and informational barriers, and those who do start college are more likely to 

drop out.33   

For many middle-income families, affording post-secondary education means 

taking on a sobering amount of student debt.  Total student loan debt, in inflation-

adjusted terms, more than doubled from 2006 to 2018 (figure 11).34  Repayment of 

student loans can be challenging.  In 2018, 2 in 10 middle-income adults with education 

debt were behind on their payments, and those who did not complete a degree were 

nearly twice as likely to be behind.35  Repayment status also differs by the type of 

institution attended.  Among middle-income adults with education debt, 30 percent who 

attended for-profit institutions were behind on student loan payments, compared with 17 

percent of those who attended public institutions and 12 percent who attended not-for-

profit private institutions. 

Investing in higher education may come at the cost of deferring or forgoing other 

investments.  For example, higher tuition costs—reflected in increasing student loan 

debt—together with the rising costs of homeownership, have left many middle-income 

households in a poor position to save for a down payment or handle a mortgage.  

Researchers at the Fed have estimated that roughly 20 percent of the decline in 

homeownership among young adults can be attributed to their increased student loans

since 2005.  This suggests that more than 400,000 young individuals would have owned a 

home in 2014 had it not been for the rise in student debt.36  

Businesses and stock ownership 

Another concern is that high debt may hinder people seeking to start a business.  

Starting a business is a classic pathway to securing a foothold in the middle class.  This 

has been particularly true for members of some groups that historically have faced 

challenges in the labor market, particularly minorities and first-generation Americans.37 

Aspiring small business owners with student loans may lack the financial ability 

to invest in starting a business while staying current on payments.  One study found that 

individuals with student loan debt are less likely to start a business, and those who do are 

more likely to fall behind on their loan payments.38  Another study found that growth in 

student loan debt resulted in a 14 percent reduction in small business formation in 

counties over a 10-year period.39

The personal assets of small business owners have been an important source of 

capital for entrepreneurs as they seek to start and sustain a small business.  As wealth for 

middle-income households has stagnated, reliance on this source of capital has declined 

in recent years.40  Very small firms depend heavily on personal debt for start-up and 

working capital.  Owners of smaller firms often struggle to qualify for bank credit, and 

among those that apply and are denied, low credit scores and insufficient credit history 

are the most frequently cited reasons.   

More broadly, a key reason that middle-income households have not seen wealth 

increases commensurate with high-income households is that they have not benefited as 

much from the strong performance of stocks and privately held businesses.  In inflation-

adjusted terms, total business assets (including corporate stocks, mutual funds, and 

unincorporated businesses) have more than tripled since 1989.  Similarly, the average 

business assets of top-income households have more than tripled since 1989.  But the 

average business assets of middle-income families have grown only 31 percent since 

1989 and are lower than they were before the Great Recession (figure 12).   Stock market 

participation fell for middle-income families after the Great Recession, so they have not 

benefited as much from the subsequent rise in stock prices.41  By 2018, the 30 percent of 

households in the middle of the income distribution held only 6 percent of aggregate 

business assets, while the top 10 percent of households held over three-fourths.

Maximum Employment, Wages, and Wealth 

With lower net worth and financial assets, the livelihoods of most middle-income 

families, other than retirees, depend primarily on compensation from working.  So the 

robustness of labor income over time is central to the ability of middle-income families to 

achieve and maintain middle-class financial security.  While the strengthening of the 

labor market over the course of this extended recovery has benefited middle-income 

families, the long-term decline in the share of national income going to wage earners is 

concerning. 

The Congress put maximum employment right at the heart of the Federal 

Reserve’s mandate, alongside price stability.  In fact, we are one of only a handful of 

central banks that have the explicit responsibility to promote maximum employment.  

Given that households at the middle of the income distribution rely primarily on wage 

income, our full employment mandate has served the country well during this extended 

recovery.   

The gains to workers, including those in the middle class, from the strong labor 

market are clear.  Unemployment is now at 3.6 percent—its lowest level in 50 years.  

Employment rates of adults in their prime working years (ages 25 to 54) have been rising 

steadily during the expansion and recently reached their pre-recession peak of 80 

percent.42  Importantly, wage growth has begun to pick up after years of slow gains.  

It is notable that the near recovery in middle-class wealth from the Great 

Recession did not take hold until the labor market began to strengthen.  While higher-

income households saw their wealth begin to recover as soon as financial markets 

                                                 
42 The data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

stabilized in early 2009, middle-income households did not see their wealth begin to 

recover until 2010, when the unemployment rate began to decline (figure 13).   

Even as we welcome the many benefits of the current strong job market, longer-

term trends raise concerns.  Labor market disparities by race have been an enduring 

feature of the labor market for decades.  The unemployment rate of blacks, while near its 

historical low, remains at about 7 percent, twice the unemployment rate of whites.  

Recent research suggests that the strong labor market may be helping to narrow some of 

the long-standing disparities for some racial minorities and women, although the results 

are tentative and very modest.43   

The progressive long-term decline in the share of national income that goes to 

workers through wages is concerning for middle-income households.  The share going to 

workers—which economists call the labor share—translates into how much of our 

economic output shows up in people’s paychecks.  The decline in the labor share goes to 

the heart of the rising inequality of wealth and the unequal sharing of prosperity.  

Several explanations have been put forward for the decline in the labor share.  

The increasing concentration of industries into the hands of a few firms has likely 

reduced the bargaining power of workers.44  Increasing automation in the workplace is

also a factor, along with the ongoing effects of globalization and offshoring.  Earnings 

have declined as the job market has shifted away from important middle-income 

occupations.  Manufacturing, for example, employs vastly fewer people now than it has 

historically.45  It is important to understand the relative importance of these different 

drivers, as they have different implications for the overall health of the economy and for 

policies to support middle-income families.   

Monetary policy aims to influence employment and inflation over the business 

cycle, as opposed to addressing these longer-run structural changes.  But the distribution 

of income and wealth may have important implications for macroeconomic 

developments, such as the evolution of consumption, which is the single biggest engine 

of growth in our economy.  That is why the Federal Reserve has a significant interest in 

understanding distributional developments and their implications.   

Recent research finds that households with lower levels of wealth spend a larger 

fraction of any income gains than households with higher levels of wealth.46  

Consequently, an economy that delivers an increasing share of income gains to high-

wealth households could result in less growth in consumer demand than one in which the 

gains are distributed more equally.  In fact, the recovery of consumer spending after the 

Great Recession was slower than the recovery in aggregate household income and net

worth would previously have suggested, and rising inequality is one plausible 

explanation.47   

Conclusion 

The discrepancy between slow growth in income and wealth, on the one hand, 

and rising costs of housing, health care, and education, on the other, may be making it 

more difficult for middle-income families to achieve middle-class financial security.  

Long-term, the shifting of wealth and income to the top of the distribution and away from 

the middle could pose challenges to the health and resilience of our economy.  These are 

important questions, and I am pleased that this conference is bringing to light interesting 

research to shed light on them.
