to fairly compensate servicers.  But when a loan becomes non-performing, costs start 

climbing.  Costs associated with collections, loss mitigation, foreclosure, the maintenance 

and disposition of real-estate owned properties, and so on, are lumpy and can be high.  

The current model is structured with the hope that, over a given period of time, there are 

enough of the low-touch performing loans to cross-subsidize the high-touch non-

performing ones, so that the overall pool of servicing fee revenue is sufficient to cover 

expenses and return a reasonable profit.  But if that doesnâ€™t happen, servicers are either 

being paid too much for their efforts or not enough.    

 The current model also rests on the expectation that, in good times, servicers are 

using some of the residual income to build out systems and procedures to handle the 

pressures that come with worse times.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, this has not 

happened. 

 A better business model--one that might attract more entrants and increase 

competition--would more closely tie expenses with compensation and  reduce many of 

the principal-agent problems that currently exist.  Rather than rolling most of the 

compensation into one annual fee that covers performing and delinquent loans alike, 

servicers could be compensated quite modestly for the routine processing of payments 

involved with performing assets.  They would be required to have either significant 

capacity for loss mitigation and the other work involved with non-performing loans, or 

business relationships with third parties, such as specialty servicers, that do. Contracts 

could spell out a structure wherein the investor would pay significantly higher and more 

direct compensation for the more labor-intensive work involved in delinquent loans, 

though they would need to be careful not to create perverse incentives to encourage such
