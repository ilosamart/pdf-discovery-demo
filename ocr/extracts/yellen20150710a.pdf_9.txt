last year, as global financial markets seemed to judge that our economy was relatively 

stronger than those of many of our trading partners.  The stronger dollar has pushed down 

the prices of imported goods, and that, in turn, has put downward pressure on core 

inflation.  In addition, the plunge in oil prices may have had some indirect effects in 

holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers passed on to 

their customers some of the cost savings from lower energy prices.  In all, however, these 

downward pressures seem to be abating, and the effects of these transitory factors are 

expected to fall out of measures of inflation by early next year.  

Very low inflation may not sound like a real problem to many people.  However, 

persistently low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage increases over 

time, can weaken the economy by, for example, making it more difficult for households 

and firms to pay off their debts.  A persistent, very low inflation environment also tends 

to result in chronically low short-term interest rates.  This type of situation would leave 

less scope for the FOMC to respond with its conventional monetary policy tool--namely, 

a cut in the federal funds rate--to counteract a weakening in the economy.

Let me turn now to where I think the economy is headed over the next several 

years.  The latest estimates show that both real GDP and industrial production actually 

edged down in the first quarter of this year.  Some of this weakness appears to be the 

result of factors that I expect will be only transitory, such as the unusually harsh winter 

weather in some regions of the country and the West Coast port labor dispute that briefly 

restrained international trade and caused disruptions in manufacturing supply chains.  

Also, statistical noise or measurement issues may have played some role.  This is not the
