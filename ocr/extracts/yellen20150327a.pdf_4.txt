sales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given 

such robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower 

energy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of 

consumer confidence.  Of course, not all sectors of the economy are doing as well:  dollar 

appreciation appears to be restraining net exports, low oil prices are prompting a cutback 

in drilling activity, and the recovery in residential construction remains subdued.  But 

overall, I anticipate that real gross domestic product is likely to expand somewhat faster 

than its potential in coming quarters, thereby promoting further gains in employment and 

declines in the unemployment rate. 

In assessing the actual strength of the labor market and the broader economy, we 

must bear in mind that these very welcome improvements have been achieved in the 

context of extraordinary monetary accommodation.  While the overall level of real 

activity now appears to be much closer to its potential than it was a year or two ago, the 

economy in an “underlying” sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the 

simple reason that the increases in hiring and output that have been achieved thus far 

have required exceptionally low levels of short- and longer-term interest rates, reflecting 

a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Interest rates have been, and remain, 

very low, and if underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should 

be booming.  As I will discuss shortly, this assessment concerning the underlying 

strength of real activity has important policy implications. 

While there has been considerable progress on the maximum employment leg of 

our dual mandate, progress on the price stability leg has been notably absent.  Inflation as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures has been running
