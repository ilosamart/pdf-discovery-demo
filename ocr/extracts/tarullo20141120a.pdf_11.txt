manageable when they do occur.  It can serve both as a tax and a mitigant to offset the 

externalities associated with liquidity risk.9    

There is an additional role for liquidity regulation, one suggested by much of the 

preceding discussion.  When a firm faces a run on its funding, it is likely either insolvent or in a 

condition that makes an assessment of its solvency difficult for counterparties, investors, and 

regulators.  That is, by this point the capital position of the firm is perceived as sufficiently 

uncertain so as to call into question its continued viability.  Liquidity regulation can ensure that, 

even in these circumstances, officials have at least a bit of time to assess liquidity troubles and 

the underlying condition of the firm, as well as the degree to which the troubles are idiosyncratic 

or systemic.  With appropriate insolvency mechanisms available, authorities can then decide 

whether the firm will recover or needs to be placed into a resolution or liquidation regime, while 

proceeding in a manner consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act injunction that LOLR measures in 

exigent circumstances are not to be used for the benefit of a single firm. 

This is not to say that everything will always proceed smoothly, of course.  But such an 

approach can extend the proverbial runway for a troubled firm and help avoid repeats of the 

situation six years ago, when policymakers confronted with chaotic financial conditions had little 

time to react and few available tools other than government liquidity and, eventually, capital 

injections.
