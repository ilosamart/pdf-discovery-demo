Conclusion 

To conclude, I have covered a handful of specific ideas to involve markets and the public 

more closely in the regulatory system.  My more general point is that the reform of our financial 

system to strengthen market discipline is both an essential change in itself and also a starting 

point for increasing useful information flows between markets and regulators.  Market forces 

will operate more efficiently with information about banks that has usually remained largely 

hidden from investors in anything but the most aggregated form.  The regulatory system will 

operate more effectively if the supervisory process integrates market information which should, 

as a result of innovations such as a resolution mechanism, be even more sensitive to the 

conditions of financial firms.   

Experience before the financial crisis suggests that institutionalizing opportunities for 

external voices, including dissident voices, will be an important element of macroprudential 

supervisory efforts.  Outside critics are not always right, of course.  But the best way to separate 

insightful and well-grounded criticisms from unfounded ones is through a rigorous discussion in 

which the views of outside critics, as well as those of the regulators themselves, will be subject 

to inquiry.  Such a process may lead to uncomfortable moments for regulators, but that is a small 

price to pay if it can help contain financial instability in the future.
