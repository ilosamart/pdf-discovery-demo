 As everyone present today knows, the process of post-crisis financial regulatory reform 

has been elaborate and extended.  Numerous rulemakings, most involving multiple agencies and 

many quite complex, are required to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as various international frameworks developed 

under the auspices of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  It is thus natural, and 

appropriate, that those of us involved in this process, both inside and outside government, have 

been focused on the details of one or another of these regulations.  However, this necessary 

attention to details also places us at risk of losing sight of the broader reform picture.  So this 

morning I would like to do some stocktaking: to review briefly the vulnerabilities in the financial 

system that contributed to the crisis and compel regulatory response, to outline some key reforms 

adopted to date, and to identify important tasks that remain. 

The Origins of the Crisis 

 This is certainly not the occasion for an extended discussion of the origins of the crisis.  

But, in assessing the progress of reform, it is important to recall the basic problems we should be 

addressing.  The New Deal reforms, engrafted onto preexisting restrictions in the National Bank 

Act and state banking laws, largely confined commercial banks to traditional lending activities 

within a circumscribed geographic area, while protecting them from runs and panics through the 

provision of federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve discount window access.  At the same 

time, investment banks and broker-dealers were essentially prohibited from affiliation with 

traditional banks.  This approach fostered a system that was, for the better part of 40 years, very 

stable and reasonably profitable, though not particularly innovative in meeting the needs of 

savers, on the one hand, and of households and businesses wishing to borrow funds, on the other.
