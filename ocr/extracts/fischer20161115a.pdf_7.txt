2.  Trading volume is high 

Another commonly used measure of liquidity is trading volume.  Figure 4 shows 

trading volume in the corporate bond market.  This measure is important because low 

trading volumes may indicate that high transaction costs have deterred investors from 

making trades, a phenomenon that transaction cost measures would clearly miss because 

they are calculated from actual trades.  The trading volumes depicted in the figure show 

no obvious signs of a current problem with market liquidity.  In 2006, investors traded an 

average of $12 billion a day.  During the height of the financial crisis, trading volume 

decreased to $8 billion a day, but, by 2009, volumes appeared to have fully recovered.  

Today trading volumes are at about $19 billion a day.  On balance, the evidence 

presented in these two figures seems to suggest that market liquidity has not deteriorated 

in recent years--subject, of course, to the caveat I just discussed about the possibility that 

our measures of bid-ask spreads could be distorted by the increasing role of investors as 

suppliers rather than demanders of liquidity.11 

As an aside, the market liquidity figures shown are only for the corporate bond 

market, but we see similar patterns in the equity and Treasury markets.12  That is, we do 

not find convincing evidence that liquidity has markedly declined in those markets.   

Policy Issues Related to Market Liquidity 

While the evidence for changes in market liquidity does not point clearly to a 

reduction, I have highlighted some recent research that indicates the possibility that 

market liquidity has fallen.  To date, observed changes in liquidity do not suggest that 

                                                 
11 Trebbi and Xiao (2015) analyze multiple corporate bond liquidity measures and conclude that there is no 

evidence of deterioration in liquidity due to regulation.

agreement) market.
