part reflecting the international role of U.S. financial markets and the dollar.  Since the 

middle of 2014, with a reassessment of demand growth in the euro area and subsequently 

in emerging markets and other commodity exporters, the real trade-weighted value of the 

dollar has increased nearly 20 percent.  As a result, in 2014 and 2015, net exports 

subtracted a little over 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth each year, and 

econometric models point to a subtraction of a further 1 percentage point this year.12  In 

addition, the dollar’s appreciation is estimated to have put significant downward pressure 

on inflation:  Non-oil import prices fell 3-1/2 percent in 2015, subtracting an estimated 

1/2 percentage point from core PCE inflation.13   

Financial channels can powerfully propagate negative shocks in one market by 

catalyzing a broader reassessment of risks and increases in risk spreads across many 

financial markets.  Since the beginning of the year, U.S. financial markets have reacted 

strongly to adverse news on emerging market growth, even though the news on the U.S. 

labor market has remained positive.  In this regard, although China’s direct imports from 

the United States are modest, uncertainty about changes to its exchange rate system and 

financial imbalances, together with changes in the composition of its growth, have had 

broader global spillovers that may pose risks to the U.S. outlook.   

Recent events suggest the transmission of foreign shocks can take place extremely 

quickly such that financial markets anticipate and indeed may thereby front-run the 

expected monetary policy reactions to these developments.  It also appears that the 

exchange rate channel may have played a particularly important role recently in 

transmitting economic and financial developments across national borders.  Indeed,
