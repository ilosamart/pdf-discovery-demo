Could the FOMC go further in enhancing its communications?  One logical 

possibility would be for the Committee to publish forecasts akin to those I’ve presented 

in figure 1.  That is, the Committee could provide the public with its projections for 

inflation and the unemployment rate together with what it views as appropriate paths both 

for the federal funds rate and its asset holdings, conditional on its current outlook for the 

economy.  Over time, these projections would be revised in response to incoming data 

that alters the Committee’s economic outlook or, instead, because the Committee decides 

to alter its policy stance.  Several inflation-targeting central banks, such as those in 

Sweden and Norway, publish forecasts of this type.  Such a forecast could be highly 

informative, and, in recent months, the FOMC has explored whether it might be 

achievable.  Not surprisingly perhaps, in a Committee of 19 participants with diverse 

views on the structure of the economy and appropriate policy, a detailed consensus 

forecast is exceptionally difficult to develop.  As an alternative, the FOMC could try to 

build on the individual projections of macroeconomic variables and policy already 

included in its quarterly SEP to provide at least some further information about how these 

individual projections inform the Committee’s collective policy judgment.  

Improvements along these lines are currently under active consideration.24 

                                                 
24 In the SEP, participants provide paths for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation that 
each expects under his or her own view of the policy that is most appropriate to achieve the Committee’s 
dual mandate.  But as is apparent in the SEP, participants have a great diversity of views on matters such as 
the expected timing and subsequent pace of federal funds rate increases.  The SEP currently provides 
information about the separate distributions of the projections for inflation, real activity, and the federal 
funds rate over the next few years, but it does not provide the joint paths--that is, multivariate projections.  
The public cannot, for example, infer whether a projection for higher inflation in 2015 was made by a 
participant who expects real activity to be weak due to a more pessimistic view about the productive 
capacity of the economy, or by a participant who expects higher inflation in the context of a stronger 
recovery, perhaps judging, in the spirit of the optimal policy simulations, that somewhat higher inflation is 
warranted for some time to achieve faster progress in reducing unemployment.
