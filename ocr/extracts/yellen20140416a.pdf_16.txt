and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current 

target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained.  This approach 

underscores the continuing commitment of the FOMC to maintain the appropriate degree 

of accommodation to support the recovery.  The new guidance also reaffirms the 

FOMC’s view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one indicator, but 

that it will take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, inflation, 

and financial developments.  

Along with this general framework, the FOMC provided an assessment of what 

that framework implies for the likely path of policy under the baseline outlook.  At 

present, the Committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely 

warrant maintaining the current range “for the federal funds rate for a considerable time 

after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run 

below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation 

expectations remain well anchored.”25   

Finally, the Committee began explaining more fully how policy may operate in 

the period after liftoff, indicating its expectation that economic conditions may, for some 

time, warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as 

likely to prove normal in the longer run.  FOMC participants have cited different reasons 

for this view, but many of the reasons involve persistent effects of the financial crisis and 

the possibility that the productive capacity of the economy will grow more slowly, at 

least for a time, than it did, on average, before the crisis.  The expectation that the 

achievement of our economic objectives will likely require low real interest rates for 

some time is again not confined to the United States but is shared broadly across many
