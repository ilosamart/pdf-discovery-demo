Guarantors eligible for double default treatment include those entities that a banking 
organization assigns a probability of default equal to or lower than the probability of 
default associated with a long-term credit rating in the third-highest investment grade 
category.38   

One option would be to expand the use of the recognition of collateral and 
guarantees as provided in the general risk-based capital rules, that is, by substituting the 
risk weight appropriate to the guarantor or collateral for that of the exposure.  This 
approach would have to be modified to exclude mention of external credit ratings for 
certain securities firms.  The agencies could also incorporate into the recognition of 
collateral and guarantees some of the credit-worthiness standards discussed above for 
sovereign, PSE, bank, and corporate exposures.    

Question 8: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative 
approaches?  What are the implications or potential for unintended consequences?  Are 
there other approaches that would more appropriately capture the risk-mitigating effects 
of collateral and/or guarantees without adding undue cost or burden?  Commenters are 
asked to provide quantitative as well as qualitative supporting data and/or analysis for 
proposed alternative methods. 

d.  Burden 

The agencies recognize that any measure of credit-worthiness will involve a 
tradeoff among the objectives discussed in this ANPR.  As previously noted, the agencies 
recognize that a more refined differentiation of credit-worthiness may be achievable only 
at the expense of greater implementation burden.  The agencies seek comment on the 
costs and burden that various alternative standards might entail.  In particular, the 
agencies are interested in whether the development of alternatives to the use of credit 
ratings would involve, in most circumstances, cost considerations greater than those 
under the current regulations. 

Question 9: What burden might arise from the implementation of alternative 
methods of measuring credit-worthiness at banking organizations of varying size and 
complexity?  Commenters are asked to provide quantitative as well as qualitative support 
for their burden estimates.  In addition to the cost burden, the agencies seek comment on 
the feasibility of implementing various alternatives, particularly for community and mid-
sized banks.
