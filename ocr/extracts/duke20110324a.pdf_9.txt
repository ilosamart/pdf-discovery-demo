boomer families remained cautious, or grew more cautious, about spending out of their asset 

gains--regardless of whether they experienced significant losses during the crisis (figure 8).  

However, the response of spending plans to the prospect of asset losses appears to be 

stronger than the response to the prospect of asset gains.  Every wealth-change group reported 

being more than twice as likely to decrease spending if asset values declined than they were to 

increase spending if asset values rose (figure 9).  All of this evidence may help explain the sharp 

drop in consumer spending as household wealth declined and the continued sluggishness of 

consumer spending even as asset values have recovered.  This asymmetry in responses holds 

over all age groups as well. 

The varied change in wealth for preretirement families, taken together with the changes 

in retirement plans, risk attitudes, and willingness to spend in response to changes in wealth, 

imply that some of the effects of recent economic turmoil may result in a longer period of 

economic adjustment than has been the case in past recessions, as fundamental attitudes appear 

to have shifted.   

I think the higher level of caution displayed by all households in the group, regardless of 

whether the change in their individual circumstances was positive or negative, is especially 

interesting.  This indicates that changes in risk appetite result from observations of changes to the 

circumstances of others as much as to changes in oneâ€™s own circumstances.  Responses regarding 

attitudes toward modifying spending as asset values rise and fall suggest that the relationship 

between the saving rate and household wealth might be even more persistent than in the past.  

Such an impact would be further magnified if changes in wealth also impacted borrowing 

patterns and credit approval.
