 Another argument for the structural unemployment hypothesis is that the 

relationship between job vacancies and unemployment has recently changed.  Generally, 

job vacancies bear an inverse relationship to the unemployment rate; that is, when the 

unemployment rate is low, vacancies are relatively plentiful, and when unemployment is 

high, vacancies are scarce.  The pattern of these changes over time has been plotted on 

what is commonly referred to as the Beveridge curve.  A stylized interpretation is that 

movements along the downward-sloping Beveridge curve are generally caused by 

changes in aggregate demand.  Persistent shifts of the curve closer to, or further away 

from, the vertical and horizontal axes may reflect structural changes in the labor market.   

 Much has been made of the fact that the Beveridge curve appears to have shifted 

out in the past couple of years.  The argument is that the shift reflects an increase in job 

mismatch, with the vacancies going unfilled because of structural reasons such as lack of 

geographic mobility or appropriate skills.   

I think far too much has been made of this argument.  In the first place, the 

Bureau of Labor Statistics data series from which the Beveridge curve is constructed 

began only in 2000.  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and San 

Francisco used other data sources to draw what we might call “approximate Beveridge 

curves” for the post-World War II period.8  They found that, during and immediately 

after the serious recessions from 1973 to ’75 and from 1981 to ’82, the curve also shifted 

out noticeably, but in both cases it shifted back inward during the recovery.  Why this 

occurred is not so clear.  The big increase in job loss during the recession is probably a
