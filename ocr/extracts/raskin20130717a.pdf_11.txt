the transaction is the “haircut.” Haircuts protect the cash lender, since, if the borrower 

cannot repay, or chooses not to because collateral values have fallen, the lender can take 

and sell the collateral to satisfy its loan. The larger the haircut is at the time of the 

transaction, the greater the lender’s protection; that is, the greater the likelihood that that 

the value of the security, when sold, will exceed the amount owed plus interest.  

Presumably, lenders assess their borrowers’ riskiness and calibrate the amount of 

the appropriate haircut. Regulators should require them to do this consistently and 

prudently across the credit cycle.  

Haircuts tend to be cyclical: falling in good times, which adds to the growth of 

credit, and rising in busts, which contracts credit. A regulator could mitigate the cyclical 

behavior of haircuts and its consequences by establishing minimum haircuts that apply in 

both good and bad times. Calibrating minimum haircuts to the risks and volatility 

expected during bad times would make lenders more secure, increasing their resilience to 

losses. It could also make it more expensive to fund the purchase of the securities, and so 

could limit the amount of borrowing that could be supported by an asset of given value; 

this, in turn, might limit credit-fueled increases in the asset’s price.  

In other words, by requiring increased margin, the growth of credit can be slowed 

and resiliency can be strengthened. Regulators can also simply require margin 

requirements to be increased in good times. This would lean against the growth of 

bubbles even if regulators had not yet discerned the particular type of asset bubble 

growing.
