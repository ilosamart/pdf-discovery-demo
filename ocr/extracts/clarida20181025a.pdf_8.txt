they should be ignored.  Instead, when thinking about monetary policy, I believe it is best 

not to ignore entirely an admittedly imprecise estimate of r* today, but instead to update 

that estimate as new data on inflation, inflation expectations, employment, growth, and 

productivity arrive.   

Moreover, because monetary policy operates with a lag, and with inflation 

presently close to the 2 percent goal, it will be especially important to monitor inflation 

expectations closely--using both surveys and financial market data--to best calibrate the 

pace and destination for policy normalization.  It will also be important to monitor both 

model-based and financial-market-based estimates of expected future inflation-indexed 

real interest rates (for example, 5-year real rates 5 years forward)--suitably adjusted for 

term premium and liquidity effects--as one indicator of longer-run r*.  Before the 

financial crisis, these 5-year real rates 5 years forward averaged around 2 percent after a 

term premium and liquidity adjustment.  Since 2015, they have averaged about 0.50 

percent but recently have approached 0.75 percent, also after a term and liquidity 

premium adjustment.  Given that real interest rates and economic growth tend to move 

together over the longer run, one possible source of these upward revisions in forward 

real rates could be that financial market participants may have become more optimistic 

about the growth potential of our economy.  Evidence also suggests that the term 

premium that investors require to hold longer-maturity bonds has risen as well. 

The Way Forward 

If the data come in as I expect, I believe that some further gradual adjustment in 

the federal funds rate will be appropriate.  As I mentioned earlier, I believe monetary 

policy today remains accommodative, and that, with the economy now operating at or
