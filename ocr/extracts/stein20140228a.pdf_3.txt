managers create should be factored into the design and conduct of monetary policy.  

Presumably, this consideration would imply that monetary policy should be somewhat 

less easy in a weak economy, all else being equal, to reduce the probability of an 

undesirable upward spike in rates and credit spreads down the road.  The authors are 

careful to note that “our analysis neither invalidates nor validates the course the Federal 

Reserve has actually taken.”

  Rather, they are highlighting a set of considerations that 

they believe should ultimately be incorporated into the design of a monetary policy 

framework.  This is the spirit in which I will discuss the paper--not as a comment on the 

current stance of policy, but as an exploration of the factors that should be taken into 

account when thinking about the tradeoffs associated with monetary policy more 

generally.   

The model in the paper is a simple one, and it does a nice job of framing the 

issues.  In particular, here is how I think about the value-added of the theory:  On the one 

hand, an emerging body of empirical work documents that an easing of monetary policy--

even via conventional policy tools in normal times--tends to reduce both the term 

premiums on long-term Treasury bonds and the credit spreads on corporate bonds.

  That 

is, monetary policy tends to work in part through its effect on capital market risk 

premiums, perhaps through some sort of risk-taking or reaching-for-yield mechanism.   

On the other hand, while this empirical observation sheds some interesting light 

on how monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that 

there is any financial stability dark side to the lowered risk premiums that go with
