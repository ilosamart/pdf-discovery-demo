Extent of slack in the economy.  Some proponents of the view that the U.S. 

economy is operating close to the NAIRU point to an apparent outward shift in the 

Beveridge curve--the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--as 

indicating an increase in the structural level of unemployment.  In the simplest 

framework, movements along a downward sloping Beveridge curve are typically 

characterized as cyclical movements in labor market conditions, while persistent inward 

and outward shifts in the curve are frequently attributed to structural forces. 

As shown in figure 5, the Beveridge curve appears to have shifted out in recent 

years.  However, the Beveridge curve can shift out for a variety of reasons, including 

some that are essentially cyclical in nature, so it is important to understand the sources of 

any shift to assess whether it represents persistent structural forces.  

There is some evidence suggesting that structural factors account for a portion of 

the Beveridge curveâ€™s outward shift.  In particular, the shift may partly reflect a decline in 

the efficiency with which unemployed workers are matched to vacant jobs.14  However, 

given that the apparent decline in matching efficiency coincided with a large reduction in 

job vacancies, the two developments may be related.  In particular, weak labor demand 

may be causing the labor market to operate less efficiently than would typically be the 

case, and matching efficiency may return to normal as demand for workers improves.  

Indeed, historically, matching efficiency does appear to move back toward its long-run 

average over time.15  That said, a persistently high level of long-term unemployment

Haltiwanger (2010).  Possible reasons for a decline in matching efficiency include decreased mobility of 
workers due to the drop in house prices and a mismatch between the skills demanded by businesses and the 
skills offered by unemployed workers.  On the issue of migration rates and mobility, see Kaplan and 
Schulhofer-Wohl (2010).
