The economy normally has some self-correcting mechanisms.  Typically, a drop 

in prices--whether the price of an apple or the price of a house--stimulates demand and 

brings new buyers into the market.  In the case of houses, price declines often occur in 

the context of a broad-based weakness in the overall economy.  In response to 

macroeconomic weakness, the Federal Reserve generally can lower the target federal 

funds rate, which would be expected to lower mortgage rates.  The combination of lower 

prices and lower mortgage rates makes home purchase more affordable and helps revive 

the housing market.  Indeed, most recent recoveries have been led by housing.  But for a 

variety of reasons, these mechanisms are not working fully in todayâ€™s economy.  When 

crafting solutions, it is helpful to first identify areas where removing some obstacles 

might enable these self-correcting mechanisms to operate more productively. 

Refinancing Existing Mortgages at Lower Rates 

One way to reduce the flow of foreclosed homes is to ease the payment strain on 

borrowers, which can be accomplished by modifying loans that are past due or by 

refinancing performing loans at lower rates.  The Federal Reserve has already acted to 

lower longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, through the purchase of 

longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities.  In 

addition to enabling more buyers to purchase homes, low mortgage rates act to reduce the 

debt service cost of existing household debt.  However, while refinancing activity has 

picked up in response to the lower rates, the pickup has been subdued compared with past 

low-rate environments.  That is, even though mortgage rates on many outstanding loans 

are well above current market rates, many borrowers have not been able to take
