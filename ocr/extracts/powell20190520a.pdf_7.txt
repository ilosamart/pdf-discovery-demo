risk insolvency.  At best, they will cut back on lending to other borrowers, dragging the 

economy down.  At worst, they will fail, which can lead to severe economic damage to 

households and businesses.  Finally, when the financial system funds long-maturity assets 

with short-maturity liabilities, we risk a classic “fast burn” crisis—a bank run, or its 

equivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking.2   

In our framework, the story of the mid-2000s goes something like this:  Amid a 

self-reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion, households 

borrowed (and lenders lent) far too much, and property prices rose far too high.  Financial 

institutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much.  And the financial sector was 

highly susceptible to a run because it funded risky, long-maturity mortgages with 

extended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short-

maturity liabilities.   

Let’s compare this story with the current situation using our four-point checklist, 

beginning with borrowing by businesses and households.  Business debt has grown faster 

than gross domestic product (GDP) for several years and today is high.  But the growth in 

the ratio of business debt to GDP in the past decade is much less than the growth in 

household debt to GDP that we saw in the run-up to the Global Financial Crisis.  Back 

then, household debt grew from 60 percent of GDP to 90 percent, or by half (figure 5).  

At its recent low, business debt was 65 percent of GDP.  Now, even after rapid growth, it 

is still below 75 percent of GDP.  Overall, the increase in business debt relative to the
