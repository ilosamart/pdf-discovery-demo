where it changes materially as a result of the addition of more complex or higher-risk strategies, 

more frequent contact may be appropriate.   

Early feedback from bankers and examiners regarding the program has been largely 

positive.  For example, bankers have noted that examiners seem to better understand their 

institutions, that the exam work undertaken better reflects the individual institutions being 

examined, and that the time spent by examiners at the banks has decreased.  We will be 

conducting a review of the program this summer to determine if adjustments are needed. 

Our examiners have observed increased consumer compliance risk where community 

banks move into products that are less congruent with bank-customer relationships in the 

traditional community bank business model, such as prepaid cards or credit card add-on 

products.  Similarly, risks can arise where a bank relies upon third-party providers for core 

banking services or products that the bank does not have the resources or expertise to undertake 

in-house.  Of course, when properly chosen and managed, the use of third-party providers is not 

only acceptable, but desirable for important services such as cybersecurity.  But reliance upon 

third parties to broaden a bankâ€™s scope of operations can pose supervisory concerns when the 

bank itself does not have adequate capacity to vet and monitor these vendors.5  For example, a 

bank that relies upon a third party to provide a loan processing system or to conduct compliance 

audits may face increased risks because the bank no longer has direct control over these 

activities.   

Simplifying the Regulatory Regime for Community Banks 

  In the wake of the financial crisis, the overall aim of the Dodd-Frank Act was to 

strengthen the regulation of banks and certain other parts of the financial system.  A key
