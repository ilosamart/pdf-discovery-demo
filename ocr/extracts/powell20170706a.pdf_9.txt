percent of their total assets.  Under rigorous annual stress tests, they must demonstrate a high 

level of understanding of their risks and the ability to manage them, and must survive severely 

adverse economic scenarios with high levels of post-stress capital.  And they must file regular 

resolution plans that have made them significantly more resolvable should they fail.  These 

measures were implemented to reduce the risk that a future crisis will result in taxpayer support, 

and to help ensure that the financial system could continue to function even in the event that one 

of these banks were to default.   

It is ironic that the housing finance system should escape fundamental reform efforts.  

The housing bubble of the early 2000s was, after all, an essential proximate cause of the crisis.  

Housing is the single largest asset class in our financial system, with total outstanding residential 

real estate owned by households of $24 trillion and roughly $10 trillion in single-family 

mortgage debt.8  While post-crisis regulation has addressed mortgage lending from a consumer 

protection standpoint, the important risks to taxpayers and the broader economy and financial 

system have not been robustly addressed.   

The most obvious and direct step forward would be to require ample amounts of private 

capital to support housing finance activities, as we do in the banking system.  We should also 

strive for a system that can continue to function even in the event of a default of any firm.  No 

single housing finance institution should be too big to fail.     

Greater amounts of private capital could come through a variety of sources, including 

through the entry of multiple private guarantors who would insure a portion of the credit risk,
