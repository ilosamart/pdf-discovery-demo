They hold higher levels of liquidity as well and are much less reliant on runnable short-term 

funding.  They are subject to rigorous, forward-looking capital stress tests that recognize the 

dynamic nature of financial risks.  And they have submitted several rounds of resolution plans 

that are helping to ensure that they could be safely reorganized should all these other safeguards 

prove insufficient.    

  Our financial market infrastructures are also much stronger.  The amount of intraday 

credit extended in the triparty repo market has been drastically reduced.  Last year, the Securities 

and Exchange Commission implemented reforms that address weaknesses in the structure of 

prime money funds.  And about 75 percent of interest rate and credit default swaps are now 

centrally cleared, which allows for greater transparency and more consistent risk management.6  

While the move to central clearing has made the system safer, we need to make sure that the 

central counterparties have the resources and risk-management practices to withstand plausible 

but severe shocks.7 

Many of the statutory provisions and regulations put in place to effect these changes were 

novel; it is not likely that we would have gotten everything exactly right on the first attempt.  

This is a good time to step back and ask what changes have worked and where adjustments 

should be made.  Indeed, along with the other financial regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve 

is contributing to just such an exercise by the Treasury Department.  As I share some of my 

views on these issues, I should emphasize that I speak for myself and not for my Board 

colleagues or for the new colleagues who will soon join us.

7 The Alternative Reference Rates Committee is working to strengthen another key segment of the financial 
infrastructure.  The Committee will select its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (or, 
LIBOR) and is expected to complete its plans to promote the use of this rate this year.
