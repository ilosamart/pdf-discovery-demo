Within this structure, the Federal Reserve will play an important role.  We will 

supervise all systemically important institutions and, jointly with other regulators in the 

new Financial Stability Oversight Council, establish stricter prudential standards for such 

firms.  We will help ensure the safety of financial market utilities that are critical to our 

payment, clearing, and settlement systems.  And we will actively support the council’s 

mission to identify and address emerging risks to financial stability.  At the same time, 

though, we must take care to preserve incentives for innovation and reasonable risk-

taking.  We must remain prudent, while avoiding an overly strict approach that unduly 

impedes financial intermediation and stifles capital formation.  

Vigilance to threats of systemic financial risk must also inform the conduct of 

monetary policy.  We have seen that the eruption of a financial crisis can have severe 

economic consequences, compromising the ability of a central bank to attain its primary 

macroeconomic objectives.  Monetary policymakers should also be aware that the 

decisions they make in pursuit of price stability and full employment could, in some 

circumstances, affect the development of systemic risk.  For example, if compensation 

incentives in the financial sector are misaligned, low interest rates might heighten the 

ability and desire of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk.   

Our goal should be to deploy an enhanced arsenal of regulatory tools to address 

systemic risk, making the financial system far more robust.  That way, monetary policy 

can concentrate on its long-standing goals of price stability and maximum employment.  

Supervision and regulation must serve as the first and main line of defense in addressing 

systemic risk.  We have at our disposal a tool kit of regulatory instruments that are well 

adapted for this purpose.  Monetary policy cannot be a primary instrument for systemic
