in March and April, private nonfarm payroll employment rose by only 41,000 in May.  

Employers, however, continue to lengthen workweeks for existing employees.  Notably, 

the workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers in manufacturing reached its 

highest level since July 2000, and overtime hours per worker now stand at pre-recession

and the OIS (overnight indexed swap) rate widened and commercial paper rates for many 

issuers jumped.  Investors became decidedly less willing to provide funds at longer 

tenors. 

Treasury yields fell to near historic lows, in part as investors sought refuge in 

dollar-denominated, highly liquid, safe-haven assets.  Equity prices, reacting to increased 

risk and prospects for weaker global growth, also fell.  Broad equity price indexes

investors may have experienced one scare too many; outflows from equity mutual funds 

appear to rival the retreat in late 2008.  Risk spreads on U.S. investment-grade and high-

yield bond prices rose, and corporate bond issuance fell to about half the run-rate of 

earlier this year.  Broad measures of industrial commodity prices decreased substantially
