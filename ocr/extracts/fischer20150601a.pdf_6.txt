The argument was that the central bank could not reduce the interest rate below zero, 

since at a zero interest rate people could hold currency, on which the nominal interest rate 

is zero – which implies that the nominal interest rate could not decline below zero.    

Almost immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Fed began to 

undertake policies of Quantitative Easing (QE), in two forms: first, by buying assets of 

longer duration on a large scale, thus lowering longer term rates and making monetary 

policy effectively more expansionary; and second, by operating as market maker of last 

resort in markets that in the panic had seemed to stop working – for example, the 

commercial paper market.   

Did these policies work?  The econometric evidence says yes.  So does the evidence 

of one’s eyes.  For instance, the recent inauguration of the ECB’s QE policy seemed to 

have an immediate effect not only on European interest rates, but also on longer-term 

rates in the United States. 

More recently, policymakers in several jurisdictions have discovered that zero is not 

the lower bound on interest rates.  The reason is that it is not costless to hold currency: 

there are costs of storage, and insurance costs to cover the potential for theft of or damage 

to the currency.  We do not know how low the interest rate can go – but do know that it 

can go below zero.  Whether it can be reduced much below minus one percent remains to 

be seen – and many would prefer that we don’t go there.5   

                                                 
5 There are fascinating issues about how a hypothetical monetary system without currency would operate, 
and what interest rates the central bank should attempt to control in such a situation – but we will have to 
leave those issues for another occasion.
