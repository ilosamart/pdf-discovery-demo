statements that it expected to keep the funds rate target at exceptionally low levels “for an 

extended period.” 

Figure 2 reproduces panels from the April 2011 Tealbook that show the staff’s 

baseline forecast--the solid black line--as well as prescriptions from three simple policy 

rules that were generated using the FRB/US model.17  The panel on the left shows the 

paths for the federal funds rate, while the panels on the right show the implications of 

those policy prescriptions for the unemployment rate and core PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) price inflation, respectively.18 

Each of the rules is regarded as mainstream.  Note that there are substantial 

differences in the prescribed policy paths, both in terms of how long the interest rate 

remains near zero as well as how gradual or rapid is the pace of tightening once the 

interest rate begins to increase.  Those differences produce different outcomes for 

unemployment and inflation, as can be seen in the two panels on the right of figure 2. 

                                                 
17 The three rules are the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the “balanced approach 

rule”), and the first-difference rule.  The Taylor (1993) rule is * *0.5 ( ) 0.5R r y         , where R  

is the nominal federal funds rate; *r  is the equilibrium real interest rate;   is the four-quarter PCE price 
inflation rate; *  is the inflation objective, 2 percent; and y  is the output gap, defined as the percentage 

difference between actual GDP and potential GDP.  The Taylor (1999) rule is identical to the Taylor (1993) 

rule except that the coefficient of 0.5 on the output gap is replaced by a coefficient of 1.0; see Yellen 

(2017) for a brief discussion.  The first-difference rule is

  represents a four-quarter change in the variable that follows and t j t  indicates the j-period-ahead 

forecast of the variable that precedes, given information that is available at date t.  The first-difference rule 

is seen as a robust alternative to other simple rules because it does not rely on estimates of the natural rate 

of interest or the level of potential GDP.  The appendix to the April 2011 Tealbook provides details on each 

of these rules. 
18 In the end, the unemployment rate and inflation did not turn out to be greatly different from what is 

shown in figure 2, although the shocks borne by the economy required a more accommodative stance of 

policy to bring about those outcomes.  For an explanation of how the FOMC interprets its statutory goals, 

see the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” which the Committee first issued 

in January 2012 and reaffirms each year.  The 2016 statement is available on the Board’s website at
