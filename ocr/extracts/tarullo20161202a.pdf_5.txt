If anyone harbored remaining doubts, it was clear by October that the nation’s financial 

system faced not just severe liquidity problems, but a solvency crisis.  In response, following 

enactment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program by Congress, Secretary Henry Paulson oversaw 

the injection of government capital into the nation’s largest financial firms, as well as into many

between, but within, the political parties on how best to respond.  If there was one powerful,
