In recent years, local governments and community-based organizations have 

struggled to counter the effects of foreclosures on neighborhoods.  One tool for 

controlling the temporary condition and ultimate disposition of REO properties is the use 

of a unique kind of entity known as a land bank.4  Land banks are typically public or 

nonprofit entities created to manage properties not dealt with adequately through the 

private market.  The lifespan of these entities may be time-limited with sunset provisions.  

The notion of a land bank, as opposed to a land trust, is that properties are brought in and 

moved out of a land bank’s portfolio rather than permanently preserved.  Using this kind 

of mechanism, a community can gain control of low-value properties that may otherwise 

sit vacant and cause problems for the surrounding neighborhood.  Options available for 

disposing of the properties include physical rehabilitation, some period of rental, sale to 

new owner-occupants or responsible investors, or, in some cases, demolition.  Because it 

likely will take several years for the overhang of vacant homes to be sold, such a strategy 

would help some communities deal with the short-term crisis and then ultimately allow 

for the disposition of properties in a manner suitable to local market conditions in the 

longer term.  

While few land banks currently have the resources to operate at significant scale, 

the land bank model is one that has shown some success and could help many 

communities stabilize troubled properties if used more extensively.  However, although 

such an approach holds promise, the current infrastructure for land banks is limited.
