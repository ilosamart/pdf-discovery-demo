forward guidance concerning its likely future path.  As in its statements since March 

2009, the Committee reiterated last month that “economic conditions, including low rates 

of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are 

likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended 

period.”  In addition, the FOMC has purchased a substantial volume of agency debt, 

agency mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury securities.  The Committee 

initiated a second round of Treasury purchases last November and has indicated that it 

intends to complete those purchases by the end of June.  My reading of the evidence is 

that these securities purchases have proven effective in easing financial conditions, 

thereby promoting a stronger pace of economic recovery and checking undesirable 

disinflationary pressures. 

I believe this accommodative policy stance is still appropriate because 

unemployment remains elevated, longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored, 

and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low relative to the rate of 2 percent or 

a bit less that Committee participants judge to be consistent over the longer term with our 

statutory mandate.  However, there can be no question that sometime down the road, as 

the recovery gathers steam, it will become necessary for the FOMC to withdraw the 

monetary policy accommodation we have put in place.  That process will involve both 

raising the target federal funds rate over time and gradually normalizing the size and 

composition of our security holdings.  Importantly, we are confident that we have the 

tools in place to withdraw monetary stimulus, and we are prepared to use those tools 

when the right time comes.
