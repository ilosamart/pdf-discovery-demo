proposed deep tax cuts, which, if implemented, could amount to about 2 percentage

suggest that the supply-side effects of these policies would be fairly small, so, if enacted, 

the net effect could well be a boost to U.S. aggregate demand at a time when the 

economy could be at full employment.  Nonetheless, there is considerable uncertainty 

about the magnitude and timing of any policy changes.  There is also important 

uncertainty about the deliberations over the debt limit, which are likely to garner 

increasing attention in the early fall and will factor into my considerations of risks to the
