household purchasing power as well.  Simple calculations suggest that the average 

household has gained some $1,300 in purchasing power since mid-2014 from the fall in 

gasoline prices.7  With continuing gains in disposable income and wealth, I expect 

consumer spending to grow at a solid rate.  I also expect the housing sector to make 

further progress.  Both home sales and construction have been gradually improving, and 

residential investment made a noticeable contribution to GDP growth over the past year.  

Housing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is still 

difficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hard-to-document income, 

those with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms.8  

And fiscal policy at the combined national, state, and local levels, which subtracted from 

GDP growth for much of recovery, is now a small positive.   

 Economists often say, “on the other hand.”  So, in keeping with that tradition, I’ll 

now turn to the less-positive.  Economic developments abroad have significantly 

restrained growth in the United States over the past year, although I am cautiously 

optimistic that these headwinds are now fading.  Concerns about slowing growth in China 

and falling commodity prices, which afflicted global financial markets early this year and 

thus likely weighed on demand, appear to have eased somewhat.  Indicators suggest that 

foreign economies are growing, if still at only a moderate pace, and foreign financial 

markets have recovered and stabilized.  That said, net exports have been a drag on U.S. 

GDP growth over the past year and are likely to continue to weigh on growth over the 

                                                 
7 In 2013, according to the Energy Information Agency, households purchased about 730 gallons per 
household on average.  Applying the drop in gasoline prices since the first half of 2014, savings per 
household averaged about $110 in the second half of 2014, $780 in 2015, and another $420 through May of 
this year, implying a cumulative overall gain of more than $1,300 per household on average.   
8 Housing could receive another boost if there were a continued revival in the rate of new household 
formation, which has been depressed since the recession as young adults have delayed moving out of their 
parents’ homes.
