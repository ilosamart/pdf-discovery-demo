confirm that children who grow up in areas with better-quality K-12 schools or in classes 

with higher-quality teachers have better outcomes in life.7 

Later in life, workforce training and education are most effective when they train 

workers in skills needed by local employers.  Rural areas where traditional industries are 

declining and where new employers may be moving in often experience a mismatch 

between the skills of local workers and those demanded by the new employers.  Training 

and retraining programs tend to be centralized and concentrated in areas with a higher 

population density, which puts many rural areas at a disadvantage.8  

Education benefits both the student and the community.  It is true that some 

young people leave their hometowns to seek greater opportunity.  However, it is also true 

that young families, drawn back home by family and social ties, are the largest source of 

in-migration in many rural communities.  Young families are more likely to come if they 

believe their children will get a good education.  Returnees often bring back important 

skills and experiences and make meaningful contributions to the local economy.9
