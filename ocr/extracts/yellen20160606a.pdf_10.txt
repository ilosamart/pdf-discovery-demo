the future just as we have been surprised in the past.  Four areas of uncertainty seem 

particularly salient at present. 

The first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand.  The U.S. 

economy has performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance 

has relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand, consumer spending in 

particular.  So an important question is whether the U.S. economy could continue to 

make progress amid fairly considerable global bumpiness.  I continue to think that the 

answer to that question is yes, but the weak investment performance in recent months is 

concerning, and Fridayâ€™s employment report provides another reminder that the question 

is still relevant. 

The second uncertainty pertains to the economic situation abroad.  Even though 

the financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this year have eased, 

global risks require continued attention.  Much of the turmoil early this year appeared to 

be associated with concern over the outlook for Chinese growth, which in turn has broad 

implications for commodity prices and global economic growth.  Recently, the renminbi 

has moved in a more predictable fashion and Chinese capital outflows have abated.  

However, it is widely acknowledged that China faces considerable challenges as it 

continues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and consumption.   

More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and 

already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor 

perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly.  One development that could 

shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom.  A U.K. 

vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions.
