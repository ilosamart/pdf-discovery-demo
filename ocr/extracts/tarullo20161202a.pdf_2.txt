Last summer, when I accepted President Loretta Mester’s invitation to speak at this 

conference, I thought it would be a good occasion to step back and assess where we stand in our 

post-crisis efforts to promote financial stability in the United States.  This morning I will offer 

such an assessment.  I will begin by reviewing what has been accomplished.  Then I will suggest 

how to approach the work that remains--including both tackling continuing vulnerabilities to 

financial stability and rationalizing the measures that have already been taken. 

The Crisis and Its Aftermath 

 To understand where we stand today, we should recall why we embarked on these efforts 

in the first place.  There is little mistaking the motivation--it was the magnitude of the 

destruction wrought by the financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed it.  The 

resulting losses in employment were on a scale not seen since the Great Depression.  One model 

used by Federal Reserve staff1 estimates that cumulative loss in output relative to potential over 

the period was on the order of one quarter of a year’s worth of economic output.2  While we 

cannot be certain that these losses were due solely to the financial crisis, losses of this magnitude 

appear broadly in line with estimates of the effects of prior financial crises.3  Moreover, the 

shortfalls in jobs and income relative to potential may understate the total losses, as many current 

                                                           
1 This estimate is from the FRB/US model, which is one model of the U.S. economy used by staff at the Federal 
Reserve Board.  For a description of the model and access to the data, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm.  
2 Losses attributable to the Great Recession have been estimated using different metrics and range widely.  For 
example, one 2013 study suggests that total U.S. losses from the financial crisis could range from 40 to 90 percent of 
a year’s worth of economic output, or $6 to $14 trillion.  Tyler Atkinson, David Luttrell, and Harvey Rosenblum
