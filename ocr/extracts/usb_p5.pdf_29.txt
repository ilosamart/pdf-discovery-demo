Examinations of entities of FBOs should be
conducted using existing regulatory policies and
procedures for domestically-chartered bank com-
pliance examinations. Examiner guidelines for
conducting compliance examinations and inves-
tigating consumer complaints are contained, for
example, in the Board of Governor’s Consumer
Compliance Handbook and various supervisory
Consumer Affairs letters. These guidelines
describe the examination procedures to be used
in connection with loan file sampling, reporting
and correcting violations, and rating branches
for compliance. Of particular importance are
violations that require reimbursement of over-
charges and violations that trigger corrective
action under the Board’s Regulation B/Fair
Housing Act Policy Guide.

Following is a description of some of the
regulations and consumer protection laws that
Federal Reserve System examiners enforce. This
information is provided primarily as reference
material; examiners should consult the detailed
handbooks mentioned earlier for specific exami-
nation guidance in this area.

Regulation B/Equal Credit
Opportunity Act

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits
discrimination against an applicant for credit
because of age, sex, marital status, religion,
race, color, national origin, or receipt of public
assistance. It also prohibits discrimination
because of a good faith exercise of any rights
under the federal consumer credit laws. The law
also contains notification requirements for con-
sumers and small businesses that have been
denied credit.

Regulation C/Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires
certain lending branches to report annually on
their originations and purchases of home pur-
chase and home improvement loans and appli-
cations for such loans. The type of loan, location
of property, race or national origin, sex, and
income of the applicant or borrower are reported
to supervisory agencies. Branches are required
to make information regarding their lending

available to the public and must post a notice of
availability in their public lobby.

Regulation E/Electronic Funds
Transfer Act

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act provides
consumer protection for all transactions using a
debit card or other electronic means to debit or
credit an account. For example, it also limits a
consumer’s liability for unauthorized electronic
fund transfers, restricts issuance of debit cards,
and requires certain disclosures.

Regulation Z/Truth In Lending Act

Regulation Z implements the federal Truth in
Lending Act, which is contained in Title I of the
Consumer Protection Act and Section 1204 of
the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987.

The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure
of certain costs and terms of credit including the
finance charge and the annual percentage rate so
that a consumer can compare the prices of credit
from different sources. It also limits liability on
lost or stolen credit cards. In addition, it pro-
vides consumers the right to cancel certain
home-secured loans. Over the years, the Truth in
Lending Act has been amended by several acts.
A summary of the provisions of each of the Acts
follows.

Consumer Leasing Act

The Consumer Leasing Act requires disclosure
of certain costs and terms of consumer leases, so
that consumers can compare the prices of leas-
ing from different sources.

Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure
Act

The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act
requires disclosures on (1) credit and charge
cards and (2) applications and pre-approved
solicitations for cards, whether issued by finan-
cial institutions, retail stores, or private compa-
nies. Information such as APRs, annual fees,
and grace periods must be provided in tabular
form. The Act also requires card issuers that
