statistics indicate that, perhaps surprisingly, the average number of banks in rural markets 

has actually increased in the past 20 years.    

If we look at the number of bank branches rather than the number of competitors, 

we see a significant increase in the number of branches in the average urban market, with 

the entire increase coming from branches of large banks (figure 11).  Over the same 

period, there was essentially no change in the number of branches in rural markets, with a 

slight shift upward in the share of branches accounted for by large banks (figure 12).  Of 

course, there is substantial variation in the experiences of individual markets, as some 

local rural and urban markets gained and others lost bank branches.  

As the share of branches in the average banking market operated by community 

banks has declined, so, too, has the share of deposits held at community banks.  This shift 

in deposit shares away from community banks, similar to the shift in branch shares, has 

been substantial in urban markets but only marginal in rural markets (figure 13).  

Community banks held almost half of all deposits at urban bank branches in 1997, but 

just over one-third in 2017.  In rural markets, community banks collectively had a deposit 

market share of 80 percent in 1997, declining moderately to 77 percent in 2017. 

Despite the decline in the overall share of deposits held by community banks in 

urban and rural markets over the past 20 years, the average individual community bank 

operating in each type of market has seen almost no change in its deposit market share 

(figure 14).  In other words, the decline in the share of market deposits held in aggregate 

by community banks is due to fewer community banks.  The fact that the average 

individual community bank has maintained or increased its deposit market share since
