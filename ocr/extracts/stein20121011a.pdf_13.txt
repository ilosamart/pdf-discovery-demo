So a key question is to what extent removing long-term Treasury securities is like 

removing currency.  This question is hard to answer precisely and depends on the details 

of how you tell the story.  If you believe that only nominal Treasury securities--but not 

something similar, such as agency securities or AAA-rated corporate bonds--provide 

money-like services to investors, you can try to measure the value of these services by 

looking at the spread on Treasury securities relative to something else that is very safe 

but not literally a Treasury bond--for example, corporate bonds coupled with credit 

default swap protection to minimize the credit risk.  Arvind Krishnamurthy and Annette 

Vissing-Jørgensen of Northwestern University take this approach and conclude that 

between 24 and 70 basis points of the yield premium on Treasury securities is attributable 

to a “money-ness” effect.16  Numbers in this ballpark suggest that the costs of further 

LSAPs on this dimension are likely to be modest relative to even a conservative estimate 

of their potential benefits.   

However, a couple of caveats are worth noting.  First, this methodology may only 

provide a lower bound on the welfare costs of an LSAP, as it is plausible that not just 

Treasury securities, but also agency securities and perhaps highly rated corporate bonds, 

also have some degree of money-ness to them in terms of being useful in satisfying safe-

haven demands.  In this case, a spread of the sort just described may underestimate the 

value of monetary services provided by safe and near-safe assets.  This area is one where 

                                                                                                                                                 
effectively by short-term bills or reserves.  If all safe assets provide the same kind of monetary services, 
then an LSAP that swaps reserves for long-term bonds has no effect on the net supply of monetary assets.  
See also Woodford (2012) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2012). 
15 Friedman (1969) famously argued that a socially efficient outcome involves setting the opportunity cost 
to investors of holding money equal to the marginal cost to the government of creating additional money. 
16 Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen’s (2012) analysis is based on market quotes from July 20, 2012. 
One obtains similar estimates if their methodology is updated to the present.  However, it is important to 
emphasize that spreads of the sort they study can be subject to a variety of other idiosyncratic influences, so 
care must be taken not to over-interpret any one of them.
