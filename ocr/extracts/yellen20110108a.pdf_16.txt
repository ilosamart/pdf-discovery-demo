This concern deserves to be taken seriously, and the Federal Reserve is carefully 

monitoring financial indicators for signs of potential threats to financial stability.  While 

there is no single metric we can use to assess these threats, standard financial market 

indicators do not currently signal significant excesses or imbalances in the United States.  

In the stock market, for example, price-to-earnings ratios, by some measures, remain 

below their averages over the past several decades, and other valuation measures also 

indicate that equity prices are not significantly out of alignment with past norms.  In the 

real estate market, price-to-rent ratios for both residential and commercial real estate are 

now within a reasonable range of their long-run averages, in contrast to the severe 

misalignment that occurred prior to the crisis. Again, there is little sign here of 

imbalances relative to fundamentals, at least if history is used as a guide.  In fixed-

income markets, narrow risk spreads and risk premiums could be signs of excessive risk-

taking by investors, and indeed spreads on corporate bonds have dropped dramatically 

since the financial crisis, as the economic outlook has improved and investor sentiment 

has picked up.  Risk premiums on nonfinancial corporate bonds, as measured by forward 

spreads far in the future, are relatively low compared with historical norms, although 

other indicators for this market do not point to overvaluation. 

An alternative way to identify imbalances is to focus more directly on measuring 

credit flows and exposures to credit risk.  Extraordinarily rapid credit growth may be a 

sign that financial institutions are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets.  In recent 

months, nonfinancial corporations have issued large amounts of bonds and syndicated 

leveraged loans, and banksâ€™ provision of consumer credit has shown some signs of 

reviving.  Nonetheless, a portion of the recent corporate issuance has been used to
