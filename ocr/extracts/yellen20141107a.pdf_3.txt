which will boost pension obligations and health-care expenditures in coming years.  

Moreover, government debt levels were already high in Japan and in some European 

economies and not particularly low elsewhere.  In addition, some euro-area countries that 

appeared to have strong fiscal positions going into the crisis depended partly on revenue 

from housing booms that soon went bust.   

The Policy Response to the Crisis 

 When the crisis hit, its global scope and severity were exceptional.  Central banks 

in the United States and other countries responded by rapidly and sharply reducing their 

policy interest rates, lowering them in many cases to near zero.  In addition, in their role 

as lenders of last resort, central banks acted rapidly to provide liquidity to help stabilize 

the financial system and support the flow of credit to households and businesses, in some 

cases creating new lending facilities.  These extraordinary and creative responses showed 

that monetary policymakers had internalized the lessons of the Great Depression. 

Initially, fiscal policy also provided significant stimulus.  A portion of this 

stimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers--higher unemployment benefits, 

for example, and a decline in tax payments due to lower incomes--and some came 

through cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending.  Expansive fiscal policy 

served to raise deficits in most countries, some of which faced further costs from 

stabilizing financial institutions, pushing deficits even higher.  Sharp increases in deficits 

led in turn to escalating levels of government debt.   

Policy during the Recovery 

 The combination of increasing debt and depressed output led to rising ratios of 

debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in many advanced economies and heightened 

concern about whether the growth in debt could be sustained without unsettling financial
