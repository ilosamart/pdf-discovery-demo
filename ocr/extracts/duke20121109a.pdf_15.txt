In addition to the capital proposals that I discussed earlier, community banks will be 

affected by a number of provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, such as those covering escrow 

accounts for higher-priced mortgages,16 loan officer compensation, and appraisal requirements. 

Within the escrow requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act did provide for an exemption for banks in 

rural or underserved areas, but I think broader exemptions for community banks should be 

considered.  

The definitions of qualified mortgages (QMs) and qualified residential mortgages 

(QRMs) could have a profound effect on the mortgage terms offered and the underwriting 

conditions for all banks.  To the extent that these definitions constrain community bankers from 

using their experience with the cash flows from a small business customer or their knowledge of 

local real estate markets to customize a loan for an “irregular” situation, such loans may not be 

made.  I do not mean to suggest that community banks are the only ones making good loans or 

that there weren’t any problems in small banks.  But I do believe that the contribution of 

community banks to mortgage lending abuses was proportionately small and that problematic 

practices in smaller banks can be addressed through on-site supervision.  And I also believe that 

many community banks simply do not have the resources to appropriately comply with all of the 

pending regulatory changes pertaining to mortgage lending.  Thus, the cost of solving the 

problem falls disproportionately on them. 

Conclusion: A Separate Set of Rules for Mortgage Loans Held by Community Banks

 In mortgage lending, crafting a regulatory approach that is effective in preventing abuse 

but that leaves room for traditional community bank lending is challenging.  And designing 

appropriate exemptions is no easier.  I have presented evidence today indicating that community

collect and pay taxes, insurance premiums, or other charges with respect to a mortgage loan.
