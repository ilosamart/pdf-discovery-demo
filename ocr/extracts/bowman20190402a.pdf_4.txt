about the vital importance of community banking and the essential role community banks 

play in our financial system.   

Community banks are frequently the economic engines supporting and driving the 

economies of many communities, especially in rural areas.  In these communities, they 

are the primary providers of financial services for individuals and small businesses, and a 

source of financial advice and civic leadership.  They play an indispensable role in areas 

not served by larger institutions and in other communities of all different sizes, from 

urban to rural, serving a range of customers, including some that are sometimes not as 

high a priority for larger banks.   

I think it is important to note, and too often overlooked, that the vast majority of 

community banks managed their risks well in the years leading up to and during the 

financial crisis and were not the source of the excessive risk taking that caused the crisis.  

For this reason among others, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in an active effort to 

tailor regulations, including those issued in the wake of the financial crisis, to 

appropriately reflect the potential risk that an institution might pose to financial stability.   

I am pleased to see some evidence we are making progress.  Last year’s CSBS 

survey found that community banks reported a decrease in regulatory costs in 2017.2   

This was the first reduction in burden reported since the survey began in 2014.  The 

decline was attributed to the implementation of changes stemming from the recent review 

by the banking agencies under the EGRPRA, the Economic Growth and Regulatory 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996.  There has been progress in tailoring regulations that
