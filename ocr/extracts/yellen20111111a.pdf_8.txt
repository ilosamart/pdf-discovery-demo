efficient intermediation, but they may also raise systemic risk if they increase the 

complexity and interconnectedness of the financial system. 

Authorities need to collect data and monitor risks associated with new products 

before the risks become salient.  To improve the quality of financial-sector data and 

facilitate the analysis of data for the FSOC and its member agencies, the Dodd-Frank Act

initiated a project to design a global classification system based on unique legal entity 

identifiers to identify parties to financial contracts.  This system would allow market 

participants to better measure on a consolidated basis their counterparty risk across 

products and other dimensions.  In addition, the SEC and the Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission recently issued a new reporting form for hedge funds and certain 

other private investment funds, which will provide more information on their size, 

concentration, funding, and investments; this additional information should shed some 

valuable light on an important segment of the financial sector for which we have not had 

consistent data.   

Identifying and Addressing Cyclical Forms of Systemic Risk 

Turning next to cyclical forms of systemic risk, we are working to develop good 

measures of such risks, to monitor them on an ongoing basis, and to be aware of how 

they could unwind in a destabilizing way.  On that score, at the Federal Reserve, we 

regularly monitor measures of leverage and maturity mismatch at financial 

intermediaries, and we look at asset valuations, underwriting standards for loans, and

various systemic risk measures for the largest banking firms.  These measures capture
