We believe that revisions to the CRA’s implementing regulations should more effectively

Conclusion 

To summarize my main points today, people in rural communities who are 

struggling with persistent poverty need access to high-quality education from preschool 

through college.  They need support for their aspirations to own their own businesses.  

And they need access to safe and affordable credit.   

I will conclude where I began, by applauding both MVSU and Hope for their 

long-standing contribution toward bettering the lives of the people of Itta Bena and 

similar rural communities.
