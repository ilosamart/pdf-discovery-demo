 The fourth use of financial stability in Dodd-Frank is as a factor to be taken into account 

in various regulatory determinations.  So, for example, the list of considerations in the 

International Banking Act for the Federal Reserve in determining whether to permit the 

establishment of a foreign bank office, or to terminate an existing such office, was augmented 

with a financial stability factor – specifically, whether the home country of a bank that presents a 

risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system has taken, or is taking, appropriate regulatory 

steps to mitigate that risk.20 

 Similarly, Dodd-Frank added “risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial 

system” to the non-exhaustive lists of factors set forth in the Bank Merger Act and the Bank 

Holding Company Act for consideration by banking regulators in evaluating a proposed merger 

or acquisition by a bank or bank holding company.  There are actually three statutory provisions 

governing these transactions – Section 3(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act for bank 

acquisitions by holding companies, Section 4(j) of the Bank Holding Company Act for nonbank 

acquisitions by holding companies, and the Bank Merger Act for mergers by banks.  The 

statutory standards, and thus the import of the factors, are somewhat different.21  In all three 

instances, however, the financial stability factor is not in itself dispositive, in contrast to the 

statutory provisions covering designation of systemically important institutions or special actions 

to address grave threats to financial stability. 

 This brief review shows how ubiquitous the concepts of financial stability and systemic 

risk are in Dodd-Frank.  The law creates or strengthens numerous forms of regulatory authority 

that can be used to control numerous practices or circumstances associated with financial 

instability.  Yet the statute itself provides only limited guidance to regulators on how to 

implement financial stability where it is established as a standard, or how to weigh it against
