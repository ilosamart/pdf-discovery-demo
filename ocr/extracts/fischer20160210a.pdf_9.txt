authority to convert some existing creditor claims into equity in a new bridge institution.  

If liquidity problems arose at the new bridge institution, the FDIC could guarantee the 

institution’s short-term liabilities, or it could act as a lender of last resort using funds 

provided by the Treasury and ultimately repaid by the institution and, if necessary, the 

banking industry through assessments. 

Deciding what authority should be given to a potential lender of last resort 

requires weighing the costs and benefits including, importantly, moral hazard.  Moral 

hazard costs may be substantial, especially when the potential borrower got itself into 

trouble by taking on excessive risk, and especially if the loan is seen as expanding the 

safety net.  But the costs of a disorderly default of a large interconnected firm may also 

be substantial, especially when the financial system is in a fragile state--as was the case in 

the default of Lehman Brothers.   

The best way to deal with those types of situations is to prevent them from 

occurring.  Such prevention requires appropriately tight supervision and regulation, 

consistent with the changes to supervision and regulation introduced in the past five years 

in the United States.  Further, strengthening resolution procedures to the point where they 

can be used to resolve an insolvent institution without causing runs and exacerbating a 

potential crisis is an essential component of the reform strategy underlying the Dodd-

Frank Act.8
