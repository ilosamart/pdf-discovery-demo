Conclusion 

 In conclusion, let me recapitulate one set of points and add another.  To recapitulate--

focusing on the characteristics of the liability side of a financial intermediary’s balance sheet 

suggests that there are reasons to vary capital regulation across different forms of financial 

intermediation, but that significant shifts in the nature and scope of an intermediary’s liabilities 

may in turn provide reasons for varying applicable capital regulation among firms that are 

primarily identified as a particular type of intermediary.  Conceptual, institutional, and practical 

impediments to developing a single framework for capital regulation are doubtlessly insuperable 

for the foreseeable future.  But regulators with mandates covering different kinds of 

intermediaries, including the Federal Reserve, must keep both sides of this perspective in mind.  

And, hopefully, regulators with a more focused responsibility will be sensitive to the ways in 

which their regulated entities have departed from their original liability structure. 

 The additional point follows from the first.  When concerns are raised about regulatory 

arbitrage or a level playing field, they are usually in the context of a similar asset being held, or a 

business activity conducted, by financial firms with different regulatory structures.  My 

discussion today would suggest that attention must be paid to the liability structure of the 

different firms before deciding whether the asymmetric regulatory treatment is prudent or an 

invitation to the propagation of new financial risks. 

 These two points underscore the fact that the question for regulators is not really whether 

capital rules developed for banks should be extended to nonbank actors.  The Basel standards 

have already evolved to take account of different forms of intermediation in the financial firms 

subject to those rules.  The Basel framework might itself be enhanced by further differentiation
