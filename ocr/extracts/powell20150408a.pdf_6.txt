economies since 2008.  The underlying pattern is an interesting one.  Economists and 

policymakers have tended at first to view a decline in output as a cyclical shock to 

demand and to realize only gradually over time that a crisis has done substantial and 

lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.6  As a result, estimates of the 

gap between actual and potential output often narrow over time, partly through higher 

actual output but also through lower estimates of potential.  For example, figure 2 shows 

that the Congressional Budget Office has made a series of downward revisions to its 

estimates of potential output in recent years.7 

This supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in 

the capital stock.8  Long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more 

difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those 

who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out.  

Extended periods of weak demand appear to cause companies to invest less in plant and 

technology, which slows the growth of the productivity of the workforce.  The number of 

new business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of reduced credit availability, 

which may depress hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9  

6 For example, Martin, Munyan, and Wilson show that estimates of potential output generated by common 
filtering techniques tend to revise down following recessions as actual output grows slower than its pre-
recession trend; see Martin, Munyan, and Wilson, “Potential Output and Recessions,” in note 5.  In other 
words, looking backward with many years of hindsight at the evolution of output following a financial 
crisis, the negative effect on potential output is clearer than it is when estimating the level of potential 
output in real time immediately following the crises.  As an example of this type of exercise, see Furceri 
and Mourougane, “Effect of Financial Crises on Potential Output,” in note 5.
