describing how each form of unconventional policy can be helpful in promoting a 

stronger economic recovery.   

Monetary Policy Communication 

An essential element of good monetary policy is effective communication.  In a 

democratic society, central banks have the responsibility to clearly and fully explain their 

policy decisions.  Good communication is also essential for strengthening the 

effectiveness of monetary policy.  Expectations about the future play a key role in the 

decisionmaking of households and firms:  how much to spend, save, work, invest, or hire.  

Moreover, when financial market participants understand how the central bank is likely 

to react to incoming information, asset prices can adjust in ways that reinforce the central 

bank’s expected policy actions and thereby support the central bank’s objectives.  Finally, 

clear communication can help anchor the public’s long-term inflation expectations and 

hence improve the extent to which the central bank can take forceful actions to promote 

job creation in a context of price stability.   

With the federal funds rate constrained by its effective lower bound, effective 

communications with the public have become more important than ever.  Since 2009, the 

Federal Reserve has published the Committee participants’ longer-run projections of the 

inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and economic growth four times a year in 

conjunction with the minutes of FOMC meetings.  Based on their longer-run projections 

for inflation, Committee participants judge that an inflation rate of 2 percent or a bit less, 

as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent 

with our statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
