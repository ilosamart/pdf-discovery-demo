Federal Reserve policy announcements.  As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates 

after Fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in 

the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis).  And because of the dollar’s 

widespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions 

abroad.  Fed policy-related movements in U.S. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond 

yields abroad, such as the German yields shown in the scatterplot on the right.  Such 

spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2  As figure 

2 shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move 

together fairly closely.   

But the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should 

not be overstated.  The Federal Reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect 

global financial markets.  In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the 

originator of monetary policy spillovers.  For example, as seen in figure 3, changes in 

German yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S. 

yields.3  More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate 

six times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S. 

domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global 

conditions and central bank policy abroad.   

Much of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their 

effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs).  Some observers 

                                                 
2 See, for example, Adrian and others (2017) and the IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report 
(2018) for discussion of the transmission of global risk shocks to domestic macroeconomic conditions. 
3 Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) find that about half of the movement in German bund yields in a 
window following ECB monetary policy announcements spills over to U.S. Treasury yields, roughly the 
same magnitude as the spillover of movements in U.S Treasury yields to German bund yields following 
Federal Reserve policy announcements.
