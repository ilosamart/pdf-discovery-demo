moment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade.  

We are therefore conducting a review of the Fed’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications practices.  I will conclude with some thoughts on the review. 

Balance Sheet Normalization 

Between December 2008 and October 2014, the Federal Reserve purchased 

$3.7 trillion in longer-term Treasury and agency securities in order to support the 

economy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer-

term interest rates.  Consistent with the Committee’s long-stated intention, in October 

2017 we started the process of balance sheet normalization.  We began gradually 

reducing the reinvestment of payments received as assets matured or were prepaid, 

allowing our holdings to shrink.  The process of reducing the size of the portfolio is now 

well along. 

To frame the discussion of the final stages of normalization of the size of the 

balance sheet, it is useful to consider what the phrase “normal balance sheet” meant in the 

decades before the crisis.  During that period, the main monetary policy decision for the 

FOMC was choosing a target value for the federal funds rate.  Subject to that choice, the 

Fed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet.  This 

is a feature of “normal” that we are returning to:  After normalization, the size of the 

Fed’s balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities.   

To see what this means, consider figure 1, which shows the size of the Fed’s 

balance sheet through time, as measured by total liabilities.  The values are stated as a 

percentage of the dollar value of GDP, or gross domestic product.1  Liabilities began to 

                                                 
1 The balance sheet had been steady at around 5 percent of GDP since about 1980, as currency slowly grew 
as a share of GDP, but the increase was offset by a decline in reserves.
