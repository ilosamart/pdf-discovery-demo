The FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in January 

and March, in large part reflecting the changes in baseline conditions that I noted earlier.  

In particular, developments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and 

inflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was 

anticipated in December. 

Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the Committee to 

proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.  This caution is especially warranted because, 

with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC’s ability to use conventional monetary 

policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric.  If economic conditions were 

to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise 

its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy.  By contrast, if the 

expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be 

able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds 

rate back to near zero.9 

One must be careful, however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting 

monetary policy at the moment.  Even if the federal funds rate were to return to near zero, 

the FOMC would still have considerable scope to provide additional accommodation.  In 

particular, we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully 

employed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on long-

term interest rates and so support the economy--specifically, forward guidance about the 

                                                 
9 Research suggests that, all else being equal, increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity 
of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates call for greater gradualism under optimal policy than 
would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.  This phenomenon is 
known as “policy attenuation” in the economic literature.  For a discussion, see, for example, Adam and 
Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), Evans and others (2015), and Gust, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2015).
