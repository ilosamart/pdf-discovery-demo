Finally, some of the econometric models used to estimate the current neutral rate, 

or closely related concepts, can also be used to assess whether low neutral rates are likely 

to persist.  While estimates will depend on the model specification, several models 

estimate that the neutral rate will remain low for some time to come.  Laubach and 

Williams, for example, estimate that the natural rate, a concept closely related to the 

neutral rate, likely will remain near zero for the foreseeable future.9 

Why Is the Neutral Rate Low? 

With a variety of estimates suggesting that the neutral rate of interest is likely to 

remain low relative to historical norms for some time, it is important to assess the 

underlying causes and their likely persistence.  There are a host of factors that could lead 

the neutral rate to remain depressed in the longer run--ranging from the low level of 

world real interest rates, which affects the United States via the exchange rate and 

financial market channels, to slow-moving secular trends in the labor force and 

productivity, to persistent changes in risk perceptions stemming from the crisis. 

Although tight domestic credit conditions and concerns about downside risks to 

asset prices and domestic demand were the dominant drivers early in the recovery, the 

foreign outlook has become increasingly important as a source of downward pressure on 

the neutral rate in the past few years.  In addition to concerns about weak demand in 

Japan and the euro area, more recently foreign growth concerns have broadened to 

include China, which is navigating difficult structural as well as cyclical adjustments.  

The financial reverberations from China are adversely affecting commodity exporters and 

                                                 
9 Laubach and Williams define the natural rate as “the real short-term interest rate consistent with the 
economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate supply or demand have abated” 
(2015, p. 2).
