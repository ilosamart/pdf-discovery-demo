racial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall 

unemployment rate falls further.10   

More broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in familiesâ€™ income and wealth.  

According to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the 

average income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with 

$54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.11  Disparities in wealth, 

shown in figure 4, are even larger:  Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016 

were about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $138,000 for 

black families.12  Moreover, these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and 

wealth have generally widened rather than narrowed over the past few decades.  Based on 

SCF data, median family wealth has grown much more rapidly for white families than for 

other families over the past few decades, while median family incomes have risen by 

about the same amount for white, black, and Hispanic families.   

As the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the 

sidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in 

employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.  

                                                 
10 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity 
are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Historical gaps are provided by Cajner and others 
(2017). 
11 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data.  Recent estimates of household income from Current 
Population Survey data and reported by the Census in Semega, Fontenot, and Kollar (2017) are 
qualitatively similar, in that between 2013 and 2016 for both sets of data, family income has increased for 
whites, blacks, and Hispanics (with greater increases, in percentage terms, for black and Hispanic families). 
12 Racial and ethnic differences in median income and wealth are somewhat smaller.  For example, in 2016 
median income for white families was about $61,000, compared with $35,000 for black families and 
$39,000 for Hispanic families.  Median wealth was about $171,000 for white families, compared with 
about $20,000 for black and Hispanic families. The larger gap in average income and wealth than median 
income and wealth reflects a greater concentration of income and wealth among the wealthiest white 
families than for other races and ethnicities.
