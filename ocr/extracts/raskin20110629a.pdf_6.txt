their assets, the highest of any group during the same period.  Combined with widespread 

unemployment, housing and stock price declines, and increasing rates of mortgage 

defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies, the assets of many American families have been 

significantly eroded.  

In addition to losing the value of their savings and assets, a significant number of 

low- and moderate-income families have become financially marginalized as a result of 

the economic crisis.  The percentage of families earning $15,000 per year or less who 

reported that they have no bank account increased between 2007 and 2009 such that more 

than one out of four families were unbanked.5  Families slightly further up the income 

distribution earning between $15,000 and $30,000 per year are also financially 

marginalized: 13 percent report being unbanked and almost 24 percent report being 

underbanked.   

This combination of economic insecurity and financial marginalization has placed 

more low- and moderate-income families right at the well-lit front doorsteps of payday 

lenders and other alternative financial service providers to try to meet their financial 

needs.   

Alternative Financial Services: Convenience vs. Cost 

While alternative financial services may serve the access needs of many 

consumers, they often come at a much higher cost than traditional financial services.  For 

example, the typical payday lender may charge $15 to $20 per $100 borrowed for a two-

week period, translating into annual percentage rates often exceeding 390 percent.
