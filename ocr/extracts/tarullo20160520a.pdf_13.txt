really fit our need for an approach that can--as a practical matter--be developed and implemented 

in the relatively near term. 

These are some of the paths we do not intend to take in formulating capital requirements 

for insurance firms.  The approach we do intend to follow will be elaborated in what I anticipate 

will be an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to be issued in the coming weeks.  As 

I suggested earlier, the ANPR will likely put forward two different methodologies--one for the 

insurance firms that we supervise solely because they own a bank or thrift and the other for the 

firms designated as systemically important. 

A. Insurance Companies Owning a Bank or Thrift: The Building Block Approach 

The Federal Reserve has traditionally set capital requirements for holding companies on a 

consolidated basis.  Among other things, a consolidated capital standard deters firms from 

moving assets around its affiliates in order to take advantage of lower requirements applied to 

different affiliates for particular assets.  Insofar as publicly traded banking organizations are 

required by securities laws to file consolidated, U.S. GAAP-consistent financial statements, there 

is both a parallelism between accounting and capital regulation and a measure of economy in the 

compliance costs of a consolidated capital rule.   

In contrast, most insurance firms subject to our regulation only because they own 

depository institutions do not produce consolidated financial statements.  Furthermore, Congress 

has prohibited the Federal Reserve from requiring insurance firms that file only Statutory 

Accounting Principles (SAP) financial statements to produce U.S. GAAP consolidated financial 

statements.9  Given that these firms have not been designated systemically important and that the 

depository institutions they own tend to be relatively small parts of the total firm, the compliance 

                                                           
9 The SAP are a set of accounting rules for insurance companies established by the NAIC and used to prepare those 
companiesâ€™ financial statements.
