In applying enhanced prudential standards for firms with total assets of more than 

$100 billion, the Congress requires the Board to consider not only size but also capital 

structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, and any other factors the Board 

deems relevant.  While we use similar factors to calibrate the largest firms’ G-SIB 

surcharges, we have not used them more holistically to tailor the overall supervision and 

regulation of large banks that do not qualify as G-SIBs.  Further, consistent with the 

legislation’s tailoring requirements, the Board must proactively consider how firms with 

more than $250 billion in assets that do not qualify as G-SIBs may be more efficiently 

regulated by applying more tailored standards.  

In conjunction with changing regulations, we also need to consider how such 

changes would be reflected in supervisory programs, guidance, and regulatory reporting.  

As supervisors, we need to balance providing appropriate relief to firms with ensuring 

that firms are maintaining resources and risk-management practices so they can be 

resilient under a range of conditions.  We must also ensure we receive the right 

information in a timely manner so we can identify emerging risks. 

A Path Forward 

Banks with Assets between $100 Billion and $250 Billion 

I want to spend the balance of my time focusing on the question I previously 

posed:  On what basis will we decide to apply enhanced prudential standards to firms 

with total assets in the $100-billion to $250-billion range?  The recent legislation directs 

the Board to consider factors other than size for differentiating supervision and regulation 

of large banking organizations.
