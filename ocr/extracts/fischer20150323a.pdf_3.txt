dispersed and allocated to those best able to bear it.  But rather than distributing risk 

widely, these instruments concentrated risk on the balance sheets of a relatively small 

number of highly levered financial institutions.   

As a result, as the subprime crisis developed, market participants pulled back 

from risk taking, leading to deleveraging spirals and fire sales.2  The damage spread 

across the globe.  Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 

international trade collapsed as panic and financial connections transmitted distress 

across borders.3  Of course, the economyâ€™s vulnerabilities did not stem from the private 

sector alone: in the public sector, gaps in the regulatory structure allowed important 

financial institutions to escape comprehensive supervision, and regulators were 

insufficiently focused on the stability of the system as a whole. 

The Federal Reserve responded aggressively to the crisis.4  By the end of 2008, 

the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had reduced the target federal funds rate 

from 5-1/4 percent to, effectively, zero.  The Fed also acted forcefully as the lender of 

last resort--in its traditional role of providing short-term liquidity to depository 

2 For a model in which fire sales can arise from uncertainty about the network of cross-exposures among 
banks, see Caballero and Simsek (2013). 
3 The fallout from the crisis was large even in countries that had not experienced an acute financial crisis.  
As an example, in six Asian countries, including China and India, exports fell more than 30 percent by the 
beginning of 2009, and industrial production declined about 10 percent.  See the discussion of China, India, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan in Coulibaly, Sapriza, and Zlate (2011).  Regarding the role of 
credit conditions in the collapse of international trade, see Chor and Manova (2012). 
4 A key trigger for the crisis was the decline in housing prices, which began in 2006 and led to uncertainty 
about mortgage investments.  In the summer of 2007, two large financial institutions--The Bear Stearns 
Companies, Inc., and BNP Paribas Group--suspended redemptions from certain investment funds, perhaps 
marking the beginning of the financial crisis.  In 2008, the crisis intensified with the near collapse of Bear 
Stearns in March and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings in September; a full-scale financial 
panic ensued across much of the global financial system.
