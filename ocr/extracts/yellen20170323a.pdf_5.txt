would like to briefly mention each, highlighting some of the questions that I believe can 

be informed by the research that will be presented here.   

First, this morning’s panel will address early childhood development and 

education.  In recent years, medicine and social science has revealed more than we ever 

have known before about which factors and experiences in childhood can make a 

difference later in life.  However, many questions demand further attention.  A 

fundamental one is how positive developmental outcomes can be promoted among those 

who were not born into families with socioeconomic advantages.  While we do know 

there are advantages to good quality early childhood education, we should strive to better 

understand what kind of returns on investment this education provides and how to 

maximize these returns.  The answers to these questions may influence thinking about 

how programs and interventions meant to assist kids and their families should be 

structured for maximum effectiveness to help put kids on the road to economic success. 

Second, researchers have explored the effects of neighborhoods and community 

conditions on the development of young people.  Some presenters at this conference will 

share their understanding of how physical surroundings influence personal development.  

For instance, how do the form and quality of community institutions such as schools, 

community centers, and libraries play a role?  What other kinds of community 

characteristics--such as public safety, transportation, and environmental quality--might 

help or hinder general education and financial skill development?  A particularly 

important question is how kids’ home environments affect them in ways that matter for 

their future economic success.  It is also critically important to ask, what kinds of 

interventions have proven track records, and are these programs scalable?
