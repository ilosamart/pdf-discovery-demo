economic growth in the emerging markets is far outstripping growth in the advanced 

economies.5   

In light of the relatively muted recoveries to date in the advanced economies, the 

central banks of those economies have generally continued accommodative monetary 

policies.  Some observers, while acknowledging that an aborted recovery in the advanced 

economies would be highly detrimental to the emerging market economies, have 

nevertheless argued that these monetary policies are generating negative spillovers.  In 

particular, concerns have centered on the strength of private capital flows to many 

emerging market economies, which, depending on their policy responses, could put 

upward pressure on their currencies, boost their inflation rates, or lead to asset price 

bubbles.   

Although policymakers in the emerging markets clearly face important 

challenges, such concerns should be put into perspective.  First, these capital flows have 

been driven by many factors, including expectations of more-rapid growth and thus 

higher investment returns in the emerging market economies than in the advanced 

economies.  Indeed, recent data suggest that the aggregate flows to emerging markets are 

not out of line with longer-term trends.  Second, as I noted earlier, emerging market 

economies have a strong interest in a continued economic recovery in the advanced 

economies, which accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies are 

intended to promote.  Third, policymakers in the emerging markets have a range of 

powerful--although admittedly imperfect--tools that they can use to manage their 

economies and prevent overheating, including exchange rate adjustment, monetary and
