view of this basic premise, it is the law of the land.  Taking that premise as a given, we have to 

ask how to improve the framework of the implementing regulation to make it more workable and 

less burdensome in practice from both a compliance and supervisory perspective.   

 I think we all can agree that the implementing regulation is exceedingly complex.  As one 

example of specifics, among many, the statute and implementing regulation’s approach to 

defining “market making-related activities” rests on a number of complex requirements that are 

difficult or impossible to verify objectively in real time.  As a result, banks spend far too much 

time and energy contemplating whether particular transactions or positions are consistent with 

the Volcker rule.     

Some of you may quite sensibly be asking, “If the deficiencies of the regulation are so 

apparent, how did we get here?”  Despite the best of intentions in crafting the regulations, no one 

seems to be happy with the complex rule we wound up with.  This has a very positive 

consequence:  I have heard nothing but support from all of my regulatory colleagues for the 

proposition that the regulation is overly complex and would benefit from streamlining and 

simplifying to improve its workability in practice.   

We are actively working with our fellow regulators in seeking ways to further tailor and 

to reduce burden, particularly for firms that do not have large trading operations and do not 

engage in the sorts of activities that may give rise to proprietary trading.  We also appreciate the 

broad extraterritorial impact of the rule in its current form for foreign banks’ operations outside 

of the United States.  To that end, we have, with the full cooperation of all five Volcker 

regulatory agencies, picked back up the process that was begun last fall to engage in a 

rulemaking process subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and develop a proposal for 

public comment that would make material changes to the Volcker rule regulations.  In that
