from sizable increases in gasoline prices, inflation has been subdued in recent months.  

While the jump in energy prices is pushing up inflation temporarily, I anticipate that 

subsequently inflation will run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for the 

foreseeable future.  Let’s examine the economic outlook in greater detail before 

considering how that outlook shapes my views on appropriate policy. 

Starting with the labor market, as I mentioned, there have been encouraging signs 

of improvement in recent months.  The unemployment rate had hovered around 9 percent 

for much of last year but moved down in the fall and averaged 8-1/4 percent in the first 

three months of this year, about 1-3/4 percentage points lower than its peak during the 

recession.  And even though the latest employment report was somewhat disappointing, 

private sector payrolls expanded, on average, by about 210,000 per month in the first 

quarter, up from gains averaging around 150,000 per month during most of 2011.  Other 

labor market indicators have shown similar improvement.   

This news is certainly welcome, yet it must be kept in perspective.  Our economy 

is recovering from the steepest and most prolonged economic downturn since the 1930s, 

and these job gains still leave us far short of where we need to be.  The level of private 

payrolls remains nearly 5 million below its pre-recession peak, and the unemployment 

rate stands well above levels that I, and most analysts, judge as normal over the longer 

run.   

Figure 1 shows the unemployment rate together with the outlook of professional 

forecasters from last month’s Blue Chip survey.

quarterly forecasts for 2014, we interpolate the annual projections reported in the March survey.  According
