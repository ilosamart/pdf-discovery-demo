United States.  Many of us are old enough to remember when the only challenge was to 

keep inflation low.  But too-low inflation can also be a serious problem.  Below-target 

inflation increases the real value of debts owed by households and businesses and reduces 

the ability of central banks to respond to downturns.     

The public’s expectations about inflation are thought to be an important driver of 

actual inflation.  Many measures of U.S. inflation expectations--both from surveys and 

from market-based readings--are still well below their pre-crisis levels, although some 

have moved up as of late.  The only way to ensure that inflation expectations remain 

safely anchored near the FOMC’s target is to keep inflation close to that target on a 

consistent basis.  So, while the current shortfall may seem small, it is important that 

inflation continue to move up to 2 percent, as I expect it will. 

The FOMC does not have a numerical goal for maximum employment because 

the long-run sustainable level of employment changes over time and is determined 

mainly by nonmonetary factors that are outside the Fed’s control, such as evolving labor 

market practices, demographics, social change, and fiscal and regulatory policies.  

Nonetheless, four times each year FOMC participants write down their estimates of the 

longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate (the natural rate); at the September 

FOMC meeting the median estimate was 4.8 percent, very close to the current 

unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. 

  Other labor market measures are also healthy, including payroll job creation and 

labor force participation.  Employers have been adding roughly 180,000 jobs per month 

so far this year--a pace a little below that of the past several years but significantly higher 

than underlying growth in the labor force (figure 2).  Despite these strong job gains, the
