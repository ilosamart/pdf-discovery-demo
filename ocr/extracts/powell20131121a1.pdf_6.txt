CCPs are safe and effective at managing the risks, interactions, and interdependencies 

inherent in the clearing process. 

I will now turn to some key aspects of the regulatory framework for CCPs that 

will strengthen the financial system and help reduce systemic risk. 

Three Keys to Ensuring Central Counterparties Are Effective in Mitigating 

Systemic Risks 

There are three key dimensions to making the reform program work in practice:  

enhancing supervision and regulation of CCPs, strengthening CCP risk management and 

governance, and promoting the stability of clearing members. 

Enhancing Central Counterparty Supervision and Regulation 

The decision to require central clearing of standardized derivatives as a 

foundation for reform has raised the stakes for CCPs, clearing members, regulators, and 

the general public.  At the international level, financial regulatory authorities addressed 

this challenge by updating, harmonizing, and strengthening the minimum risk 

management standards applied to financial market infrastructures, including CCPs.  The 

new Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, commonly referred to as the PFMIs, 

set a higher bar for risk management to strengthen these core market infrastructures and 

promote financial stability.6  Just last week, the CFTC finalized its adoption of the PFMIs 

for the derivatives clearing organizations it regulates and supervises.7 

The PFMIs require that a CCP develop strategies to cover its losses and continue 

operating in a time of widespread financial stress.  In particular, the PFMIs require that a
