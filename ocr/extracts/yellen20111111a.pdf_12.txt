this literature, which also includes more theoretical analyses of such policies, is a vibrant 

and growing one that should yield useful insights in coming years.7   

Current Challenges 

Let me finish with a few words about current challenges to financial stability.  In 

particular, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains 

in global financial markets that pose significant downside risks to the U.S. economic 

outlook. 

 U.S. banking institutions have manageable levels of direct exposure to the 

peripheral European countries but more substantial links to financial institutions in the 

larger European economies.  In addition, some major European banks that obtain 

appreciable short-term wholesale U.S. dollar funding from U.S. money market funds 

appear to be facing significant funding pressures.  In light of such international linkages, 

further intensification of financial disruptions in Europe could lead to a deterioration of 

financial conditions in the United States.   

                                                 
7 Current empirical work on this topic includes a number of interesting country case studies on LTV and 
DTI policies.  For example, see Bank of Korea and International Monetary Fund (2011), “Managing Real 
Estate Booms and Busts,” summary from the BOK-IMF workshop, Seoul, Korea, April 11-12, 
www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2011/bok/041111.pdf.  For a difference-in-difference econometric 
analysis of dynamic provisioning in Spain (with implications for countercyclical capital buffers), also see 
Gabriel Jiménez, Steven Ongena, José-Luis Peydro, and Jesús Saurina (2011), “Macroprudential Policy, 
Countercyclical Bank Capital Buffers and Credit Supply:  Evidence from the Spanish Dynamic 
Provisioning Experiments,” unpublished paper, Banco de España, March,

example of model-based analysis is a study of LTV ratios in the context of calibrated general-equilibrium 
macro models by Luisa Lambertini, Caterina Medicino, and Maria Teresa Punzi (2011), “Leaning against 
Boom-Bust Cycles in Credit and Housing Prices,” Banco de Portugal Working Papers 8/11 (Lisboa, 
Portugal:  Banco de Portugal, March), www.bportugal.pt/en-
US/BdP%20Publications%20Research/wp201108.pdf; another example of model-based analysis is a study 
of countercyclical capital buffers in the context of calibrated general-equilibrium macro models by Ian 
Christensen, Césaire Meh, and Kevin Moran (2011), “Bank Leverage Regulation and Macroeconomic 
Dynamics,” paper presented at the Regulation of Systemic Risk Conference sponsored by the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Washington,
