can do to temper market volatility.  This is just the nature of the beast when dealing with 

speculative markets, and to suggest otherwise--to suggest that, say, “good 

communication” alone can engineer a completely smooth exit from a period of 

extraordinary policy accommodation--is to create an unrealistic expectation. 

  In this spirit, I think the FOMC may face a similar communications challenge as 

the nature of the forward guidance for the path of short-term interest rates evolves over 

the next couple of years.  The 6.5 percent unemployment threshold that we had until 

recently was not only quantitative in nature, but it also represented a relatively firm 

commitment on the part of the Committee.  While this kind of commitment was entirely 

appropriate at the zero lower bound, as policy eventually normalizes, guidance will 

necessarily take a different form; it will be both more qualitative as well as less 

deterministic.  So, for example, when I fill in my “dot” for 2016 in the Survey of 

Economic Projections, I think of myself as writing down not a commitment for where the 

federal funds rate will be at that time, but only my best forecast, and one that is highly 

uncertain at that.   

Chair Yellen made a similar point in her March press conference:   


More generally, you know, the end of 2016 is a long way 

out.  Monetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions 

in the economy, and the public does need to understand that 

as those views evolve, the Committee’s views on policy 

will likely evolve with them.  And that’s a kind of 

uncertainty that the Committee wouldn’t want to eliminate 

completely from its guidance because we want the policy
