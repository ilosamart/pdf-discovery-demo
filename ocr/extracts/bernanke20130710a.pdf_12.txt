The Great Moderation 

Volcker’s successful battle against inflation set the stage for the so-called Great 

Moderation of 1984 to 2007, during which the Fed enjoyed considerable success in 

achieving both objectives of its dual mandate.  Financial stability remained a goal, of 

course.  The Federal Reserve monitored threats to financial stability and responded when 

the financial system was upset by events such as the 1987 stock market crash and the 

terrorist attacks of 2001.  More routinely, it shared supervisory duties with other banking 

agencies.  Nevertheless, for the most part, financial stability did not figure prominently in 

monetary policy discussions during these years.  In retrospect, it is clear that 

macroeconomists--both inside and outside central banks--relied too heavily during that 

period on variants of the so-called Modigliani-Miller theorem, an implication of which is 

that the details of the structure of the financial system can be ignored when analyzing the 

behavior of the broader economy.  

An important development of the Great Moderation was the increasing emphasis 

that central banks around the world put on communication and transparency, as 

economists and policymakers reached consensus on the value of communication in

 See Woodford (2005).  Many of these principles were codified in the emerging doctrine of inflation 

targeting, the practice of which was greatly advanced by central banks in other countries.  One of the most 

notable examples is New Zealand’s introduction of inflation targeting in 1990.
