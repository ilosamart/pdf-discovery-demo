A Rebalanced Approach to Foreign Bank Regulation 

As has been the case in the past, we need to adjust the regulatory requirements for foreign 

banks in response to changes in the nature of their activities in the United States, the risks 

attendant to those changes, and instructions from Congress in new statutory provisions.  The 

modified regime should counteract the risks posed to U.S. financial stability by the activities of 

foreign banking organizations, as manifested in the years leading up to, and through, the 

financial crisis.  Special attention must be paid to the risk of runs associated with significant 

reliance on short-term funding.  In addition, the regime should reduce the difficulties in 

resolution of cross-border firms.  Finally, it should take steps to diminish the potential need for 

ex-post ring-fencing when losses mount or runs develop during a crisis, since such actions may 

well be unhelpfully procyclical. 

At the same time, in modifying our regulatory regime for foreign banking organizations, 

we must remain mindful of the benefits that foreign banks can bring to our economy and of the 

important policies of national treatment and comparable competitive opportunity.  Thus, we 

should chart a middle course, not moving to a fully territorial model of foreign bank regulation, 

but instead making targeted adjustments to address the risks I have identified.  In basic terms, 

three such adjustments are desirable. 

First, a more uniform structure should be required for the largest U.S. operations of 

foreign banks--specifically, that these firms establish a top-tier U.S. intermediate holding 

company (IHC) over all U.S. bank and nonbank subsidiaries.  An IHC would make application 

of enhanced prudential supervision more consistent across foreign banks and reduce the ability 

of foreign banks to avoid U.S. consolidated-capital regulations.  Because U.S. branches and 

agencies are part of the foreign parent bank, they would not be included in the IHC.  However,
