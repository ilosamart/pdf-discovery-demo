more than the dollars they originally borrowed.  I am sure we all remember learning in 

school about farm families in the Great Depression who couldn’t pay their mortgages and 

lost their homes and their livelihoods when crop prices fell persistently. 

Another important reason to maintain a modest inflation buffer is that too low 

inflation impairs the ability of monetary policy to counter economic downturns.  When 

inflation is very low, interest rates tend to be very low also, even in good times.  And 

when interest rates are generally very low, the Fed has only limited room to cut them to 

help the economy in bad times. 

In a nutshell, the Fed’s goal is to promote financial conditions conducive to 

maximum employment and price stability.  And I have offered broad-brush definitions of 

each of those objectives.  So where is the economy now, in relationship to them?  The 

short answer is, we think it’s close.  The economy has come a long way since the 

financial crisis.  As you know, the crisis marked the start of a very deep recession.  It 

destroyed nearly 9 million jobs, and it’s been a long, slow slog to recover from it.  

Unemployment peaked at 10 percent late in 2009, a level unseen for more than 25 years, 

and didn’t move below 8 percent for nearly three years.  Falling home prices put millions 

of homeowners “underwater,” meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their 

homes were worth.  And the stock market plunged, slashing the value of 401(k) 

retirement nest eggs. 

The extraordinarily severe recession required an extraordinary response from 

monetary policy, both to support the job market and prevent deflation.  We cut our short-

term interest rate target to near zero at the end of 2008 and kept it there for seven years.
