continuing to hold short-term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned 

to normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms 

of inappropriate risk-taking that might undermine financial stability.  For these reasons, 

the more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace, 

adjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data.  

Conclusion 

To conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by 

the Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum 

employment and price stability.  To this end, we have maintained a highly 

accommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a 

marked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable 

disinflationary pressures.  However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under 

the dual mandate:  Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and 

the influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant 

factors keeping inflation below our goal.  But I expect that inflation will return to 

2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on 

inflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete 

the return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well 

anchored.  Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving 

these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this 

year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter.  But if the economy surprises 

us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.
