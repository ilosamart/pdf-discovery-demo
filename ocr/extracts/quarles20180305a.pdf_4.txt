their impact on foreign banking organizations (FBOs) based on lessons learned over the past 

several years.   

  To illustrate how I am thinking about these issues, I want to focus in my remarks today 

on two specific regulatory examples.  These are, of course, not an exhaustive list of work to be 

done in the regulation of FBOs, but they tend to be near the top of the feedback list from both the 

industry and supervisors.  First, I will discuss the application of enhanced prudential standards to 

FBOs, including our flexibility in implementing certain aspects of these standards.  I will also 

offer some initial thoughts on opportunities for further tailoring that regime for FBOs.  Second is 

the Volcker rule.  I will provide some of my initial thinking on how we might be able to improve 

the Volcker rule, both generally and in its application to FBOs in particular.     

Enhanced Prudential Standards 

In implementing enhanced prudential standards for foreign banks with a large U.S. 

presence, we sought to ensure that firms hold sufficient local capital and liquidity--and have a 

risk management infrastructure--that is commensurate with the risks in their U.S. operations.2  

And in general, that approach is meeting many of the broad goals the Federal Reserve set out to 

achieve.  Today, foreign banks with large U.S. operations are less fragmented, maintain local 

capital and liquidity buffers that align to the size and riskiness of their U.S. footprint, and operate 

on equal footing with their domestic counterparts.

other prudential requirements and consistent supervision across the U.S. subsidiary operations of an FBO.  See 12
