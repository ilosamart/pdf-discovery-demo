II. D. Initial Guidance on Loss and Resource Calculations 

Loss Projections 
The participating BHCs were asked to project estimated losses on loans, securities, and trading-
related exposures (for those firms with trading assets exceeding $100 billion), including potential losses 
stemming from off-balance sheet positions, for 2009 and 2010 that would be consistent with the 
economic outlooks in the baseline and more adverse scenarios. They were instructed to project losses 
for 12 separate categories of loans held in the accrual book, for loans and securities held in the 
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity (AFS/HTM) portfolios, and in some cases for positions held in the 
trading account. The BHCs were asked to make adjustments to reported balance sheet values of assets 
to reflect expectations of customer drawdowns on unused credit commitments, and other assets or 
exposures that might be taken back on the balance sheet in a stressed economic environment and due 
to pending accounting changes. 
The specific categories of loans and securities included in the exercise are listed in the attached 
template. For the most part, these categories are based on regulatory report classifications to facilitate 
comparison across BHCs and with information reported by the BHCs in their regulatory filings. However, 
the BHCs were encouraged to provide more granular loss projections - that is, loss projections for sub-
categories of the loan types specified in the template - to the extent that their internal calculations 
were built up from such information. In addition, the BHCs were instructed to report projections of 
losses that would be material deriving from other positions, businesses, or risk exposures that were not 
included in the template. 
For loans, the BHCs were instructed to estimate forward-looking, undiscounted credit losses, 
that is, losses due to failure to pay obligations ("cash flow losses") rather than discounts related to mark-
to-market values. To guide estimation, the BHCs were provided with a range of indicative two-year 
cumulative loss rates for each of the 12 loan categories for the baseline and more adverse scenarios. 
BHCs were permitted to submit loss rates outside of the ranges, but were required to provide strong 
supporting evidence, especially if they fell below the range minimum. The indicative loss rate ranges 
were derived using a variety of methods for predicting loan losses, including analysis of historical loss 
experience at large BHCs and quantitative models relating the performance of individual loans and 
groups of loans to macroeconomic variables. These loan-level models were particularly important for 
residential mortgages, since historical loss experience at BHCs may not be a reliable guide to future 
performance under the baseline or more adverse scenario, given the path of home prices in recent 
years. 
The BHCs were asked to provide loss estimates based on outstanding balances of loans and 
securities on a global consolidated basis as of December 31, 2008 as reported in their FR Y-9C reports, 
adjusted to reflect any significant mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures that an institution completed 
after that date.5 [Footnote 5. The FR Y-9C reports contain balance sheet and income statement information for 
bank holding companies. End footnote 5.] The BHCs also were asked to project losses on loans that could be 
drawn down from unused credit commitments in place as of year-end 2008 and on securitized assets that could be 
brought back onto the balance sheet under stressed market conditions. 
For securities held in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, institutions were 
instructed to estimate possible impairment relative to net unrealized losses at year-end 2008 (as
