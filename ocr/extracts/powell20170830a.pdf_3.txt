strategy of the company and the risks inherent in that strategy, and that the institution has the 

capital, liquidity, and risk management capabilities necessary to manage those risks.   

Today, the role of a director of a large banking firm is more expansive, more challenging, 

and more important than ever.  Boards now oversee management’s participation in highly 

challenging annual exercises, such as stress testing, capital planning, and resolution planning, 

that have fundamentally changed the business of our largest institutions.  Boards now more 

carefully evaluate the compensation practices of these large institutions to assure that they 

reinforce positive incentives and discourage unwanted risk taking.  Across a range of 

responsibilities, we simply expect much more of boards of directors than ever before.  There is 

no reason to expect that to change.   

We do take seriously our obligation to assess whether our reforms are achieving their 

desired effects, without imposing unnecessary burden.  In 2014, we began a review of these 

higher expectations for directors.  We found that many boards have significantly improved their 

practices.  We also found some ways to make our reforms both more effective and more 

efficient.  For example, while directors generally say that they understand and embrace their 

more challenging responsibilities, we consistently hear that directors feel buried in hundreds or 

even thousands of pages of highly granular information, to the point where more important 

strategic issues are crowded out of board deliberations.  Some of this granular information was 

likely driven by our supervisory guidance, which included specific expectations not only for the 

management of the institution, but also for the board of directors.  Over time, this guidance has 

increased the number of specific directives aimed at boards well into the hundreds, which may 

have fostered a “check-the-box” approach by boards.
