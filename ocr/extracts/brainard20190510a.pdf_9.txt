income adults do not have any money saved for retirement.12  In part, this may reflect the 

long-term shift by employers to defined contribution plans and away from defined benefit 

plans, especially in the private sector.  While in 1989 more middle-income households 

had a defined benefit pension than a defined contribution plan, the reverse has been true 

since 1989.13  With defined contribution plans, employees have to decide how much they 

will save and how they will invest, and they face uncertainty regarding how much 

savings will be available in retirement.  Those who save and invest effectively can help 

secure their retirement.  But those who opt out, save too little, or make investment 

choices that turn out to yield low returns may find themselves unprepared as retirement 

approaches, despite years of hard work.  Two-thirds of middle-income adults who hold 

self-directed accounts, including defined contribution plans and individual retirement 

accounts, say that they have little or no comfort in managing the investments.14 

Assets and liabilities 

Stepping back, it is instructive to look at the evolution of the underlying assets 

and liabilities of middle-class households more broadly.  The liabilities of the average 

middle-income household have nearly doubled over the past three decades, while assets 

have increased only 50 percent (figure 8).  The gap between the relative growth of 

liabilities and assets peaked during the financial crisis and has narrowed somewhat for 

middle-income households more recently.  While mortgages rose and fell sharply around

Retirement savings in the SHED include pensions, individual retirement accounts, and other savings for 
retirement. 
13 The data source is the SCF (1989â€“2016).  In 1989, 50 percent of middle-income households had a 
defined benefit pension, and 29 percent had a defined contribution pension, but by 1998, the relative 
ownership of each pension type had reversed to 36 percent and 43 percent, respectively.  Since then, the 
rates have been fairly stable.

directed retirement accounts.
