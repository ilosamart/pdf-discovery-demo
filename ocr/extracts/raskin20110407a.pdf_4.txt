In fact, the need for diversification is one of the great lessons of the crisis.  Indeed, we 

found that, irrespective of size, those banks most likely to weather the crisis were those with 

diverse loan portfolios, management information systems capable of monitoring concentrations, 

reasonably diversified funding sources and liquidity management processes, and forward-looking 

analyses that considered how loan portfolios might perform and affect bank conditions under 

periods of stress. We need many, many more banks with these characteristics because these are 

the banks that absorbed the shocks of the crisis, remained relatively healthy, and, most 

significantly, now have the potential to thrive as robust sources of credit in their communities 

after the crisis.   

As I see it, we need to create within the Dodd-Frank regulatory architecture a supervisory 

and examination program that encourages diversification and forward-looking strategies as a 

means to ensuring a healthy financial system and a steady flow of loans to creditworthy 

borrowers.   

Am I saying that it is the responsibility of examiners, in essence, to guarantee that the 

banking system becomes more resilient and incapable of failure?  No.  A regulatory system that 

guarantees against bank failures is not in my mind desirable, even if such a system could be 

established in a cost-effective manner.    

To illustrate, I’ll borrow a concept from the field of statistics.  When drawing conclusions 

based on test results, statisticians and scientists often factor in the possibility of erroneous results, 

or “false negatives” and “false positives.”  Some economists have extended this concept to 

assessing the effectiveness of regulation.   

  Imagine that you visit your doctor for an annual checkup and have your cholesterol level 

tested.  When the results come back from the lab, they show that all is well.  But what if your
