responsibility of central banks to protect financial stability is at least as important as the 

responsibility to use monetary policy effectively in the pursuit of macroeconomic 

objectives.   

An evolving consensus holds that central banks can dedicate separate toolkits to 

achieving their financial stability and macroeconomic objectives, but this consensus must 

be viewed as provisional.  Certainly, those toolkits appear to be much better stocked 

today than before the crisis:  monetary policy tools that can be brought to bear if 

necessary include the management of the central bank’s balance sheet and, to a greater 

extent than in the past, communication about future policies.  Financial stability policy 

encompasses, as the first line of defense at least, a range of microprudential and 

macroprudential tools, both structural and varying over the cycle, supported by enhanced 

monitoring and analysis of potential risks to systemic stability.  Clearly, understanding 

and applying the lessons of the crisis will take some time yet; both theorists and 

practitioners of central banking have their work cut out for them.
