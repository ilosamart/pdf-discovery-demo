interoperability between other ledgers and networks, and the reduction of computational 

intensity and costs. 

Moreover, distributed ledgers will have to compete with other options and 

priorities of financial firms and clearinghouses in a highly regulated financial ecosystem.  

Thus, a major threshold question for the adoption of distributed ledger technology within 

and between groups of firms engaging in particular types of transactions is whether the 

advantages outweigh the costs of replacing legacy systems.  

In some cases, where distributed ledger technology can be employed internally 

within a firm to automate and speed up business processes, traditional business case 

analysis would presumably lead to efficient technology choices.  By contrast, where 

coordinated industry-level decisions would be needed to develop distributed ledgers 

shared by multiple firms, the case must be compelling for entire networks of market 

participants that will need to make the investments, as well as for the broader public 

interest. 

This set of competing considerations suggests there are likely to be a spectrum of 

cases.  At one end are the high-volume, heavily regulated markets that have made large 

investments in central clearing to provide safe and efficient clearing and settlement for 

the industry and the public.  These markets must always actively consider technological 

and other enhancements to strengthen efficiency and safety.  But as a practical matter, the 

large-scale adoption of wholly new clearing technologies to replace existing legacy 

technologies for major markets may face a significant hurdle initially, such that 

incremental change or delayed adoption until the technology has achieved greater 

maturity and standardization may be more likely.
