Considerable evidence shows that growing up poor makes it harder to succeed as 

an adult, and new research by the Fed likewise shows the strong connection between the 

typical experiences of poverty in childhood and economic challenges later as an adult.  

The data come from the Board’s latest Survey of Household Economics and 

Decisionmaking (SHED), which will be published later this spring.1  In the most recent 

survey, we asked some of the younger respondents--aged 25 to 39--to think about their 

childhoods.  We asked those young adults whether, during their childhoods, they found 

themselves worrying about having enough food to eat, having a stable caregiver, or about 

their personal safety.  About 10 percent said they regularly worried about one or more of 

these concerns, and an additional 19 percent said they sometimes worried about them. 

We were then able to compare responses about their experiences in childhood to 

what these young adults told us about their current circumstances.  Some pretty clear 

patterns emerged.  Of those young adults who regularly had one or more of these 

childhood concerns growing up, more than one-half say that they are currently facing 

challenges in getting by financially.  This fraction compares to just over one-fourth of 

those who said they never, or only rarely, worried about these concerns as children that 

now experience this level of financial challenge.  Young adults who regularly or 

sometimes worried when they were children about their care, safety, or having enough to 

eat are also less likely to be employed, less likely to have consistent income month-to-
