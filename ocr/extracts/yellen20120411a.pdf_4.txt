Chip consensus and the blue shading denotes the range between the top 10 and bottom 10 

projections of forecasters in the March Blue Chip survey.  The figure also shows the 

central tendency of the unemployment projections that my FOMC colleagues and I made 

at our January meeting:  Those projections reflect our assessments of the economic 

outlook given our own individual judgments about the appropriate path of monetary 

policy.  As in the Blue Chip consensus outlook, FOMC participants’ projections indicate 

that unemployment will decline gradually from current levels.  Included in the figure as 

well is the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal 

unemployment rate, which ranges from 5.2 percent to 6 percent.  The unemployment rate 

is expected to remain well above its longer-run normal value over the next several years. 

As you know, economic forecasts always entail considerable uncertainty.  

Figure 2 illustrates the degree of uncertainty surrounding projections of unemployment.  

The gray shading denotes a model-based 70 percent confidence interval for the 

unemployment rate, based on the sorts of shocks that have hit the economy over the past 

40 years.

  Judging from historical experience, the consensus projection could be quite far 

off, in either direction.  That said, the figure also shows that labor market slack at present 

is so large that even a very large and favorable forecast error would not change the 

conclusion that slack will likely remain substantial for quite some time. 

                                                                                                                                                 
to the April edition of the Blue Chip survey, which was released yesterday, “The consensus outlook for 

U.S. economic growth this year and next underwent minimal change over the past month.”

 The forecast confidence interval is generated using stochastic simulations of the Federal Reserve staff’s 

FRB/US model.  Specifically, a baseline is constructed centered on the midpoint of the central tendency of 

the FOMC’s projections released in January, and then the model is repeatedly simulated with shocks drawn 

randomly for the set of historical disturbances experienced over the period from 1968 to 2011.  Similar 

estimates of forecast confidence intervals would be obtained if the intervals were instead constructed using 

the actual historical forecasting errors of private forecasters; for further discussion, see Table 2 of the 

FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
