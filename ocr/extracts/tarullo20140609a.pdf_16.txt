creating the regulatory checklist for board compliance and regular consideration.  One example, 

drawn from Federal Reserve practice, is the recent supervisory guidance requiring that every 

notice of a “Matter Requiring Attention” (MRA) issued by supervisors must be reviewed, and 

compliance signed off, by the board of directors.15  There are some MRAs that clearly should 

come to the board’s attention, but the failure to discriminate among them is almost surely 

distracting from strategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards. 

 One might ask how the strengthening of systems of controls and risk-appetite decision 

processes can promote achievement of regulatory interests beyond those shared with the owners 

of firms.  One answer is that it clearly improves the supervisory line-of-sight into the safety and 

soundness of financial firms.  The more timely and accurate the information that can be 

aggregated by supervisors, the more responsive our supervisory and financial stability oversight 

can be.  A well-developed set of risk and control functions also allows an effective point of entry 

for pursuing certain regulatory objectives.  To date, the best example of this potential is our 

annual supervisory stress tests and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) to 

which I have already referred.    

As a substantive matter, the CCAR requirements limit capital distributions of large 

financial institutions based upon a forward-looking assessment of the losses that would be 

suffered under hypothetical adverse economic scenarios, so that capital will be built and 

maintained at levels high enough for the firms to remain viable financial intermediaries even 

under such stressed conditions.  In addition to the microprudential improvement that comes from 

                                                 
15 An MRA is a supervisory finding that the Federal Reserve communicates to the firm and requires 
remediation.  For more information, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Banking
