There have also been sizable shifts within the non-investment-grade, or riskier, 

debt universe.  Higher-risk businesses have traditionally funded themselves with a mix of 

high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.  Over time, the balance between the two has swung 

back and forth because of investor demand, the interest rate environment, and other 

factors.  In the past few years, leveraged loans have grown far more quickly (figure 3).  In 

fact, while net new issuance of high-yield bonds in 2018 was close to nil, leveraged loans 

outstanding rose 20 percent and now stand at more than $1 trillion.  So far this year, 

issuance of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans has been more balanced.  In addition, 

underwriting standards have weakened.  With leveraged loans, covenants intended to 

protect lenders may be an endangered species; more loans now feature high debt-to-

earnings ratios; and the use of optimistic projections including “earnings add-backs” is 

becoming more common.  

The rise in riskier business borrowing has been funded principally by nonbank 

lenders.  Collateralized loan obligations are now the largest lenders, with about 

62 percent of outstanding leveraged loans (figure 4).  These lenders are actively managed 

securitization vehicles that mostly buy higher-risk assets like leveraged loans.  CLOs, in 

turn, are funded by a slice of equity and layers of debt of varying seniority.  After CLOs, 

mutual funds are the next-largest vehicle for holding leveraged loans, with about 

20 percent of the market.  These funds allow investors to redeem their shares daily, 

although the underlying loans take longer to sell.  As a result, investors may react to 

financial stress by trying to redeem their shares before the funds have sold their most 

liquid assets.  Widespread redemptions by investors, in turn, could lead to widespread
