banks--through international meetings, seminars, and conferences; in the provision of 

technical assistance; and through other activities in forums such as the Bank for 

International Settlements (BIS), the Group of Twenty (G-20), and the Center for Latin 

American Monetary Studies, or CEMLA.   

I would be remiss if, before ending, I did not note the strong leadership that 

Governor Agustín Carstens continues to provide at the Bank of Mexico.  His leadership 

in economic policy, in several key roles, has been instrumental in solidifying the progress 

that Mexico has made over the past two decades.  Agustín has also built an impressive 

record in the international policy community more broadly.  He is currently the chair of 

the BIS Consultative Council for the Americas, has recently been appointed chair of the 

BIS Economic Consultative Committee and the Global Economy Meeting, and played a 

key role in Mexico’s successful presidency of the G-20 last year.    

To conclude, I would like to congratulate the Bank of Mexico on the 20th 

anniversary of its independence.  I wish you a productive conference marking this 

auspicious occasion.  And I wish the Bank of Mexico continued success in its work to 

stabilize and strengthen the Mexican economy.
