there are troubling signs that less diversified or connected localities have a diminished 

ability to adapt.  And the evidence suggests that concentrated economic shocks and the 

associated labor market stress also have broader consequences for health and mortality.15   

 To provide some sense of the magnitudes, on average over the past year the 

unemployment rate for adults of prime working age (25 to 54) was about 1 percentage 

point higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in larger metro areas.16  But there is an even 

greater gap in labor force engagement, as can be seen in figure 5.  The participation rate 

for prime-age adults in larger metro areas is currently nearly 3-1/2 percentage points 

above the participation rate for prime-age adults in nonmetro areas.  Interestingly, the 

geographic participation rate gap between more and less populous areas is apparent for 

all races as well as, in recent years, for both men and women.17 

 This gap in labor force participation between large cities and other areas has 

widened substantially since just before the Great Recession:  Since 2007, the 

participation rate for prime-age adults in nonmetro areas has fallen nearly 3 percentage 

points, as compared with less than 1 percentage point on net in larger metro areas.  

Indeed, since 2007, the large decline in labor force participation in small metro and rural 

areas can explain about 40 percent of the economy-wide decline in prime-age labor force 

participation, even though these areas account for a smaller 25 percent of the population. 

Before discussing possible contributors to this growing participation gap, it is 

important to emphasize that less populous areas appear to be falling behind in ways

16 Larger metro areas are defined as metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with a population of 500,000 or 
larger, while smaller metro areas are MSAs with population between 100,000 and 500,000, and nonmetro 
areas are the remainder; see Weingarden (2017).   
17 This gap appears to be a post-crisis phenomenon for women, while for men the gap began to widen in the 
1990s.
