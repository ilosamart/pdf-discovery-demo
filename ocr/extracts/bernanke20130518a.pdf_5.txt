interesting to ask how my family’s everyday life back then differed from that of a typical 

family today.  Well, if I think about it, I could quickly come up with the Internet, 

cellphones, and microwave ovens as important conveniences that most of your families 

have today that my family lacked 50 years ago.  Health care has improved some since I 

was young; indeed, life expectancy at birth in the United States has risen from 70 years in 

1963 to 78 years today, although some of this improvement is probably due to better 

nutrition and generally higher levels of income rather than advances in medicine alone.  

Nevertheless, though my memory may be selective, it doesn’t seem to me that the 

differences in daily life between then and now are all that large.  Heating, air 

conditioning, cooking, and sanitation in my childhood were not all that different from 

today.  We had a dishwasher, a washing machine, and a dryer.  My family owned a 

comfortable car with air conditioning and a radio, and the experience of commercial 

flight was much like today but without the long security lines.  For entertainment, we did 

not have the Internet or video games, as I mentioned, but we had plenty of books, radio, 

musical recordings, and a color TV (although, I must acknowledge, the colors were 

garish and there were many fewer channels to choose from).   

The comparison of the world of 1963 with that of today suggests quite substantial 

but perhaps not transformative economic change since then.  But now let’s run this 

thought experiment back another 50 years, to 1913 (the year the Federal Reserve was 

created by the Congress, by the way), and compare how my grandparents and your great-

grandparents lived with how my family lived in 1963.  Life in 1913 was simply much 

harder for most Americans than it would be later in the century.  Many people worked 

long hours at dangerous, dirty, and exhausting jobs--up to 60 hours per week in
