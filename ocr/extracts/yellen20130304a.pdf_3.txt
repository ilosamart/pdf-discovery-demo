The Outlook for the Labor Market and Inflation 

The Committee’s recent actions are shaped by the fact that the labor market is still 

far from healed from the trauma of the Great Recession.  Despite some welcome 

improvement, employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, reflecting an 

economy that is still operating far short of its potential.  At 7.9 percent in January, the 

unemployment rate has declined from its recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009.  But 

that’s still higher than unemployment ever reached in the 24 years prior to the recent 

recession and well above the 5.2 to 6 percent that is the central tendency of FOMC 

participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  With economic 

activity constrained by fiscal consolidation, the lingering effects from the financial crisis, 

and the added headwinds of Europe’s recession and debt problems, most FOMC 

participants reported in December that they expected only a gradual decline in 

unemployment over the next two years, to about 7 percent by the end of 2014.

The official estimate of 12 million currently unemployed does not include 

800,000 more discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.

  In 

addition, nearly 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working 

part time even though they would prefer full-time jobs.  A broader measure of 

underemployment that includes these and others who want a job stands at 14.4 percent,

 In the December 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the central tendency of FOMC 

participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2013 and 2014 was 7.4 to 

7.7 percent and 6.8 to 7.3 percent, respectively.  The central tendency omits the three lowest and three 

highest projections.  The SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board of Governors 

(2013).

 The most widely reported estimate of those in the labor force who are unemployed--12.3 million in 

January, rounded to 12 million, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)--is seasonally adjusted.  

(Without seasonal adjustment, the actual estimate of unemployed in January was 13.2 million.)  The BLS 

does not seasonally adjust its estimate of discouraged workers who have left the labor force, an estimate 

that was 804,000 in January.  For more on the employment situation in January, see Bureau of Labor 

Statistics (2013).
