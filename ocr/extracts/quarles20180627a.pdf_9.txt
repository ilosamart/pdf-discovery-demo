financial vulnerabilities was more limited, particularly for conditions outside the United 

States.  For one, we did not understand the importance of some financial vulnerabilities 

or had only limited information on them, such as interconnectedness across financial 

firms, and therefore we were unable to share information.  We also failed to appreciate 

the ways in which the shadow banking system that had grown up outside the institutions 

we oversaw had become interconnected with those institutions.  The existing global 

forums for discussion of these issues were considered less important or were focused on 

just one financial sector, and membership was often limited to a handful of industrial 

countries.  We now understand the importance of taking a global view on financial 

vulnerabilities, and we are learning from each other about how to fill the gaps in 

understanding and data that exist. 

An additional challenge that the United States faced, in responding to the crisis 

and establishing more effective oversight and higher standards was the inability to 

enforce such rules in a global financial system without common, more uniform standards.  

If some of the activities threatening financial stability occurred outside the United States 

and in jurisdictions with lower standards, raising standards in the United States would be 

both ineffective in fully stabilizing the financial system, and could put U.S. firms at a 

competitive disadvantage, which would be only an added disincentive to embrace 

effective standards.   

Every nation, of course, seeking to make its financial system more resilient faced 

these same challenges and disincentives, an example of the problem of collective action 

that points nations toward international cooperation.
