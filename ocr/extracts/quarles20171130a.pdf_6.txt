financial and technical risk at the same time.  Not surprisingly, because striking the right balance 

takes time, genuine innovation in payment systems over history has often been measured in 

decades, not years.  

Private Digital Currencies   

As part of the new technology associated with fintech, we are now seeing the emergence 

of privately developed digital currencies using new decentralized technologies.  Fundamental to 

these digital currencies is the establishment of a new asset, the unit of the digital currency--for 

example, a bitcoin--and a new record-keeping and transfer mechanism that enables users to store 

and trade those units--for example, a blockchain--often without reliance on traditional financial 

institutions.   

I believe the financial industry is increasingly recognizing that we should separate the 

concept of digital currencies from the innovative new technologies that they have employed to 

transfer assets.  Those technologies, such as distributed ledgers, may offer useful new ways to 

store, transfer, and protect data and traditional financial assets.  The industry is now moving 

cautiously from pilot projects in many of these areas to the use of these new technologies in 

limited production settings.  This cautious approach to using new technology appears to reflect 

the weight of responsibility the financial industry bears for protecting both their customers and 

their reputations.  Continued monitoring of developments is in order, and time will tell how these 

new technologies--and others--can contribute to a safe and secure payment system and broader 

financial system.  The Federal Reserve has been actively monitoring these developments and will 

continue to do so.2
