stability" that can constitute an adverse effect for purposes of Sections 3 and 4 of the Bank 

Holding Company Act.  Unlike Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which permits the antitrust 

authorities either to restrain a merger beforehand or undo it thereafter, the Federal Reserve's 

authority under the Bank Holding Company Act to disallow the merger on financial stability 

grounds appears to lapse after the merger is completed, but for the narrow authority vested in the 

FSOC.  Of course, one motivation for the passage of Hart-Scott-Rodino in 1976 was the 

perceived reluctance of courts to order potentially disruptive divestitures once companies had 

completed the merger.  In any case, the legal and practical impediments to such action counsel an 

additional measure of caution by the Federal Reserve in considering acquisitions by firms that 

can reasonably be expected to raise significant financial stability concerns.   

For all the attention paid to financial stability analysis in the last few years, it is still – 

relatively speaking – a fledgling enterprise.  Even if we hypothesize a viable working theory of 

financial stability that commands a rough consensus, translating that theory into administrable 

standards and processes is a task that will take years.41  But while the absence of well-established 

systemic risk measures may counsel caution in approaching merger analysis, and while it has 

surely already affected the formulation of capital surcharges in the Basel Committee, it may well 

be leaving a gap in financial stability regulation.   One of the difficulties in building out a 

financial stability analysis is the absence of an upper bound point of reference.  There is no 

statutory basis for identifying a certain systemic footprint above which the risks to financial 

stability are not worth bearing compared to whatever possible benefits may be associated with 

the operation of the largest, most interconnected firms.   

Similarly, the absence in the financial stability area of the equivalent of the 

monopolization provision in Sherman Act Section 2 to complement the merger provisions in
