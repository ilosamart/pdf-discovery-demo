 Private-sector products and systems already exist or are being developed that 

will fulfill demands that central-bank-issued digital currencies might otherwise

new private-sector-led faster payments initiatives are coming.  In the United States, 

a faster payments system that operates around the clock and provides the capability 

to hold and transfer deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

in real time would go a long way toward providing the low-risk and flexible 

payment arrangements that paper currency historically provided.  Indeed, I would 

expect private-sector systems to be more forward leaning than central banks in 

providing new features to the public through faster payments systems as they 

compete to attract retail customers.  A central bank issued digital currency would 

compete with these and other innovative private-sector products and may stifle 

innovation over the long run.   

Conclusion 

 We live in a time of extraordinary technological change.  We should be open 

to the new ideas and innovations that will drive economic growth and 

improvements in our financial system.  At the same time, the public rightfully 

expects that authorities will do whatever it takes to keep their money safe.  Those
