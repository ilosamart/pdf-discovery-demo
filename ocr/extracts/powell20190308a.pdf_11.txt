2.  Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and 

maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be 

expanded? 

3.  How can the FOMCâ€™s communication of its policy framework and 

implementation be improved? 

I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic.  Because interest 

rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times 

now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8  Thus, when a recession 

comes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the 

economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent.  The 

post-crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended 

period at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target.  Persistently weak 

inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still 

lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to 

support the economy during a downturn.  It is therefore very important for central banks 

to find more effective ways to battle the low-inflation syndrome that seems to accompany 

proximity to the ELB.  

In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation and 

sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a 

central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells by adopting a 

makeup strategy.9  The simplest version goes like this:  If a spell with interest rates near
