sharply in comparison with the wages of college graduates over the past 40 years.  Many 

economists believe that the decline in demand for lower-skilled workers reflects 

technological changes.4  For instance, the introduction of information technology such as 

desktop computers may have boosted the wages of highly skilled workers by more than 

the wages of workers with fewer skills.  The slump in demand for lower-skilled labor 

likely also reflects the effects of globalization, including competition from goods 

produced and imported from abroad.5 

My second current question concerns economic mobility:  How likely is a child 

from a low-income family to move up to a higher income level as an adult?  Over the past 

few years, economists have made important findings using newly available data.  First, 

economic mobility varies substantially across the United States.  For example, the odds 

of a child from the bottom quintile of the income distribution reaching the top quintile of 

income as an adult are 11 percent here in the Washington, D.C., area but only 4 percent 

in the Charlotte, North Carolina, region.  Second, mobility is significantly lower in areas 

with greater residential segregation in terms of both race and income.  Mobility is also 

lower in areas with greater income inequality, less family stability, and lower-quality 

schools.6  However, we need further study and analysis to understand whether these 

factors cause lower mobility or are merely correlated with it.  Thus, despite the gains in
