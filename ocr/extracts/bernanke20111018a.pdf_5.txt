the existing frameworks proved effective.  Notably, well-anchored longer-term inflation 

expectations moderated both inflation and deflation risks, as price-setters and market 

participants remained confident in the ability of central banks to keep inflation near target 

in the medium term.  The medium-term focus of flexible inflation targeting also offered 

central banks latitude to cushion the effects of the financial shocks on output and 

employment in the face of transitory swings in inflation.  In particular, they were able to 

avoid significant policy tightening in mid-2008 and early 2011, when sharp increases in 

commodity prices temporarily drove headline inflation rates above target levels.  Finally, 

for central banks with policy rates near the zero lower bound, influencing the public’s 

expectations about future policy actions became a critical tool, as I will discuss further 

shortly.  The commitment to a policy framework that is transparent about objectives and 

forecasts was helpful, in many instances, in managing those expectations and thus in 

making monetary policy both more predictable and more effective during the past few 

years than it might otherwise have been. 

 However, the recent experience did raise at least one important question about the 

flexible inflation-targeting framework--namely, that although that framework had helped 

produce a long period of macroeconomic stability, it ultimately, by itself, was not enough 

to ensure financial stability.  Some observers have argued that this failure should lead to 

modifications, or even a replacement, of the inflation targeting approach.  For example, 

since financial excesses tend to develop over a relatively longer time frame and can have 

significant effects on inflation when they ultimately unwind, it has been suggested that
