pursuit of that extra yield.  In the spirit of my earlier comments, let’s call this the “Fed 

recruitment” view. 

I take the events of the past few months to be evidence in favor of the recruitment 

view.  And, to be clear, I don’t mean this as a criticism of the set of policies that we have 

in place.  Quite to the contrary--it can be useful to enlist help when you have a big job to 

do.  Indeed, my whole point in talking about the research I described earlier was to 

underscore my belief that something like this investor-recruitment mechanism is central 

to how monetary policy acquires much of its traction over the real economy even in 

ordinary times.  Of course, the magnitude of the effect--the extent of downward pressure 

that we may have been inducing other investors to apply to the term premium--is likely to 

have been more noteworthy given the unprecedented scope of our overall monetary 

accommodation.  But in an important sense, this effect is just a powered-up version of 

what makes garden-variety monetary policy work. 

Again, the existence of this recruitment channel is helpful; without it, I suspect 

that our policies would have considerably less potency and, therefore, less ability to 

provide needed support to the real economy.  At the same time, an understanding of this 

channel highlights the uncertainties that inevitably accompany it.  If the Fed’s control of 

long-term rates depends in substantial part on the induced buying and selling behavior of 

other investors, our grip on the steering wheel is not as tight as it otherwise might be.  

Even if we make only small changes to the policy parameters that we control directly, 

long-term rates can be substantially more volatile.  And if we push the recruits very 

hard--as we arguably have over the past year or so--it is probably more likely that we are 

going to see a change in their behavior and hence a sharp movement in rates at some
