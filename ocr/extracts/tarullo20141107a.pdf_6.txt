To return, then, to the aims of prudential regulation of community banks, it seems that we 

can fill out the basic aims of protecting the deposit insurance fund and supporting the availability 

of relationship lending across the country by concentrating on traditional capital regulation to 

ensure solvency and on traditional examination practice to monitor the basic soundness of the 

relationship lending practices.  We may also need to increase scrutiny when community banks 

move beyond their traditional business model and enter lines or markets that are more complex 

or with which they may not be familiar.  But many rules and examinations that are important for 

institutions that are larger, more complex, or both, do not make sense in light of the nature of the 

risks to community banks.  We must avoid importing measures from large bank oversight that 

make relationship banking more costly. 

With that explanation of the purposes of community bank oversight, let me now turn to 

more specific discussion of how we are tailoring regulation and supervision of community banks 

to achieve those aims. 

Tiered Regulation for Community Banks 

There are two complementary ways to implement a tiered approach to prudential 

regulation.  One is to apply specific regulations only to those classes of banking organizations 

whose activities and scale require those measures.  The second is to tailor the application of 

generally applicable measures based on the size, complexity, and possibly other characteristics of 

banking organizations.  We are following both approaches in putting into place an explicitly 

tiered method of regulating community banks.8 

                                                 
8 While not directly the subject of these remarks, it also bears noting that additional tiering of expectations is 

increasingly taking place even among larger banking organizations.  For example, capital planning and stress testing 

requirements are more extensive for the very largest, most systemically important firms than they are for smaller 

regional banking organizations.  Likewise, liquidity and capital requirements are or will be higher for the most 

systemically important firms than for other large banking organizations.
