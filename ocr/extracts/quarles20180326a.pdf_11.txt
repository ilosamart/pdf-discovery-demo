lending at larger banks may be partly due to their use of automated underwriting for credit 

cards.20  By providing credit cards, banks are expanding credit available to small businesses; 

however, some small business advocates note that this form of credit is generally more expensive 

and lacks the flexibility of other products.21  For example, personal or business credit cards may 

be suitable for purchasing supplies, but not for payroll.  In addition, this automated approach 

may be more “cookie cutter,” meaning that firms that don’t meet standard lending criteria may 

not qualify.22 

These developments have created a space for the third trend we have been observing--the 

emergence of nonbank online alternative lenders that provide small-dollar business credit.  For 

example, some of the large technology firms are providing credit, at a rapidly growing pace, to 

their built-in customer base of merchants.  Several of the businesses I met with mentioned they 

had turned to nonbank online lenders after being turned down by banks.  Some online lenders 

obtain access to a prospective borrower’s accounting software, merchant accounts, shipping, and 

payroll data in real time in order to underwrite businesses.  Business owners can receive funds in 

a couple of days or even hours.   

This emergence of online lenders is part of a broader evolution of financial technology--

or “fintech”--as seen in a wide range of products and services for both consumers and small 

businesses.  I’m not surprised to see this important topic on your conference agenda.  The use of 

fintech to expand access to credit has great promise and also associated risks.  For example,
