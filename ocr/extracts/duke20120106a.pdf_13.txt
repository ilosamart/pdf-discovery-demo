that the GSEs could force lenders to repurchase loans if the borrower defaults.  

Although this ability of the GSEs to “put back” loans to lenders helps protect the 

taxpayers from losses, an open question is whether the costs of the associated 

contraction in credit availability outweigh the benefits of risk mitigation.   

At the same time that housing demand has weakened, the number of homes for 

sale is elevated relative to historical norms, due in large part to the swollen inventory 

of homes held by banks, guarantors, and servicers after completion of foreclosure 

proceedings. 3  These properties are known as real estate owned, or REO, properties.     

Furthermore, sales by REO owners are often characterized as distressed sales because 

the regulatory and contractual constraints they face affect their options and incentives 

for disposing of the properties and may affect their willingness to improve the 

properties or to sell them at a discount, which in turn would affect home prices beyond 

the increase in overall supply.   

Since 2008, distressed sales have consistently accounted for one-third or more of 

existing home sales, compared with only a small fraction of sales in preceding decades 

(chart 31).  In addition to increasing the supply of homes for sale, these distressed 

sales may have an effect on all house prices in a given area if appraisers do not adjust 

for the differences between distressed and nondistressed sales.  And as these 

discounted transactions go on the books, they can effectively contribute to tighter 

credit conditions both because they might lower mortgage appraisals for nearby 

nondistressed properties and because mortgage lenders are motivated to offer tighter 

                                                 
3 Although the numbers are difficult to measure precisely, estimates by Federal Reserve staff suggest that 
perhaps as many as one-fourth of the 2 million houses for sale in the second quarter of 2011 were REO 
properties, with an anticipated future inflow of foreclosures perhaps as high as 1 million units in both 2012 
and 2013.
