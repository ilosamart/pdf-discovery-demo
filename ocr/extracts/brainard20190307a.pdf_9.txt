rising somewhat above 2 percent for a time, which is in line with the symmetry of the 

target.    

There is a separate discussion of policies that would pre-commit to make up for 

past misses on inflation, such as temporary price-level targeting, which may be important 

in circumstances with a low long-run neutral rate and more frequent effective-lower-

bound episodes.10  I expect this will be part of our review of monetary policy strategies, 

tools, and communication practices later this year.11 

Our policy goal now is to preserve the progress we have made on maximum 

employment and target inflation.  Core inflation last year came in around target.   It is 

heartening to see so many American workers coming back into the jobs market with 

rising wages.  Our business contacts note they are currently hiring and investing in 

training workers who may not have been considered just a few years ago.    

With regard to policy, modest downward revisions to the baseline outlook for 

output and employment would call for modest downward revisions to the path for our 

conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, helping to offset some of the weakness 

that would otherwise weigh on the economy.  Moreover, basic principles of risk 

management would suggest that the increase in downside risks warrants a modest 

downward revision to the modal path for policy.  These downside risks, if realized, could 

weigh on economic activity.12  So heightened downside risks to output and employment 

would argue for a softer federal funds rate path even if the modal outlook for the 

economy were unchanged.

12 The limited amount of conventional policy space reinforces the importance of guarding against the 
materialization of downside risks.
