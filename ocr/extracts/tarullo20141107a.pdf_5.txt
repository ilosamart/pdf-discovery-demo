county.  This finding suggests that the “soft” information obtained from their local relationships 

usefully informs rural community banks’ underwriting.5  Federal Reserve research also suggests 

that many community banks that adhered to the traditional relationship banking model of 

funding local lending with customer deposits continued to thrive even during the worst years of 

the financial crisis.6   

In contrast, many small banks that turned to a more transactional model and funded 

construction loans—often outside of their local market—with borrowings, rather than core 

deposits, failed.  And, precisely because of their business model, community banks do have their 

vulnerabilities.  They are more likely to have geographic and portfolio concentrations that can 

make them vulnerable to localized economic problems.  Of course, the failure of a community 

bank in these circumstances will only exacerbate these problems.  Especially in rural areas, the 

disappearance of community banks could result in a permanent reduction in this local kind of 

credit, as the slack may not all be picked up by larger banks.7  Additionally, of course, there will 

usually be issues requiring supervisory and management consideration for at least a time.  At 

present, as I know you have been hearing from your supervisors, these issues include 

cybersecurity and interest rate risks.

compensation growth, higher poverty rates, and lower employment.  See John Kandrac (2013), “Bank Failure,
