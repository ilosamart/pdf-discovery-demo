given the wide income and wealth disparities in the United States, this area is ripe for 

more research.  

In recent years, the Board has increased its efforts to measure and understand 

differences in the economic situations faced by different types of families.  A particularly 

strong source of data to improve our understanding of the role for inequality and 

heterogeneity is the SCF.  The triennial SCF marks its 30th anniversary this year, as the 

fieldwork for the 2013 survey begins this month.  The data we collect on U.S. families 

are a fundamental input for many different types of research projects being undertaken by 

Board economists, in other government agencies and research centers, and in academia.  

In addition, the Board, in partnership with other members of the Federal Reserve System, 

is engaged in a wide range of analysis and research using rich and timely data on 

households’ use of consumer credit.  And the Board continues to support direct efforts to 

understand differences in spending and saving behavior across households, such as 

studies of stimulus policies in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of 

Consumers.  

There is much work to be done on understanding the ways in which income and 

wealth inequality and other forms of household heterogeneity affect aggregate behavior, 

and the implications for monetary policy.  The times demand that we continue to analyze 

such dynamics and their implications, in partnership with academics, our Federal Reserve 

System colleagues, and policy analysts representing many different types of government 

and private-sector institutions.  

Thank you for your attention and the creative thought you bring to today’s 

economic challenges.
