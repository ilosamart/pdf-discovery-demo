I would also argue strongly that U.S. monetary policies were not beggar thy 

neighbor policies in that, on balance, they generally did not drain demand from other 

economies.  Federal Reserve staff analysis finds that an easing of monetary policy in the 

United States benefits foreign economies from both stronger U.S. activity and improved 

global financial conditions.   

The “taper tantrum” of 2013 

We should also expect spillovers when monetary policy is tightened.  Central 

bank communications can be a tricky business.  And indeed, financial markets reacted 

strongly to the first statements by Chairman Bernanke in the spring of 2013 that the Fed’s 

asset purchases were likely to decelerate in the near future and come to an end not long 

after that.  Some market participants clearly understood these statements to be broadly in 

line with previous guidance about the eventual normalization of policy as recovery of the 

U.S. economy took hold.  But others may have grown accustomed to continuing asset 

purchases; the most recent program of quantitative easing, commonly referred to as QE3, 

had been first announced less than a year before and was proceeding at a steady pace of 

$85 billion per month.   

The onset of the taper tantrum went well beyond a roiling of U.S. financial 

markets.  Spillovers to other advanced-economy financial markets included stock price 

declines, significant increases in sovereign yields, higher overnight interest swap rates in 

the United Kingdom and euro area, and rising credit spreads in some countries.
