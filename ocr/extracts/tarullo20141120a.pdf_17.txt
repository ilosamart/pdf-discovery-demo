To complement the LCR and NSFR, in 2012 the Federal Reserve launched the 

Comprehensive Liquidity Assessment and Review (CLAR) for firms in the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) portfolio.17  Like the Comprehensive Capital 

Analysis and Review (CCAR), CLAR is an annual horizontal assessment, with quantitative and 

qualitative elements, overseen by a multidisciplinary committee of liquidity experts from across 

the Federal Reserve.  In CLAR, supervisors assess the adequacy of LISCC portfolio firms’ 

liquidity positions relative to their unique risks and test the reliability of these firms’ approaches 

to managing liquidity risk.  CLAR provides a regular opportunity for supervisors to respond to 

evolving liquidity risks and firm practices over time.  

CLAR involves evaluations of firms’ liquidity positions both through a range of 

supervisory liquidity metrics and through analysis of firms’ internal stress tests.  A variety of 

liquidity indicators, such as funding concentrations, measure vulnerabilities beyond those 

captured in the LCR; the measurements are made over a number of time horizons.  In parallel to 

this quantitative assessment, supervisors also examine the stress tests that each firm uses to make 

funding decisions and to determine its liquidity needs.  Recent CLAR work on the firms’ own 

stress testing practices has focused, among other issues, on assumptions regarding liquidity needs 

for capital markets activity, such as prime brokerage services and derivatives trading.  As with 

CCAR, this analysis helps inform supervisors of the reliability of firms’ own risk measurement 

and management.     

Though similar to CCAR in some respects, CLAR does not include a specific quantitative 

post-stress minimum.  Of course, LISCC firms will be required to meet the LCR, which is itself a
