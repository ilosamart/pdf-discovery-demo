policy, there is considerably less convergence around theories of, metrics for, and policy 

prescriptions to promote, financial stability.  Policy and academic writing generally limits 

the term “macroprudential” to measures directed specifically at countering risks in the 

financial system that, if realized, can severely impact real activity.

  But adoption of 

consistent terminology does not itself resolve questions of whether, for example, 

increases in systemic risk are endogenous to the financial system and thus follow a 

somewhat regular cyclical pattern, or are instead somewhat randomized, albeit repeated, 

phenomena.

Differences in views of the origins of systemic risk obviously affect views of the 

best ways to measure it and, of course, the best policies to contain it.  One example, of 

particular interest to central bankers, is the ongoing debate about the circumstances under 

which monetary policy should be adjusted to take account of financial stability concerns.  

Lying behind the various positions in this debate are differing views on how systemic risk 

propagates, and thus on the relative efficacy of monetary versus macroprudential policies.   

Progress in these debates is complicated by the fact that, by definition, financial 

stability policies are directed toward preventing or mitigating rare events, rather than 

outcomes such as inflation and unemployment that are continuously observable.  This 

focus on tail risks raises important issues of accountability in the institutional design of

 Thus, for example, fiscal or tax policies would not be generally characterized as macroprudential tools, 

even though they could have implications for systemic risk in some circumstances.  For useful overviews of 

macroprudential policy issues and debates, see International Monetary Fund (2011), “Macroprudential
