currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if 

the economic data continue to come in about as we expect.  Indeed, at our meeting later 

this month, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are 

continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of 

the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate. 

Nonetheless, as we have said many times--and as my discussion today 

demonstrates--monetary policy cannot be and is not on a preset course.  As in 2015 and 

2016, the Committee stands ready to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path for 

monetary policy if unanticipated developments materially change the economic outlook. 

Monetary Policy Is Not a Panacea 

The U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our 

congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, but we of

Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, the ongoing expansion has been the slowest 

since World War II, with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year.12  

This subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years--

compared with much of the post-World War II period--and disappointing productivity 

growth both in the United States and abroad.  

Our report also noted that, despite a notable pickup in 2015, real incomes for the 

median family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession, and the 

gains during this economic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income 

distribution, as has been the case for quite some time.  Families at the 10th percentile of
