It is an honor and a privilege to participate once again in this annual Hoover 

Institution Monetary Policy Conference.  The topic of this year’s conference, “Strategies 

for Monetary Policy,” is especially timely.  As you know, the Federal Reserve System is 

conducting a review of the strategy, tools, and communication practices we deploy to 

pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.  In this 

review, we expect to benefit from the insights and perspectives that are presented today, 

as well as those offered at other conferences devoted to this topic, as we assess possible 

practical ways in which we might refine our existing monetary policy framework to 

better achieve our dual-mandate goals on a sustained basis. 

My talk today will not, however, be devoted to a broad review of the Fed’s 

monetary policy framework—that process is ongoing, and I would not want to prejudge 

the outcome—but it will instead focus on some of the important ways in which economic 

models and financial market signals help me think about conducting monetary policy in 

practice after a career of thinking about it in theory.1 

The Role of Monetary Policy 

Let me set the scene with a very brief—and certainly selective—review of the 

evolution over the past several decades of professional thinking about monetary policy.  I 

will begin with Milton Friedman’s landmark 1967 American Economic Association 

presidential address, “The Role of Monetary Policy.”2  This article is, of course, most 

famous for its message that there is no long-run, exploitable tradeoff between inflation 

                                                 
1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or 
Federal Open Market Committee participants.  I would like to thank Ed Nelson and Bob Tetlow for their 
assistance in preparing this speech. 
2 See Friedman (1968).  Recent retrospectives on Friedman’s (1968) American Economic Association 
address that consider its implications for monetary policy analysis include Hall and Sargent (2018), Laidler 
(2018), Mankiw and Reis (2018), and Nelson (2018).
