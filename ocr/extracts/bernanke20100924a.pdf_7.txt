for understanding key aspects of the crisis and for designing appropriate policy 

responses.  

For example, the excessive dependence of some financial firms on unstable short-

term funding led to runs on key institutions, with highly adverse implications for the 

functioning of the system as a whole.  The fact that dependence on unstable short-term 

funding could lead to runs is hardly news to economists; it has been a central issue in 

monetary economics since Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot wrote about the question 

in the 19th century.2

Britain (New York:  A. M. Kelley); and Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street:  A Description of 
the Money Market (New York:  Charles Scribner’s Sons).  A discussion relating the Federal Reserve's 
policy actions during the financial crisis to the ideas of Bagehot is contained in Brian F. Madigan (2009),

  Indeed, the recent crisis bore a striking resemblance to the bank 

runs that figured so prominently in Thornton’s and Bagehot’s eras; but in this case, the 

run occurred outside the traditional banking system, in the shadow banking system--

consisting of financial institutions other than regulated depository institutions, such as 

securitization vehicles, money market funds, and investment banks.  Prior to the crisis, 

these institutions had become increasingly dependent on various forms of short-term 

wholesale funding, as had some globally active commercial banks.  Examples of such 

funding include commercial paper, repurchase agreements (repos), and securities lending.  

In the years immediately before the crisis, some of these forms of funding grew 

especially rapidly; for example, repo liabilities of U.S. broker-dealers increased by a
