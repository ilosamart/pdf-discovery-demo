from each local council serves on the national council that meets with the Board in 

Washington twice a year.   

At a recent meeting, for example, one of our CDIAC members asked us to be 

clearer about whether particular rules and guidance apply to community banks.  Having 

heard from this banker as well as others, we are now working to more explicitly indicate 

which banks will be affected when we issue new regulatory proposals, final rules, or 

regulatory guidance.  Although this change seems relatively simple, we hope it will help 

banks avoid allocating precious resources to poring over supervisory guidance that does 

not apply to them. 

In addition to the advisory council, the Board last year established a supervision 

subcommittee on smaller regional and community banking.  Because of their professional 

backgrounds in community banking and bank supervision, I asked Governors Elizabeth 

Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on this subcommittee.  Its primary role is to 

improve our understanding of community and regional banking conditions and to review 

policy proposals for their potential effect on the safety and soundness of, and the 

regulatory costs imposed on, community and regional institutions.

  Governors Duke and 

Raskin are also keenly interested in how our policies could affect the availability of credit 

to sound borrowers. 

We have other contacts with community banks that have proved valuable.  For 

quite a few years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach 

programs for banks.  More recently, several of these programs have been expanded

 For the purposes of the Federal Reserveâ€™s supervisory programs, regional banking organizations generally 

are considered to be those banks and bank holding companies (including savings and loan holding 

companies) with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.
