7. Wicksell’s explanation of price dynamics.  (continuation of #1 above) 

Now let us suppose that for some reason or other commodity 

prices rise while the stock of money remains unchanged, or that 

the stock of money is diminished while prices remain 

temporarily unchanged.  The cash balances will gradually appear 

to be too small in relation to the new level of prices. . . . I 

therefore seek to enlarge my balance.  This can only be done--

neglecting for the present the possibility of borrowing, etc.--

through a reduction in my demand for goods and services, or 

through an increase in the supply of my own commodity . . . or 

though both together.  The same is true of all other owners and 

consumers of commodities.  But in fact nobody will succeed in 

realizing the object at which each is aiming--to increase his cash 

balance. . . . On the other hand, the universal reduction in 

demand and increase in supply of commodities will necessarily 

bring about a continuous fall in all prices. This can only cease 

when prices have fallen to the level at which the cash balances 

are regarded as adequate. . . .  (pp. 39-40) 

8. Paul Samuelson on Wicksell.  In 1962 Paul Samuelson delivered the Wicksell 

Lectures in Sweden, and opened with a lecture on “Wicksell, The 

Economist”.5  Herewith three extracts from his lecture:  

A stormy rebel against the traditional religion and prudery of his 

day, Wicksell had the warm heart of a socialist along with the 

cool head of a classical economist.  (pp. 1682-3);  

. . . Wicksell spent part of his time as professor at Lund in jail.  

Whatever we may think of the state of society then, which could 

jail a man for the offense of blasphemy, one’s admiration goes 

out to the tradition of academic freedom in Swedish Universities, 

which keeps a professor’s livelihood and scholarly privileges 

immune from his non-scholarly misdemeanors. (p.1684);
