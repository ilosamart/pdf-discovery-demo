financial decisions that people have to make--from paying for school to buying a home to 

planning for retirement--vary through the course of their lives, and thus we need to 

ensure that access to financial education is readily available at all stages of life.  

Moreover, relevant, accurate, and reliable financial information must be readily available 

to consumers at the time they are making their decisions.  Given the ubiquity of 

smartphones, applications for mobile devices may be one effective method of delivering 

this just-in-time information at a relatively low cost.  For example, our colleagues at the 

Department of the Treasury are currently running an “app” contest to design mobile tools 

to help Americans make better financial choices. 

Because financially capable consumers ultimately contribute to a stable economic 

and financial system as well as improve their own financial situations, it’s clear that the 

Federal Reserve has a significant stake in financial education.  We demonstrate our 

commitment through numerous programs and resources offered by the Federal Reserve 

System staff and through partnerships our Reserve Banks have formed with local 

educators and institutions.  For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, during its 

annual Money Smart Week, conducts free classes and activities to help consumers better 

manage their personal finances.  And the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis offers a 

broad selection of online personal finance courses that teachers can use along with their 

students.  To find out more about what is happening in your area, I encourage you to visit 

the Federal Reserve System’s education website, www.federalreserveeducation.org. 

 I would again like to thank you for your participation today, and I look forward 

to your questions.
