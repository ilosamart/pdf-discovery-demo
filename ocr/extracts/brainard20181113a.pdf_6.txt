supervised institutions and toward less regulated and more opaque spaces in the financial 

system.11 

Our existing regulatory and supervisory guardrails are a good place to start as we assess 

the appropriate approach for AI processes.  The National Science and Technology Council, in an 

extensive study addressing regulatory activity generally, concludes that if an AI-related risk 

“falls within the bounds of an existing regulatory regime, . . . the policy discussion should start 

by considering whether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether 

they need to be adapted to the addition of AI.”12  A recent report by the U.S. Department of the 

Treasury reaches a similar conclusion with regard to financial services.13 

With respect to banking services, a few generally applicable laws, regulations, guidance, 

and supervisory approaches appear particularly relevant to the use of AI tools.  First, the Federal 

Reserve’s “Guidance on Model Risk Management” (SR Letter 11-7) highlights the importance to 

safety and soundness of embedding critical analysis throughout the development, 

implementation, and use of models, which include complex algorithms like AI.14  It also 

underscores “effective challenge” of models by a “second set of eyes”--unbiased, qualified 

individuals separated from the model’s development, implementation, and use.  It describes 

supervisory expectations for sound independent review of a firm’s own models to confirm they 

are fit for purpose and functioning as intended.  If the reviewers are unable to evaluate a model 

in full or if they identify issues, they might recommend the model be used with greater caution or
