 As for the business sector, the uncertain durability of the recovery appears to be 

discouraging businesses from decisively increasing their productive capacity.  

Notwithstanding a surge around mid-2011, on balance, firms appear to have increased 

their spending on equipment and structures at a less robust pace in 2011 than they did 

in the prior year.  The pace of inventory accumulation was also quite modest.  The 

most recent indicators suggest more of the same:  Orders and shipments of capital 

goods have been subdued in the past few months, commercial vacancy rates remain 

elevated (chart 8), and most indicators of business sentiment remain mediocre 

(chart 9).   

 The government sector also continues to be a substantial drag on activity, both at 

the federal level (chart 10)--where defense and nondefense spending look to have 

dropped last year--and at the state and local levels (chart 11).  The declines in state and 

local government expenditures reflect continuing cutbacks in both employment and 

construction outlays.  The budgets of these governments are quite strained by the 

ongoing phase-out of federal stimulus grants and the weakness of local tax collections. 

 One area of the economy that has been performing relatively favorably is the 

trade sector.  In the third quarter, the annualized growth rate of exports of domestically 

produced goods and services was about 5 percent, while net exports--that is, exports 

less imports--contributed nearly one half of a percentage point to the increase in real 

GDP, about one-fourth of the overall gain (chart 12).  However, in recent weeks, many 

forecasters have weakened their global outlooks substantially, which certainly does 

not bode well for U.S. exports going forward.
