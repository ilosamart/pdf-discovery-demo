Community Partners, is working with a private real estate fund to direct some of the private 

dollars seeking investment properties in Oakland.  The nonprofit partnership is using a complex 

data-driven platform to identify targeted low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in the city, 

purchasing vacant properties, rehabilitating them through a local workforce development 

program, and converting them to rental.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that the properties remain 

local neighborhood assets.  To achieve this, the partnership is prioritizing rentals and sales to 

qualified local residents or nonprofits.  Such an innovative strategy seeks to complement local 

government and investor activity so that residents can share in the benefits of a housing recovery.         

“Low Demand” Locations 

Not all markets are equally attractive to private investors, so some governments are 

developing programs to attract private capital to “low demand,” high-vacancy neighborhoods.  

The city of Baltimore, Maryland provides a good example of such a program.  Baltimore is 

burdened with approximately 16,000 vacant and abandoned buildings, about a quarter of which 

are owned by the city.  Much of this vacancy has been caused by population loss and suburban 

flight--Baltimore City has lost nearly one-third of its population over the last 50 years.18  

However, not all parts of Baltimore have a significant number of vacant properties.  In fact, only 

5 percent of census tracts in the Baltimore metropolitan area have a long-term vacancy rate in the 

top decile of the national distribution.19 The city of Baltimore has recognized these micro-market 

distinctions and initiated an innovative data-driven program to identify areas with a high 

concentration of vacant properties and turn these properties into valuable assets.
