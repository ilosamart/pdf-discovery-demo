nearly as much as she was her social loss.  Ms. Means told the interviewer that she no longer 

invites friends over to her home because of her embarrassment about the condition of her street. 

I have visited the southeast side of Cleveland and have seen first-hand the challenges 

faced by homeowners.  There is a large inventory of homes that have gone through the 

foreclosure process and are now owned by financial institutions.  These properties are often 

referred to as REO, or “real estate owned,” which is how they are recorded on bank balance 

sheets.   

Our conference publication includes an article by Frank Ford, of Cleveland-based 

Neighborhood Progress, Inc., that paints a very troubling picture of the impact of a large number 

of foreclosures in a once vibrant community.  Ford estimates that every blighted house in 

Cleveland can negatively impact five or six other houses near it.  Homeowners in close 

proximity to foreclosures experience even greater losses in value than the general price declines 

that occur as a market absorbs a large number of distressed sales.  With an estimated 11,500 

vacant houses in Cleveland, Ford calculates that some 60,000 occupied homes will likely be 

impacted.1

The challenges associated with REO are not exclusive to older cities, such as Cleveland 

or Detroit, where economic forces have long threatened the sustainability of large infrastructures 

that support fewer residents.  Carolina Reid, of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has 

  Even worse, as he explains, is that losses don’t stop at home equity:  tax revenues 

decline and along with them the financial support necessary to provide for public schools, police, 

fire, and social services.  Neighborhoods that were once vibrant have, in many cases, become 

blighted, and the resources necessary to address the problem are scarce.

Mikelbank, “Spatial Analysis of the Impact of Vacant, Abandoned and Foreclosed Properties,” Federal Reserve 
Bank of Cleveland, November 2008.  Mikelbank finds that vacant properties have a significant impact on the home 
values of neighboring properties.
