I will loosely define fintech as technology-enabled financial innovation that results in 

material changes to the provision of financial services.  As is often the case when technological 

innovation meets established business, fintech has attracted a great deal of attention, ranging 

from utopian claims to hostile skepticism.  Claims about fintech’s promise abound: it has the 

power and potential to reduce economic inequality, increase financial inclusion, and boost 

economic growth.  Through the introduction of new methodologies, greater information curation, 

and reduction in processing costs, fintech could potentially reduce financial volatility and 

vulnerabilities.

largest mortgage provider is an online lender.  In China, a technology firm started the world’s 

largest money market fund.  

Yet, alongside this growth in fintech, as my predecessor as FSB chair emphasized, we as 

regulators must ensure that as we maximize the potential benefits in the development of fintech 

we minimize the potential risks and costs.  The FSB monitors and analyzes the financial stability 

implications of financial innovation as part of our mandate to identify and address vulnerabilities 

in the global financial system.  Let me outline two areas that we have started to examine in 

greater detail: the potential effects from the entry of large technology firms into financial 

services and the potential effects from the growth in decentralized financial technologies. 

Over the last decade, the world has witnessed an explosion of large technology firms that 

are weaving themselves into our daily lives: for example, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Tencent, 

and Baidu.  Some of these firms are increasingly providing some financial services, such as
