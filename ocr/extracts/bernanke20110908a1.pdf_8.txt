the population and the ongoing rise in health-care costs, the finances of the federal 

government will spiral out of control in coming decades, risking severe economic and 

financial damage.  But, while prompt and decisive action to put the federal governmentâ€™s 

finances on a sustainable trajectory is urgently needed, fiscal policymakers should not, as 

a consequence, disregard the fragility of the economic recovery.  Fortunately, the two 

goals--achieving fiscal sustainability, which is the result of responsible policies set in 

place for the longer term, and avoiding creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery--are 

not incompatible.  Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits 

over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the 

recovery in the near term, can help serve both objectives. 

The Outlook for Inflation 

Let me turn now from the outlook for growth to the outlook for inflation.  Prices 

of many commodities, notably oil, increased sharply earlier this year.  Higher gasoline 

and food prices translated directly into increased inflation for consumers, and in some 

cases producers of other goods and services were able to pass through their higher costs 

to their customers as well.  In addition, the global supply disruptions associated with the 

disaster in Japan put upward pressure on motor vehicle prices.  As a result of these 

influences, inflation picked up significantly; over the first half of this year, the price 

index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 

percent, compared with an average of less than 1-1/2 percent over the preceding two 

years. 

However, inflation is expected to moderate in the coming quarters as these 

transitory influences wane.  In particular, the prices of oil and many other commodities
