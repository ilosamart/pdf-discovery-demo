Consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has 

declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has 

fallen.  As a consequence, the employment-to-population ratio has increased far less over 

the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past 

experience.  For policymakers, the key question is: What portion of the decline in labor 

force participation reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical weakness in 

the labor market?  If the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the 

unemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market 

slack.    

Labor force participation peaked in early 2000, so its decline began well before 

the Great Recession.  A portion of that decline clearly relates to the aging of the baby 

boom generation.  But the pace of decline accelerated with the recession.  As an 

accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to 

increases in four factors:  retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, 

including worker discouragement.8  Of these, greater worker discouragement is most 

directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further 

increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the 

workforce.  Indeed, the flattening out of the labor force participation rate since late last 

year could partly reflect discouraged workers rejoining the labor force in response to the 

significant improvements that we have seen in labor market conditions.  If so, the cyclical 

shortfall in labor force participation may have diminished.
