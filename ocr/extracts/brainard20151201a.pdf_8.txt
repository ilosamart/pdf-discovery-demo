Other factors likely pushing down the current neutral rate may prove even more 

persistent.  Importantly, expectations that the economy’s growth potential has fallen 

could contribute to a persistent decline in the neutral rate.  Indeed, there is evidence that 

growth in the labor force, and perhaps productivity, have slowed persistently in recent 

years.  After increasing noticeably over much of the post-World War II period, the labor 

force participation rate flattened out over the 1990s and began to decline in the early 

2000s as the baby boom generation approached retirement.  Most recently, the pace of 

decline has quickened, with the participation rate declining 1/2 percent per year, on 

average, over the recovery.11  Productivity growth has also slowed, averaging just 

1 percent per year over the recovery, about half the pace over the 50 years prior to the 

financial crisis.12  Given this data, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that 

the growth rate of potential output is only 1.7 percent currently, less than half the rate 

during the 50 years before 2008.  Nevertheless, although there is evidence of a 

connection between low potential output growth and a low neutral rate, as pointed out by 

Hamilton and others, the relationship is not precisely estimated, which leaves 

considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect.13 

Finally, investors’ risk sensitivity appears to have been altered by the experience 

of tail risks during the crisis, which could have a persistent depressing effect on the 

                                                 
11 Population growth has also moved gradually lower in the United States, though the effect has not been as 
large as in some foreign economies, where the size of the population is now stagnant or falling.   
12 It is unclear how persistent recent low rates of measured productivity growth will be.  While weak 
investment levels, particularly early on in the recovery, likely contributed to lower productivity gains, 
investment levels going forward could be closer to historical norms.  Also, recent technological gains may 
eventually contribute strongly to productivity growth; see, for example, Baily, Manyika, and Gupta (2013).  
In addition, there is evidence that some of the contribution of technology gains to productivity growth is 
being understated; see, for example, Byrne and Pinto (2015), Byrne and Corrado (2015), and Byrne, Oliner 
and Sichel (2015).
