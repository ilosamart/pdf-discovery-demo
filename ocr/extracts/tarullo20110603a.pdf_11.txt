20% to more than 100% over the Basel III requirements, depending on choices made among 

plausible assumptions. 

Another methodology uses macroeconomic models to estimate both the costs and 

benefits of higher capital requirements to the economy as a whole.  The motivation for this 

“long-run economic impact” approach is still macroprudential, even though it differs from that 

informing the expected impact approach.  However, isolating the effects of capital levels within a 

general macroeconomic model is a very challenging task and, perhaps for that reason, it 

produced lower implied increases in capital requirements than did the expected impact approach. 

A third methodology tries to determine how much additional capital would be needed to 

offset any reduction in funding costs associated with the perceived too-big-to-fail status of SIFIs.  

The capital requirement increases implied by this approach were considerably higher than for the 

other two approaches.  However, the results seemed even more sensitive to changes in 

reasonable initial assumptions than did the other two models.  Moreover, while the possible 

moral hazard and competitive funding advantage associated with SIFIs are certainly of concern, 

they do not relate directly to the conceptual foundation for enhanced capital requirements, which 

lies in the negative externalities associated with a SIFI failure. 

In reaching our final view on calibration, the Federal Reserve Board will consider all 

these approaches, though I note that the expected impact methodology has had the most 

influence on our staff’s analysis.  We will also take account of observations from academics and 

financial institutions.  We are certainly mindful of the uncertainties associated with these 

methodologies.  But, at the same time, we cannot ignore the costs to society that the failures of 

SIFIs would cause the financial system and the economy more generally.
