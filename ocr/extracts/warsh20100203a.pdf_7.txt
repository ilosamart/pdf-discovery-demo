works--not to the exclusion of regulatory discipline--but in support of it.  They should serve as 

complementary pillars, bolstering one another as needed.  

So, how do we design a new financial architecture that--in addition to improved 

resolution authority--more squarely confronts the too-big-to-fail problem?  It isn’t simple or easy 

or ripe for a quick-fix.  But, we cannot afford to be discouraged.  The stakes are too high.   

First, in order to resurrect market discipline from the ash-heap of the recent crisis, 

stakeholders--that is, shareholders, creditors, and regulators alike--need better, more timely 

information about financial firms.  Information-sharing is growing exponentially in all aspects of 

human endeavor.  Financial firm disclosures should be no exception.   

Asset quality and funding sources for financial firms must be more understandable and 

readily comparable among peers.  Stakeholders can then make better informed judgments of 

potential risks and rewards.  Markets can help effectively discipline the behavior of firms by re-

pricing funding costs as perceived risks change.4  And regulators can use market prices and 

changes in funding mix, among other information, to evaluate whether firms are being evaluated 

independent of government backing.   

The stress tests led by the Federal Reserve in early 2009 were testament to the need for 

improved public information about firms’ financial position.  Market functioning and credit and 

capital availability improved markedly after the Federal Reserve’s detailed, cross-firm 

comparisons were made public.  This is no coincidence.   

Second, reforms must encourage robust competition.  Market entry and market exit can 

be a more effective means of developing a stronger, more resilient financial system.  The too-

                                                 
4 More understandable, frequent disclosures could also foster development of contingent capital securities.  These 
securities could exert ex ante discipline on firms, and then convert to common equity to absorb losses if a firm’s 
capital position were to fall below a threshold.
