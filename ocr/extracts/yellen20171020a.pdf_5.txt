The FOMC’s goal in lowering longer-term interest rates was to help the U.S. 

economy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged 

from it.  Some have suggested that the slow pace of the economic recovery proves that 

our unconventional policy tools were ineffective.  However, one should recognize that 

the recovery could have been much slower in the absence of our unconventional tools.  

Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities 

purchases--by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families 

and businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative--did help 

spur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off 

disinflationary pressures.4  

Other central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that 

followed the financial crisis.5  Evidence accumulated from their experience also supports 

the notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after 

their short-term interest rates were lowered to near-zero--and, in some cases, even below 

zero.6
