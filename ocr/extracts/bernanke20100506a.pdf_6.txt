we released a year ago covered the 2009-2010 period as a whole and did not try to 

apportion losses to specific quarters within the period.  Moreover, at this point, the 

overall economy is likely to perform better than in the more adverse scenario.  However, 

with those caveats, it is encouraging that, through the end of last year, the revenues of the 

SCAP banks have collectively reached about 60 percent of the two-year estimates under 

the more adverse scenario while loan losses are at only about 40 percent of estimates.  

Although the banking organizations that participated in the SCAP have 

significantly improved their financial positions, they continue to face challenges.  By the 

same token, regional and community banks, which also play a vital role in our financial 

system and economy, are dealing with challenges of their own.  The number of regional 

and community institutions considered weak is still increasing, and their loan losses 

likely will remain elevated this year.  The most significant areas of concern are 

residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans.  Also, with credit demand tepid 

and the economy still under stress, profitable lending opportunities have been relatively 

scarce for many of these banks.   

For logistical reasons--including the large number and diversity of smaller banks 

in the United States--we have not attempted a full-scale simultaneous stress test of these 

banks but instead have worked with them on an individual basis to evaluate their capital 

needs.  Although the results vary considerably across institutions, prospective losses are 

such that many of these organizations may need additional capital over the next few 

years.  Unfortunately, smaller banks generally have fewer alternatives than large banks 

for raising fresh capital and thus tend to rely on retained earnings for capital growth.  

Recognizing these difficulties, we will continue to work closely with smaller banks as
