funding and interbank markets.  While some participants in each of these sectors had 

direct exposures to Lehman, many more did not.  Moreover, even in cases in which direct 

exposures to Lehman were manageable, the turmoil caused by Lehman’s failure added 

stress to the system at a particularly unwelcome time.  In this way, the failure of a highly 

interconnected institution such as Lehman imposes costs on society well in excess of 

those borne by the firm’s shareholders and direct creditors.  Accordingly, tying enhanced 

capital requirements to interconnectedness improves the resilience of the system.  Of 

course, higher capital requirements are not costless; they may raise financing costs for 

some borrowers, and they have the potential to induce institutions to engage in regulatory 

arbitrage.  An important ongoing agenda for research and policy is the design and 

implementation of data-based measures of interconnectedness to ensure that our 

understanding of financial system interconnections evolves in tandem with financial 

innovation.       

While enhanced capital standards for GSIBs are an important tool for managing 

systemic risk that arises through interconnectedness, they are not the only tool.  The 

Basel Committee’s program contains a number of initiatives that will help manage 

interconnectedness and systemic risk.  These measures include countercyclical capital 

buffers, liquidity requirements, increased capital charges for exposures to large financial 

institutions, large exposure rules, and deductions from capital for equity investments in 

banks.

  These and other initiatives will all play a role in managing the effect of 

complexity and interconnectedness on financial stability.  In fact, the multifaceted nature 

of the reform program is an important design principle.  One of the lessons of the recent
