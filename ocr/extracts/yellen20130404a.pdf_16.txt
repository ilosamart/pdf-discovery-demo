intentions and should reduce the risk of misunderstanding and market disruption as the 

conclusion of the program draws closer.      

The Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases continually add to the 

accommodation that the Federal Reserve is providing to help strengthen the economy.  

An end to those purchases means that the FOMC has ceased augmenting that support, not 

that it is withdrawing accommodation.  When and how to begin actually removing the 

significant accommodation provided by the Federal Reserve’s large holdings of longer-

term securities is a separate matter.  In its March statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its 

expectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain 

appropriate for a considerable time after the current asset purchase program ends and the 

economic recovery has strengthened.14  Accordingly, there will likely be a substantial 

period after asset purchases conclude but before the FOMC starts removing 

accommodation by reducing asset holdings or raising the federal funds rate.    

To guide expectations concerning the process of normalizing the size and 

composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, at its June 2011 meeting, the FOMC 

laid out what it called “exit principles.”  In these principles, the FOMC indicated that 

asset sales would likely follow liftoff of the federal funds rate.  It also noted that, in order 

to minimize the risk of market disruption, the pace of asset sales during this process could 

be adjusted up or down in response to changes in either the economic outlook or financial 

conditions.  For example, changes in the pace or timing of asset sales might be warranted 

by concerns over market functioning or excessive volatility in bond markets.  While
