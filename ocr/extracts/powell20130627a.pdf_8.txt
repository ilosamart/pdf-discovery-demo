Both forward guidance and asset purchases work by lowering longer-term interest 

rates and contributing to an easing of overall financial market conditions.  Lower rates 

increase economic activity through a variety of channels.5  Businesses and households 

react to lower rates by investing and spending more.  Lower rates also support the prices 

of housing and financial assets such as stocks and bonds.  Higher asset prices increase 

wealth and, with a lag, induce higher spending.   

In all likelihood, the current LSAP program will continue for some time.  It is 

therefore appropriate to ask how well asset purchases have worked, and whether they are 

still working today.

Most research has found, and I agree, that the first round of purchases of longer-

term securities, which began in November 2008, contributed significantly to ending the 

financial crisis and preventing a much more severe economic contraction.  The second 

round of purchases that began in November 2010 also appears to have been successful in 

countering disinflationary pressures.6
