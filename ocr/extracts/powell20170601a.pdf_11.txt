The Long-Run Framework 

Over the next few years, the runoff of assets acquired through QE is expected to 

reduce the balance sheet substantially below its current level of $4.5 trillion.  In the long 

run, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will depend mainly on the demand for Federal 

Reserve liabilities--currency, reserves, and other liabilities--and on the Committee’s long-

run framework for setting interest rates.21   

The next slide compares the Fed’s balance sheet of May 2007 with that of May 

2017 (figure 8).  On the asset side, the balance sheet increased by about $3.5 trillion as 

the FOMC acquired securities in its QE programs.  These assets were matched on the 

liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by a $2.2 trillion increase in reserve 

balances held by commercial banks, a $700 billion increase in currency outstanding, and 

a $500 billion increase in other liabilities.   

As can be seen more clearly in the next slide, prior to the crisis, currency was the 

Fed’s main liability (figure 9).  Currency outstanding has nearly doubled over the past 10 

years to $1.5 trillion, growing at a compound annual rate of 6.8 percent.  This growth 

reflects strong domestic and international demand for U.S. currency, which is expected to 

continue.  The eventual level of demand for reserves is less certain but is highly likely to 

exceed pre-crisis levels when reserve balances averaged only about $15 billion.  Reserves 

are the ultimate “safe asset,” and demand for safe assets has increased substantially over 

time because of long-run trends, including regulatory requirements.  Other liabilities
