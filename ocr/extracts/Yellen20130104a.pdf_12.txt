externalities may do little harm or may even be irrelevant in normal times, but they can 

be devastating during a crisis.    

The Global Policy Response to Reduce Systemic Risk  

Governments around the globe have responded to the financial crisis by adopting 

a strong, multifaceted, and coordinated reform agenda aimed at reducing systemic risk.  

At a meeting in Pittsburgh in September 2009, governments in the Group of Twenty 

(G-20) endorsed work already under way in the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision to improve capital and the management of liquidity risk in the banking 

system.

  Iâ€™ll briefly review several Basel Committee initiatives that address 

interconnectedness and systemic risk, but first, let me focus on one in particular:  higher 

capital requirements for global systemically important banks (GSIBs).  

Enhanced capital standards for GSIBs serve to limit the risks undertaken by the 

largest, most interconnected institutions whose distress has the greatest potential to 

impose negative externalities on the broader financial system.  A framework of higher 

minimum regulatory capital standards for these institutions was issued by the Basel 

Committee in November 2011, and indicators of interconnectedness account for a 

significant proportion of the overall score used to determine whether a bank will be 

subject to higher standards.

  As shown by Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia, among others, 

highly interconnected firms can transmit shocks widely, impairing the rest of the 

financial system and the economy.  We saw, for example, that when Lehman Brothers 

failed, the shock was transmitted through money market mutual funds to the short-term

 See Bank for International Settlements (2011).  It should also be noted that while the assessment 

methodology depends on interconnectedness, the specific measures employed will be continually reviewed 

and updated as appropriate.
