Stabilizing growth and mitigating a downturn, of course, are aspects of the 

Federal Reserveâ€™s mission.  Monetary policy can be a powerful tool to achieve these 

ends, but, in truth, its powers are dwarfed by larger forces, such as the productivity of the 

American people and the strength of their finances.  By educating students and 

supporting their future contributions to the economy as workers and consumers, all 

teachers, especially economics teachers, are furthering our goals at the Fed, so let me 

offer my further thanks for making our job easier.  

To help support your work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and the 

12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books to spread 

knowledge of economics, financial literacy, and the role of the Fed in promoting a 

healthy economy and financial system.  You can find some of those resources at our 

websites:  FederalReserve.gov and FederalReserveEducation.org.   

Each of the Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational initiatives, 

and the outreach to economics teachers is coordinated by the System Economic 

Education Group, which has been chaired by Princeton Williams.  

At the Board of Governors, for some years we have operated a program called 

FedEd, which sends Board employees into high schools throughout the Washington, 

D.C., area.  This outreach depends on several dozen volunteers from our staff--typically, 

recent college graduates--who help teach about the Fed, economics and finance, and 

answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.  The Federal Reserve is 

dedicated to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the economics profession, and FedEd 

and other programs across the Federal Reserve System have helped advance this goal by 

reaching many schools with significant numbers of minority students.
