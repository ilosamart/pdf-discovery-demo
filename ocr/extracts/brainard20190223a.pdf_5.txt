Why Consider a Career in Economics? 

I have discussed why it is important for the Federal Reserve and for our economy 

to see more women of color embracing the field of economics.  But what’s in it for you?  

There are many ways your career may unfold where economics might fit in it.  Some of 

you may decide your passion lies elsewhere as an undergraduate, and later find that 

advanced studies in economics align with your career interests.  Others may already feel 

that economics is your calling.  And just as there are a variety of reasons that people 

decide to deepen their studies in economics, so too there are many career fields where a 

degree in economics can be a powerful enabler. 

In my case, although I did not have an undergraduate economics degree, I later 

decided to pursue advanced study in economics because it provided a rigorous analytical 

framework and approach to data to address important problems facing America.  

Growing up, I saw how every family’s well-being is affected by their financial resilience 

and their economic opportunities.  I decided to study economics because it provides 

powerful tools to help promote a better future for many Americans.  I have found 

different ways to approach that throughout my career--from teaching the next generation 

of problem solvers, to assessing the challenges facing American manufacturers, to seeing 

the potential of microfinance for financial inclusion, to promoting maximum employment 

and stable inflation in my current job. 

I recognize that it is challenging to look around a classroom or conference room 

and not see colleagues who you can relate to.  It is humbling to imagine how that first 

economics class looked to Dr. Sadie Alexander.  But now there are a number of leading 

scholars and practitioners in the field to provide inspiration and serve as role models.
