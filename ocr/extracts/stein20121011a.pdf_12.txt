A second set of costs has to do with the possible effects of further asset purchases 

on various aspects of market functioning, including bid-ask spreads and market depth.  

And it would indeed be a concern if large Fed ownership of some segments of the 

Treasury or MBS market were to cause market liquidity to deteriorate significantly.  We 

have seen little evidence of such problems so far, and we continue to closely monitor 

market conditions.  If problems do begin to crop up, we will know it, and we will be able 

to adjust. 

A final notion of cost relates to the currently low yields and term premiums on 

Treasury bonds.  At an intuitive level, one might think that, for the Fed, as for any other 

buyer contemplating a large asset purchase, information on prices and expected returns 

should be a relevant factor in the decision.  Said differently, the case for an LSAP might 

seem more appealing if the term premium on Treasury bonds were at plus 200 basis 

points instead of its current level of roughly minus 80 basis points.   

However, to make sense of this intuition, we have to return to the question of why 

LSAPs move term premiums.  One interesting possibility is that, in a world where other 

sovereign debt has come into question, long-term Treasury securities are uniquely able to 

provide a money-like safe-haven service to certain investors.  By analogy, think of 

currency, which investors are willing to hold even at a zero yield, because of the flow of 

convenience services it provides.  Similarly, the negative term premium on long-term 

Treasury securities may in part reflect the relative scarcity of this money-like asset.  If so, 

it would be economically costly to remove Treasury securities from the system.14  This 

logic is an application of the so-called Friedman rule.15   

                                                 
14 To be clear, this argument relies on there being multiple distinct monetary assets.  That is, the case needs 
to be that, for some investors, long-term Treasury securities provide a type of service that is not provided as
