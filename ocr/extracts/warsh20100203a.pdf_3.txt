A Time for Choosing 

Nearly 30 years ago, at another critical time of choosing--in a period of economic 

malaise--policymakers were reminded from many quarters of the need to keep their wits about 

them in making policy.   

A leading intellectual of the time, Irving Kristol, remarked:  “Our economic problems are 

not intractable…Economic policies that are just a bit more sensible, especially in the areas of 

taxation and regulation, can make a lot of difference for the future.  On the other hand, once the 

idea gets around that we are in a profound crisis and that only ‘drastic action’ by Washington can 

save us--then it will be time to head for the storm cellars.”3 

The financial crisis conditions of the past two years have substantially abated.  Those that 

headed to the storm cellars have returned to see what lies in its wake.  And Washington has 

placed itself centrally in the clean-up efforts, seeking to repair the regulatory system.  This is a 

wholly worthwhile task.  Improvements in regulatory policy--if part of a broader review of the 

financial architecture--could herald greater prosperity for future generations.   

But, efficacy, not convenience, should be the foremost goal of policymakers. And we will 

have done ourselves no favors if what is billed as “comprehensive regulatory reform” over-

promises and under-delivers.  We need a broader understanding of what occurred, more basic 

changes in our financial architecture, and more useful tools in our arsenal for reform efforts to be 

worthy of the name and equal to the challenge.
