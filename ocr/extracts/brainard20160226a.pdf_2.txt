Beginning in 2014, we saw confident predictions of a coming strong divergence 

in monetary policy among the major economies.  To date, there has been less policy 

divergence in reality than had been predicted.  This observation raises the question of 

whether there may be limits on policy divergence in current circumstances. Such limits 

might reflect common forces buffeting economies around the world or the powerful

that may have the effect of front-running monetary policy adjustments in the vicinity of 

the zero lower bound.  Put differently, predictions that U.S. monetary policy would chart 

a notably divergent path have been tempered by powerful crosscurrents from abroad.1  

How Different Are Underlying Conditions? 

Before turning to divergences in policy, it is useful to review briefly the extent of 

differences in the underlying economic conditions in the major advanced economies.  

While the recovery from the global financial crisis has been frustratingly slow in every 

major economy, there nonetheless have been important differences in the pace and extent 

of healing.  Speaking loosely, among the advanced economies, the United States and 

United Kingdom appear farthest along in closing resource gaps, Japan is next in line, and 

the euro area has been somewhat slower to recover.  In the United States, resource 

utilization has increased substantially over the past five years.  The U.S. unemployment 

rate is now under 5 percent, compared with 10 percent at its recent peak.  Even so, there 

is evidence that some labor market slack still remains.2  The United Kingdom has
