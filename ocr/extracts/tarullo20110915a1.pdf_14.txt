 As is often true, efforts to tackle new questions and to confront new problems may not 

lend themselves immediately to well-worn research approaches.  Contributions in this area may 

come in many forms, including case studies and other less conventional approaches to research.  

I hope that, at least in the early stages of research into these issues, referees and journal editors 

will be sympathetic to any research that may advance our knowledge in this new area.
