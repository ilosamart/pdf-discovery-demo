system and restore economic growth, he took courageous actions that were 

unprecedented in ambition and scope.  He faced relentless criticism, personal threats, and 

the certainty that history would judge him harshly if he was wrong.  But he stood up for 

what he believed was right and necessary.  Ben Bernanke’s intelligence and knowledge 

served him well as Chairman.  But his grit and willingness to take a stand were just as 

important.  I hope you never are confronted by challenges this great, but you too will face 

moments in life when standing up for what you believe can make all the difference.   

 Having dwelt for a moment on failure and grit, let me turn to the deeper meaning 

that underpins grit and can carry us beyond failure.  The hard work of building a life that 

makes a difference is much easier to sustain when you are passionate about what you 

pursue.  When I first came to the Federal Reserve 37 years ago, I was struck by the 

passion of my colleagues for the mission of the Fed.  And these many years later, each 

day at work, I see the importance of that passion to carrying out the Fed’s duties 

effectively.  If there is a job that you feel passionate about, do what you can to pursue that 

job; if there is a purpose about which you are passionate, dedicate yourself to that 

purpose.  

 Finally, I hope that you can find joy in the lives you choose.  You are completing 

one important phase of your life today and embarking on an amazing new adventure.  

Serious decisions about life surely lie ahead, but take the time to savor the joys, large and 

small that come along the way.  Share those joys with others, and share a laugh when you 

can.
