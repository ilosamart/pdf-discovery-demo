auditors have established appropriate rou-
tines to identify improper or illegal pay-
ments under the statutes. In connection with
the evaluation of the adequacy of any audit
program, the examiner should:
a. Determine whether the auditor is aware

paign Act, Bank Bribery Act, and For-
eign Assets Control Regulation, and
whether audit programs are in place that
check for compliance with these laws.

any audits.

5. Analyze the general level of internal con-
trols to determine whether there is sufficient
protection against improper or illegal pay-
ments being irregularly recorded on the
organization’s books.

6. Examiners should be alert, in the course of
their usual examination procedures, for any
transactions or the use of organization ser-
vices or equipment, which might indicate a
violation of the statutes.

ance with Regulation K by reviewing the

ance with Section 211.28 of Regulation K.
