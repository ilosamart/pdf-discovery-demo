begin considering, based on a wider range of indicators, whether and when an increase in 

the target might be warranted. 

Large-scale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by lowering 

long-term interest rates.  Working through the portfolio-balance channel, asset purchases 

reduce the supply of long-duration assets in the hands of the public, depressing term 

premiums and thus reducing longer-term yields.  At times, the decision to begin or extend 

an asset-purchase program may also have a signaling effect, to the extent that market 

participants see that decision as indicative of policymakers’ commitment to an 

accommodative policy stance.  However, it is important to recognize that the potential 

signaling aspect of asset purchases depends on the broader economic and policy context.  

In particular, the FOMC’s decision to modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its 

December meeting did not indicate any diminution of its commitment to maintain a 

highly accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed; rather, it reflected the 

progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market 

outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in September 2012.  

At its most recent meeting, the Committee reaffirmed and clarified its guidance on rates, 

stating that it expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well 

past the time that the unemployment threshold of 6-1/2 percent is crossed, especially if 

projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.13 

Have these unconventional tools been effective?  Skeptics have pointed out that 

the pace of recovery has been disappointingly slow, with inflation-adjusted GDP growth 

averaging only slightly higher than a 2 percent annual rate over the past few years and 

inflation below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term target.  However, as I will discuss,
