Interest rate risk management is an especially important topic in light of current market realities.  

Following its meeting earlier this week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) repeated 

its expectation that rates would remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period.  I will 

say little about the outlook for interest rates, particularly just a few days after an FOMC meeting, 

but it is obvious that as the economic recovery gains traction, it will be appropriate at some point 

for the FOMC to raise rates.  One of my messages today is that the response of interest rates 

across the maturity spectrum to an actual or expected tightening of monetary policy is always 

hard to predict, but is especially so in current circumstances.  The usual uncertainty about 

changes in policy interest rates is compounded by uncertainties related to the possible special 

effects of the historically low level of interest rates in the current recession, as well as the 

unprecedented increases in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and bank reserves as a 

result of our credit programs and large-scale asset purchases.  This run-up in Federal Reserve 

assets and bank reserves will also need to be unwound over time, with possible consequences for 

the structure of interest rates.1   

 Another message I hope to convey today is that many banks, thrifts, and credit unions 

may be exposed to an eventual increase in short-term interest rates.  As the interest rate risk 

advisory issued by each of the financial regulators earlier this month recognized, interest rate risk 

is inherent in the business of banking.  But it is especially important now for institutions to have 

in place sound practices to measure, monitor, and control this risk.  They must not become 

distracted from this critical task by their efforts to deal with credit problems, nor can they think 

that assuming greater interest rate risk is a sound strategy for compensating for the losses they
