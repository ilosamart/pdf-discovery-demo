falter, the FOMC would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus 

through conventional means.15    

These motivations notwithstanding, I continue to believe that it will be 

appropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided 

that labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress 

toward our 2 percent objective.  Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, 

steps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMCâ€™s 

goals are fully reached.  And if the headwinds that have lingered since the crisis slowly 

abate as I anticipate, this would mean that the neutral rate of interest itself will move up, 

providing further impetus to gradually increase the federal funds rate.    But I stress that 

the economic outlook, including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time, is 

uncertain, so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path.16   

This point is well illustrated by events so far this year.  For a time in January and 

early February, financial markets here and abroad became turbulent and financial 

conditions tightened, reflecting and reinforcing concerns about downside risks to the 

global economy.  In addition, data received during the winter suggested that U.S. growth 

had weakened even as progress in the labor market remained solid.  Because the 

implications of these developments for the economic outlook were unclear, the FOMC 

                                                 
15 There are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate 
demand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the FOMC, as 
appropriate.  However, so long as these tools are considered imperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate 
as an instrument of policy, the argument that the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents 
a source of asymmetric risk remains valid.  
16 Uncertainty about where the target range for the federal funds rate will be in the long run provides 
another reason why increases in policy rates cannot be on a preset path.  I view the median value of 
3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as being a reasonable guess for the longer-run normal rate.  But FOMC 
participants have lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal rate over time, and as new evidence 
comes in and we see how economic conditions evolve, further changes, in either direction, are likely.
