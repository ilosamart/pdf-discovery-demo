current context.  Common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict 

events seldom before observed in the economy.4    

Thus, my second objective today is to explain, given this uncertainty about the 

unemployment-inflation relationship, the important role that risk management plays in 

setting monetary policy.  I will explore the FOMC’s monitoring and balancing of risks as 

well as our contingency planning for cases when risk becomes reality. 

Historical Perspective on Jobs and Inflation 

Let us start with a look at the modern history of jobs and inflation in the United 

States.  Figure 1 shows headline inflation and unemployment from 1960 to today and 

extended through 2020 using the average of median projections from both FOMC 

participants and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the CBO projections.  As the 

figure makes clear, a multiyear period with unemployment below 4 percent and stable 

inflation would, if realized, be unique in modern U.S. data.5   

To understand the basis for these forecasts, it is useful to contrast two very 

different periods included in figure 1: From 1960 to 1985, and the period from 1995 to 

today.  The first period includes the Great Inflation, and the latter includes both the Great 

Moderation and the distinctly immoderate period of the Global Financial Crisis and its 

aftermath.   

Figure 2 shows unemployment and core, rather than headline, inflation in these 

two periods.  While our inflation objective concerns headline inflation, switching to core 

                                                 
4 Herb Stein (1998) made the analogous point that one should doubt the assertion that some program will 
“cause the economy to perform outside the range of its past experience” (p. 217). 
5 See note 2.  Unless otherwise noted, all statements about inflation will be four-quarter percent changes in 
quarterly average data, and all statements about unemployment will be about the quarterly average 
unemployment rate.
