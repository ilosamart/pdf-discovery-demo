The U.S. Monetary Policy Forum has become an important venue for promoting 

an exchange of views among policymakers, academics, and financial market participants.  

I’m pleased to participate in this panel on lessons learned about unconventional monetary 

policy.  In my remarks today, I’ll highlight the role of central bank communications in 

bolstering the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy.1  It is not my intention to 

provide new information about the outlook for the U.S. economy or monetary policy. 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has deployed unconventional 

monetary policy tools to promote economic recovery and price stability since late 2008.  

In particular, after the intensification of the financial crisis, conventional monetary policy 

became constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.  At that point, the 

FOMC began to provide forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate, 

and the Federal Reserve also announced a program to buy agency debt and mortgage-

backed securities (MBS).  Over time, the purchase program was augmented substantially 

and was expanded to include longer-term Treasury securities.  Furthermore, on several 

occasions, the FOMC has communicated to the markets about the likely longer-term 

trajectory of its holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS.   

In the remainder of my remarks, I will present some evidence regarding the 

effectiveness of these policy tools and discuss important similarities and differences in 

the transmission mechanisms through which they influence the economy.  I will also 

present some simulations of a macroeconometric model to illustrate the importance of
