Indeed, the condition of household finances is a key factor in the sluggish pace of 

recovery that we are seeing today.  In the run-up to the financial crisis, households became 

increasingly over-leveraged, as the amount of debt from mortgages, credit cards, student loans, 

and other liabilities outpaced income.  Between 2001 and 2007, the household debt-to-income 

ratio skyrocketed, increasing by more than it had in the prior 45 years.1 And both household 

debt-to-income and household debt-to-assets ratios reached their highest points since 1950. 

Beginning in 2008, in the face of rising unemployment and falling home values, 

households reduced spending and increased saving.  Although many households have suffered 

tremendous financial hardship, in the aggregate, U.S. consumers have moved from a near-zero 

savings rate in 2005 to a savings rate that is currently running around 5 percent.  In addition, 

household debt levels have contracted notably:  Mortgage debt and consumer debt have declined 

7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, since mid-2008.  This decline partly reflects the weakness 

in the economy:  Tight underwriting standards have damped new loan originations, and a 

sizeable amount of debt has been discharged through bankruptcies or foreclosures.  But 

households also appear to have a greater aversion to debt than in the past, and a renewed interest 

in paying down debt more aggressively.  Because of smaller debt balances and lower interest 

rates, the share of aggregate household income devoted to debt payments is at its lowest level 

since 1994.  Going forward, as income and asset values recover, these improvements in the 

aggregate household position should be felt by more and more U.S. households. 

The statistics may show that the consumer sector of our economy is improving, but I 

know that financial instability remains a reality for many families and I am quite aware of the
