system could be significant, including the prospect that the CCP’s default on its obligations 

could amplify the stress on other important financial institutions.8 

 Considerable work to ensure the safety of CCPs has been done--internationally by the 

Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)9 at the Bank for International 

Settlements and by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and 

domestically by the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal 

Reserve.  The 2012 CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) 

updated and strengthened regulatory standards for, among other financial market utilities, 

significant CCPs.  These principles, once fully implemented by all relevant U.S. agencies, will 

provide a strong and consistent basis for heightened oversight of the CCPs designated as 

systemically important by the FSOC.  These heightened standards must continue to be supported 

by robust supervisory efforts that should continue to evolve as supervisors gain experience 

assessing firms against new regulations and consider new and changing risks faced by CCPs.  

Notwithstanding the advances in CCP regulation, questions have been raised in 

international fora, in discussions among domestic financial and regulatory officials, and by some 

market participants over whether more needs to be done.  To me, at least, some of the most 

important questions implicate macroprudential concerns.  One discrete example is the possibility 

that CCP margining practices may have a significantly procyclical character that could be 

problematic in deteriorating financial conditions.   

More fundamentally, systemically important CCPs are now generally required to have 

funds sufficient to cover defaults by their two largest members (“cover 2”).  Perhaps this is the
