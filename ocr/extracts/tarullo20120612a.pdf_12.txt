foregoing discussion of implicit support for various shadow banking instruments helps identify 

areas where misunderstanding and mispricing of risk are more likely, with the result that 

destabilizing runs are a real possibility.   

Let me then suggest three more-or-less immediate steps that regulators here and abroad 

should take, as well as a medium-term reform undertaking. 

First, we should create greater transparency with respect to the various transactions and 

markets that comprise the shadow banking system.  For example, large segments of the repo 

market remain opaque today.  In fact, at present there is no way that regulators or market 

participants can precisely determine even the overall volume of bilateral repo transactions—that 

is, transactions not settled using the triparty mechanism.  It is encouraging that the Treasury 

Department’s new Office of Financial Research is working to improve information about this 

market, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering approaches to enhanced 

transparency in the closely related securities lending market.   

 Second, the risk of runs on money market mutual funds should be further reduced 

through additional measures to address the structural vulnerabilities that have persisted even after 

the measures taken by the SEC in 2010 to improve the resilience of those funds.  The SEC is 

currently considering several possible reforms, including a floating net asset value, capital 

requirements, and restrictions on redemption.  Clearly, as suggested by Chairman Schapiro, 

action by the SEC to address the vulnerabilities that were so evident in 2008, while also 

preserving the economic role of money market funds, is the preferable route.  But in the absence 

of such action, there are several second-best alternatives, including the recent suggestion by 

Deputy Governor Tucker of the Bank of England that supervisors consider setting new limits on 

banks’ reliance on funding provided by money market funds.
