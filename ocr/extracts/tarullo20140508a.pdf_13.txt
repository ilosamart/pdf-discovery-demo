holding over $10 billion in assets, other than the LISCC banking organizations.  While it is 

reasonable to adopt a macroprudential aim for all firms in this category, few of these banks have 

the kind of systemic footprint that would warrant extensive special regulation for financial 

stability purposes.  In establishing requirements for firm (though not supervisory) stress testing 

and risk-management committees for all bank holding companies in this group, but mandating 

that only bank holding companies of $50 billion or more be subject to enhanced prudential 

standards, Congress has reflected a similar judgment.  The key question is whether $50 billion is 

the right line to have drawn.   

 Experience to date suggests to me, at least, that the line might better be drawn at a higher 

asset levelâ€”$100 billion, perhaps.   Requirements such as resolution planning and the quite 

elaborate requirements of our supervisory stress testing process do not seem to me to be 

necessary for banks between $50 billion and $100 billion in assets.  If the line were redrawn at a 

higher figure, we might explore simpler methods for promoting macroprudential aims with 

respect to banks above $10 billion in assets but below the new threshold. 

 Were such a change to be adopted, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in 

assets would not be subject to any of the enhanced prudential requirements of section 165 of 

Dodd-Frank; bank holding companies with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would 

be subject to supervisory stress testing and a basic set of the section 165 requirements; and 

holding companies with $250 billion or more in assets would be subject to the supplementary 

leverage ratio, the full LCR, and the countercyclical capital buffer provision.  Of course, this is 

not the only way to draw the lines, and there could be reasons for applying additional 

requirements to specific banks, even if they fall below the presumptive asset threshold.  But I use
