These trends in participation have been more pronounced in the United States 

than in other advanced economies.  In 1990, the United States had relatively high 

participation rates for prime-age women relative to other countries and was in the 

midrange of advanced economies for prime-age men.  However, we now stand at the low 

end of participation for both men and women in this age group--just above Italy, but well 

below Germany, France, and Spain (figure 14). 

There is no consensus about the reasons for the long-term decline in prime-age 

participation rates, and a variety of factors could have played a role. 11  For example, 

while automation and globalization have contributed positively to overall domestic 

production and growth, adjustment to these developments has resulted in dislocations of 

many workers without college degrees and those employed in manufacturing.  In 

addition, factors such as the increase in disability rolls in recent decades and the opioid 

crisis may have reduced the supply of prime-age workers.  Given that the declines have 

been larger here than in other countries, it seems likely that factors specific to the United 

States have played an important role.  As I noted earlier, the strong economy may 

continue to pull some prime-age individuals back into the labor force and encourage 

others not to drop out.  Research suggests that structurally-oriented measures--for 

example, improving education or fighting the opioid crisis--also will help raise labor 

force participation in this age group.12
