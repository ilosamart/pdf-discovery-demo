is largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over 

the past year.  In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted 

portion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now 

estimated to be relatively modest.31  Finally, a similarly small portion of the current 

shortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors (which include changes 

in food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors are transitory and often 

switch sign from year to year. 

Although an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend 

on the specific model that is used, I think its basic message--that the current near-zero 

rate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for 

energy and non-energy imports--is quite plausible.  If so, the 12-month change in total 

PCE prices is likely to rebound to 1-1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further 

substantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate 

noticeably further.   

To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few 

years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid 

economic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation 

expectations remaining near their pre-recession level.  Fortunately, prospects for the U.S. 

economy generally appear solid.  Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000 

since the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster 

                                                 
31 As discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer-run level 
likely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market.  If so, the estimates reported 
in figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent 
and, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors.  For example, if the standard 
unemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the 
contribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate 
reported in figure 8.
