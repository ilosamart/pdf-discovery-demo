potentially higher-priced loans may increase.  In 2006--admittedly, not one of the best 

years for prudent mortgage underwriting in this country--about 25 percent of 

conventional purchase mortgage originations were considered higher priced.12   

Lenders who prefer to price for risk through points and fees rather than increases 

in rates also face constraints in originating QMs.  Points and fees on a QM loan may not 

exceed 3 percent of the loan amount, with higher caps available for loans smaller than 

$100,000.  The “points and fees” definition has been expanded from its original 

definition in the Truth in Lending Act and now includes, for example, compensation paid 

to the loan originator in the form of a higher interest rate on the loan.  Unfortunately, data 

on points and fees are limited, so it is difficult to determine how many potential 

borrowers might be affected by this requirement. 

To be clear, many borrowers were overcharged or defrauded by lenders in the past 

decade, and these abuses were concentrated among the more vulnerable parts of the 

population.  It is a positive development if new regulations make such abuses more 

difficult.  Still, the costs associated with mortgage lending, especially to borrowers more 

likely to default, have increased, and if lenders cannot charge enough to recoup these 

costs, they may not be willing to make the loans at all.  As a result, the QM-related 

incentives against charging higher interest rates, points, or fees will likely affect more 

loans than in the past and may, in turn, have a greater effect on credit availability for 

higher-risk borrowers. 

To bring this discussion back to the effect on the housing market, I think the 

ability of newly formed households, which are more likely to have lower incomes or 

weaker credit scores, to access the mortgage market will make a big difference in the
