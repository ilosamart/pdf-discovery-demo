reaching for yield in this manner suggests that the same pressure to boost income could 

be affecting behavior in other, less readily observable parts of their businesses. 

The final stop on the tour is something called collateral transformation.  This 

activity has been around in some form for quite a while and does not currently appear to 

be of a scale that would raise serious concerns--though the available data on it are 

sketchy at this point.  Nevertheless, it deserves to be highlighted because it is exactly the 

kind of activity where new regulation could create the potential for rapid growth and 

where we therefore need to be especially watchful. 

Collateral transformation is best explained with an example.  Imagine an 

insurance company that wants to engage in a derivatives transaction.  To do so, it is 

required to post collateral with a clearinghouse, and, because the clearinghouse has high 

standards, the collateral must be “pristine”--that is, it has to be in the form of Treasury 

securities.  However, the insurance company doesn’t have any unencumbered Treasury 

securities available--all it has in unencumbered form are some junk bonds.  Here is where 

the collateral swap comes in.  The insurance company might approach a broker-dealer 

and engage in what is effectively a two-way repo transaction, whereby it gives the dealer 

its junk bonds as collateral, borrows the Treasury securities, and agrees to unwind the 

transaction at some point in the future.  Now the insurance company can go ahead and 

pledge the borrowed Treasury securities as collateral for its derivatives trade.   

Of course, the dealer may not have the spare Treasury securities on hand, and so, 

to obtain them, it may have to engage in the mirror-image transaction with a third party 

that does--say, a pension fund.  Thus, the dealer would, in a second leg, use the junk
