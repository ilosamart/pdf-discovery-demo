As a result, some banks may reach further out on the risk spectrum to relieve earnings 

pressures.  We have seen these actions in the past, for example, when banks have engaged in ill-

conceived investment securities leveraging programs or entered the subprime credit card market 

to expand their income.  Others may be tempted to cut back on critical risk-management 

infrastructure, such as loan review, to pare expenses and enhance returns.  Some may also simply 

pull back from market pricing if they think it is too thin and accept a lower return. 

Regardless of the course of action you pursue, you will confront risk and reward trade-

offs that will fundamentally affect the financial condition and performance, and ultimately safety 

and soundness, of your banks.  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of being 

attentive to the implications of changes in your business activities for your risk levels.  Far more 

often than you might expect, we encounter banks that have not adequately thought through the 

potential risks of a new business line or lending product and that later suffer adverse financial 

consequences. 

Conclusion 

In closing, let me say how encouraged I am that, despite your struggles in the current 

economic environment, most community banks remain sound and profitable.  In a sense, the 

lessons from the financial crisis are paradoxical.  On the one hand, the crisis has underscored the 

importance of a strong community banking system to the health of local economies around the 

country, particularly in keeping credit flowing to small businesses.  On the other hand, the crisis 

and its aftermath will work changes, some painful, in all parts of our financial system, including 

those involving community banks.  My concluding thought is that it is not too soon to begin 

considering your strategy in light of these changes.
