called Taylor principle, which states that, other things being equal, a central bank should 

respond to a persistent increase in inflation by raising nominal short-term interest rates by 

more than the increase in inflation so that the real rate of interest rises, thereby helping to 

bring inflation back down.  Moreover, I think it is essential that policy rules incorporate a 

sufficiently strong response to resource slack, typically either the output gap or the 

unemployment gap, to help bring the economy back toward full employment 

expeditiously.      

John Taylor has proposed two simple and well-known policy rules along these 

lines.  The rule that Taylor proposed in 1993 incorporates a fairly modest response to 

economic slack.  Later, in a 1999 study, he considered a variant of that rule that was 

twice as responsive to slack.

  Taylor himself continues to prefer his original rule, which 

I will refer to as the Taylor (1993) rule.  In my view, however, the later variant--which I 

will refer to as the Taylor (1999) rule--is more consistent with following a balanced 

approach to promoting our dual mandate.  Importantly, because of the stabilizing effects 

of the Taylor principle, both the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules imply that 

inflation returns over time to the longer-run goal of 2 percent.

 The intercept term in each rule reflects the assumption of a constant value of 2 percent for the 

equilibrium real federal funds rate.  Thus, if the economy’s true equilibrium real funds rate deviated 

systematically from that value, the intercept term would need to be adjusted to ensure that the inflation rate 

converged over time to its longer-run goal.
