Hobson’s choice of disorderly failure endangering the entire financial system or some form of 

solvency bailout?  While they are strong relative to their peers in other major economies and 

have held up well during the few bouts of moderate financial stress we have experienced over the 

last several years, these firms have not yet faced a major financial challenge.  Second, should we 

adjust statutory or regulatory provisions that are not needed for, or are less efficient means for 

achieving, financial stability?  Let me offer some perspective on answering both questions, along 

with a handful of specific proposals.  

With respect to the first question, there is certainly room for discussion over the most 

suitable minimum capital standards for the most systemically important financial firms.  As I 

noted when we were deciding on the expected impact approach as the best available method for 

calibrating capital surcharges, there is no magic to that method.14  Indeed, even within that 

approach, we should be open to research that suggests new or improved ways to determine the 

relative systemic importance of firms.  However, I think it is important to have a methodology 

that is clearly explained and is based on the research that has been done.  Let me note in passing 

two points that can be drawn from that research.  First, there is work subsequent to the 

formulation of the Basel III capital standards suggesting that the costs of higher capital 

requirements may be somewhat lower, and the benefits broader, than previously thought.  

Second, however, the reduction in the probability of a financial crisis associated with increasing 

capital levels will begin to level off at some point, thereby creating diminishing benefits for 

tighter capital standards.15
