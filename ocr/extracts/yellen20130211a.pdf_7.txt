sales and prices plunged and mortgage credit was sharply curtailed.  Tight mortgage 

credit conditions are continuing to make it difficult for many families to buy homes, 

despite record-low mortgage interest rates that have helped make housing very 

affordable.  I’m encouraged by recent improvement in the residential sector, but the 

contribution of housing investment to overall economic activity remains considerably 

below the average seen in past recoveries, as exhibit 4 shows.   

Beyond the direct effects on residential investment, the extraordinary collapse in 

house prices resulted in a huge loss of household wealth--at last count, net home equity is 

still down 40 percent, or about $5 trillion, from 2005.7  This loss of wealth has weighed 

on the finances and spending of many homeowners.  Households are less able to tap their 

home equity to deal with economic shocks, fund their children’s education, or start new 

businesses.  For some households, the collapse in house prices has left them underwater 

on their mortgages, and thus less able to refinance or sell their homes.  

Another important tailwind in most economic recoveries is one that tends to be 

taken for granted--the faith most of us have, based on history and personal experience, 

that recessions are temporary and that the economy will soon get back to normal.  Even 

during recessions, households’ expectations for income growth tend to be reasonably 

stable, which provides support for overall spending.  In the most recent recession, 

however, surveys suggest that consumers sharply revised down their prospects for future 

income growth and have only partially adjusted up their expectations since then 

(exhibit 5).
