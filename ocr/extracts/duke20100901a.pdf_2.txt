Good morning.  I want to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board for this two-day 

summit to examine the problems associated with vacant and abandoned property and to explore 

innovative approaches to neighborhood stabilization. 

We are certain to have an informative and thoughtful discussion of these issues as our 

agenda is full of experts, including Shaun Donovan, Secretary for the Department of Housing 

and Urban Development, who will deliver a keynote address.   

Like you, I am anxious to get started.  But before I begin, I would like to recognize and 

thank the speakers and panelists we will hear from during the conference.  I would also like to 

acknowledge those who contributed to the new volume of papers the Federal Reserve published 

in conjunction with this event.  Many of our panelists contributed to the volume; their articles 

give us a look at the issue from every angle, provide great insight, and offer promising solutions.  

And I would note that a number of participants and contributors are current or former members 

of the Federal Reserve Consumer Advisory Council (CAC).  The CAC has been instrumental in 

furthering our understanding of emerging consumer and community issues, including the topic 

that brings us together today.   Finally, I would like to thank the Federal Reserve staff that 

worked tirelessly on this project. 

When it became apparent in 2007 that foreclosures were reaching epidemic levels in 

cities nationwide, the first priority of many community organizations and their public and private 

partners was to identify ways to mitigate the impact of foreclosure on individual homeowners 

and their families.  To assist in these efforts, the Federal Reserve deployed a number of 

resources:   

â€¢ We developed tools for community organizations to use in identifying areas with 

high default rates so that they could target their counseling resources effectively.
