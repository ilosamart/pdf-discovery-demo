stressed conditions, the credibility of the promise came into question, the susceptibility to runs 

increased dramatically.   

In some cases, there were explicit contractual provisions for liquidity support or credit 

enhancements, such as were provided to ABCP vehicles by their sponsoring banks.  In other 

cases, the support was more implicit, and was conveyed in the marketing of the assets or through 

an historical pattern of providing support.  Forms of implicit credit support were present in a 

variety of important funding channels and, to a considerable degree, persist today.  Three 

examples are money market funds, the triparty repo market, and securities lending.  

Money market funds aim to maintain a stable net asset value of one dollar per share and 

to meet redemption requests upon demand.  As such they are the very model of a nonbank 

―deposit‖ or cash equivalent.

  Unlike other mutual funds, money market funds are allowed to 

round their net asset values to one dollar per share so long as the underlying value of each share 

remains within one-half cent of a dollar.  But a drop in the unrounded net asset value of more 

than one-half of one percent causes a money fund to ―break the buck,‖ a scenario in which 

losses, at least in theory, would be passed along to the fund’s investors.   

However, fund sponsors historically have absorbed losses whenever necessary to prevent 

funds from breaking the buck, with only two exceptions.  Even though they had no legal 

obligation to do so, sponsors voluntarily supported their funds more than 100 times between 

1989 and 2003, presumably because allowing a fund to break the buck would have damaged the 

sponsor’s reputation and franchise.  This tendency was well understood by investors.  Indeed, a 

standard reference book on money markets states that a ―money fund run by an entity with deep
