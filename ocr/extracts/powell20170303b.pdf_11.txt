Fourth, governance and risk management will be critical.  For individual 

firms or clearing houses that adopt DLT as an internal technology upgrade, the 

governance and risk-management processes are likely to be internalized within 

existing organizations and be akin to other technology upgrades.   However, if new 

networks of bilateral payment, clearing, and settlement are established, the new 

technology may involve tightly coupled protocols and operations.  The safety of 

the overall design will depend on a highly interdependent framework.  If 

automated risk management, smart contracts, and similar tools are deployed across 

a network, cascades of rapid and hard-to-control obligations and liquidity flows 

could propagate across a network and the financial system in response to events.  

This interdependence will likely call for creative organizational thinking to address 

the need for governance and strong risk management.     

 Finally, the legal foundations supporting DLT will need 

attention.  Deployments of DLT will involve firms, perhaps in different 

jurisdictions, with systems that record and transfer information and assets under 

existing legal frameworks.  Which bodies of law apply to the particular firms, 

assets, and activities will determine the associated rights and responsibilities when 

transfers are made, cleared, and settled.  For example, whether and how banking, 

payments, securities, or commodities laws apply in a given context are likely to be 

important in designing systems and services and understanding their
