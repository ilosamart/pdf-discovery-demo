discussion thought that the Phillips curve remained a useful basis for understanding 

inflation.  They also acknowledged, however, that the link between labor market 

tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, 

reflecting in part the extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and 

in other advanced economies.  Participants also noted that other factors, including 

inflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect 

inflation. 

 My view is that the data continue to show a relationship between the overall state 

of the labor market and the change in inflation over time.  That connection has weakened 

over the past couple of decades, but it still persists, and I believe it continues to be 

meaningful for monetary policy.  Much of the shortfall in inflation in recent years is well 

explained by high unemployment during the early years of the recovery and by falling 

energy prices and the rise in the dollar in 2015 and 2016.  But the decline in inflation last 

year, as labor market conditions improved significantly, was a bit of a surprise.  The 2017 

shortfall from our 2 percent goal appears to reflect, at least partly, some unusual price 

declines, such as for mobile phone plans, that occurred nearly a year ago.  In fact, 

monthly inflation readings have been firmer over the past several months, and the 12-

month change should move up notably this spring as last spring’s soft readings drop out 

of the 12-month calculation.  Consistent with this view, the median of FOMC 

participants’ projections in our March survey shows inflation moving up to 1.9 percent 

this year and to 2 percent in 2019.
