obligations that clearinghouses, clearing members, and settlement banks must assume and

financial shocks, both in the United States and abroad.  Although the events of 2008 were

contributed to the resilience of clearing arrangements in the securities and derivatives 

markets.  The official sector’s support arrangements for financial firms and markets, 

including the Federal Reserve’s discount window lending and special liquidity programs, 

also indirectly eased liquidity pressures on the clearinghouses.  In the global foreign 

exchange market, CLS Bank International, a system that began operating in 2002 with 

the purpose of addressing settlement risk, is widely credited with maintaining confidence 

for continued interbank trading and settlement of foreign exchange. 

 Overall, the historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have
