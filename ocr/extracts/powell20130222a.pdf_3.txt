challenges for monetary policymakers.  

I believe all of these statements to be true.  They are also widely, if not 

universally, accepted.  However, based on these points and, importantly, on their 

empirical findings, the authors set out to show that fiscal difficulties present a near-term 

threat to the conduct of monetary policy.  The paper argues that rising fiscal pressures, 

exacerbated by Federal Reserve losses on asset sales and low remittances to the Treasury, 

could lead the Federal Reserve to delay balance sheet normalization and to fail to remove 

monetary accommodation as needed to keep inflation expectations stable and inflation in 

check.  In that case, the market could perceive the onset of fiscal dominance, thus setting 

off a vicious cycle of rising inflation expectations, increasing interest rates, and ever 

greater fiscal unsustainability.  

In my view, this proposition seems highly unlikely.  At a minimum, it is 

premature.

history.  On two prior occasions, federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product
