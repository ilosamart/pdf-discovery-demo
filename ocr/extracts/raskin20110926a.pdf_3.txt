wealth, mortgage foreclosures, family strains, health problems, and so on. 

Officially, the recovery from the recession began in the third quarter of 2009, but 

the pace of recovery has been modest.  We have learned from recent comprehensive 

revisions of government economic data that the recession was deeper and the recovery
