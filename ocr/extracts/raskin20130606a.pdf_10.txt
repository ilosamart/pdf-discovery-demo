lending decisions are driven solely, or even primarily, by regulatory capital requirements.  Bank 

lending is influenced by a variety of factors--capital requirements are just one.  But at the 

margin, we shouldn’t be surprised to see banks in aggregate making lending and investment 

decisions that have favorable risk-based capital treatment or that generate higher returns on a 

given amount of regulatory capital.  So, for example, in Europe a number of banks had 

significant sovereign holdings going into the financial crisis, not only because capital 

requirements were so low, but also because high credit spreads made these particularly attractive 

investments.  Likewise, here in the United States, banks piled into mortgage lending in the early- 

to mid-2000s not only because it offered generous returns, but also because regulatory capital 

requirements did not adequately capture the risks in this lending, particularly for subprime 

exposures.   

Leverage Ratio 

One of the ways that supervisors, particularly here in the United States, have addressed 

shortcomings in the risk-based capital regime has been to also impose a simple capital-to-assets 

requirement, or leverage ratio, to supplement the risk-based measures.  A leverage ratio has a 

number of things that make it intuitively appealing, if it can be set correctly.  First and foremost, 

it has the virtue of simplicity.  Not only is it easy to calculate and easy for market participants 

and the public to understand, it also provides a single benchmark by which to easily compare and 

calibrate institutions’ capital positions.  In addition, a leverage ratio provides a relatively 

straightforward gauge of how close an institution is to insolvency.  In simple terms--and I should 

caution that reality is seldom this simple--if an institution has a leverage ratio of 3 percent, a 

decline in value of assets on the balance sheet of greater than 3 percent is likely to render the 

institution insolvent.
