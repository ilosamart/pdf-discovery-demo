secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and 

international trade, as well as measurement issues.16  If so, productivity growth could 

continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its 

potential. 

A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility 

that, because of the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price 

pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached, 

although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum 

employment.17  The argument is that workers who have suffered long-term 

unemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but 

would return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to 

reemployment.  In this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail 

stronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained.18

Sahin (2013), “The Decline of the U.S. Labor Share,” Working Paper Series 2013-27 (San Francisco:  

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, September), www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2013-

27.pdf.  The notion that the labor share of income is a good measure of slack was prominent in the 

empirical literature on the New-Keynesian Phillips Curve (for example, see Jordi Galí and Mark Gertler 

(1999), “Inflation Dynamics:  A Structural Econometric Analysis,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 

44 (October), pp. 195-222), and the connections (or lack thereof) between the labor share and traditional 

measures of slack (in the statistical sense) were highlighted in, among others, Michael T. Kiley (2007), “A 

Quantitative Comparison of Sticky-Price and Sticky-Information Models of Price Setting,” Journal of 

Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 39 (February), pp. 101-25; and Michael T. Kiley (2013), “Output Gaps,” 

Journal of Macroeconomics, vol. 37 (September), pp. 1-18.  Moreover, recent research has highlighted the 

challenges that swings in the labor share have presented for the interpretation of inflation developments (for 

example, Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2014), “Inflation in the Great 

Recession and New Keynesian Models,” NBER Working Paper Series 20055 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National 

Bureau of Economic Research, April)).
