The topic of this conference--the formulation and conduct of monetary policy in a 

low-inflation environment--is timely indeed.  From the late 1960s until a decade or so 

ago, bringing inflation under control was viewed as the greatest challenge facing central 

banks around the world.  Through the application of improved policy frameworks, 

involving both greater transparency and increased independence from short-term political 

influences, as well as through continued focus and persistence, central banks have largely 

achieved that goal.  In turn, the progress against inflation increased the stability and 

predictability of the economic environment and thus contributed significantly to 

improvements in economic performance, not least in many emerging market nations that 

in previous eras had suffered bouts of very high inflation.  Moreover, success greatly 

enhanced the credibility of central banks’ commitment to price stability, and that 

credibility further supported stability and confidence.  Retaining that credibility is of 

utmost importance.  

Although the attainment of price stability after a period of higher inflation was a 

landmark achievement, monetary policymaking in an era of low inflation has not proved 

to be entirely straightforward.  In the 1980s and 1990s, few ever questioned the desired 

direction for inflation; lower was always better.  During those years, the key questions 

related to tactics:  How quickly should inflation be reduced?  Should the central bank be 

proactive or “opportunistic” in reducing inflation?  As average inflation levels declined, 

however, the issues became more complex.  The statement of the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) following its May 2003 meeting was something of a watershed, in 

that it noted that, in the Committee’s view, further disinflation would be “unwelcome.”  

In other words, the risks to price stability had become two-sided:  With inflation close to
