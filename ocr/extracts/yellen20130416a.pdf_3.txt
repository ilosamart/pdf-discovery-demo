and employment from estimates of its maximum sustainable level.  I see this language as 

entirely consistent with modern descriptions of flexible inflation targeting.   

For the past four years, a major challenge for the Federal Reserve and many other 

central banks has been how to address persistently high unemployment when the policy 

rate is at or near the effective lower bound.  This troubling situation has naturally and 

appropriately given rise to extensive discussion about alternative policy frameworks.  I

inflation-targeting framework:  clear communication about goals and how central banks 

intend to achieve them.
