better outcomes, both in research and in policy.  Studies suggest that increased diversity 

alters group dynamics and decisionmaking in positive ways.   

As Amanda Bayer and Cecilia Rouse have noted, microeconomic experiments 

and other research have confirmed these ideas.  One experiment found that greater racial 

diversity helped groups of business students outperform other students in solving 

problems.  And another found similar benefits from gender diversity.  A study of 2.5 

million research papers across the sciences found that those written by ethnically diverse 

research teams received more citations and had a greater impact than papers by authors 

with the same ethnicity.2   

Diversity in the economics profession will bring important insights into the 

analysis of our economy and financial system and help policymakers make better 

decisions in promoting a healthier economy.  So given that diversity in the economics 

profession is an important goal, how have we been doing?  Unfortunately, by any 

measure, we are still falling short.  Between 1995 and 2014, the share of women 

obtaining a doctorate in economics held roughly steady in the neighborhood of 30 

percent.  Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning doctorates, the 

representation of those identifying as black, Hispanic, or Native American among the 

pool of doctorate recipients improved from 6 percent in 1995 to 11 percent in 2007.  But 

the improvement has since unwound and the underrepresented minority share stood at 

about 7 percent in 2014.   

I respectfully defer to others who have more closely studied the mix of possible 

reasons for why progress has not been greater, but I will defer to no one in expressing my
