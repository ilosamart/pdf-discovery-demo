millennium.  It stood at 56 percent at the end of 2013, the lowest level since the BLS 

began collecting data on the measure in 1948.   

To be sure, various conceptual and measurement challenges make it difficult to 

compute labor’s share of income with any degree of precision.  However, taken at face 

value, these data have significant implications for the distribution of income in our 

society, given how skewed the holdings of capital are.  Economists have focused less 

attention on the factors underlying the apparent decline in labor’s share of income than 

they have on the rise in income inequality in general, but among the candidates are 

technological change, which has allowed for the substitution of capital for labor in the 

handling of routine tasks, an increase in firm bargaining power, and perhaps a decline in 

competition in product markets.  

The increase in inequality 

Of the trends I have identified, the one that has received the largest amount of 

press attention recently is the rise in income inequality.  While income inequality has 

been increasing since the 1970s, over the past two decades the process has been 

characterized by what some have called polarization, with those at the top of the 

distribution accumulating a significantly larger share of income, those at the bottom of 

the distribution experiencing modest relative gains, and those in the middle of the income 

distribution falling further behind in relative terms.   

Gauging by one fairly comprehensive measure of income used by the 

Congressional Budget Office, the share of income garnered by those in the top 1 percent 

of the distribution more than doubled between 1979 and 2007 to about 17 percent, while
