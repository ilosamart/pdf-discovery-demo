rates and raising equity prices and home prices, effects that have supported household

In March 2013, the Committee began noting in its postmeeting statement that it 

would consider “the extent of progress toward its economic objectives” in judging “the 

size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases.”2  In late May, the Chairman stated, in 

response to a question during a congressional hearing, that the Committee might begin to 

reduce the pace of asset purchases “over the next few meetings.”3  A few weeks later, at 

his press conference after the June 2013 FOMC meeting, the Chairman noted that the 

substantial improvement test might well be met over the coming year, and he therefore 

set forth a framework designed to clarify the path of purchases.4   

Under the most recent articulation of that framework, in considering when to 

reduce purchases, the Committee will “assess whether incoming information continues to 

support [its] expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and 

inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.”5  The path of purchases is 

entirely data dependent, as numerous FOMC participants have emphasized in public 

remarks. 

The market reaction to the Chairman’s May testimony and the June FOMC press 

conference was significant, particularly given the modest character of the news:  that the 

Committee might bring purchases to a gradual halt over the course of a full year, but only
