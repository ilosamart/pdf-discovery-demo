However, we do not have extensive experience with an economy at very low 

unemployment rates and cannot be sure how it might evolve.  In particular, we will want to 

remain attentive to the risk of financial imbalances.  While asset valuations appear to be 

elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household 

borrowing is moderate, risks associated with liquidity and maturity transformation have 

declined, and, importantly, the banking system appears to be well capitalized.12  History 

suggests, however, that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards, 

and the attendant excessive borrowing can complicate the task of monetary policy.  We will 

need to be vigilant. 

Conclusion 

What do these considerations imply for the path of monetary policy?  Continued 

gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to remain appropriate to ensure 

inflation rises sustainably to our target and to sustain full employment, keeping in mind that 

interest rate normalization is well under way and balance sheet runoff is set to reach its 

steady-state pace later this year.13  Of course, we should be ready to adjust the path of 

policy in either direction if developments turn out differently than expected.   

In many respects, the macro environment today is the mirror image of the 

environment we confronted a couple of years ago.  In the earlier period, strong headwinds 

sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy.  Today, with 

headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.

13 As laid out in Board of Governors (2017), the caps determining the degree of reinvestment of maturing 
securities in the System Open Market Account are increasing gradually.  The caps on the monthly runoff in 
the portfolio are expected to reach their maximum levels of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $20 billion 
for agency debt and mortgage-backed securities later this year.  The actual pace of runoff will vary, however, 
depending on the volume of securities maturing in any given month.
