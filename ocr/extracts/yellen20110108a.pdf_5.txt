Projections (SEP) four times a year in conjunction with the FOMC minutes.  As shown in 

the November SEP, most Committee participants anticipated that the economy would 

recover only gradually and projected that the unemployment rate would still be at around 

8 percent at the end of 2012--an outlook that is shared by most outside forecasters.  

Similarly, Committee participants generally expected inflation to rise very gradually 

toward levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate.  Moreover, continuing 

downside risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation strengthened the case 

for providing additional monetary policy accommodation, thereby reducing the risk of 

another downturn in economic activity or a further decline in inflation.   

The Design of the Asset Purchase Program  

In weighing its policy options last autumn, the Committee gave careful 

consideration to the question of whether further purchases of longer-term Treasury 

securities were likely to be effective in fostering economic recovery and bringing 

inflation back up to levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate.3  In my 

judgment, both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence suggested that such purchases 

could provide effective stimulus by keeping longer-term interest rates lower than they 

would otherwise be.  

The underlying theory, in which asset prices are directly linked to the outstanding 

quantity of assets, dates back to the early 1950s.4  For example, in preferred-habitat 

models, short- and long-term assets are imperfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios, and 

                                                 
3 As indicated in the minutes of the November FOMC meeting, the Committee has also considered the 
potential costs and benefits of setting a peg for a term interest rate.  While targeting the yield on a term 
security could be an effective way to reduce longer-term interest rates, such an approach might require the 
Federal Reserve to make an open-ended commitment to purchasing longer-term securities.
