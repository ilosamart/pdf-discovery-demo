Because of their professional backgrounds in community banking and bank supervision, I 

asked Governors Elizabeth Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on this subcommittee.  

Its primary role is to improve our understanding of community and regional banking 

conditions and to review policy proposals for their potential effect on the safety and 

soundness of, and the regulatory costs imposed on, community and regional institutions.

Governors Duke and Raskin are also keenly interested in how our policies could affect 

the availability of credit to sound borrowers, and their unique experiences and 

perspectives have contributed to the Board’s understanding of the issues that community 

bankers care most about. 

We have other contacts with community banks that have proved valuable.  For 

quite a few years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach 

programs for banks.  More recently, several of these programs have been expanded 

nationally.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis organizes national “Ask 

the Fed” calls to provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve staff 

discuss recent policy initiatives and issues that examiners are encountering in the field.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts consumer compliance 

webinars, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes a quarterly overview 

of consumer compliance issues that allows Federal Reserve staff to address questions 

from banks.

  We are exploring options for building on these initiatives.

 For the purposes of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs, regional banking organizations generally 

are considered to be those banks and bank holding companies (including savings and loan holding 

companies) with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.
