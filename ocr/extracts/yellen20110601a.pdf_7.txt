example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 

provides information about changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses 

and households.4  As shown in figure 4, recent surveys indicate that banks have reversed only a 

portion of the substantial tightening in credit standards and terms put in place after the crisis.  

Dealer-Intermediated Leverage 

In the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its efforts to monitor 

leverage, particularly outside of the traditional banking system.  Information on the use of 

leverage is incomplete at best, and in our attempts to better measure leverage, we must grapple 

with several complexities.  For instance, in recent years a significant volume of credit 

intermediation has migrated outside the traditional banking system, where it is not only 

unprotected by a formal government backstop but also difficult to capture by traditional 

accounting measures.  A further complication stems from the fact that dealers in securities and 

OTC derivatives--the key providers of leverage outside of the traditional banking system--can 

facilitate a particular economic exposure using a variety of transactional structures including, for 

example, combinations of securities financing, OTC derivatives, and prime brokerage activities. 

To obtain information on the usage and pricing of such leverage, the Federal Reserve 

relies on a number of different indicators, including supervisory and market surveillance data, as 

well as ongoing dialog with a range of market participants to construct a composite picture of the 

extent to which leverage is being deployed, on what terms, and the channels through which 

leverage is being facilitated by dealers.  These indicators include results from the Senior Credit 

Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), which was launched by the
