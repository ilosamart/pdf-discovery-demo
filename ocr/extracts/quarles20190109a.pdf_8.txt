Board’s bank capital rules to qualify as capital for an insurance holding company--and technical 

adjustments.   

Aggregation requires a further step after adjustments are applied to each building block, a 

step that is frequently termed “scaling.”  Two building blocks under two different capital regimes 

cannot simply be added together if, as is frequently the case, each regime has a different scale for 

its ratios and thresholds.  The BBA proposes to scale and equate capital positions in different 

regimes through analyzing historical defaults under those regimes.   

Once the insurance holding company’s aggregate capital position is calculated, the BBA 

would impose a minimum requirement that is calibrated to be consistent with the Board’s role to 

ensure that the risks of the enterprise do not present undue risk to the safety and soundness of the 

depository institution.  Our goal with the BBA is to capture all material risk of each supervised 

organization, leverage existing legal-entity standards, and minimize burden.   

In developing the BBA, we have been mindful of the role that the insurance industry 

plays through its buy-and-hold, long-term approach to investments.  A capital standard can have 

incentive effects, sometimes substantial.  A capital standard that uses market-based valuation can 

introduce volatility and procyclicality, and one that is excessively volatile or procyclical can 

influence a firm to veer away from a long-term perspective and concentrate instead on the short 

term.  This can have undesirable consequences, including diminishing product availability.   

In contrast, a capital standard that is stable in its valuation, conservative in its design, and 

appropriately reflective of financial soundness can influence firms to plan for the long term, 

consistent with the nature of life insurance and retirement products, and similarly invest for the 

long term through assets like government and municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and 

infrastructure.  Moreover, a capital standard like the BBA that largely builds on state-based
