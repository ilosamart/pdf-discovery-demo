Commercial Real Estate Lending 

 For community banks, it was CRE lending--in particular, lending for construction and 

land development--that caused the most problems during the crisis.  As you may know, in 2006 

the federal banking agencies issued supervisory guidance that set forth screening criteria based 

on certain types of CRE concentrations and rapid growth of CRE portfolios.

  These guidelines 

contained specific numerical thresholds for the ratios of construction and total CRE lending to an 

institution’s total capital, as well as for identifying rapid growth of such lending.
15

  These criteria 

were never intended to result in hard caps, but were instead meant to trigger conversations 

between a bank and its supervisors about the bank’s ability to manage the risks arising from 

these concentrations. 

 After our experience in the financial crisis, especially considering the severe problems in 

commercial real estate markets, we were interested in understanding how community banks were 

affected by the guidance and whether the screening criteria set forth in the guidance were 

effective indicators of risk.  In that regard, Federal Reserve staff has worked with our 

counterparts at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to analyze how banks’ holdings of 

CRE loans have evolved since the guidance was issued.

 Specifically, the guidance indicated that examiners would give heightened supervisory scrutiny to banks where 

(1) total construction and land development loans represented 100 percent or more of the institution’s total capital, 

or (2) total CRE loans represented 300 percent or more of the institution’s total capital and the institution’s CRE 

loan portfolio had increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months.  This second criteria is calculated 

excluding holdings of owner-occupied CRE loans.
