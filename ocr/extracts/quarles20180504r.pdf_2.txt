Thank you very much to the Hoover Institution for hosting this important 

conference and to John Taylor and John Cochrane for inviting me to participate.1  In my 

capacity as both the Vice Chairman for Supervision at the Board of Governors and a 

member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), part of my job is to consider 

the intersection of financial regulatory and monetary policy issues, the subject of my 

discussion today.  This topic is both complex and dynamic, especially as both regulation 

and the implementation of monetary policy continue to evolve.   

One important issue for us at the Fed, and the one that I will spend some time 

reflecting on today, is how post-crisis financial regulation, through its incentives for bank 

behavior, may influence the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 

in the long run.  Obviously, the whole excessively kaleidoscopic body of financial 

regulation is admittedly difficult to address in the time we have today, so I will focus on a 

particular component -- the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR--and its link to banks’ 

demand for U.S. central bank reserve balances.  Besides illuminating this particular issue, 

I hope my discussion will help illustrate the complexities associated with the 

interconnection of regulatory and monetary policy issues in general.  Also, let me 

emphasize at the outset that I will be touching on some issues that the Board and the 

FOMC are in the process of observing and evaluating and, in some cases, on which we 

may be far from reaching any final decisions.  As such, my thoughts on these issues are 

my own and are likely to evolve, benefiting from further discussion and our continued 

monitoring of bank behavior and financial markets over time.       

                                                 
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the 
Federal Open Market Committee.
