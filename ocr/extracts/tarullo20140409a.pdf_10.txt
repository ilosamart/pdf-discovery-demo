lower ends of the earnings distribution.  There have been healthy gains in employment in 

highly paid occupations, such as computer and information systems managers, and a rise 

in low-paid jobs, such as home health-care workers, but growth has been much slower in 

occupations with earnings in the middle of the distribution, such as machinists.  This 

trend accelerated during the Great Recession and the ensuing recovery.  For example, 

food services, retail, and employment services, all low-wage industries, accounted for 

nearly 45 percent of net employment growth from the start of the recovery through early 

2012, while employment in a number of industries that offer good jobs for mid-wage 

workers--including construction, manufacturing, and finance, insurance, and real estate--

did not grow in those years or grew too slowly to make up for their job losses during the 

recession.11   

There is no single explanation for the rise in inequality and the decline in the 

share of jobs that provide a middle-class standard of living.  Economists generally agree 

that technological change and globalization have played a role.12  Both of these forces 

have reduced the demand for workers whose jobs had involved routine work that can 

easily be mechanized or offshored while, at the same time, increasing the productivity of 

higher-skilled workers.  However, it is less clear whether technology and globalization 

are sufficient explanations for the increased share of income going to those at the very 

top of the income distribution.  It may be that by increasing the effective size of the 

markets for their skills, technological change and globalization can also explain some of

12 The literature on the reasons for the rise in inequality is extensive, but one recent work that tries to 
address the issue is David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson (2013), “Untangling Trade and 
Technology:  Evidence from Local Labor Markets,” NBER Working Paper Series 18938 (Cambridge, 
Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, April).
