integrity.  This problem is not just Wall Street’s concern; every household with a LIBOR-

linked mortgage and every corporation with a LIBOR-linked loan has an interest in more 

robust U.S. dollar reference rates. 

The Basics 

I will take a few moments to explain the basic mechanics of LIBOR for those who 

have not spent time on an interest rate swap desk.  For almost three decades, LIBOR was 

run by the British Bankers’ Association.  Just a few months ago, a private corporation 

called ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) took over the daily production and 

administration of the rate subject to the regulation and supervision of the FCA.  Today, 

18 banks participate in the panel that contributes to the production of U.S. dollar LIBOR.  

Each morning at 11 a.m. London time, those banks estimate the rate at which they could 

borrow at several different maturities ranging from overnight up to a year, and they send 

those estimates to IBA.  It is often the case that banks have recent transactions at some 

but not all of these maturities.  Where there are no transactions, they submit estimates of 

their borrowing costs based on their judgment.  In addition to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the rate 

is produced in four other currencies--the euro, the yen, the British pound, and the Swiss 

franc--although not all banks contribute rates in all currencies.  The administrator 

provides specific instructions to the panel banks regarding their submissions; currently, 

these instructions direct banks to reflect the perceived rate at which they could borrow 

from another bank.7  The administrator collects these submissions and, after dropping the 

highest and lowest quartiles at each maturity, publishes an average of the remaining 

submissions as the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate for that day. 

                                                 
7 The actual question asks banks only about transactions of “reasonable market size.”  This size is not 

defined and is left to banks’ judgment.
