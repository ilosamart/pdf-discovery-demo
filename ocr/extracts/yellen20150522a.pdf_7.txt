of 2008 and 2009 supported economic output, but the effects of that stimulus faded; by 

2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery

mostly behind us.  

A third headwind has been the restraining influences on the United States from 

the global economy.  I wonâ€™t say as much about this factor today, but I will make just a 

few observations.  Initially the euro-area crisis was the biggest headwind coming from 

the rest of the world.  Supported by monetary stimulus, reduced fiscal drag, and 

significant institutional reforms, the recovery in the euro area now appears to be on a 

firmer footing.  However, growth in many other parts of the global economy, including 

China and some other emerging market economies, has slowed.  Weak growth abroad, 

together with its accompanying implications for exchange rates, has dented U.S. exports 

and weighed on our economy.  This headwind too should abate as growth in the global 

economy firms, supported by monetary policies that generally remain highly 

accommodative.     

Factors Affecting the Outlook  

With the waning of the headwinds that I have discussed, the U.S. economy seems 

well positioned for continued growth.  Households are seeing the benefits of the
