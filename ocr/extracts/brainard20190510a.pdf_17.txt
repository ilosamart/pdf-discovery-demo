Starting a business is a classic pathway to securing a foothold in the middle class.  This

Aspiring small business owners with student loans may lack the financial ability 

to invest in starting a business while staying current on payments.  One study found that 

individuals with student loan debt are less likely to start a business, and those who do are 

more likely to fall behind on their loan payments.38  Another study found that growth in 

student loan debt resulted in a 14 percent reduction in small business formation in 

counties over a 10-year period.39
