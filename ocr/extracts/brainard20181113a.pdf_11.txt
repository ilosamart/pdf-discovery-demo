burdened by material errors on their credit reports, lack sufficient credit reporting information 

necessary for a score, or have credit reports that are unscorable.21  As noted earlier, banks and 

other financial service providers are using AI to develop credit-scoring models that take into 

account factors beyond the usual metrics.  There is substantial interest in the potential for those 

new models to allow more consumers on the margins of the current credit system to improve 

their credit standing, at potentially lower cost.  As noted earlier, AI also has the potential to allow 

creditors to more accurately model and price risk, and to bring greater speed to decisions.   

AI may offer new consumer benefits, but it is not immune from fair lending and other 

consumer protection risks, and compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws 

is important.22  Of course, it should not be assumed that AI approaches are free of bias simply 

because they are automated and rely less on direct human intervention.  Algorithms and models 

reflect the goals and perspectives of those who develop them as well as the data that trains them 

and, as a result, AI tools can reflect or “learn” the biases of the society in which they were 

created.  A 2016 Treasury Department report noted that while “data-driven algorithms may 

expedite credit assessments and reduce costs, they also carry the risk of disparate impact in credit 

outcomes and the potential for fair lending violations.”23
