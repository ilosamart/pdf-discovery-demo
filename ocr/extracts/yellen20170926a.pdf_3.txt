index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has generally run below the FOMC’s 

2 percent longer-run objective since that goal was announced in January 2012.1  Core 

inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has also fallen persistently 

short of 2 percent (the red dashed line).  Furthermore, both overall and core inflation, 

after moving up appreciably last year, have slipped again in recent months.  Sustained 

low inflation such as this is undesirable because, among other things, it generally leads to 

low settings of the federal funds rate in normal times, thereby providing less scope to 

ease monetary policy to fight recessions.  In addition, a persistent undershoot of our 

stated 2 percent goal could undermine the FOMC’s credibility, causing inflation 

expectations to drift and actual inflation and economic activity to become more volatile.   

As noted in its recent statement, the FOMC continues to anticipate that, with 

gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation will rise and stabilize at 

around 2 percent over the medium term.  This expectation is illustrated by the green stars, 

which represent the medians of the inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants 

at our meeting last week.  In part, this expectation reflects the significant improvement in 

labor market conditions over the past few years.  As shown in figure 2, the 

unemployment rate (the blue line) now stands at 4.4 percent, somewhat below the median 

of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run sustainable level (the black line).  As 

the green stars indicate, labor market conditions are expected to strengthen a bit further.  

The inflation outlook also reflects the Committee’s judgment that inflation expectations 

will remain reasonably well anchored at a level consistent with PCE price inflation of 

2 percent in the long run, and that the restraint imposed in recent years by a variety of
