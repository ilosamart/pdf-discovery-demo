instruments, including financial institutions.  Of course, the two risks may very well be 

mutually reinforcing:  Taking on duration risk is one way investors may reach for yield, 

and the losses resulting from a sharp rise in longer-term rates will be greater if investors 

have done so.

One might argue that the right response to these risks is to tighten monetary 

policy, raising long-term interest rates with the aim of forestalling any undesirable 

buildup of risk.  I hope my discussion this evening has convinced you that, at least in 

economic circumstances of the sort that prevail today, such an approach could be quite 

costly and might well be counterproductive from the standpoint of promoting financial 

stability.  Long-term interest rates in the major industrial countries are low for good 

reason:  Inflation is low and stable and, given expectations of weak growth, expected real 

short rates are low.  Premature rate increases would carry a high risk of short-circuiting 

the recovery, possibly leading--ironically enough--to an even longer period of low long-

term rates.  Only a strong economy can deliver persistently high real returns to savers and 

investors, and the economies of the major industrial countries are still in the recovery 

phase. 

So how can financial stability concerns--which the Federal Reserve takes very 

seriously--be addressed?  Our strategy, undertaken in cooperation with other regulators 

and central banks, has a number of elements.

 On the other hand, some risk-taking--such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new 

business or an existing firm expands capacity--is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery.  

Moreover, although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk-taking, in the 

present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most importantly by 

strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer-term funding, and 

by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses.
