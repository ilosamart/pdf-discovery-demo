Yet, as the Irish experience suggests, housing finance systems are vulnerable even 

if they do not rely on securitization.  Although securitization in Ireland amounted to only 

about 10 percent of outstanding mortgages in 2007, lax lending standards and light 

regulatory oversight contributed to the housing boom and bust in Ireland.15  

Macroprudential Policies  

To summarize, murky government guarantees, lax lending terms, and 

securitization were some of the key factors that made the housing crisis so severe.  Since 

then, to damp the house price-credit cycle that can lead to a housing crisis, countries 

worldwide have worked to create or expand existing macroprudential policies that would, 

in principle, limit credit growth and the rate of house price appreciation.16  

Most macroprudential policies focus on borrowers.  Loan-to-value (LTV) and 

debt-to-income (DTI) ratio limits aim to prevent borrowers from taking on excessive 

debt.  The limits can also be adjusted in response to conditions in housing markets; for 

example, the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England has the authority to 

tighten LTV or DTI limits when threats to financial stability emerge from the U.K. 

housing market.  Stricter LTV or DTI limits find some measure of success.  One study 

conducted across 119 countries from 2000 to 2013 suggests that lower LTV limits lead to 

slower credit growth.17  In addition, evidence from a range of studies suggests that 

decreases in the LTV ratio lead to a slowing of the rate of house price appreciation.18
