was a historic event--historic in the sense that its severity and economic consequences 

were enormous, but also in the sense that, as the papers at this conference document, the 

crisis seems certain to have profound and long-lasting effects on our economy, our

will be the effects of the crisis on intellectual frameworks, including the ways in which 

economists analyze macroeconomic and financial phenomena.

central banking and no doubt will continue to do so.  Although it is too early to know the 

full implications of recent events for central bank doctrine and operations, I thought it

as the continuities, that are already evident.  My remarks will focus on how central banks 

responded to recent challenges related to the conduct of both monetary policy and the 

promotion of financial stability and how, as a result of that experience, the analysis and 

execution of these two key functions may change.

for monetary policy.  This consensus policy framework was characterized by a strong 

commitment to medium-term price stability and a high degree of transparency about 

central banks’ policy objectives and economic forecasts.  The adoption of this approach
