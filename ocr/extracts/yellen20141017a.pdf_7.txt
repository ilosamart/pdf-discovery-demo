lower than the average wealth of the lower half of families in 1989, adjusted for inflation.  

Average real wealth rose gradually for these families for most of those years, then 

dropped sharply after 2007.  Figure 5 shows that average wealth also grew steadily for 

the “next 45” percent of households before the crisis but didn’t fall nearly as much 

afterward.  Those next 45 households saw their wealth, measured in 2013 dollars, grow 

from an average of $323,000 in 1989 to $516,000 in 2007 and then fall to $424,000 in 

2013, a net gain of about one-third over 24 years.  Meanwhile, the average real wealth of 

families in the top 5 percent has nearly doubled, on net--from $3.6 million in 1989 to 

$6.8 million in 2013.  

Housing wealth--the net equity held by households, consisting of the value of 

their homes minus their mortgage debt--is the most important source of wealth for all but 

those at the very top.11  It accounted for three-fifths of wealth in 2013 for the lower half 

of families and two-fifths of wealth for the next 45.  But housing wealth was only one-

fifth of total wealth for the top 5 percent of families.  The share of housing in total net 

worth for all three groups has not changed much since 1989.  

Since housing accounts for a larger share of wealth for those in the bottom half of 

the wealth distribution, their overall wealth is affected more by changes in home prices.  

Furthermore, homeowners in the bottom half have been more highly leveraged on their 

homes, amplifying this difference.  As a result, while the SCF shows that all three groups 

saw proportionally similar increases and subsequent declines in home prices from 1989 to 

2013, the effects on net worth were greater for those in the bottom half of households by 

wealth.  Foreclosures and the dramatic fall in house prices affected many of these
