Fiscal Policy 

Turning now to fiscal policy, since the onset of the recent recession and financial 

crisis, the federal budget deficit has widened significantly.  As a result, federal debt held 

by the public has increased relative to our national income to a level not seen in the past 

half-century.  These budget developments have reflected both the weak economy, which 

has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was 

implemented to help ease the recession and support the recovery.  So long as the 

economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow over the next several years as a 

growing economy boosts revenues and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in 

place to provide economic stimulus continue to wind down.  Even so, the federal budget 

is on an unsustainable path over the longer run, in large part because of the aging of the 

U.S. population and fast-rising health-care costs.  If current policy settings are 

maintained, the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income would continue 

to rise in coming decades.  

It is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and 

we should not postpone charting that course.  A failure to put in place a credible plan to 

address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious 

economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner.  Timely enactment of a 

plan to eliminate future unsustainable budget gaps will make it easier for individuals and 

businesses to prepare for and adjust to the changes.  In addition, the sooner our longer-
