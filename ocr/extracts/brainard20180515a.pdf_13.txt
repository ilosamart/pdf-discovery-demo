to overcome some of the particular vulnerabilities that cryptocurrencies face, they too have 

significant challenges related to cybersecurity, money laundering, and the retail financial system.  

Even so, digital tokens for wholesale payments and some aspects of distributed ledger 

technology--the key technologies underlying cryptocurrencies--may hold promise for 

strengthening traditional financial instruments and markets.  I have highlighted a few key areas 

where the technology is advancing to deal with some important policy, business, and operational 

challenges.  The Federal Reserve is dedicated to continuing to monitor industry developments 

and conduct research in these vital areas.  I remain optimistic that the financial sector will find 

valuable ways to employ distributed ledger technology in the area of payments, clearing, and 

settlement in coming years.
