seemed consistent with the view that inflation had been held down by both the sizable fall 

in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar starting around mid-2014, and that these 

influences have diminished significantly by this year.  Accordingly, inflation seemed well 

on its way to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis.   

Inflation readings over the past several months have been surprisingly soft, 

however, and the 12-month change in core PCE prices has fallen to 1.3 percent.  The 

recent softness seems to have been exaggerated by what look like one-off reductions in 

some categories of prices, especially a large decline in quality-adjusted prices for 

wireless telephone services.  More generally, it is common to see movements in inflation 

of a few tenths of a percentage point that are hard to explain, and such “surprises” should 

not really be surprising.  My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and 

with the ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next 

year.  Most of my colleagues on the FOMC agree.  In the latest Summary of Economic 

Projections, my colleagues and I project inflation to move higher next year and to reach 2 

percent by 2019.   

To be sure, our understanding of the forces that drive inflation is imperfect, and 

we recognize that this year’s low inflation could reflect something more persistent than is 

reflected in our baseline projections.  The fact that a number of other advanced 

economies are also experiencing persistently low inflation understandably adds to the 

sense among many analysts that something more structural may be going on.  Let me 

mention a few possibilities of more fundamental influences.1
