The Interaction of the Committee and the Market 

Going further, it is important to note that this evolution of the reaction function 

does not happen in a vacuum, where the Committee deliberates in a cloistered fashion 

and then simply reports its decisions to the market.  All along, the market is making 

conjectures about how we will behave, and these conjectures in turn can have a powerful 

influence on the debate itself.  This feedback effect has been especially relevant in the 

case of QE3, because the policy has relied significantly on a signaling channel for some 

of its effectiveness.  That is, QE3 has, in my view, mattered not just because of the direct 

downward pressure on longer-term interest rates associated with removing a given 

quantity of duration from the private market, but also because it has buttressed our 

forward guidance by serving as a credible signal of the Committee’s intentions with 

respect to the future path of the federal funds rate.   

Of course, if the Committee is using asset purchases to signal its policy intentions, 

then the information content of purchase decisions depends importantly on what the 

public expects it to do.  For example, if it is early 2013 and the market has somehow 

arrived at the belief that the Committee will continue buying assets at an $85 billion per 

month clip so long as monthly payroll growth does not exceed 200,000 jobs per month 

for three months in a row, then even a small cut down to $80 billion per month is likely to 

elicit a powerful market reaction--not because the $5 billion cut is consequential in and of 

itself, but because of the message it sends about the Committee’s policy leanings more 

generally.  But then you can see the feedback loop that arises:  The more strongly the 

market becomes attached to this belief--even if it was initially somewhat arbitrary--the 

more wary the Committee must be of making an unexpected change, and this wariness
