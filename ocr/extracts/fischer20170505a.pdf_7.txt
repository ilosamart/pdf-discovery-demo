what rules would likely have performed well in the face of that change.  For this reason, 

policymakers might change their judgment about what monetary policy rules constitute 

reasonable benchmarks, or, over time, they might develop a procedure for revising the 

monetary rule.  But a frequently revised rule does not really qualify as a rule in the sense 

that we currently use the term.     

Consequently, when considering the relationship between monetary policy 

decisions and monetary policy rules, we can expect two regularities to hold.  First, actual 

monetary policy will sometimes appropriately depart from the prescriptions of 

benchmark rules even when those benchmarks describe past decisions well.  Second, in 

their use of rules, policymakers will from time to time change their assessment of what 

rule they regard as the appropriate benchmark.  Both regularities have been amply 

observed in recent years, but they were also present 20 years ago, as reflected in Kohn’s 

remark that policymakers “do not see their past actions as a very firm guide to current or 

future policy.”  Or, as a teacher of mine at the London School of Economics, Richard 

Sayers, put it much earlier, “There is no code of eternal rules. . . .  We have central banks 

for the very reason that there are no such rules.”15 

As I will now elaborate, I believe the fact that monetary policy is made by 

committees in most economies is important in understanding both of these regularities. 

                                                 
rule is simple far from guarantees that the rule will generate satisfactory economic outcomes in the face of 
uncertainty and economic change.  For example, Friedman’s rule would likely perform poorly in an 
environment in which the trend rate of growth of monetary velocity underwent a major shift, while the 
Taylor rule could perform unsatisfactorily if the assumption about potential-output behavior embedded in 
the rule proved to be badly mistaken.  The latter possibility was stressed in Orphanides (2003).
