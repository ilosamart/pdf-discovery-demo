 I want to begin by thanking the Board of Trustees of the University of South 

Carolina, President Pastides, and this year’s graduates for the great honor of addressing 

this commencement ceremony.  Although I was born just across the border in Augusta,

United States, the Declaration of Independence:  The inalienable rights of Americans are 

“Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”  If Thomas Jefferson thought it was
