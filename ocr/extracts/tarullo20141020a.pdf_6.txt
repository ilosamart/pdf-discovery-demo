communications. 

Needless to say, nothing here is meant to suggest that a focus on compliance is 

problematic.  On the contrary, particularly as applied to areas like antitrust, securities laws, and 

consumer protection, well-crafted compliance programs are essential.  But what we want to see 

is good compliance, not mere compliance.  As in financial risk management, the perceived 

importance of what appear to be similar compliance efforts can vary greatly across firms.  Are 

compliance programs put in place by risk managers or general counsels understood as a kind of 

background noise that should not drown out the voices urging employees to “make their 

numbers,” or are they seen as reflecting the views and priorities of senior management? 

A related question is whether compliance with applicable law or regulations is 

understood to be just that, and that alone.  Do employees understand their job to be maximizing 

revenues in any way possible so long as they do not do anything illegal, or do they understand 

their job to be maximizing revenues in a manner consistent with a broader set of considerations?  

In the former case, the message is that the law is a constraint to be observed, but that the 

purposes or values that underlie it have no additional importance for determining corporate 

activity.  It may not be too great a leap from this attitude to a conscious weighing of the 

profitability of a particular practice that violates laws or regulations against the penalty that 

would be assessed for the violation, discounted by the probability of enforcement.   

In the latter case, the message to employees is that constraints on practices or products 

may be self-imposed as well as external.  The potential sources of such internal constraints are 

manifold.  For example, there might be a fear that always running close to the line will inevitably 

result in swerving over it at some point.  Or management may worry that reputational harm will
