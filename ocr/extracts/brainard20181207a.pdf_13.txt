adjusted over time.  In recent years, the scenarios have been designed to explore severe 

dislocations in corporate credit markets as a salient risk.   

Nonetheless, the stress tests have limitations as a countercyclical tool during 

buoyant periods.  For instance, while the severity of the stresses can be varied from year 

to year to address emerging risks to some degree, it is difficult to introduce entirely new 

scenarios each year to target specific sectoral risks without introducing excessive 

complexity.10  And while the stress tests and proposed stress capital buffer are designed 

to calibrate capital buffers for the riskiness of an institution’s particular assets and 

exposures, the capital buffer does not vary systematically to counter the cyclicality that 

arises through elevated asset valuations and other channels.11  The limited ability of the 

stress tests to increase loss-absorbing capacity during buoyant economic times is 

illustrated in the results from recent years, where scenarios have involved increasingly 

severe recessions and strains in corporate debt markets but generally lower declines in 

capital ratios.  More broadly, capital ratios at the largest banks have been flat and, more 

recently, modestly lower. 

In contrast, the first goal of the CCyB is to directly build resilience at large bank 

holding companies when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often 

follow periods of credit growth or rapid asset price appreciation.  The second goal of the 

CCyB is to promote a more sustainable supply of credit over the economic cycle.  The 

CCyB is expected to be reduced as credit growth slows in order to support credit supply 

at times when it might otherwise contract.  As a rough rule of thumb, the criteria for
