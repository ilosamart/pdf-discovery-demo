prices began to rise.15  This is a normal part of the textbook adjustment mechanism and is

The banks are the largest financial institutions in Israel and dominate housing 

finance.  The supervisor of banks reports to the governor of the central bank.  Starting in 

2010, the supervisor began to implement a series of measures to reduce the supply of 

housing finance by the banks.  Among the measures used were increasing capital 

requirements and provisioning against mortgages; limiting the share of any housing 

financing package indexed to the short-term (central bank) interest rate to one-third of the 

total loan, with the remainder of the package having to be linked to either the five-year 

real or five-year nominal interest rate; and, on different occasions, limiting the loan-to-

value (LTV) and payment-to-income (PTI) ratios.17  Additional precautionary measures 

were implemented in the supervision of banks.18   

The most successful of these measures was the limit of one-third imposed in May 

2011 on the share of any housing loan indexed in effect to the Bank of Israel interest rate.  

Competition among the banks had driven the spread on floating rate mortgages indexed 

to the Bank of Israel rate down to 60 basis points, which meant that mortgage financing

more than 90 percent of the land.

other assets of the borrower in addition to the house itself.
