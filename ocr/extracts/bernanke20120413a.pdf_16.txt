acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase was facilitated by a Federal Reserve loan 

against a designated set of assets, and the provision of liquidity to AIG was collateralized 

by the assets of the largest insurance company in the United States.  In both cases the 

Federal Reserve determined that the loans were adequately secured, and in both cases the 

Federal Reserve has either been repaid with interest or holds assets whose assessed 

values comfortably cover remaining loans.

institutions and markets.  Central banks collaborated closely throughout the crisis; in 

particular, the Federal Reserve undertook swap agreements with 14 other central banks to
