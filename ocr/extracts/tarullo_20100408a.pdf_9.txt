such detailed information can our senior supervisory officials at the Federal Reserve Board 

determine if our implementation is in fact promoting the policies set forth in last fall’s guidance. 

As if the core CRE problems were not enough, community banks face other short-term 

challenges.  While liquidity strains have eased following temporary increases in deposit 

insurance and the gradual stabilization of market conditions, banks will also have to bolster 

liquidity contingency funding planning.  Some banks that relied to a significant degree on so-

called noncore funding sources to grow rapidly in the run-up to the crisis may have to rework 

their business plans to secure more stable funding sources.  Additionally, capital planning will 

need to be strengthened across all institutions as companies adjust to the change in market 

conditions and investor expectations for higher capital cushions.   

Although these immediate financial challenges will, I am afraid, overwhelm quite a 

number of community banks this year, the vast majority will survive the present downturn.  

These survivors, however, will face a substantially different operating environment than they 

saw earlier this decade, and will need to adjust their operations to prosper over the long term.   

The financial crisis was ignited far from the operations of community banks.  However, 

we must overhaul our regulatory regime, so as better to contain systemic risk and the threats 

posed to the financial system by institutions perceived as too big to fail.  Still, as the CRE 

situation graphically demonstrates, too many community banks have proven unable to manage 

their high concentrations of exposures.  As a result, we expect bankers in the coming years to try 

to escape, and then avoid, high loan concentrations, regardless of loan type. 

Important as this goal is, it will not be easy to achieve for many banks.  For example, one 

means to this end would be to operate a bank with much higher capital ratios and thereby lower 

concentrations.  This strategy, however, would lower a bank’s returns and, while that may be
