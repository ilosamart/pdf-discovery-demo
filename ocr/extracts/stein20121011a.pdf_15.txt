environment.  First, on the cost side, I have just alluded to the idea that Treasury 

securities may provide money-like services to certain investors, such that removing them 

from the system may entail a welfare cost.  Presumably, MBS are less money-like than 

Treasury securities, so this element of cost could be reduced when buying MBS.19  

Second, if the efficacy of Treasury purchases is diminished by the fact that many 

corporate borrowers already have plentiful access to low-cost funds, it is natural to focus 

on a sector that is more sensitive to financing costs.  The housing market would seem to 

fit this bill.  To the extent that markets are segmented and MBS purchases therefore have 

a more powerful effect on primary mortgage rates than do Treasury purchases, this 

possibility may be another appeal of going the MBS route.   

Finally, let me touch on the implications of LSAPs for financial stability.  Some 

observers have argued that a long period of low rates can create incentives among market 

participants (such as banks, insurance companies, and pension funds) to reach for yield 

by taking on higher levels of risk with adverse consequences for stability.  These 

concerns should be taken very seriously, and a lot of work at the Fed is devoted to 

monitoring such risks.  A short summary would be that there is some qualitative evidence 

of reaching-for-yield behavior in certain segments of the market, but that we are not 

seeing anything quantitatively alarming at this point.  Of course, the worry is that one 

often sees only the tip of the iceberg in these kinds of situations, so one needs to be 

cautious in interpreting the data. 

Taking as a given that reaching for yield could be a problem, what are the 

implications at the margin for monetary policy, and for LSAPs in particular?  First, it is 

                                                 
19 This argument is made by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-JÃ¸rgensen (2012).  One natural reason why MBS 
may be less money-like than Treasury securities is their exposure to prepayment risk.
