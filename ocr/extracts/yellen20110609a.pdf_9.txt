 Although investing in a home has risks, it also has positive qualities.  Households 

may feel more comfortable investing in housing than in other investments because houses 

are familiar, tangible, and provide concrete ties to the community.  Regular mortgage 

payments may serve as a useful savings commitment device.  Finally, homes pay out a 

“dividend” in the form of housing services--that is, providing a place to live.  The 

housing services provided by an owner-occupied home--such as control over one’s own 

space--may be preferable to those provided by a rental. 

In making a decision about homeownership, prospective buyers need to consider 

the risks as well as the benefits--in particular, the possibility that house prices can fall and 

that such declines can have long-lasting effects on their financial well-being.  The current 

decline in national house prices and the preceding run-up were, of course, unusually large 

even by historical standards.  But even during times when house prices were rising 

nationally, prices fell steeply in certain local markets, such as Texas in the mid-1980s or 

Massachusetts in the early 1990s.  And homeowners are not alone in their difficulty in 

predicting house prices:  The record of industry analysts and economists is also mixed.  

Although many professionals understood that house values were high at the peak of the 

recent cycle--probably unsustainably so--there was no consensus about the extent or 

severity of the coming fall.11 

 In light of this experience, it makes sense to think about the development of 

wealth-building vehicles for low- and moderate-income households that have some of the
