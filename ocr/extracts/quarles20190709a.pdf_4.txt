financial system, and the risk-management capabilities of firms.  Evolutionary change 

has been a consistent principle of stress testing since the beginning, embraced by my 

predecessors at the Board of Governors and our supervisory staff and reflected in each 

cycle of tests.  Without such adjustments, regulators, banks, and the broader public 

cannot get a clear and dynamic view of the capital positions of the largest banks.   

Stress tests each year have upheld the original principle of transparency around 

the capital adequacy of our largest banks.  Stress tests results should allow investors, 

counterparties, analysts and markets to make more informed judgments about the 

condition of banks.  Along with other regulatory measures, this transparency increases 

market discipline and it subjects the Federal Reserve to greater outside scrutiny and 

analysis.  Accountability is important not only for the usual reasons that apply in a 

democracy but also, in this case, because stress tests can only be effective when the 

public has confidence in the Fed’s evaluation of the capital adequacy of banks.  In effect, 

stress tests are also a test of the Fed’s supervision of large banks.  

In these remarks, I will first sketch out how changes in regulation, risk 

management, the economy, and overall financial stability have prompted alterations to 

stress tests over the past decade.  Much of that change has enhanced transparency, which 

is a founding principle for stress tests.  I will then suggest some ways in which the 

effectiveness of stress testing can be further enhanced with greater transparency.    

Ten years ago, in May of 2009, the Fed and the Treasury Department released the 

first stress test results under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP).  At 

that moment, the U.S. economy was in free fall. The United States had lost an astonishing 

three million jobs in the previous four months.  One significant reason for these losses
