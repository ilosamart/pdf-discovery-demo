time, and there is a scarcity, or outright absence in longer tenors, of actual transactions 

that banks can use to estimate their daily submission to LIBOR or that can be used by 

others to verify those submissions.   LIBOR is huge--there are roughly $300 trillion in 

gross notional contracts that reference it--so the incentives to manipulate it still remain in 

place.  And the structural problems go much further than the incentives for manipulation.  

Markets need to be fair, effective, and also safe.  If the publication of LIBOR were to 

become untenable because the number of transactions that underlie it declined further, 

then untangling the outstanding LIBOR contracts would entail a legal mess that could 

endanger our financial stability.   

For these reasons, the Federal Reserve has convened a group of the largest global 

dealers to form the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.  We have asked them to 

work with us in promoting alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR that better reflect the 

current structure of funding markets.  As the Reviewâ€™s consultation document notes, 

issues of this kind are really global in nature; U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts are traded 

throughout the world, not simply in the United States. For this reason we are working in 

close consultation with our foreign regulatory counterparts in this endeavor.  

One of the reasons that I emphasize structural issues such as the market-maker 

model or the secular decline in unsecured interbank borrowing is that FICC markets are 

undergoing rapid changes that seem likely to have far-ranging consequences.  Issues that 

a few years ago concerned equity markets now arise in FICC markets as well.  As the 

consultation document notes, broker-dealers are curtailing some of their market-making 

activities and their appetite for providing liquidity in response to regulatory changes and 

their own assessment of the risks and returns of these activities.  At the same time, other
