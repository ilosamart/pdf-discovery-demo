inadequate sources of liquidity may then be forced into responses with systemic implications, 

such as fire sales of assets and termination of credit extensions to their own counterparties. 

The other major vulnerability revealed by the financial crisis was systemic risk that may 

be created through so-called shadow banking activities--that is, credit intermediation outside the 

prudentially regulated banking system.  Here is where the integration of traditional lending and 

capital markets is most clearly in evidence, albeit in quite different ways.  In truth, many shadow 

banking channels passed through prudentially regulated institutions, as with the notorious 

structured investment vehicles and asset-backed commercial paper conduits.  Changes in 

accounting and in bank capital and liquidity requirements have done a great deal to guard against 

a recurrence of such patterns in the future, though continued monitoring will be needed to 

prevent the development of other forms of support that elude these regulatory measures. 

Of greater interest for financial regulation going forward will be the constantly changing, 

and largely unrelated, set of intermediation activities pursued by very different types of financial 

market actors.  While the extent of shadow banking has significantly diminished since the crisis, 

there is good reason to believe that it will grow in the future.  Indeed, the very rigor of new 

regulations applicable to firms within the prudential perimeter may well incentivize more 

innovation outside that perimeter.  It will be essential to disaggregate all the activities that might 

be characterized as shadow banking in order to regulate those that pose risks to the financial 

system while not unduly burdening forms of credit extension that may more or less benignly help 

meet the savings and investment needs of households and businesses.  This task is perhaps 

summed up by the fact that activities which in one context are called “shadow banking” are in 

other contexts called “market-based financing.”
