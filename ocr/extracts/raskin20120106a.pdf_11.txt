examiners.4  In addition, we must always think about whether the allocation of 

responsibilities should be different depending on whether the supervision is of a 

community bank rather than a large bank, especially one whose failure could 

significantly disrupt the broader financial system.5  Specifically, there are key differences 

between these two sets of institutions, and these differences have implications for our 

supervisory framework.   

 The way the banking industry has evolved over at least the past decade indicates 

a trend toward greater concentration.  Ninety-nine percent of banks in the United States 

are community banks, with most of these holding less than $1 billion in total assets.  The 

remaining 1 percent of banks together hold more than 80 percent of the assets in the 

banking system, with much of this concentrated at a handful of the very largest banks.  

The four largest commercial banks, each of which has more than $1 trillion in 

consolidated assets, collectively hold just under half of all U.S. banking assets.6     

The largest commercial banks are characterized not only by their size, but also by 

their scope of operations and complexity.  Their legal and business line structures, 

balance sheets, and product offerings often are extraordinarily complex.  For example,

5 For the purposes of these remarks and for the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs, the largest banking 
organizations are generally considered to be those banks and bank holding companies with total 
consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater.  Oversight of approximately a dozen of the largest and most 
complex organizations is conducted by the Federal Reserve’s Large Institution Supervision Coordinating 
Committee; see Ben S. Bernanke (2011), “Implementing a Macroprudential Approach to Supervision and 
Regulation,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s 47th Annual Conference on Bank 
Structure and Competition, Chicago, Ill., May 5,

6 Of course, there are still banking organizations that are at neither end of the spectrum, which our 
supervisory program reflects.  Regional banking organizations, for example, which are generally 
considered to be those banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between 
$10 billion and $50 billion, share characteristics of both larger and smaller institutions, and we have a 
tailored supervisory program for those organizations.  For the purposes of today’s discussion, however, I 
would like to focus my remarks on the institutions at opposite ends of the spectrum.
