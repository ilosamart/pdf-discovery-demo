consider how to work with low-wage workers to bridge information gaps by expanding 

workers’ networks, providing legitimate information, and identifying new job 

opportunities.    

But finally, the pressure that community-based organizations exert on financial 

regulators must continue.  Access to credit is an enduring challenge, and the obstacles 

and problems--all the “broken windows” you see on the block--must be reported and 

explained.  They must be understood by the federal policymakers who are responsible for 

enforcing our country’s laws and regulations in the realm of access to credit; by the 

federal policymakers who engage in the conduct of monetary policy; and by the federal 

policymakers whose actions contribute to the shaping of the landscape for financial 

services in this country.  Your voices--whether you are reporting, documenting, 

monitoring, analyzing, proposing, or even protesting--must be heard. Your voices are 

crucial to alerting policymakers to the significant developments and emerging trends in 

the nation’s communities that must be confronted--and confronted in a swift and decisive 

way--if we are to make prosperity a national agenda that touches every American.    

Thank you.
