Since joining the Board in 2008 amid a crisis centered on mortgage lending, I 

have focused much of my attention on housing and mortgage markets, issues surrounding 

foreclosures, and neighborhood stabilization.  In March of this year, I laid out my 

thoughts on current conditions in the housing and mortgage markets in a speech to the 

Mortgage Bankers Association.

  Today I will summarize and update that information 

with a focus on mortgage credit conditions.  Before I proceed, I should note that the 

views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of 

Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. 

A sustained recovery in the housing market appears to be under way.  House 

prices, as measured by a variety of national indexes, have risen 6 to 11 percent since the 

beginning of 2012 (figure 1).

  The recovery of house prices has been broad based 

geographically, with 90 percent of local markets having experienced price gains over the 

year ending in February.  Also since the beginning of 2012, housing starts and permits 

have risen by nearly 30 percent (figure 2), while new and existing home sales have also 

seen double-digit growth rates.  Homebuilder sentiment has improved notably, and real 

estate agents report stronger traffic of people shopping for homes (figure 3).

  In national 

surveys, households report that low interest rates and house prices make it a good time to
