It is not sufficient, given current economic conditions and the significant needs of our 

neighborhoods, to do things the way we have always done them.  Homeownership, long 

promoted by federal policy and facilitated by local housing organizations, cannot and should not 

be the only alternative for REO properties.  Indeed, redevelopment strategies profiled in the 

conference publication include rental housing, lease-purchase, and even converting owners to 

renters to avoid vacancies.  Including rental options among the mix of stabilization strategies 

makes particular sense at a time of high unemployment.  Even in the best of times, 

homeownership limits mobility in the labor market.  

Today’s summit and companion publication also highlight several promising models of 

“non-redevelopment” to stabilize communities, such as simple code enforcement, land banking, 

and demolition.  The scale of the problem is such that communities must consider a variety of 

strategies to repurpose REO properties within the context of a comprehensive plan that addresses 

a variety of community needs.  Only in this way will our neighborhoods be restored to health and 

vitality. 

This brings me back to Yvonne Means and her street in Cleveland.  Her plight illustrates 

that while it is important to avoid foreclosures whenever possible, it is equally important to pay 

attention to the properties that despite everyone’s best efforts will end up in foreclosure or worse, 

will become vacant and abandoned with no one even willing to take responsibility through 

foreclosure.  We owe it to Yvonne Means and others like her to work to repair the financial and 

social damage, and restore services to the remaining homeowners in communities with high rates 

of vacancy and foreclosure.  The problems caused by foreclosure are not solved until properties 

are restored to responsible ownership and occupied by families who call them home.
