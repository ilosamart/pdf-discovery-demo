urban and rural community banks (figure 1), we see that the number of banks in both of 

these categories has been falling over time.  The rate of decline was steeper for rural 

banks than for urban banks before the financial crisis but has reversed in the post-crisis 

period.  This reversal may be due to the fact that, as we will see momentarily, urban 

community banks suffered more severe losses in the immediate post-crisis period than 

did rural community banks.  And the share of community banks that operate primarily in 

rural markets has increased slightly, from 53 percent to 54 percent. 

While there are more rural community banks than urban community banks, the 

latter consistently account for a larger volume of deposits, loans, and offices than the 

former.  This difference is due, in part, to the average size of an urban community bank, 

in terms of total assets, being about two and a half to three and a half times that of the 

average rural community bank (figure 2).  As community banks have increased in asset 

size, they have also grown their branch networks.  The average number of branches for 

an urban bank is about 1.7 to 2 times that of a rural bank (figure 3).  

Looking next at the total amount of deposits held by all urban community banks 

and all rural community banks, we can see that both have been trending upward over time 

(figure 4).  Growth in total loans outstanding was strong for both urban and rural 

community banks between 1997 and 2008 (figure 5).  Declines in lending between 2008 

and 2011 were more severe for urban community banks than rural ones.  Coming out of 

the recent recessions, rural community banks have seen quite modest loan growth since 

2011, while the pace of growth in urban community bank lending has been strong since 

2013.  This divergence in recent growth rates may be due to the fact that the recovery
