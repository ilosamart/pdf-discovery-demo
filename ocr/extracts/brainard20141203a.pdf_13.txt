those efforts are in early stages and must respect differences of mission and mandate, 

authority, and governance structures. 

As an example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has authority 

to adjust the definition of qualifying mortgages (QM), which affects mortgage credit at 

all lenders, whether inside or outside the banking regulatory perimeter.  It is worth 

noting, however, that the CFPB operates primarily under a consumer protection mandate.  

While the ultimate consequences of a mortgage credit boom have, in the past, proved 

very costly for families, the danger to consumers in the initial stages of such a boom may 

be too unclear to warrant timely action. 

Fourth pillar:  Monetary policy 

Recognition of the limits to the macroprudential framework brings us to a 

consideration of monetary policy—a powerful tool with broad reach, but also relatively 

blunt.10  Monetary policy is the only tool available to the Federal Reserve that has far-

reaching effects on private credit creation across the entire financial system and one of 

the few tools that can be changed rapidly (although its effects have famously long and 

variable lags). 

While recognizing the far-reaching effects of monetary policy on financial 

conditions, there are good reasons to view monetary policy as the second line of defense. 

It is better viewed as a complement to rather than an alternative to macroprudential tools.  

In many circumstances, standard monetary policy and financial stability considerations 

will reinforce one another.
