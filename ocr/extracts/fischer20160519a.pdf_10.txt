on the view, frequently expressed by graduate students, that the field of 

macroeconomics was based on ad hoc assumptions rather than being derived 

from first principles, as is done in value theory--that is, microeconomics.    

The first paragraph of the introduction to both editions of MIP is  

Money buys goods, and goods do not buy money. The natural 

place, then, to study the workings of monetary forces is directly 

in the market for goods.  This will be our central theme. 

2. The real balance effect.  MIP builds the integration of monetary and value 

theory around the real balance effect, often known as the Pigou effect, the 

presence of a wealth effect in aggregate demand, which produces stable price 

dynamics at the level of the aggregate economy.  The first edition was 

published in 1956 and became very well known, but was also criticized, 

particularly about the dynamics of prices in response to changes in the money 

stock.  The second edition, published in 1965, responded to this and other 

critiques, and achieved the goal set out in the book’s subtitle. 

In Note M of MIP (pp. 651-664) Patinkin reviews empirical 

investigations of the real-balance effect, noting that most of the studies are in 

effect estimates of the impact of liquid wealth holdings, rather than just real 

balances, on consumption. 

3. Reviews of the book.  In an article published in 1993 in a festschrift for 

Patinkin8, I reviewed both editions of MIP.   The book had been reviewed by
