growth has been quite weak in recent years, and empirical analysis suggests that it is has 

been holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor 

utilization in recent years.15  An analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the U.S. state 

level also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole probably reflects 

sluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states, because cross-state 

differences in wage growth are about what one would expect given cross-state differences 

in unemployment rates.16  Finally, I would note that the percentage of firms planning 

wage increases has moved back up to its pre-recession level, many firms report 

difficulties in finding qualified workers, and some have responded by expanding training 

programs and offering signing bonuses--possible harbingers of stronger wage gains 

to come.   

Overall, I view the data we have in hand as suggesting a generally healthy labor 

market, not one in which substantial slack remains or one that is overheated.  That said, 

the evidence does not allow for any definitive assessment, so policymakers must remain 

open minded on this question and its implications for reaching our inflation goal.  

Inflation Expectations 

Another source of uncertainty concerns inflation expectations.  In standard 

economic models, inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation 

because, in deciding how much to adjust wages for individual jobs and prices of goods 

                                                 
15 For example, predictions from a simple empirical model track recent movements in the employment cost 
index reasonably well, because the model estimates that the increasing upward pressure on compensation 
growth from rising labor utilization is being offset by a declining contribution from productivity growth.  
(See the appendix for further details.)  Relatedly, research also suggests that cyclical changes in the 
composition of the workforce associated with the absorption of new workers with relatively low skills and 
experience may be currently restraining growth in both aggregate wages and productivity. See Daly and 
Hobijn (2017) and Daly, Hobijn, and Pyle (2016), who also point to the retirement of baby boomers as a 
factor holding down wage growth.
