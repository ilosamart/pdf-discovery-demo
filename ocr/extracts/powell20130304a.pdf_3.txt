I hope you won’t mind if I draw today on some of my own experiences over the years 

with too big to fail, beginning with my service at the Treasury Department during the 

Administration of President George H.W. Bush.  I joined the Administration only a few years 

after the rescue of Continental Illinois, which is sometimes said to have codified the practice of 

too big to fail.   

In my years at Treasury, we faced a wave of well over 1,000 savings and loan and bank 

failures. That included the failure of the Bank of New England Corp., then the third largest bank 

failure in U.S. history.

  It happened in January 1991, at a time of great stress in the financial 

system and the broader economy, and only days after 45 depository institutions in the region had 

been closed and 300,000 deposit accounts frozen.

  My Treasury colleagues and I joined 

representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve 

Board in a conference room on a Sunday morning.  We came to understand that either the FDIC 

would protect all of the bank’s depositors, without regard to deposit insurance limits, or there 

would likely be a run on all the money center banks the next morning--the first such run since 

1933.   We chose the first option, without dissent.

In the summer of 1991, we faced the Salomon Brothers crisis.  Salomon, a global 

investment bank, was one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, and the largest 

dealer in U.S. government securities.  The firm came under severe market pressure after some of 

its traders were caught submitting phony bids in Treasury bond auctions.   As recounted in 

harrowing detail in the book “The Snowball,” Salomon came within hours of failure over a

 Ranked by total assets at the time of failure, in 1991 Bank of New England Corp. ($21.7 billion) was the largest 

U.S. bank failure following Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust ($40 billion; 1984) and First Republic 

Bank ($32.5 billion; 1988).
