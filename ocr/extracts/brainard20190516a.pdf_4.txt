mean when they say the Phillips curve is very flat:  The historical relationship between resource 

slack and price inflation appears to have broken down.4  Although wage growth has been moving 

progressively higher as labor market slack has diminished, broader price inflation has remained 

muted. 

Another important feature of today’s new normal is that the long-run neutral interest rate 

seems to be lower than it was historically.  The neutral rate of interest refers to the level of the 

federal funds rate that would maintain the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if 

no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy.  The decline in the neutral rate likely 

reflects a variety of forces globally, such as the aging of the population in many large economies, 

some slowing in the rate of productivity growth, and increases in the demand for safe assets. 

When one looks at the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), it is striking 

that over the past five years, since the SEP interest rate projections first became available, the 

median estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined 1-1/2 percentage points, from 

4-1/4 percent to 2-3/4 percent.  Going back further to the two decades before the crisis shows a 

similar decline in today’s long-run neutral rate relative to earlier Blue Chip consensus forecasts 

of the long-run federal funds rate.5 

Third, underlying trend inflation—the trend in inflation after filtering out idiosyncratic 

and transitory factors—appears to be somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s goal of 2 percent.  

This raises the risk that households and businesses could come to expect inflation to run
