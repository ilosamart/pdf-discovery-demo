I look forward to the conversations today, and I hope we’ll keep having 

them.  Treasury markets are important to all of us.  The financial market 

participants represented here have special reasons to care.  As one of the panelists 

at the conference put it, we’ve built our entire prudential regulatory framework, 

indeed our entire financial framework, around the ability to quickly and efficiently 

transform Treasury securities in to cash liquidity.  These markets need to keep 

functioning at a high level, and we all have a stake in making sure that they do.
