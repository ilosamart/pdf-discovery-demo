sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet their projected net cash outflows during a 30-

day stress period.  A new process--the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review--

sets supervisory expectations for liquidity-risk management and evaluates institutions’ 

practices against these benchmarks.  A proposal for a net stable funding ratio would 

require better liquidity management at horizons beyond that covered by the liquidity 

coverage ratio.  A proposed capital surcharge for the largest firms would discourage 

overreliance on short-term wholesale funding.  Also, the Securities and Exchange 

Commission has adopted changes in regulations that may help avoid future runs on prime 

money market mutual funds (that is, money funds that invest primarily in corporate debt 

securities).  And reforms in the triparty repo market have reduced risks associated with 

intraday exposures.   

Large, complex institutions and too big to fail 

In the aftermath of the crisis, the Congress tasked the banking regulators with 

challenging and changing the perception that any financial institution is too big to fail by 

ensuring that even very large banking organizations can be resolved without harming 

financial stability.  Steps are under way to achieve this objective.  In particular, banking 

organizations are required to prepare “living wills”--plans for their rapid and orderly 

resolution in the event of insolvency.  Regulators are considering requiring that bank 

holding companies have sufficient total loss-absorbing capacity, including long-term 

debt, to enable them to be wound down without government support.11  In addition, the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has designed a strategy that it could deploy 

11 For a discussion of total loss-absorbing capacity, see Financial Stability Board (2014), a consultative 
document on a proposal for a common international standard on total loss-absorbing capacity for global 
systemic banks.  The comment period on this FSB proposal ended in February of this year.
