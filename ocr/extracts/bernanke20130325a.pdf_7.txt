countries have pursued an export-led strategy for industrialization, they may be leery of 

expansionary policies in the advanced economies that, all else being equal, tend to cause 

the currencies of emerging market economies to appreciate, restraining their exports.  

Second, because many emerging market economies have financial sectors that are small 

or less developed by global standards but open to foreign investors, they may perceive 

themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy 

and volatile capital inflows, including those arising from low interest rates in the 

advanced economies. 

I agree these challenges are significant.  However, a few points should be made.

that trade-weighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies, with some 

exceptions, have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of 

the financial crisis in late 2008.  Moreover, even if the expansionary policies of the
