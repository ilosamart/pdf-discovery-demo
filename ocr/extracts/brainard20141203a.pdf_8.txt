Tool two:  Time-varying broad macroprudential tools 

While our efforts are far advanced in building structural resilience, progress is 

less advanced in developing time-varying tools that counter the buildup of excesses 

across the system broadly or in a particular financial sector.  These efforts are in earlier 

stages of elaboration and more of a departure from recent practice.  Here we can learn 

from financial authorities in other countries that have recent experience deploying a 

broader array of macroprudential tools. 

The classic case for time-varying broad macroprudential tools is to lean against a 

dangerous acceleration of credit growth at a time when the degree of monetary tightening 

that would be needed to slow it down would be highly inconsistent with conditions in the 

real economy.  The Basel Committee agreed on a common countercyclical capital buffer 

framework for addressing such circumstances, and the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. 

banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the Basel 3 countercyclical capital 

buffer for U.S. banking firms in 2013.  Under the rule, starting in 2016 and phasing in 

through 2019, the U.S. banking agencies could require the largest, most complex U.S. 

banking firms to hold additional capital in amounts up to 2.5 percent of their risk-

weighted assets if the agencies determine it is warranted by rising risks.  We are currently 

considering how best to implement the countercyclical capital buffer.  The existing 

research would suggest that indicators related to debt growth, leverage, and other signs of 

growing financial imbalances would provide guidance on when to implement the buffer 

and when to deactivate it.  

procyclicality to the financial system, it is not designed to explicitly offset any existing procyclical 
tendencies.  The purpose of the stress-test scenarios is to make sure that banks are properly capitalized to 
withstand severe economic and financial conditions, not to serve as an explicit countercyclical offset to the 
financial system.
