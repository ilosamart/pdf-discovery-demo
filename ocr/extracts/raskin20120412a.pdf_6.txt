apartments.  The general stagnation in housing activity during the current recovery is 

very unusual since previous recoveries typically have been accompanied by a sharp 

increase in residential construction.     

The pace of economic recovery has also been sluggish for small businesses.  

These firms continue to report weak sales, although some recent indications suggest that 

sales have finally started to improve lately.  Nevertheless, small business owners 

generally report that they remain cautious about overall economic prospects. 

The Los Angeles economy has had farther to climb than the nation as a whole in 

order to achieve a full recovery, and it also has been slow-going here.  The 

unemployment rate in the Los Angeles area has been declining, but, still at almost 12 

percent, it remains well above the national average. The housing market in Los Angeles 

has remained depressed, similar to conditions nationwide.  House prices in the Los 

Angeles area have continued to decline, and single-family construction has been flat, 

although multifamily construction has picked up.  

Nationally, some economic news has been encouraging and may be suggesting 

that the pace of the recovery is picking up.  In the past six months, the national 

unemployment rate has come down about 3/4 percentage point and employment has 

increased by about 1 million.  In Los Angeles, employment expanded by 1 percent over 

the six months ending in February (the latest available data), and the local-area 

unemployment rate also declined about 3/4 percentage point.   

However, the national economic recovery clearly has a long way to go.  The share 

of unemployed workers who have been without a job for more than six months is still 

more than 40 percent nationwide, a level well above that seen in earlier recessions.
