Of course, having a job is one thing.  Getting to it is another.  With good reason, 

transportation considerations have become more common in community development 

plans in recent years.   More communities are taking public transportation into account 

when planning residential projects.  Given the high cost of owning and operating a car, 

transportation options are a significant factor in a neighborhood’s overall affordability.  

Demographic shifts over the last decade have resulted in the suburbanization of poverty, 

and now dictate that communities work together to create transportation options, 

including buses, light rail, and even car-sharing arrangements.   

Even so, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has discovered in its work on 

car ownership for low-income workers, public transportation is not always sufficient to 

solve the transportation problems of the poor.  Some jobs, such as construction work, 

require that workers report to different locations.  Shift workers, whether security guards, 

airport baggage handlers, or hospital workers, may not have easy access to public 

transportation at night.  Supporting nonprofit organizations, such as Vehicles for Change, 

which takes donated cars and refurbishes them for sale to low-income workers for a very 

small fee, may be the most effective means for some communities to overcome the 

barriers to car ownership.5   

One of the more innovative solutions to this issue that I have seen was developed 

by an organization in Dallas that aims to move the jobs to the workers, rather than vice 

versa.  Lone Star Investment Advisors LLC is a private equity fund that invests in Texas 

companies located in, or willing to move to, low-income census tracts.  The fund's 

managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that can create jobs
