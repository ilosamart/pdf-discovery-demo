beginning of the most acute phase of the financial crisis.  The cross-border dimensions of the 

crisis itself and the global effects of the Great Recession that followed provoked a major effort   

to strengthen international cooperation in financial regulation.  While a good deal has already 

been accomplished, this evening I will suggest the next steps that would be most useful in 

advancing global financial stability.   

 Of course, the fashioning of an international agenda requires a clear understanding of the 

overall regulatory aims of participating national authorities.  Here is where international 

regulatory cooperation links to the subject of this conference--if not quite the changing politics of 

central banks, then at least their changing policy goals in the wake of the financial crisis.  Almost 

by definition, systemic crises reveal failures across the financial system, from breakdowns in risk 

management at many financial firms to serious deficiencies in government regulation of financial 

institutions and markets.  While the recent crisis was no exception, it has presented particular 

challenges to the policy foundations of central banks, especially those like the Federal Reserve 

that carry out regulatory mandates alongside their monetary policy missions.  So I begin with 

some remarks on the nature of those challenges, before turning to a discussion of how changes in 

approach should inform international cooperation in financial regulation. 

Central Banks and the Financial Crisis 

 In surveying the failings of financial authorities, both here and abroad, one can certainly 

identify some specific characteristics of pre-crisis regulation that look today to have been 

significantly misguided, rather than the advances they were formerly thought to be.  So, for 

example, regulators became prone to place too much confidence in the capacity of firms to 

measure and manage their risks.  Indeed, the decade or so prior to the crisis had seen an
