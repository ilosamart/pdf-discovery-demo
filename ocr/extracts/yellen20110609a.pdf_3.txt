In total, 2-1/2 million foreclosures were initiated in 2010, and a similar number of 

foreclosure starts are expected in 2011. 

 One factor depressing house prices is the large number of “distressed” home 

sales.  A distressed sale occurs when a borrower sells a house through a short sale or 

when a lender sells a property that it acquired through a foreclosure; these sales have 

represented about half of all home sales in recent months.  The condition of the property 

can deteriorate considerably over the course of the foreclosure proceedings, and these 

damaged properties are typically sold to the next buyer at a significant discount.  

Commonly, market values of properties and the selling price of similar homes in the 

neighborhood become depressed as a consequence.  The blight associated with these 

properties can further depress the value of nearby homes. 

 Housing market conditions are also being hurt by the large inventory of empty 

and unsold homes in the United States.  Nearly 2 million homes were estimated to be 

vacant in the first quarter of 2011.  Although this number is down some from the highs 

seen in 2008, it is about 60 percent higher than the average level over the 20 years before 

the 2008 surge.  And, with the pipeline of delinquent and foreclosed homes overflowing, 

the inventory of empty and unsold homes will likely stay elevated for some time, which 

will maintain downward pressure on house prices and damp construction of new homes. 

 Recovery in the housing market is being restrained further by tight mortgage 

credit.  According to the Federal Reserve’s April 2011 Senior Loan Officer Opinion 

Survey on Bank Lending Practices, commercial banks have begun to ease standards on 

credit card and other consumer loans, but they have not yet started to ease standards for
