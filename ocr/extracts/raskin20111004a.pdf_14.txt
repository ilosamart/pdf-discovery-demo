After the Great Depression, fully amortizing loans with maturities of 15 years or 

longer became the standard.  Federal policy appears to have been a key factor in this 

transition.  First, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation--a sort of precursor to today’s

when state law forbade it. 

The challenge for us today, as I see it, is to emulate our predecessors from the 

1930s who dealt with a comparable crisis.  We need to consider our current array of 

mortgage contracts with a dispassionate eye and open mind.  If the contracts today are not 

working--and the evidence seems clear to me that, along some dimensions, they are not--

we as lawyers should be working on ways to improve them.  Without such improvements 

you may not be serving your clients, and from the perspective of the macroeconomy, 

none of us will be contributing to a reconstruction of the legal framework in the crucial 

context of mortgage finance.  Lawyers have a singular responsibility and exceptional 

ability to help rebuild this framework, and I urge you to consider how you can contribute 

to the effort of renegotiating these relationships and how the terms of such a renegotiation 

might become memorialized in contracts.  This is a massive challenge for lawyers who
