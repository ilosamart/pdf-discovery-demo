facilities and the normalization of the terms for discount window credit were undertaken because 

the recovery in financial markets suggested that they were no longer necessary.  These changes 

were not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and they 

did not signal any change in the outlook for the economy or for monetary policy. 

As I have indicated, the second objective will likely require some innovative measures, 

insofar as, all else equal, the unusually high level of reserve balances would undercut efforts to 

raise the federal funds rate through conventional means.  As Chairman Bernanke has detailed in 

his speeches and Congressional testimony, we have a number of tools that will allow us to 

accomplish this task at the appropriate time.1  The most important instrument is likely to be 

increasing the interest rate paid to banks on the reserves they hold with the Fed.  Raising this rate 

should itself tend to raise the federal funds rate, because banks have little incentive to lend into 

the federal funds market at rates below what they can earn risk-free at the Fed.  The efficacy of 

this instrument can be increased by draining reserves through the use of a number of instruments, 

including reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), term deposits for reserve balances, and, 

if necessary, sales of assets on our balance sheet.  Thus, unlike a monetary policy action under 

more normal conditions, our eventual decision to raise interest rates will require a determination 

of the mix and sequencing of these policy tools, as well as the basic determination of when 

monetary tightening is appropriate. 

In recent months, the Federal Reserve has been evaluating the likely effects of each of 

these tools.  We have also successfully tested our capacity to carry out reverse repo transactions 

and are expanding the group of counterparties with which these transactions can be carried out. 

We have also been working on the development of a term deposit facility.  These analytic and
