In many ways, the choice of which road to take is a function of the particular business 

model that the financial institution chooses for itself.  As community bankers, you have 

embraced a business model for your banks that is based almost exclusively on pure financial 

intermediation between borrowers who want to engage in economically productive activities--

many of which are for businesses and homeowners in your communities--and depositors who 

have funds to advance for such activities.   

This high-road business model means that your financial institutions easily understand 

the impact of your actions on local homeowners, businesses, and communities.  As a state 

financial regulator, I saw the individual impact that financial institutions had on the local and 

overall economies of the state; at the Federal Reserve Board, I see the collective impact that 

these activities have on the economy as a whole.  Your institutions factor those considerations 

into their business processes, practices, and decisions, which ultimately both create and reflect 

the culture at your banks.  The high-road business model embodies a public and economic 

imperative that unifies and animates your banking cultures and decisions.  Indeed, the high-road 

business model of a bank allows you to continually challenge the model with the question:  Does 

this banking model interfere with a notion of public welfare and economic common good?  Or 

advance it? 

But there are also flawed business models that create misaligned incentives that lead to 

what I believe are low-road outcomes.  Such outcomes stem from a banking model that blithely 

ignores the core function of banks as financial intermediaries between those who have credit and 

those who need it.  The low-road banking model leads to a series of business choices emanating 

from a business plan and culture focused largely on quick profits with little consideration of 

longer-term risks and costs, not only to individual firms, but also to the financial system more
