the mid-1990s.  One reason to be concerned about the apparent decline in new business 

formation is that it may serve to depress the pace of productivity, real wage growth, and 

employment.41  Another reason is that a slowdown in business formation may threaten 

what I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity for many 

families below the very top in income and wealth.

inheritances are also common among households below the top of the wealth distribution 

and sizable enough that I believe they may well play a role in helping these families
