involve failures by many people and systems, there should not be excessive emphasis on the 

culpability of just one or two individuals.  They are opting instead for a more transparent internal 

process to dissect the failures of action, judgment, and oversight that lay behind a significant 

problem, and then act more broadly in applying disciplinary or remedial measures.  Whatever 

approach a firm takes, it is important that the consequences of violations of a firmâ€™s norms and 

expectations, much less regulations and laws, be well-specified and clearly communicated to 

employees. 

Conclusion 

In these very selective remarks on the factors that affect employee behavior, I have 

intentionally concentrated on the roles of management and regulators.  I realize, of course, that 

there are other forces at work.  There is, for example, an interesting debate among corporate law 

professors as to the merits of giving shareholders more direct influence over firm policies, in 

order to reduce agency costs within the firm.  Some fear that this would focus employees of 

financial firms even more on short-term equity market movements, with potential bad effects on 

both conventional risk management and the kinds of conduct problems noted at the outset of my 

remarks.   

Those broader concerns are relevant, to be sure, but they implicate a broader set of actors 

than the banks themselves, or even bank regulators.  My expectation is that if banks do not take 

more effective steps to control the behavior of those who work for them, there will be both 

increased pressure and propensity on the part of regulators and law enforcers to impose more 

requirements, constraints, and punishments.
