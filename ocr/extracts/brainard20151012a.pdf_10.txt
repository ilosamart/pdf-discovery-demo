Over the past year, a feedback loop has transmitted market expectations of policy

tightening that has already taken place has been comparable in its effect to the equivalent

Looking ahead, one of the biggest sources of known uncertainty to the U.S. 

outlook is whether this foreign weakness fades or intensifies.  A plausible baseline 

scenario might include a soft landing in China and growth in other emerging markets 

moving gradually back up to underlying trends.  Of course, it is possible that a recovery 

in emerging market growth occurs sooner than in the baseline, such that the U.S economy 

moves modestly more quickly toward our goals. 

However, demand in emerging markets could also fall short of such a baseline.  

China is only part-way through challenging economic adjustments and financial market 

reforms, including reform of its exchange rate regime, debt deleveraging, and rebalancing

fundamentals or its exchange rate regime would likely affect other important economies 

in the region, as well as commodity-producing economies, pushing global demand down 

further.  In turn, expectations of additional weakness in global demand could have
