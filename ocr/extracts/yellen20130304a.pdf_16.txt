from its asset holdings and, hence, for its remittances to the Treasury.  Second, some 

have raised the possibility that the Committee’s policies could have negative 

consequences for financial stability.   

With respect to the Federal Reserve’s remittances, balance sheet operations are 

intended to support economic growth and job creation in a context of price stability and 

not to maximize Federal Reserve income.  There is a possibility that the Federal 

Reserve’s earnings from its assets and the remittances of those earnings to the Treasury 

will decline later in the decade, perhaps even ceasing entirely for some period.  It is 

important to note, however, that any losses that could conceivably occur would not 

impair the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy.

  Further, even if remittances 

to the Treasury ceased for a time, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over 

the period affected by our asset purchases will be higher than the pre-crisis norms.   

 Though our expanded portfolio of longer-term securities has in recent years 

translated into substantial earnings and remittances to the Treasury, the Federal Reserve 

has, to be sure, increased its exposure to interest rate risk by lengthening the average 

maturity of its securities holdings.  As the economic recovery strengthens and monetary 

policy normalizes, the Federal Reserve’s net interest income will likely decline.  In 

particular, the Federal Reserve’s interest expenses will increase as short-term interest 

rates rise, while reserve balances initially remain sizable.  In addition, policy 

normalization may well involve significant sales of the Federal Reserve’s agency 

securities holdings, and losses could be incurred in these sales.  A recent study by the 

Board staff considered the effect of a number of scenarios on Federal Reserve income,
