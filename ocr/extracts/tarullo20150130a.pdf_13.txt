that cash equivalents are actually cash, it is equally important to realize that the demand for 

relatively safe, short-term assets will not disappear.  Indeed, there is some risk that, as regulation 

makes some forms of such assets more costly, this demand will simply turn elsewhere.  Thus the 

ultimate effectiveness of what I have termed prudential market regulation will depend on 

policymakers taking into account in their regulatory approaches the sources of, and motivation 

for, demand for short-term, liquid, and relatively safe assets beyond the debt of very 

creditworthy sovereigns. 

Central Counterparties   

My third policy objective with a macroprudential component relates to central 

counterparties (CCPs).  A key regulatory aim following the crisis, both in the United States and 

internationally, has been to encourage more derivatives and other financial transactions to be 

cleared through CCPs.  There are important financial stability benefits to be gained from the 

progress that has been made toward this aim--including multilateral netting, standardized initial 

and variation margin requirements, and greater transparency.   

However, as has been frequently observed, if the financial system is to reap these 

benefits, the central counterparties to which transactions are moving must themselves be sound 

and stable.  Extreme but plausible events, such as the failure of clearing members or a rapid 

change in the value of instruments traded by a CCP, could expose it to financial distress.  If the 

CCP has insufficient resources to deal with such stress, it may look to its clearing members to 

provide support.  But if the problems arise during a period of generalized financial stress, the 

clearing members may themselves already have been weakened or, even if they remain sound, 

the diversion of their available liquidity to the CCP may prevent customers of the clearing 

members from accessing needed funding.  If the CCP fails, the adverse effects on the financial
