Further down the credit quality ladder, there has been sizable growth in leveraged 

lending, accompanied by a notable deterioration in underwriting standards.  Net issuance 

of debt to risky borrowers, which had stopped growing in late 2016, rebounded over the 

past year.  Leveraged loans outstanding rose about 12 percent over the past 12 months 

and now stand around $1 trillion overall.4 

 While leveraged loans have traditionally had important investor protections, loan 

covenants for new leveraged loans have weakened dramatically.  Covenant-lite, or cov-

lite, transactions now represent roughly 80 percent of the entire leveraged lending 

market--up from less than 30 percent a decade ago, when they were associated primarily 

with stronger borrowers.  Deals increasingly involve features that increase opacity and 

risk, such as less subordinated debt; “EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, 

depreciation, and amortization) add backs,” which could inflate the projected capacity of 

the borrowers to repay their loans; and “incremental facilities,” which allow additional 

borrowing that is of equal seniority with the existing bank loan.5  The share of newly 

issued large loans to corporations with high leverage (debt to EBITDA ratios above 6) 

now exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 (figure 8).  Previously, 

much of this deterioration in underwriting appeared to be concentrated among nonbank 

lenders, but this year has witnessed a deterioration in underwriting at the largest banks.  

                                                 
4 Estimates vary.  The estimate of about $1 trillion in the Board’s Financial Stability Report excludes 
lending to financial companies and generally excludes loan commitments by banks.  The S&P Global 
Leveraged Loan Index is around $1.3 trillion.  The estimate of $2.2 trillion in the Bank of England’s 
Financial Stability Report is for the global market, including bank loans. 
5 An “add back” is an unusual, discretionary, or nonrecurring expense that is added back to earnings with 
the intent of normalizing EBITDA.  Examples include legal expenses, insurance costs, or owner-related 
expenses.
