Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.  Given my role at the Federal 

Reserve, I am not in a position to comment on debt management policy.1   

I would like to begin by complimenting the authors of this highly interesting 

paper for their systematic approach to thinking about a wide-ranging and difficult set 

of issues.  

After a period during which the Treasuryâ€™s debt management needs dominated 

Federal Reserve policies, the Fed began to regain its independence with the Treasury-Fed 

Accord of 1951.  Since the 1970s, there has been little or no coordination between the 

two institutions over debt management.  This paper argues that the extraordinary 

response to the global financial crisis brought about a conflict between debt management 

and monetary policy that should have been avoided through collaboration.  The paper 

proposes a regime in which the Treasury and the Fed would cooperate around debt 

management at all times and would fully collaborate in the case in which the monetary 

policy rate is pinned at the zero lower bound. 

As a policymaker, I bring a degree of skepticism to a proposal to make major 

changes to institutional arrangements that seem to me to have served the public well.  I 

will mention three areas where I have significant concerns.  First, the literature on 

financial stability and monetary policy is still in its infancy.  There is no consensus that 

monetary policy (or debt management policy) should assume the kinds of roles assigned 

by the authors.  In particular, policymakers are addressing the problem of private money 

creation through an array of regulatory initiatives.
