Longer-term patterns in the types of jobs being created have also contributed to a 

widening gap in wages and income between the richest and poorest Americans.  

Adjusting for inflation, earnings for a worker in the middle of the wage distribution have 

risen about 10 percent since 1980, while earnings for a highly paid worker at the 90th 

percentile of the wage distribution have risen more than 30 percent during the same 

period.  Earnings for workers near the low end of the distribution--those around the 10th 

percentile--have risen only about 5 percent after taking inflation into account.  Thus, as 

has been widely observed, the gains from economic growth over the past three decades 

have disproportionately accrued to the highest wage earners. 

 To some degree, growing wage inequality reflects rising returns to education.  

Since 1980, the average wage for college graduates has increased from about one and a 

half times the average wage for workers with only a high school degree to about two 

times their wage.  The good news is that this rise has encouraged more young Americans 

to enroll in college.  The fraction of 18- and 19-year-old high school graduates who are 

enrolled in college rose from around 50 percent in 1980 to nearly 70 percent today.  Even 

the good news must be qualified, however, since half this rise took place in the 1980s, 

and the pace of increase has slowed since then.  The bad news is that less-educated adults 

with significant work experience and younger, inexperienced adults who are ill prepared 

for, or unable to afford, college may be increasingly excluded from future economic 

gains.

impediments to workers changing jobs (for example, job lock related to health insurance or pensions) or 
that workers have become more risk averse.  In principle, these trends could also reflect improving 
efficiencies in the labor market, such as screening and hiring techniques that result in better matches 
between firms and workers, though this more benign explanation strikes me as less likely against the 
overall backdrop of labor markets in the past decade.
