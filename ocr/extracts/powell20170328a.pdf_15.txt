Throughout our history, Americans have questioned the structure and even, at times, the 

need for a central bank.  Current discussions of Fed reforms echo these past debates.  But 

it is important to understand that history in both advanced and emerging economies 

across the world has consistently demonstrated the need for a central bank, and both the 

existence and the structure of the Federal Reserve are products of that historical 

experience.  Our structure is fundamentally a compromise, shaped by American history 

stretching back to the first Bank of the United States and, later, by the lessons of the 

Great Depression.  It is designed to deliver the United States a vitally needed central bank 

in a country that has had a long-standing aversion to centralized power over monetary 

and financial affairs.  It preserves diverse regional voices while ensuring that policy can 

be implemented through a cooperative consensus.  The balance between national and 

regional interests is critical to the spirit of the original compromise that created the 

Federal Reserve, and to its democratic legitimacy.  The structure achieves a practical 

balance that should not be changed lightly, as it continues to serve the country well.
