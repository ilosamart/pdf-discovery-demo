match the character of the risk at the institution.  Accordingly, we should also be looking at 

additional opportunities for more tailoring for larger, non-Global Systemically Important Banks, 

or non-G-SIBs. In this regard, I support congressional efforts regarding tailoring, whether by 

raising the current $50 billion statutory threshold for application of enhanced prudential 

standards or by articulating a so-called factors-based threshold.  Irrespective of where the 

legislative efforts land, I believe we at the Federal Reserve have the responsibility to ensure that 

we do further tailoring for the institutions that remain subject to our rules to ensure that 

regulation matches the risk of the firm.  

Take for example large non-G-SIBs whose failure would not individually pose a risk to 

U.S. financial stability.  Even without financial stability implications, the distress or failure of 

these firms still could harm the U.S. economy by, for example, significantly disrupting the flow 

of credit to households and businesses.  In my view, this tranche of the U.S. banking system 

ought to be subject to regulations that are generally stricter than those that apply to small banking 

firms, but that are also meaningfully less strict than those that apply to the G-SIBs.  The Board 

has effected this sort of G-SIB versus non-G-SIB tailoring among large banks in many areas of 

the regulatory framework.  Most notably, each of the risk-based capital requirements, leverage 

requirements, stress testing requirements, and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements 

is calibrated substantially more strictly for G-SIBs than for large non-G-SIBs.  However, in some 

key regulations, there is no distinction between the requirements for large non-G-SIBs and G-

SIBs.  

Liquidity regulation, for example, does not have a G-SIB versus non-G-SIB gradation.  In 

particular, the full liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement and internal stress testing 

requirements of enhanced prudential standards apply to large, non-G-SIB banks in the same way
