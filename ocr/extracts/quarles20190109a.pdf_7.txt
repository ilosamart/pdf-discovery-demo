that block.  For instance, in a life insurance building block, subsidiaries within this block would 

be treated in the BBA the way they would be treated under life insurance capital requirements.   

In a depository institution building block, subsidiaries would be subject to bank 

regulatory capital requirements.  The financial crisis taught us that certain activities in an 

insurance enterprise--for instance, derivatives activity--could pose risks to the enterprise that 

may not always be reflected through affiliates subject to capital regimes.  To address regulatory 

gaps and arbitrage risks, like those made manifest in the financial crisis, the BBA generally 

would apply bank regulatory capital requirements to nonbank/non-insurance building blocks.   

Once the enterprise’s entities are grouped into building blocks, and capital resources and 

requirements are computed for each building block, the enterprise’s capital position is produced 

by generally adding up the capital positions of each building block. 

In order for the BBA’s aggregation to function appropriately, and to reflect the Board’s 

supervisory objectives, the BBA needs to make certain adjustments to the building blocks.  For 

instance, to compare similar activities across building blocks, the BBA would apply insurance 

capital rules consistently, without regard to permitted accounting practices granted by an 

individual state, thus uniformly applying statutory accounting principles as set forth by the 

NAIC.  Measures to avoid double-counting, including double-leverage, that could arise from 

intercompany transactions would be built into the BBA’s aggregation process.  Other areas 

where adjustments would be made include provisions to comply with the Collins Amendment of 

the Dodd-Frank Act9--for instance, allowing only instruments meeting the criteria under the 

                                                 
9 The so-called Collins Amendment (Section 171) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that the 
Board establish consolidated, minimum risk-based capital requirements that are not less than the current generally 
applicable capital requirements for insured depository institutions nor quantitatively lower than the generally 
applicable capital requirements for these institutions in effect at the time of the Dodd-Frank Act’s enactment.  
A 2014 amendment to this provision set out that, in applying these minimum capital requirements, the Board is not 
required to include a person regulated by a state insurance regulator or a regulated foreign subsidiary or affiliate of 
such person engaged in the business of insurance.
