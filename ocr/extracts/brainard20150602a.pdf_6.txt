apparent in the second half of last year reassert itself.  In assessing this possibility, it is 

important to keep in mind the international context, which I will turn to next.  

International Context 

The notable effects of recent crosscurrents from abroad should lay to rest any 

remaining lore that the United States is a closed economy.  Financial linkages between 

the United States and foreign economies are immediate and extensive.  Equity prices, 

long-term interest rates and risk spreads, and exchange rates show strong reactions to 

developments abroad, and, in recent months, foreign developments have at times been the 

dominant factor driving U.S. financial conditions.  Weak foreign aggregate demand, as 

well as accompanying accommodative monetary policies in the euro area and Japan, and 

diverging expectations have been key among the factors causing a significant 10 percent 

appreciation of the dollar since last June.  To the extent that exchange rate appreciation 

exerts a tightening force on financial conditions in the United States, it delays the return 

of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels. 

While trade is a smaller share of the U.S. economy than in many other economies, 

exchange rate changes of the magnitude seen recently can have large effects on aggregate 

demand.3  We have already seen a large negative contribution of net exports to U.S. GDP 

growth in the past two quarters.  In addition, because some models estimate that 

exchange ratesâ€™ effect on net exports can last up to three years, it is possible that the drag 

from net exports will persist for some time.  Even before the latest estimate of the first-

quarter contribution of net exports to GDP was published, many private-sector forecasters 

                                                 
3 In addition, an increase over time in import and export shares will increase the effect of exchange rate 
changes on real GDP even if the export and import elasticities have not changed.
