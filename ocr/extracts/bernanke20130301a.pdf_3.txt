even Japanese yields have shown some tendency to fluctuate along with other benchmark 

yields, and they have also declined over the period shown.   

In my comments, I will delve more deeply into the reasons why these long-term 

interest rates have fallen so low.  This examination may be useful both for understanding 

the current stance of policy and also for thinking about how rates may evolve.  In short, 

we expect that as the economy recovers, long-term rates will rise over time to more 

normal levels.  A return to more normal conditions in financial markets would, of course, 

be most welcome.  Many commentators have noted, however, that both an extended 

period of low rates and the transition back toward normal levels may pose risks to 

financial stability.  In the final portion of my remarks, I will discuss some aspects of how 

the Federal Reserve is approaching these risks. 

Why Are Long-Term Interest Rates So Low? 

So, why are long-term interest rates currently so low?  To help answer this 

question, it is useful to decompose longer-term yields into three components:  one 

reflecting expected inflation over the term of the security; another capturing the expected 

path of short-term real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates; and a residual component 

known as the term premium.  Of course, none of these three components is observed 

directly, but there are standard ways of estimating them.  Chart 2 displays one version of 

this decomposition of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield based on a term structure model 

developed by Federal Reserve staff.

  The broad features I will emphasize are similar to 

those found by other authors using a variety of methods.

 Estimates are based on the model of D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2010).  That model employs the “arbitrage-

free” term structure framework and jointly models real yields, nominal yields, and inflation as functions of 

four underlying latent factors.  Historical data on nominal yields, real yields, and inflation can be used to 

estimate these underlying factors and the relationship of real and nominal yields to the factors.  Based on
