Simplicity   

Fourth, the new system should encourage simplicity.  Credit disclosures and retail mortgage 

contracts ought to be as simple as possible.  Too often, the complexity of credit and lending 

products has served to confuse borrowers and make it more difficult to make informed decisions.  

Securitization structures will likewise need to be simpler and conform to standardized contracts.  

The trickle of new mortgage securitizations that are attracting investor interest today have 

structures that are markedly simpler and more transparent than those of the recent past. 

Properly aligned incentives   

Finally, the new system should feature clear roles and properly aligned incentives for all 

players.  In the recent turmoil, we saw examples of misaligned interests and competing 

objectives.  For instance, there is evidence that some loan officers and mortgage brokers may 

have been as concerned about whether loans were profitable to them personally as they were 

about whether the borrower could actually repay.10  Servicers, too, turned out to have interests 

that were not always aligned with investors, and different tranches of investors themselves had 

competing interests that they tried to impose onto servicers.  Certainly, greater clarity about roles 

and responsibilities, and the associated compensation of participants in the origination and 

servicing chains, will help all parties understand, and properly align, incentives.  

Conclusion 

 Having survived the financial crisis, it is now time to work together to build a consumer 

banking model for the future.  It sure would be nice if we could build it in a laboratory or test it 

in a simulation.  But we are all working in real time.  The new model will be shaped by the scars 

of the past.  Policymakers will continue to craft regulation to prevent the practices that led to
