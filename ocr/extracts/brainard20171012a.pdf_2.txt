I enjoyed Ben Bernanke’s paper titled “Monetary Policy in a New Era.” 1  He 

presents a compelling diagnosis of the issues facing policymakers and discusses a variety 

of policy options.  Bernanke proposes an approach to policy that is elegant and 

straightforward to communicate.  I will focus on those elements that I find particularly 

relevant for the challenges faced by policymakers and suggest some implications and 

complications.  My comments are not intended to address current policy.2 

The New Normal 

Policymakers in advanced economies are confronting a different constellation of 

challenges today than those that dominated the canon of U.S. monetary policymaking 

over the previous half-century, which I refer to as the “new normal.”3  A key feature of 

the new normal is that the neutral interest rate--the level of the federal funds rate that is 

consistent with the economy growing close to its potential rate, full employment, and 

stable inflation--appears to be much lower than it was in the decades prior to the crisis.  

In the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) most recent Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP), the median FOMC participant expected a longer-run real federal funds 

rate, after subtracting inflation, of 3/4 percent, down sharply from the value the first time 

the policy projection was published in the January 2012 SEP of 2-1/4 percent--and the 

average value in the decades prior to the financial crisis of 2-1/2 percent.4

4 The well-known Laubach-Williams model currently suggests an estimate of the longer-run neutral federal 
funds rate that is close to zero.  The latest estimates are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco’s website at http://www.frbsf.org/economic-
research/files/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.  Over the 1960-2007 period, the real federal 
funds rate--measured as the nominal federal funds rate less trailing four-quarter core PCE (personal 
consumption expenditures) inflation--averaged 2-1/2 percent.
