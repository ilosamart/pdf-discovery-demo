model-based and judgmental criteria.  On December 1, 2017, with overall risks assessed 

as moderate and with other measures that we routinely monitor sending a similar signal, 

the Board announced its decision to leave the CCyB at its minimum value of zero.  

Of course, our assessments of financial vulnerabilities are also an important input 

into Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations, recognizing that there is 

important interdependence between financial stability and our monetary policy objectives 

of full employment and price stability.10 The FOMC Statement on Longer-Run Goals 

and Monetary Policy Strategy notes that “the Committee’s policy decisions reflect . . . its 

assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could 

impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”11 Generally speaking, lessons from a 

broad range of countries suggest financial crises occur with substantially lower frequency 

than business cycles, and there is no settled doctrine to date on the use of the short-term 

policy rate--the key instrument of monetary policy--to lessen the probability and severity

of financial crises. While financial imbalances are an important consideration in 

monetary policymaking and the expected path of monetary policy can have important 

implications for financial vulnerabilities, both research and experience suggest there is no 

simple rule for accomplishing our dual-mandate and financial stability objectives through 

reliance on a single policy instrument.
