Faster and More Secure Retail Payment Systems  

The development of real-time retail payments has been gaining momentum 

globally.  The UK has had a system in place since 2008.  Australia is actively 

developing a new nationwide system.  The European Central Bank, the Bank of 

Japan, and several other central banks have also been acting as catalysts to promote 

real-time payments initiatives.  The broad emergence of real-time systems 

throughout the world reflects the growing demand for such systems, and the need 

for the payments system to keep up with evolving technology.2 

In the United States, our traditional bank-centric payments system, 

sometimes operating on decades-old infrastructure, has adjusted slowly to the 

evolving demands for greater speed and safety.  Innovators have built new systems 

and services that ride on top of the old rails but with mixed results, and over time, 

our system has grown more fragmented.  Our payments system is large and 

diverse, with a wide array of financial institutions, systems, and service providers; 

it will take coordinated action to make fundamental and successful nationwide 

improvements.  The Federal Reserve has often helped address problems of this 

nature by convening stakeholders in the payments system and encouraging them to 

identify key issues and to work together to make fundamental improvements.
