model, adding a requirement that banks would not restrict the supply of loans during the severely 

adverse scenario.   

To date, the model has actually operated to project an increase in the balance sheets of 

the CCAR banks during the severely adverse scenario, with varying impacts on different 

portfolios.  This assumption, and its somewhat complicated implementation, was designed to be 

fairly conservative, in a manner not dissimilar to the assumptions about capital distributions.  

Numerous banks have attempted to show why some of these portfolios or business lines would 

not be increasing under any reasonable assumptions, and thus that even macroprudential goals do 

not justify ignoring the likelihood that those portfolios would decline.  During our review of 

CCAR, some banks proposed ways to distinguish among business lines so as to relax what they 

argued to be an unrealistic assumption, even one with a macroprudential purpose.  

The complexities of trying to differentiate across idiosyncratic business lines seem to us 

considerable.  We are instead considering replacing this feature of our model with a simple 

assumption that balance sheets and risk-weighted assets remain constant over the severely 

adverse scenario horizon.  Given that some decline in demand by creditworthy borrowers for 

loans is inevitable in a serious recession, this simpler assumption would still achieve the 

macroprudential policy objective that any such decline in lending during a recession is 

attributable to the impact of the recession, rather than to capital constraints at the large banks. 

This change would also make the treatment of balance sheets and risk-weighted assets simpler 

and more transparent.  

Toward a more macroprudential stress testing regime 

 The second major objective in our stress testing review was to integrate more 

macroprudential elements into the program.  Of course, combining the GSIB surcharge with the
