unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a 21 percent 

further decline in housing prices, as well as steep falls in prices of financial assets most 

exposed to conditions in Europe.  Under this highly adverse scenario, the 19 bank holding 

companies were projected to incur aggregate losses of more than $500 billion through the 

fourth quarter of 2013.  Nevertheless, their aggregate Tier 1 common ratio was projected 

to be 6.3 percent at the end of the scenario period, and 15 of the 19 bank holding 

companies were projected to maintain capital ratios above all four of the regulatory 

minimum levels--even after taking into account their proposals for capital actions such as 

dividends, share buybacks, and share issuance in the baseline scenario. 

The banking sector overall also has substantially improved its liquidity position 

over the past few years.  Indeed, large banks in the aggregate have more than doubled 

their holdings of cash and securities since 2009.  Large banks have reduced their 

collective dependence on short-term wholesale funding, and many are flush with retail 

deposits, which tend to be a more stable funding source.  Challenges on the liquidity front 

remain, however:  Some large firms still rely heavily on wholesale short-term funding; 

and the liquidity needs of the banking system as a whole may become somewhat higher 

for a while as some of the securities issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporationâ€™s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program come due, and as the unlimited 

insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts expires at the end of the year.  

Nevertheless, over time, greater liquid asset positions and reduced dependence on 

wholesale short-term funding, together with more and better capital, will make the 

banking sector less susceptible to unexpected disruptions in short-term funding markets.
