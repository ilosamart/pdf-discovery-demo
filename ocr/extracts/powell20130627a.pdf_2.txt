the outlook for the economy and then turn to monetary policy.1  

Near-Term Outlook 

Our economy has grown at an average annual rate of only about 2 percent since 

the recovery began exactly four years ago.  That modest pace is notably weaker than the 

experience of past recoveries would have predicted, even accounting for the depth and 

duration of the Great Recession.2  Since 2009, the question has been when the recovery 

will decisively take hold and begin to deliver the higher levels of growth that are needed 

to put people back to work more quickly.        

Against that background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last 

week, and, among other tasks, each of the 19 members of the Committee submitted 

individual economic projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation for 2013 

through 2015.  These forecasts are combined into the Summary of Economic Projections 

(SEP), a high-level outline of which was released at the Chairman’s press conference last 

week.  FOMC participants generally expect an acceleration of the recovery through 2013 

and 2014 and continued strong growth in 2015.  While I make no claim to special 

forecasting skills, my individual projections are within the so-called central tendency of
