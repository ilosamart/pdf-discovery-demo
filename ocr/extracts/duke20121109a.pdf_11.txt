focus of the Community Reinvestment Act requirements to help serve the credit needs of 

local communities   

 hold the loans they originate in portfolio and retain the credit risk, rather than transfer the 

risk by selling those loans to other market participants, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, 

or others13   

The HMDA data also indicate that a larger share of the conventional loans extended by 

smaller lenders carry higher prices.14  The data do not provide much insight into why the pricing 

patterns differ across lender size groups, but it may be that the types of loans originated by 

smaller lenders tend to be nonconforming or out of the ordinary in other ways and consequently 

carry higher prices to compensate for the lower liquidity or somewhat higher credit and interest-

rate risk.   

Although the HMDA data provide us with an opportunity to learn quite a bit about the 

home lending activities of community banks and other lending institutions, the data have some 

important limitations, particularly since they only cover urban institutions and are available only 

through 2011.  Other sources of data we can use to monitor the home lending activities of 

banking institutions are the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, or Call Reports, filed 

                                                 
13 In 2011, 56 percent of the conventional home-purchase loans by small community banks and about 40 percent of 
those originated by larger community banks were held in portfolio as compared to 30 percent for the largest banks. 
For this analysis only, loans originated in the first three quarters of 2011 were considered because of the delay 
between origination and loan sale.  The analysis assumes loans sold to affiliates are held in portfolio. 
14 Under HMDA, lenders report the spread between the “average prime offer rate” (APOR) and the annual 
percentage rate (APR) on a loan if the difference (or “spread”) exceeds 1.5 percentage points for first-lien loans or 
3.5 percentage points for junior lien loans of a similar type (for example, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage).  The 
APOR, which is published weekly by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), is an 
estimate of the APR on loans being offered to high-quality prime borrowers based on the contract interest rates and 
discount points reported by Freddie Mac in its Primary Mortgage Market Survey.
