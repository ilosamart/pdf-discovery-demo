Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the Federal 

Reserve’s commitment to and oversight of community banking.  I appreciate the 

invitation to attend the American Bankers Association’s Conference for Community

community bankers at conferences like this to discuss issues impacting your banks and 

the communities that you serve. 

As many of you know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community 

banker and more recently had the privilege to serve as the Kansas State Bank

listening closely to community bankers, consumers, small business owners, community 

leaders--all of the stakeholders with an interest in this area.  I will take back the 

knowledge I gain from these discussions and use it to improve our work.  And in the 

process, I hope to help you better understand what the Federal Reserve is doing and what 

we are trying to accomplish.  In doing so, I am confident our work will be more effective 

and efficient.
