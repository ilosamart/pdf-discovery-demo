regime reflected the characteristics of an intermediary’s liabilities.  Prior to the crisis, the Basel 

regime--though nominally applicable only to internationally active banks--in fact applied to most 

banks in many member jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union (EU).  

There were no quantitative liquidity requirements, and capital requirements did not vary based 

on the liability side of the balance sheet.  Indeed, the major departure from uniform application 

of capital rules was the opportunity afforded by Basel II for large banks to use their own internal 

models in determining their regulatory capital requirements, an opportunity that Basel II’s 

proponents expected to result in slightly lower requirements than under a standardized approach. 

 In the wake of the crisis, Basel III strengthened capital quality and levels across the 

board.  In addition, capital surcharges were imposed on about thirty banks of global systemic 

importance (G-SIBs), based on criteria that roughly reflect TBTF concerns--that is, the size and 

interconnectedness of the firms’ balance sheets.  Neither the generally applicable Basel III 

changes nor the G-SIB surcharges were specifically tied to the stability of a bank’s debt 

structure.  However, minimum quantitative liquidity requirements have been developed in the 

form of the shorter-horizon Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the longer-horizon Net Stable 

Funding Ratio, which together are intended to place some limits on excessive reliance on 

runnable liabilities.4 

 Important as these changes have been, the risks to the financial system posed by large 

amounts of short-term wholesale funding argue for closer regulatory linkage between capital and 

                                                 
4  In the United States, we have also applied a somewhat less stringent version of the LCR to banks that are large but 
that do not cross the threshold of being internationally active.  This tiered approach is consistent with the principle 
stated earlier that prudential requirements should vary based on the potential impact of a firm’s failure on the 
financial system as a whole. 

The liquidity rules clearly seem to have influenced the way banks manage their balance sheets.  In the 
United States, bank holding companies subject to the LCR significantly increased their holdings of high-quality 
liquid assets from the beginning of 2013 until the beginning of this year, to the point that many internationally active 
banks reported their LCR ratios already above fully phased-in requirements, even though the transition rules set an 
80 percent minimum ratio for January 1, 2015.
