because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications, 

and it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 

A fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other 

countries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our 

country as part of broader career and technical education efforts.  For instance, a state-run 

program in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop 

apprenticeships at no cost to them.  Businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per 

apprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs, 

paperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges.  The 

program has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state.24  Similarly, 

Washington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term 

increases in employment rates and hourly wages.25  

My fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a 

greater role in workforce development.  Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the 

American economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer 

income, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job 

and family commitments.  Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income
