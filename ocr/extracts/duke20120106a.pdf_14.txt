credit terms in declining markets.  Taken together, these mechanisms create a negative 

feedback loop between prices, credit terms, and inventories of distressed property in 

falling markets that may cause prices to overshoot their underlying values. 

Given the severity of problems with supply and demand in the housing market, 

it is unlikely that any single policy solution will provide the full answer, but a number 

of different policies each have the potential to yield incremental improvement in 

housing and economic recovery.  In the long term, policymakers will need to decide 

the future role, if any, that the government will play in housing finance.  And they will 

need to decide how to best wean the GSEs away from government conservatorship.  In 

the short term, however, I believe policymakers should at least consider policies that 

take into account the role the GSEs could play in hastening the healing of the housing 

market rather than focusing entirely on minimizing losses to the GSEs.  In the end, 

breaking the current logjam created by large numbers of loans severely past due or in 

foreclosure and high levels of distressed sales should help reduce losses to the GSEs 

by breaking the downward cycle in prices.  And, I think it is plausible that a faster 

recovery in the housing markets could speed, rather than slow, the end of GSE 

conservatorship.   

In recent months, a group of staff at the Federal Reserve has been studying ways 

in which the housing market is hindering the economic recovery and possible 

remedies for those difficulties.  This week we published a white paper that discusses 

issues and trade-offs to consider in developing policies that would facilitate recovery
