strategies to rebuild communities cannot focus narrowly on a single problem, such as the 

physical deterioration of neighborhoods that suffered high rates of foreclosure.  Rather, 

progress will require multipronged approaches that address housing, education, jobs, and 

quality-of-life issues in a coherent, mutually consistent way.  Moreover, strategies will 

have to be adapted to meet the special circumstances of urban, suburban, and rural 

settings.  As community development researchers and practitioners, you are confronting 

the challenge of effectively attending to the needs of both individuals and communities--

of people as well as places.  

The Evolution of Community Development 

Community development has a long history of innovation and learning from 

experience.  Notably, after decades of large-scale, top-down federal efforts, it became 

increasingly apparent that a one-size-fits-all approach did not serve local communities 

well.  The urban renewal programs of the 1950s and 1960s were perhaps the most 

prominent examples of well-meaning but misguided efforts to revitalize decaying inner-

city neighborhoods.  In practice, these policies often devastated neighborhood cohesion, 

leading their critics to argue for local, bottom-up solutions.  Perhaps the most influential 

critique of urban renewal and top-down planning was Jane Jacobs’s 1961 book, Death 

and Life of Great American Cities.

  In that book she celebrated the complexity and 

organic development of city neighborhoods in which intricate social networks enhance 

safety, quality of life, and economic opportunity.  In Jacobs’s view, a police force was 

not as effective at maintaining order as a neighborhood filled with “public actors” such as 

storekeepers, doormen, and interested neighbors acting as street watchers at all hours.  

The development of this sort of community self-monitoring is most likely to emerge, she
