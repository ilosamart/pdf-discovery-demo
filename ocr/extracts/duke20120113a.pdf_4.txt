 Today, I plan to discuss with you some ideas and initiatives that are on our subcommittee 

agenda as we strive for balance between our supervisory responsibilities and the effect 

supervisory practices have on the cost of compliance and credit availability.   

 Before I begin, I should note that the views I will share today are my own and do not 

necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board.  But I think it is 

also safe to say that my concern and commitment to get this right is shared by all of my 

colleagues on the Board of Governors and by the staff throughout the Federal Reserve System 

who do the really hard work every day. 

Clarifying Supervisory Expectations 

 One of the most daunting aspects of any comprehensive financial regulatory reform 

legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Act is the sheer volume of new regulatory proposals and final 

regulations.  I still remember the experience as a banker of reading through hundreds of pages of 

dense language, paying close attention to the footnotes, trying to determine whether a regulation 

even applied to my bank and, if it did, what was expected of us.  That was before we even got 

around to figuring out how we were going to meet the requirements, let alone what compliance 

was going to cost.  And now, as a regulator, I still read every rule, guidance, and proposal with 

the knowledge that the effort expended to understand new regulatory requirements is itself an 

additional burden. 

 So, in response to a suggestion that was made by one of our CDIAC members, we are now 

working to include, at the beginning of each regulatory proposal, final rule, or regulatory 

guidance, a statement outlining which banks are affected.  In particular, when issuing 

supervisory letters, we try to state specifically if and how new guidance will apply to community 

banks.  This way, banks won’t waste resources on requirements that don’t apply to them.
