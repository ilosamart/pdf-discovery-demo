I have discussed the factors that have held back the recovery, not only to better 

understand the recent past but also to think about the economy’s prospects.  The 

encouraging news is that the headwinds I have mentioned may now be abating.  Near-

term fiscal policy at the federal level remains restrictive, but the degree of restraint on 

economic growth seems likely to lessen somewhat in 2014 and even more so in 2015; 

meanwhile, the budgetary situations of state and local governments have improved, 

reducing the need for further sharp cuts.  The aftereffects of the housing bust also appear 

to have waned.  For example, notwithstanding the effects of somewhat higher mortgage 

rates, house prices have rebounded, with one consequence being that the number of 

homeowners with “underwater” mortgages has dropped significantly, as have 

foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies.  Household balance sheets have strengthened 

considerably, with wealth and income rising and the household debt-service burden at its 

lowest level in decades.  Partly as a result of households’ improved finances, lending 

standards to households are showing signs of easing, though potential mortgage 

borrowers still face impediments.  Businesses, especially larger ones, are also in good 

financial shape.  The combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing 

market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation 

bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters.  But, of course, if the 

experience of the past few years teaches us anything, it is that we should be cautious in 

our forecasts. 

What about the rest of the world?  The U.S. recovery appears to be somewhat 

ahead of those of most other advanced industrial economies; for example, real GDP is 

still slightly below its pre-recession peak in Japan and remains 2 percent and 3 percent
