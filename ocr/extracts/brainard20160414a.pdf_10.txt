distributed ledgers, is to operate effectively.  Indeed, if new technologies could lower the 

costs of multilateral clearing relative to bilateral clearing in new market segments, 

multilateral clearing could even grow. 

    Todayâ€™s clearing houses will likely continue to play a central role in highly 

regulated markets and be well positioned to evaluate and implement new clearing 

technologies, while continuing to provide core governance functions in the market.  

Nonetheless, it is also possible that if distributed ledgers ultimately cross asset classes 

and even industries, traditional clearinghouses serving specific market segments might 

have to evolve or new organizations might develop to provide an optimal approach to 

implementation.  Moreover, in principle, the use of distributed ledgers in new market 

segments may call for new clearing arrangements more in tune with new technologies.  

Similarly, organizations that can provide governance or other coordinating functions in 

bilaterally cleared markets may also require organizational structures somewhat different 

from traditional clearinghouses.  We will be following these issues with interest.   

Safety, Integrity, and Financial Stability 

 Safety and integrity in clearing and settlement is a critical, long-standing public 

policy objective of the Federal Reserve, and is critical for broader financial stability.  

Regardless of the technologies employed, if risks to clearing and settlement are not 

identified and addressed, then banks, dealers, and other firms will not be able to manage 

their obligations and market functioning may be impaired.  This is a key reason why 

major clearing and settlement systems are highly regulated.  Hence, the fundamental 

threshold test for new technologies will be whether they can be deployed and operated 

safely, with the requisite high degree of operational and financial integrity, security, and
