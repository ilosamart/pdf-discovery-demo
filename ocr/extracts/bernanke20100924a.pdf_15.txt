Most fundamentally, and perhaps most challenging for researchers, the crisis 

should motivate economists to think further about their modeling of human behavior.  

Most economic researchers continue to work within the classical paradigm that assumes 

rational, self-interested behavior and the maximization of “expected utility”--a 

framework based on a formal description of risky situations and a theory of individual 

choice that has been very useful through its integration of economics, statistics, and 

decision theory.9

The idea that, at certain times, decisionmakers simply cannot assign meaningful 

probabilities to alternative outcomes--indeed, cannot even think of all the possible 

outcomes--is known as Knightian uncertainty, after the economist Frank Knight who 

  An important assumption of that framework is that, in making 

decisions under uncertainty, economic agents can assign meaningful probabilities to 

alternative outcomes.  However, during the worst phase of the financial crisis, many 

economic actors--including investors, employers, and consumers--metaphorically threw 

up their hands and admitted that, given the extreme and, in some ways, unprecedented 

nature of the crisis, they did not know what they did not know.  Or, as Donald Rumsfeld 

might have put it, there were too many “unknown unknowns.”  The profound uncertainty 

associated with the “unknown unknowns” during the crisis resulted in panicky selling by 

investors, sharp cuts in payrolls by employers, and significant increases in households’ 

precautionary saving. 

                                                 
9 Herein I use the extension of Von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility, which focused on objective 
probabilities over risks, to situations in which individuals assign subjective probabilities over risks.  For a 
review of some classic contributions in this area, see Jacques H. Drèze (1974), “Axiomatic Theories of 
Choice, Cardinal Utility and Subjective Probability:  A Review,” in Jacques H. Drèze, ed., Allocation under 
Uncertainty:  Equilibrium and Optimality (London:  Macmillan), pp. 3-23.  Some authors have used risk to 
refer to a situation of objective probabilities and uncertainty to refer to a situation of subjective 
probabilities (see, for example, David M. Kreps (1990), A Course in Microeconomic Theory (Princeton, 
N.J.:  Princeton University Press)).  As highlighted below, others refer to uncertainty as a situation in which 
subjective probabilities cannot be assessed.  As this discussion makes clear, it is probably best to focus on 
the context in which the terms risk and uncertainty are used.
