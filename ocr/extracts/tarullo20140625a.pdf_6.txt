 Finally, I might mention a change made this year that actually reverted to a feature of the 

SCAP.  We did not allow banks to assume their balance sheets would shrink in the stress 

scenarios as a way of meeting the minimum capital charge, something that many banks had done 

in the stress tests of the past few years.4  Foreclosing this assumption serves the macroprudential 

goal of helping to ensure that the major financial firms remain sufficiently capitalized to support 

lending in a severe downturn. 

 As I have already suggested, we are likely to continue to hone the supervisory stress test.  

In particular, I expect that we will devote more attention to developing the macroprudential 

elements of the stress tests.  For example, we might sharpen our focus on the risks to the 

financial system of significant common exposures among firms.  We have already adjusted the 

market shock applied to the trading books of the six largest firms to ensure that firms are not 

incentivized to hold significant amounts of certain assets simply because they performed well in 

the second half of 2008.5  But there is more that could be done.  One idea would be to test 

whether individual firms that are revealed by the tests to be vulnerable to serious stress might 

engage in asset fire sales that could produce knock-on damage to other firms.  Another would be 

to incorporate more assumptions pertaining to the increased cost of, or reduced access to, 

funding in stressed environments, when lots of credit lines may be drawn simultaneously. 

 In short, we do not regard the supervisory stress test and CCAR as finished products.  In 

fact, we should never regard them as finished products, since to do so would be to overlook 

                                                 
4 Prior to CCAR 2014, the Board sent CCAR participants a letter detailing the Federal Reserve’s procedure for 
independently projecting the firms’ balance sheets and risk-weighted assets in the supervisory stress test and the 
implications of the independent projections. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), 
“Federal Reserve Independent Balance Sheet and RWA Projections,” December 
16, www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/independent-projections-letter-20131216.pdf.
