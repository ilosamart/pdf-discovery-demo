have, at least for the time being, adopted a more prudent stance.  But structural changes 

have also played a role.  The largest broker-dealers are now part of bank holding 

companies and are therefore subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, 

which includes regular stress-testing and tighter capital and liquidity requirements.  The 

new liquidity rules for large banks and the capital surcharge for systemically important 

banks discourage reliance on short-term wholesale funding.  And the ability of banks to 

provide support to structured investment vehicles has been substantially curtailed through 

both restrictions on the accounting treatment of formerly off-balance-sheet exposures and 

more stringent capital requirements, including the supplementary leverage ratio applying 

to on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. 

Indeed, some have asked whether the reduction in broker-dealer activities has 

gone too far, citing heightened concerns over a possible shortage of bond market liquidity 

as one example of potentially negative consequences.  Most measures of market liquidity 

in Treasury and corporate bond markets have not shown signs of a deterioration in market 

functioning in recent years.  There are certainly concerns that bond market liquidity may 

not be as robust as in the past, which could lead to sharper-than-anticipated price 

movements--of which the bond market events in mid-October 2014 are often cited as an 

example.  However, a review of the evidence does not point clearly to a significant role 

for the reduction in broker-dealer balance sheets or regulatory changes as being 

responsible for any shifts in liquidity.9  Other structural factors, such as the long-term 

trends toward higher participation of high-frequency trading firms in Treasury markets 

and greater disclosure of corporate bond trades, have been important.
