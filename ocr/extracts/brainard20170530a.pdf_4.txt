inflation did reach as high as 2.4 percent in the period from 2006 to 2007, but, at the time, 

this higher inflation was viewed as reflecting the pass-through of a significant run-up in 

energy and non-energy import prices.3 

Today, there is little indication of an outbreak of inflation--rather, the latest data 

on inflation have been lower than expected.  If anything, the puzzle today is why inflation 

appears to be slowing at a time when most forecasters place the economy at or near full 

employment.   

Even wage inflation, which is most tightly connected to labor market slack, shows 

little sign of heating up by most measures.  Overall, wages are increasing a bit more 

rapidly than they were a few years ago, but the latest data on wages do not show much 

progress over the past year.  Average hourly earnings rose only 2-1/2 percent in the 

12 months through April, the same as a year earlier.  Similarly, the employment cost 

index was up only 2-1/4 percent in the 12 months through March.  While that is up from 

a year earlier, it is lower than two years ago.  The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker 

tells a similar story:  Upward movement in wage gains was observed until about a year or 

so ago, but there has been little acceleration recently.   

Turning to overall inflation, earlier this year, reports indicated that the Federal 

Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) preferred measure of inflation--the headline measure 

of consumer price inflation on a national accounts basis--had, on a 12-month change 

basis, risen close to the FOMC’s objective, but the latest figures  have edged down 

somewhat as the rebound in energy prices has abated.  I tend to place greater weight on 

                                                 
3 For example, the FOMC minutes for March 2007 expressed “concern” about the rate of inflation but 
noted that increases in energy and non-energy imports could explain some of the upward pressure on core 
prices (see Board of Governors, 2007, paragraph 23).  The outlook was for a gradual decline in core 
inflation.
