Strong labor markets do seem to be averting some of the damage that might 

otherwise have become permanent.  Improved matching is reducing the natural rate of 

unemployment.  Potential workers are being pulled into the labor force by rising real 

wages and the recognition that jobs are becoming easier to find.  Over a longer period, 

stronger demand should support increased investment, driving productivity higher.  

Moreover, as the economy tightens, firms will have rising incentives to get more out of 

every dollar of capital and hour of work.   

Real-time estimates of potential output are highly uncertain; forecasts of potential 

growth even more so.  We can estimate growth of the working-age population reasonably 

well.  Future levels of labor force participation are less certain.  Least certain of all are 

forecasts of TFP.  If the optimists are right, then there will eventually be another wave of 

high productivity growth driven by the truly remarkable evolution of technology.  That 

would mean higher potential growth, faster increases in living standards, and also a return 

to higher interest rates over time. 

What if the pessimists are right and productivity growth remains low for another 

decade, or indefinitely?  The consequences would include lower potential growth and 

relatively lower living standards.  Our longer-term fiscal challenges would be 

significantly greater.   

Monetary Policy 

The implications for monetary policy of these supply-side issues have been 

limited, but they begin to matter more as we near full employment.   

For the near term, my baseline expectation is that our economy will continue on 

its path of growth at around 2 percent.  To confirm that expectation, it will be important
