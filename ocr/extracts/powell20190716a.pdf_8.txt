transparent communication about the economy, the risks, and our policy responses is 

critical for the effectiveness of our tools and for our accountability to the public in a 

democratic society.  

It is challenging, because we are operating in a changing macroeconomic 

environment with tools that, while no longer new, remain less familiar to the public.  

Moreover, our audience has become more varied, more attuned to our actions, and less 

trusting of public institutions.  Gone are the days when the Federal Reserve Chair could 

joke, as my predecessor Alan Greenspan did, “If I turn out to be particularly clear, you’ve 

probably misunderstood what I said.” 1  Central banks must speak to Main Street, as well 

as Wall Street, in ways we have not in the past, and Main Street is listening and engaged. 

Where does this leave us, and how should policymakers adapt to this new 

environment?  Recognizing challenges posed by the changing structure of the economy, 

the need for effective policy responses, and the importance of clear communication, 

central banks are taking a closer look at their strategies and the range of tools currently at 

their disposal.  For example, the Bank of Canada examines its framework every five 

years as part of the renewal of its inflation-control agreement with the federal 

government.  Canadian officials have announced the bank will “assess a broad range of 

monetary policy frameworks ahead of the renewal in 2021” of this agreement.2  The
