also of almost the entire world, and is reflected in the original Articles of Agreement of 

the International Monetary Fund.  

The first modern international attempt to regularize monetary relations among 

independent European states was that of the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), which came 

into force in 1866.  The original members were France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy.  

The Papal States joined later in the same year, and Greece and Rumania joined in 1867.7  

The members agreed to fix exchange rates among them by setting the amounts of silver 

and gold (weights and fineness) in the national coinage, with a specified exchange rate 

(15.5) between silver and gold.  In addition, a limit of 6 francs per inhabitant was set on 

the value of smaller coins issued by each country, “because of their substantial 

seigniorage.”8 

The LMU fixed exchange rates within a bimetallic international system.  

Kindleberger notes that in setting up the Union, the Swiss, Belgians, and Italians were in 

favor of moving to the gold standard, but that “French resistance dominated” (p. 68).  

“Then came a series of blows to silver” (p. 68), the most important occurring after the 

establishment of the Reichsbank, when Germany in 1873 shifted from bimetallism to the 

gold standard, and the Reichsbank started selling its silver.  In practice this moved the 

LMU to a gold standard, a change that was formally recognized in 1878--the year of the 

International Monetary Conference called by the United States to maintain bimetallism, 

an effort which failed.   

7 Later many other countries accepted the coinage standards set by the LMU but did not formally join the 
Union.
