complex firms.  In the course of our review, comments from these smaller, less complex firms 

confirmed this observation.  Officials from these banks expressed the view that the CCAR 

qualitative assessment was unduly burdensome because it created pressure to develop complex 

processes, extensive documentation, and sophisticated stress test models that mirrored those in 

use at the largest, most complex firms, in order to avoid the possibility of a public objection to 

their capital plan.  Since our intention had never been to create an incentive for firms with a 

relatively small systemic footprint to invest in stress testing processes appropriate only for larger 

or more complex firms, we knew we needed to address this problem. 

Results of the Review 

After more than a year of discussions and analysis, we have developed ideas for changes 

to the stress testing and CCAR regimes that would address these three key issues, along with 

some related matters that arose during the course of our review.  Some of these changes would 

need to be pursued through rulemakings, including the usual notice-and-comment process.  

Others can be implemented through nonregulatory changes, though some will need further 

elaboration in moving from idea to concrete practice.  Thus, there is a necessarily provisional 

character to the package set forth here.  Except for the relief from the qualitative requirements 

for smaller, less complex CCAR firms--which I will describe a bit later--we do not contemplate 

proposing regulations to implement these ideas until early next year.  Thus, any such changes 

would not apply to the coming 2017 DFAST/CCAR cycle.   

Better Alignment of CCAR with the new regulatory capital rules 

As I noted earlier, there have been significant additions to regulatory capital requirements 

since the first CCAR exercise began in late 2010.  While some--such as revised risk-weighted 

asset calculation methodologies and definitions of capital--have been integrated into the stress
