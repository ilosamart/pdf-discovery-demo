watershed meetings in Washington of finance ministers and central bank governors, 

many countries, including the United States, announced comprehensive plans to stabilize 

their banking systems.  And at the Federal Reserve, because we were well aware that 

turmoil in dollar funding markets overseas hurts our own financial markets, we also 

established temporary liquidity swap lines that enabled 14 central banks around the world 

to calm their markets by lending dollars in their jurisdictions. 

 I’ll conclude with the cautionary fourth lesson--history is never a perfect guide.  It 

is a principle acknowledged by the words etched on the wall of the Center’s conference 

room, attributed to Mark Twain, “History does not repeat itself, but it can rhyme.”  As an 

example, bank runs in many countries, including the United States, were common in the 

Depression.  In the most recent crisis, retail runs--depositors lining up in the streets--were 

thankfully rare because of deposit insurance and other changes in our financial system.4  

Although ordinary small depositors by and large did not run, we nevertheless experienced 

the equivalent of runs on the network of nonbank financial institutions that has come to 

be called the shadow banking system.  In the shadow banking system, loans, instead of 

being held on the books of banks as was virtually always the case in the 1930s, were 

packaged together in complex ways and sold to investors.  Many of these complex 

securities were held in off-balance-sheet vehicles financed by short-term funding.  When 

the housing slump shook investors’ faith in the values of the loans underlying the 

securities, short-term funding dried up quickly, threatening the banks and other financial 

institutions that explicitly or implicitly stood behind the off-balance-sheet vehicles.  This 

was a new type of run, analogous in many ways to the bank runs of the 1930s, but in a

California’s IndyMac Bank in July 2008.
