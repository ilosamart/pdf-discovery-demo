I am very happy to be participating in this symposium on taking stock of the 

global economy a decade after the Global Financial Crisis, and I thank Hiroshi Watanabe 

for the invitation.1  I have been asked to provide an overview of the U.S. economy since 

the advent of the crisis in no longer than 10 minutes, so I could either talk very quickly or 

focus my comments on more recent developments, perhaps throwing in a bit of historical 

context when appropriate. 

To cut to the bottom line, the U.S. economy appears to be performing very well 

and, certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many 

metrics, since well before the crisis.  Recent volatility in equity markets is a reminder that 

asset prices can move rapidly and unexpectedly.  However, it is my assessment that the 

underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound and much improved relative to 

earlier in the decade. 

One easy and important place to see that improvement is in the labor market.  

After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate fell rather steadily to 

4.1 percent in January--the lowest level, outside of a period from 1999 to 2000, since the 

1960s.  Job gains in recent months have continued at a pace that would be pushing the 

unemployment rate even lower if the labor participation rate had not stabilized in recent 

years, a welcome development and a sign that the strength of the labor market is pulling 

in or retaining workers who might otherwise be on the sidelines.  Broader measures of 

labor market slack--for example, those that include individuals who are out of the labor 

force but say they want a job as well as those working with a part-time job but who 

would like to work full time--have largely returned to pre-crisis levels.
