during periods in which risks are rising.13  Similarly, minimum margin requirements for 

securities financing transactions could potentially vary on a countercyclical basis so that 

they are higher in normal times than in times of stress.   

Implications for Monetary Policy, Now and in the Future 

In light of the considerable efforts under way to implement a macroprudential 

approach to enhance financial stability and the increased focus of policymakers on 

monitoring emerging financial stability risks, I see three key principles that should guide 

the interaction of monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the United States. 

First, it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a 

macroprudential approach to enhance resilience within the financial system, which will 

minimize the likelihood that monetary policy will need to focus on financial stability 

issues rather than on price stability and full employment.  Key steps along this path 

include completion of the transition to full implementation of Basel III, including new 

liquidity requirements; enhanced prudential standards for systemically important firms, 

including risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio, and tighter prudential buffers 

for firms heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding; expansion of the regulatory 

umbrella to incorporate all systemically important firms; the institution of an effective, 

cross-border resolution regime for systemically important financial institutions; and 

consideration of regulations, such as minimum margin requirements for securities 

financing transactions, to limit leverage in sectors beyond the banking sector and SIFIs.
