other lower-paying service jobs--accounted for only one-fifth of job loss and more than 

one-half of total job gains in the recovery.13   

It is not only the occupational and industrial distribution of the new jobs that 

poses challenges for workers and their families struggling to make ends meet, but also the 

fact that many of the jobs that have returned are part time or make use of temporary 

arrangements popularly known as contingent work.  The flexibility of these jobs may be 

beneficial for workers who want or need time to address their family needs.  However, 

workers in these jobs often receive less pay and fewer benefits than traditional full-time 

or “permanent” workers, are much less likely to benefit from the protections of labor and 

employment laws, and often have no real pathway to upward mobility in the workplace.14  

Wage gains have remained more muted than is typical during a recovery.  While 

this phenomenon likely partly reflects the trends in job creation that I have already 

discussed, weak wage growth also reflects the severe nature of the crisis:  Typically, 

those who are laid off during recessions struggle to find reemployment that is of 

comparable quality to their previous job, and research has shown that, on average, a 

person’s income remains depressed for decades following job loss, and that income 

losses over one’s working life are especially severe when the job loss occurs during a 

recession.15

jobless recoveries--but not prior to then.  See Nir Jaimovich and Henry E. Siu (2012), “The Trend Is the
