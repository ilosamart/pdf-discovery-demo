Data Are Not Enough:  We Need Theory, Too 

While the steps to improve data taken so far will help, gaps will remain, 

especially with regard to unregulated or weakly regulated entities.  These gaps impede 

both market participants’ ability to discipline the risks taken by institutions and 

supervisors’ ability to take prompt action.  Nonetheless, I would also like to emphasize to 

this group of researchers that better data, by themselves, are only the start of the journey 

to better understanding.   

An important area in need of development is economic modeling on 

interconnectedness, particularly on the interaction of shadow banking, banks, and the 

broader financial system.13  It is instructive to consider the distress at Lehman Brothers 

and American International Group, Inc. (AIG), in the late summer and fall of 2008 and of 

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in the late summer and fall of 1998.  In each 

case, banking supervisors and market participants appear not to have appreciated--at least 

until very late--the degree to which these institutions were intertwined with large banks 

and other financial institutions; in each case, the concerns over the direct connections of 

these institutions were compounded by uncertainty regarding their positions, the positions 

of other institutions, and the potential fire sale dynamics that could occur under forced 

liquidation of their assets.  Most obviously, in each case the institution was not a bank, 

and understanding the implications of their distress required understanding the possibly 

different implications of their business models from those of banks, their interconnections 

with banks, and their interconnections with the broader financial system.  Of course, 

                                                   
13 Then Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair Yellen discussed these issues in January 2013 (Yellen, 2013), in 
a speech that includes a detailed discussion of possible interactions among financial institutions, along with 
very clear graphic representations of potential systemic interactions.
