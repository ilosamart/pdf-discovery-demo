Another question asked consumers what they actually do most often with the mailings 
they receive. Responses indicate that the mailings are not solely or always considered 
“junk mail,” even if they are so regarded in many instances. About 55 percent said that 
they throw them away, but the others said that they open them and that they look at them, 
although not especially carefully (table 5). The respondents who said that they usually 
opened the prescreened solicitations were asked whether they looked for any particular 
information, and if so, what information. Among those who usually opened the 
prescreened solicitations, about 68 percent provided a variety of answers that mostly 
concerned pricing (data not in table). The remainder indicated that there was nothing in 
particular they looked for. Again, while it appears that the strong attitude toward the 
solicitations as “junk mail” leads most respondents to throw them away unopened, it also 
appears that nearly half of consumers are clearly aware of the contents of the mailings 
they receive. In other words, they have direct access to pricing and product information 
at a time when they can make a decision.25 

In sum, most consumers receive written offers of credit or insurance, and a significant 
portion appeared to be at least somewhat familiar with the contents of the mailings, 
including a minority who were aware of the opt-out notice. Only a relatively small 
proportion acted on the opt-out information and had their names placed on the opt-out list 
maintained by the CRAs. 

COMPETITION 

One cannot demonstrate conclusively that prescreened solicitations have had an effect on 
the competitiveness of markets for credit cards, but the available evidence is consistent 
with this hypothesis. Consider, for example, the uptrend in the volume of credit card 
prescreened solicitations seeking to attract or retain customers through offers of reduced 
interest rates and additional credit availability (see figure 1). Importantly for consumers, 
annual percentage rates on credit card accounts have fallen over the past fifteen years. 
Data from the Board’s reporting series FR2835 indicate that credit card interest rates fell 
sharply from mid-1991 through early 1994, after being relatively stable for most of the 
previous twenty years, and they fell again over the period 1998-2003.26 The decline in 
rates from mid-1991 is the result of many factors, including the continued advancement 
of data processing, communications technology, and credit evaluation methods such as 
credit scoring, and the sharp drop in card issuers’ costs of funds during this period. But it 
also seems likely that competitive factors were important in passing production and 
financing-cost savings through to customers. In 1990, only 6 percent of credit card 

25 Responses to a further question in the survey revealed that about 9 percent of those with general-
purpose credit cards who received solicitations in the past six months had responded to a solicitation from 
some card issuer during that time period (data not in table).
