resource constraints could be more binding than current inflation measures would 

traditionally indicate, which would call for a more athletic response.  Moreover, there is 

today a higher degree of uncertainty about many of these factors--measures of labor 

slack, the relation between labor slack and inflation, the sensitivity of current inflation 

measures to actual resource constraints, and the future growth of productivity, to name a 

few--than there has been for many years.  In such an environment, some have argued that 

this greater uncertainty leaves policymakers without a clear guide and market participants 

without a firm anchor, meaning policy itself could drift--perhaps dangerously.   

I do not think that is the case at all.  Instead, I think this situation reinforces and 

supports the importance of a clear, steady strategy and a gradual, predictable approach to 

the removal of accommodation as we continue to monitor the data.  The analogy I 

frequently use is the old pilot’s adage of “Don’t chase the needles.”  The control panel of 

any airplane has an instrument to guide your course:  a circular gauge with a vertical bar, 

or “needle,” running through the center of it.  If the bar moves sideways to the left, you 

are drifting off course and should change course to the left until the bar comes back into 

the center of the circle; if it moves to the right, you change course to the right.  Today 

these instruments get their inputs from the plane’s GPS (Global Positioning System) and 

are fairly sensitive and accurate, but decades ago, when I was a young man first learning 

to fly in the clouds, they got their information from radio beacons stationed on the ground 

and were quite squirrelly.  The bar could wander from side to side for a while for any of a 

number of reasons--distance from the beacon, the angle you were approaching it from, 

interference from other instruments on the panel, sunspots, or rain--and because of this 

uncertainty, the first rule taught to us as young pilots was, “Don’t chase the needles.”
