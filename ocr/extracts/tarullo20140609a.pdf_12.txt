up better with the old-style managers for whom the preservation of the firm is considerably more 

important than for shareholders. 

 Various suggestions for change have been made.  Some have proposed making incentive 

compensation packages more closely reflect the composition of the liability side of a banking 

organization’s balance sheet by including returns on debt, as well as equity, instruments in the 

calculation of compensation.11  Others have proposed the much simpler approach of making a 

significant part of incentive compensation deferred and subject to clawback and forfeiture, with 

the employee’s ultimate right to the compensation dependent on the firm not having become 

insolvent, received government assistance, or experienced a similar triggering event.  While 

developing the details of an effective mechanism that also allows for motivating employees to 

advance shareholder interests will take some work, some measure along these lines is key to 

adjusting incentives so as to promote prudential objectives across the many risk decisions made 

within the firm. 

 Incentive realignment can also be achieved by fostering more of the capital market 

discipline that has, as explained earlier, been limited.  One example is a byproduct of measures 

to increase the total loss absorbency of systemically important financial firms by requiring 

minimum amounts of debt that could be converted to equity upon a firm’s insolvency.  As you 

may know, the Federal Reserve Board intends to issue a proposed rulemaking that would 

implement such a requirement at the largest financial firms.  While the principal motivation of 

such a requirement is to help ensure that even a very large financial firm can be resolved in an 

orderly fashion without the injection of public capital, identifying debt instruments as convertible 

                                                 
11 See Bebchuk and Spamann, “Regulating Bankers’ Pay.” Depending on how closely one would want to tie 
compensation to the prices of bonds, for example, there may be difficulties owing to the potential at times for 
interest rate risk fluctuations to overwhelm credit risk fluctuations in the price of debt instruments.  Interest rate risk 
fluctuations would not reflect the performance or risk associated with a specific firm.
