may wish to consider revenue stability along with other critical features of the tax code 

such as fairness, support for economic growth, and administrative costs. 

Of course, healthy economic growth can ease state and local fiscal problems--and 

federal fiscal problems, for that matter.  Notwithstanding the very difficult near-term 

budget issues you face, I urge you not to take your eye off the important goal of 

promoting growth.   

A basic economic principle is that growth requires investment.  Investment 

includes physical investment such as infrastructure development; surely, adequate 

transportation networks and the like are necessary for economic growth.  But for 

sustained economic development, investment in people--in their knowledge and skills--is 

even more important.  No economy can succeed without a high-quality workforce, 

particularly in an age of globalization and technical change.  I think this is a lesson that 

the South, as a region, has learned quite well.  When I attended public schools in South 

Carolina in the 1960s, measures of per-pupil spending, years of schooling, and student 

achievement in the South lagged significantly behind other parts of the country.  Since 

then, those indicators have changed, very much for the better.  Because of the concerted 

efforts of state and local governments, high school completion rates in the South have 

gradually converged to the national average.  Southern colleges and universities have 

become more prominent nationally and internationally, and we have seen the emergence 

of leading centers of education and innovation, such as the Research Triangle Park area 

in North Carolina and the high-tech area around Austin, Texas.  Economic progress and a 

high quality of life have in turn attracted educated workers and new industries.
