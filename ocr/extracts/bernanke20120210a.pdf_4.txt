crowding out much of the need for new building.  Looking ahead, the relatively high rate 

of foreclosures is likely to continue for a while, putting additional homes on the market 

and dislocating families and disrupting communities in the process. 

At the same time, a number of factors are constraining demand.  Household 

formation has been down, particularly among young adults.  High unemployment and 

uncertain job prospects may have reduced the willingness of some households to commit 

to homeownership.  Availability of mortgage credit is an important constraint, to which I 

will return later.  Additionally, housing may no longer be viewed as the secure 

investment it once was thought to be, given uncertainty about future home prices and the 

economy more generally.   

Not surprisingly, the large imbalance of supply and demand has been reflected in 

a drop in home values of historic proportions.  Nationally, house prices have plunged 

about 30 percent in nominal terms from their peak and nearly 40 percent in real, or 

inflation-adjusted, terms.  The imbalance of supply and demand has also been reflected in 

the decline in home construction that I mentioned earlier.  Since 2009, the pace of single-

family housing starts has averaged less than 500,000 units per year.  During the 15 years 

before the financial crisis, the pace of single-family starts had never fallen below 

1 million units per year. 

In contrast to the situation for owner-occupied homes, rental markets around the 

country have strengthened somewhat.  In particular, vacancy rates for rental properties 

have declined and now stand near the lower end of their range over the past eight years.  

Not surprisingly, rents have been increasing and the construction of apartment buildings 

has picked up.
