continue to damp house prices in those states.  Nonetheless, the specific dynamics going 

forward will depend on the pace at which these properties are put on the market for sale.  

Investor activity is difficult to predict.  As house prices rise, some investors may 

no longer find purchasing homes to be a profitable enterprise.  Other investors may want 

to lock in their gains and sell properties.  The prospect of steady rental income and 

possible further capital gains, though, will likely continue to be attractive to many 

investors.  In addition, I suspect that the development of large-scale rental of single-

family homes as an asset class has gained enough traction with investors to continue in 

some form. 

For the housing recovery to gain true momentum, however, demand for housing 

among owner-occupiers must increase.  As I noted earlier, household sentiment toward 

homebuying, as measured by households’ assessments of purchasing conditions and by 

homebuyer traffic, appears to be on an upswing and should gradually strengthen demand.  

But I expect the strongest impetus to recovery to come from pent-up demand for housing 

in the form of household formation.  Between 2006 and 2011, roughly 550,000 new 

households formed per year, on net, significantly fewer than the 1.35 million per year 

over the previous five years.  Indeed, household formation from 2006 to 2011 appears to 

have been far lower than in any other five-year period since at least the mid-1960s.8 

Federal Reserve staff research indicates that this decline in household formation 

largely reflects the weak labor market, especially among younger adults.  If you have an 

adult son or daughter still living at home because he or she can’t find a job, it might not 

surprise you to know that the number of individuals aged 18 to 30 living with older 

                                                 
8 The finding is from staff calculations based on data from the Housing Vacancy Survey supplement of the 
Current Population Survey.  See U.S. Department of Commerce (2013), “Housing Vacancy Survey,” U.S.
