would be to assign risk weights for sovereign exposures based on whether the sovereign 
is a member of an organization other than the OECD, such as the G-20 or the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision, or whether it participates in the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) New Arrangements to Borrow.  This type of approach would be 
operationally simple, but would not recognize differences in credit-worthiness among the 
individual member nations within an organization.  An additional degree of risk 
sensitivity could be incorporated into this approach by adding additional criteria beyond 
membership in a given organization.  For instance, a higher risk weight could be assigned 
to an exposure to a sovereign entity if it had restructured its debt within a specified period 
of time or if its credit-worthiness deteriorated based on some market indicator (for 
example, credit spreads).    

 The agencies could also consider incorporating into standards of credit-worthiness 
country risk classifications generated by the OECD, the World Bank, or a similar 
organization.  This approach could assign risk weights according to the relative credit risk 
of each risk classification or designation.  Under such an approach, exposures to 
sovereigns classified as having lower credit risk would receive lower risk weights, and 
exposures classified as higher risk would receive higher risk weights.   

 A third option would be to differentiate the credit risk of sovereign exposures 
based on certain key financial and economic indicators.  For example, risk weights could 
be assigned based on one or more ratios such as gross debt per capita, real gross domestic 
product growth rate, or government debt and foreign reserves.  Such a treatment would 
require the agencies to select specific ratios and acceptable data sources, for example, 
from the IMF or the OECD.   

Question 3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods?  How can the agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  
Should the agencies consider other international organizations?  Which financial and 
economic indicators should the agencies consider?  What are the implications or potential 
unintended consequences?  Are there other methods for assessing risk-based capital 
requirements for sovereign exposures that would meet the principles described in section 
III?  Commenters are asked to provide quantitative as well as qualitative support and/or 
analysis for proposed alternative methods.  

ii. Public Sector Entity (PSE) exposures 

The agencies’ general risk-based capital rules assign risk weights to PSE 
exposures based on the repayment source for the exposure (for example, whether the 
exposure is a general obligation, revenue, or industrial revenue bond) and membership of 
the PSE’s sovereign government in the OECD.22  Under the Basel standardized approach, 
PSE exposures would be risk weighted based on the credit rating of the exposure or the
