Good morning.  Thank you to the American Enterprise Institute and Steve Oliner for 

inviting me here to speak.  My topic today is the urgent need for fundamental reform of our 

system of housing finance--the great unfinished business of post-financial crisis reform.1     

The Federal Reserve is not charged with designing or evaluating proposals for housing 

finance reform.  But we are responsible for regulating and supervising banking institutions to 

ensure their safety and soundness, and more broadly for the stability of the financial system.  A 

robust, well-capitalized, well-regulated housing finance system is vital to achieving those goals, 

and to the long-run health of our economy.  We need a system that provides mortgage credit in 

good times and bad to a broad range of creditworthy borrowers. 

While reforms have addressed some of the problems of the pre-crisis system, there is 

broad agreement that the job is far from done.  The status quo may feel comfortable today, but it 

is also unsustainable.  Today, the federal governmentâ€™s role in housing finance is even greater 

than it was before the crisis.  The overwhelming majority of new mortgages are issued with 

government backing in a highly concentrated securitization market.  That leaves us with both 

potential taxpayer liability and systemic risk.  It is important to learn the right lessons from the 

failure of the old system.  We can also apply lessons from post-crisis banking reform.  Above all, 

we need to move to a system that attracts ample amounts of private capital to stand between 

housing sector credit risk and taxpayers.  We should also use market forces to increase 

competition and help to drive innovation.
