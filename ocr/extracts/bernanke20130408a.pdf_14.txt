understand in general terms how the supervisory models work, and, even more 

importantly, they need to be confident that our models are empirically validated and 

sound.  I mentioned our internal efforts at model validation, which have increased the 

quality and accuracy of our models.  We have also begun to host an annual stress test 

modeling symposium, which provides a venue for regulators, bankers, academics, and 

others to share their views.  Over time, we expect banks to better understand the basic 

elements of the supervisory models, rendering them at least somewhat less opaque.  

At the same time, it is reasonable to worry that, with increased disclosure of 

supervisory models, firms would see a declining benefit to maintaining independent risk-

management systems and would just adopt supervisory models instead.  Doing so would 

certainly make it easier to “pass” the stress tests.  However, all models have their blind 

spots, and such an outcome risks a “model monoculture” that would be susceptible to a 

single, common failure.  The differences in stress test results obtained by supervisors’ 

and banks’ own models can be informative, and we do not want inadvertently to destroy 

the healthy diversity or innovation of the models and other risk-management tools used in 

the banking industry. 

Another challenge is that our stress scenarios cannot encompass all of the risks 

that banks might face.  For example, although some operational risk losses, such as 

expenses for mortgage put-backs, are incorporated in our stress test estimates, banks may 

face operational, legal, and other risks that are specific to their company or are otherwise 

difficult to estimate.  It is important for banking firms to consider the potential for losses 

from these other classes of risks as systematically as possible, and supervisors also
