$250 billion in assets with the same stringency as a G-SIB.  I believe there should be a 

clear differentiation. 

Next Steps from the Federal Reserve 

In my view, the Board should make it a near-term priority to issue a proposed rule 

concerning tailoring of enhanced prudential standards for large banking firms.  This 

proposal, of course subject to  notice and comment, would address our statutory 

obligations under the recent legislation by proposing to tailor enhanced prudential 

standards in a manner that recognizes relative complexity and interconnectedness among 

large banks.  The statute sets an 18-month deadline for this regulatory process, but we 

can and will move much more rapidly than this. 

In terms of capital requirements, both risk-based and leverage capital 

requirements should remain core components of regulation for large firms with more than 

$100 billion in total assets.  Stress testing should continue to play an important role in 

assessing potential losses that large firms would suffer under a severely adverse 

economic scenario; the recent legislation recognized the importance of stress testing by 

requiring a supervisory stress test for these large firms.  Therefore, the Board’s proposed 

stress capital buffer, if finalized, would be critical for these firms.  

However, we could consider a number of changes for less complex and less 

interconnected firms related to their capital requirements.  For example, such firms, even 

if above $250 billion in assets, could have less frequent company-run stress tests.  For 

those below $250 billion in assets, the statute requires supervisory stress tests to be 

conducted “periodically”, which suggests the legislature wanted us to at least consider a 

rhythm other than annually.  Additionally, less complex and less interconnected firms
