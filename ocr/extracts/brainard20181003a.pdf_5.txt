consumers and businesses to send and immediately receive payments at any time of the day, any 

day of the year, and provide recipients the ability to use their funds anywhere they choose.6   

Nascent faster payment services are emerging to address this demand from individuals 

and businesses for the capability to manage their finances more efficiently in real time.  These 

faster payment innovations are striving to keep up with this demand, but gaps in the underlying 

infrastructure pose challenges associated with safety, efficiency, and accessibility.  In many 

circumstances, the underlying infrastructure in place today cannot ensure that a fast payment is 

fully complete before the recipient seeks to use the funds.  To complete a payment, the banks 

behind the transaction need to transfer funds between each other.  Until this happens, the 

payment between them is like an “IOU.”   

Today’s systems that transfer funds between banks are not set up to work in a 24/7, real-

time world.  Instead, most faster payments settle funds between banks on a deferred basis.  

Deferred settlement entails a buildup of obligations--like IOUs between banks--that could 

present real risks to the financial system in times of stress.  Although faster payment systems that 

rely on deferred settlements can incorporate certain measures to mitigate these risks, these 

measures may be appropriate for a nascent faster payment market only for a limited time.  As we 

saw with the avalanche of paper checks prior to ACH, as the volume and value of faster 

payments grow over time, the potential risks of deferred settlement to the financial system are 

also likely to grow. 

To fully deliver on the promise of faster payments into the future, we need an 

infrastructure that can support continued growth and innovation, with a goal of settlement on a
