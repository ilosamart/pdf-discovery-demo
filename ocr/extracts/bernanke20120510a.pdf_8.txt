its peak, U.S. home mortgage credit outstanding has contracted about 13 percent in real 

terms.  Many factors suggest that this situation will be difficult to turn around quickly, 

including the slow recovery of the economy and housing market, continued uncertainty 

surrounding the future of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the lack of a 

healthy private-label securitization market, and cautious attitudes by lenders.   

Financing conditions in the commercial real estate sector also remain strained as 

fundamentals, including high vacancy rates, depressed property prices, and the poor 

quality of existing loans, continue to be weak.  Moreover, the market for commercial 

MBS--a source of liquidity for some lenders in this sector--is still struggling to regain its 

footing.    

The Federal Reserve’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 

Lending Practices (SLOOS) offers a more-nuanced view of how lending terms are 

changing.  The SLOOS indicates that standards and terms in many loan categories have 

eased somewhat further in recent quarters from the very tight conditions that prevailed 

earlier in the recovery.

  For example, the April SLOOS pointed to the first material net 

easing in lending standards for commercial real estate loans since 2005 and to a further 

easing of standards for most types of consumer loans.  In addition, SLOOS respondents 

suggested that stepped-up competition has induced a large number of domestic banks to 

reduce fees and spreads on C&I loans to firms of all sizes.  The SLOOS also indicates 

that demand for many types of loans has continued to increase, with demand for C&I 

loans having risen to relatively high levels.
