Another major financing question for the nation in this 

coming year must be that of commercial bank policy. Clearly, over 

the past two years, banks have had to contend with major losses 

stemming in a large part from the recession and its impact upon 

real estate developments and in part on other corporate failures.

Bankers responded to these losses by tightening their lending terms 

and limiting their growth of assets. Over the past few months, 

disclosures of certain banks on special surveillance lists and 

Congressional demands for additional information have impacted upon 

bankers' psychology to an unknown degree. Congress is at the moment 

studying the financial institutions of this country, trying to develop 

new legislation for restructuring our financial industry and its 
regulators. Some appear to view the published problems of some 

of the banks in the United States as a reflection of a poor job of 

regulation whereas from our standpoint the fact that there is a list 

of banks requiring special surveillance is evidence that we have been 

watching the banks with a great deal of care and have put special 

surveillance elements into our regulatory and supervisory work.

Banking is a risk industry. Unless bankers take risks, 

they cannot support their communities nor the industries and businesses 

making up those communities. Bankers expect to have some losses. Losses 

may result from poor management, from adverse economic conditions,
