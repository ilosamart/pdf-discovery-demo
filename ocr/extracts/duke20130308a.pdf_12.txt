initiative last year to clarify the liabilities associated with representations and warranties, 

but so far, those efforts do not appear to have been sufficient to keep putback risk from 

weighing on the mortgage market. 

Mortgage servicing standards, particularly for delinquent loans, are more stringent 

than in the past due to settlement actions and consent orders.  Servicing rules recently 

released by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will extend many of these 

standards to all lenders.  These standards remedy past abuses and provide important 

protections to borrowers, but they also increase the cost of servicing nonperforming 

loans.  Under current servicing compensation arrangements, servicers receive the same 

monthly servicing fee for the routine processing of current loans as they do for the more 

expensive processing of defaulted loans, a model that assumes that the higher profits on 

routine processing will offset the cost of servicing delinquent loans.  However, this 

compensation model, coupled with higher default servicing costs, may instead make 

lenders less willing to extend credit to lower-credit-quality borrowers, who are more 

likely to default.  A change to servicer compensation models, especially for default 

servicing, could alleviate some of the concern about making these loans, albeit at higher 

costs to some borrowers. 

Another key factor contributing to mortgage lender caution is uncertainty about 

the ultimate regulatory environment.  Regulatory decisions will work individually and 

collectively to shape the cost and availability of mortgage credit in the future.  So it is 

important for policymakers to think carefully about their individual decisions as well as 

how those decisions will work within the full constellation of mortgage regulation.  

Regulatory changes are being implemented to ensure that borrowers have more
