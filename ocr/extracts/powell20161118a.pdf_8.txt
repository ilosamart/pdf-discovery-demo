components in China’s total manufactured imports from about 65 percent in 2005 to under 

50 percent in 2014.10  These two pieces of evidence suggest that the shift away from parts and 

components in Chinese imports is not just due to lower orders tied to weak import demand in the 

advanced economies, but also due to the rising productivity and sophistication of the Chinese 

labor force, which is enabling China to move to higher value-added exports.   

As China moves up the sophistication ladder, you would also expect other countries to 

take a greater role in the lower steps of the ladder.  We do have evidence that some other 

countries with cheaper labor, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, are playing more of a role as 

exporters in the low-value added parts of the Asian supply chain.  Anecdotal evidence suggests, 

though, that some of this shift is also taking place within China, as low-value-added production 

shifts to low-wage areas in China’s interior.11     

The third important structural change affecting Chinese trade is the progress China is 

making in moving away from its export-led model of economic growth and rebalancing its 

economy toward domestic demand.  As shown in slide 10, investment, which in much of the 

pre-crisis period was supporting high exports, has been falling as a share of the economy in 

recent years while the consumption share has been rising.  Note, though, that the consumption 

share remains well below its value in the early 2000s.  In addition, as can be seen in slide 11, as 

part of its rebalancing, Chinese production has been shifting away from manufacturing to 


10 This share has been computed by updating the methodology followed in Haltmaier and others (2007), which, in 
turn, extended the methodology of Athukorala and Yamashita (2006).
