I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of San 

Francisco’s Asia Economic Policy Conference, and I thank the organizers for inviting 

me.1  After a long period of rapid economic growth, Asia’s emerging economies appear 

to have entered a transitional phase.  For decades, emerging Asian economies have been 

among the fastest growing and most dynamic in the world.  Supported by an export-

oriented development model, annual growth averaged 7-1/2 percent in the three decades 

leading up to the global financial crisis.  As shown in table 1, the fast pace of growth in 

emerging Asia has also supported impressive gains in per capita income within the 

region.     

As the economies of emerging Asia have developed, they have followed a similar 

growth trajectory, also apparent in table 1.  Along a path pioneered by Japan in the 1960s, 

initial integration into the global economy has been followed by a period of rapid export-

led economic growth, which subsequently slows as the economy develops and incomes 

rise.  In a process that has been likened to the pattern of flying geese, development in 

Japan pushed more labor-intensive production from Japan into the “Asian tigers”--that is, 

Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--with that set of countries experiencing rapid 

growth in the 1970s and 1980s.  As the tigers developed, low-value-added production 

was pushed further on, into the group of countries known as the Association of Southeast 

Asian Nations (ASEAN)--primarily Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and, more recently, 

China, where growth took off in the 1980s and accelerated through the 2000s.2  At each

Hoek for their contributions to this speech.  I also thank Ravi Menon of the Monetary Authority of
