Concluding Comments 

Overall, the U.S. financial agencies collectively have substantial lender-of-last-

resort authorities to meet future contingencies.  The Federal Reserve maintains the ability 

to provide liquidity to markets during times of unusual financial stress, including the 

authority to lend to insured depository institutions.  Indeed, for the 70 years between the 

Great Depression and the recent financial crisis, the Fed executed its lender-of-last-resort 

responsibility exclusively through such loans.  Moreover, broad-based facilities of the 

sort that the Fed operated during the financial crisis generally could still be introduced 

under our new regulations if they were needed to limit the effect of a future crisis on 

financial markets and the economy.   

And while the Federal Reserve no longer can lend to individually troubled 

nonbanks, the FDIC’s expanded resolution authorities should allow it to address troubles 

at such institutions with sufficiently low risk of cascading disruptions to the rest of the 

financial system and thus the economy.  Handling such situations through resolution has 

the advantage of ensuring that any costs are primarily incurred by the existing owners and 

creditors of the troubled firm, but such an approach is currently untried.  It is important 

that the government have the ability to execute the resolution seamlessly and with little or 

no warning--for example, Bear Stearns informed the Fed on a Thursday that it would 

default on Friday.9   

There are nonetheless three major sources of concern about potential weaknesses 

in the new framework for financial crisis management that has been introduced since the
