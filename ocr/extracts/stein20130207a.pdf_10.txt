exhibit 2, issuance in both of these markets has been very robust of late, with junk bond 

issuance setting a new record in 2012.  In terms of the variables that could be informative 

about the extent of market overheating, the picture is mixed.  On the one hand, credit 

spreads, though they have tightened in recent months, remain moderate by historical 

standards.  For example, as exhibit 3 shows, the spread on nonfinancial junk bonds, 

currently at about 400 basis points, is just above the median of the pre-financial-crisis 

distribution, which would seem to imply that pricing is not particularly aggressive.

On the other hand, the high-yield share for 2012 was above its historical average, 

suggesting--based on the results of Greenwood and Hanson--a somewhat more 

pessimistic picture of prospective credit returns.

  This notion is supported by recent 

trends in the sorts of nonprice terms I discussed earlier (exhibit 4).  The annualized rates 

of PIK bond issuance and of covenant-lite loan issuance in the fourth quarter of 2012 

were comparable to highs from 2007.  The past year also saw a new record in the use of 

loan proceeds for dividend recapitalizations, which represents a case in which 

bondholders move further to the back of the line while stockholders--often private equity 

firms--cash out.

  Finally, leverage in large LBOs rose noticeably, though less 

dramatically, in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. 

Putting it all together, my reading of the evidence is that we are seeing a fairly 

significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior emerging in corporate credit.  However, 

even if this conjecture is correct, and even if it does not bode well for the expected

 To be precise, the spread was at 397 basis points as of January 28, 2013, as compared to a median value 

of 388 basis points over the period January 1997 to July 2007, and a mean of 447 basis points over the 

same period.

 One factor that complicates the interpretation is that, in late 2012, one might have expected an increase in 

dividend-recap loans even absent any change in investor risk appetite, based on the anticipation of future 

dividend tax increases.
