Consistency and Predictability 

There was also wide support for making CRA definitions and evaluation criteria

CRA is implemented as consistently as possible both within and across the agencies.  At 

the Federal Reserve, we agree that it is important for the banking agencies to take a

Metrics 

  Finally, there was broad support for expanding the use of metrics in CRA 

evaluations, where appropriate, especially if they are clearly articulated, are used in 

tandem with performance context information, and add to the transparency of CRA 

ratings.  We recognize that effective and predictable evaluations rely on good metrics.  

Metrics, in turn, require good data.  Currently, CRA evaluations use HMDA data, which
