is essential that they remain so.  The only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve 

actual inflation of 2 percent, and I am strongly committed to that objective.   

Looking Ahead 

My baseline expectation has been that our economy is likely to continue on its 

path of growth at around 2 percent.  I have also expected the ongoing healing in labor 

markets to continue, with healthy wage increases and job creation.  As the economy 

tightens, I have expected that inflation will move up over time to the Committee’s 2 

percent objective.   

For some time, the principal risks to that outlook have been from abroad.  Global 

economic and financial conditions are particularly important for the U.S. economy at the 

moment.  Weakness in economic activity around the world and related bouts of financial 

volatility have weighed on the performance of our economy.  Given the stronger 

performance of the U.S. economy, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has risen 

roughly 20 percent since 2014.  Such a large appreciation of the dollar means that we will 

“export” some of our strength to our trading partners and “import” some of their 

weakness.   

Growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading 

partners.  European and Japanese authorities have limited scope to respond, with daunting 

longer-run fiscal challenges and policy rates already set below zero.  In China, stimulus 

measures should support growth in the near term, but may also slow China’s necessary 

transition away from its export- and investment-led business model.  Emerging market 

nations such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela face challenging conditions.   

These global risks have now shifted even further to the downside, with last 

week’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the European Union.  The Brexit 

vote has the potential to create new headwinds for economies around the world, including
