that question is answered affirmatively, whether the imposition of such standards would lead to a 

significant arbitrage through increased participation by those outside the regulatory perimeter.  It 

does not seem far-fetched to think that, with time and sufficient economic incentive, the 

financial, technological, and regulatory barriers to the disintermediation of prudentially regulated 

dealers could be overcome.  Indeed, there have already been reports of some hedge funds 

exploring the possibility of disintermediating dealers by lending cash against securities collateral 

to other market participants. 

 For this reason, there is a need to supplement prudential bank regulation with a third set 

of policy options in the form of regulatory tools that can be applied on a market-wide basis.  That 

is, regulation would focus on particular kinds of transactions, rather than just the nature of the 

firm engaging in the transactions.  To date, over-the-counter derivatives reform is the primary 

example of a post-crisis effort at market-wide regulation.5  Given that the 2007â€“2008 financial 

crisis was driven more by disruptions in the SFT markets than by disruptions in the over-the-

counter derivative markets, comparable attention to SFT markets is surely needed.  Over the past 

two years, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has been evaluating proposals for a system of 

haircuts and margin requirements for SFTs.  In its broadest form, a system of numerical floors 

for SFT haircuts would require any entity that wants to borrow against any security to post a 

minimum amount of excess margin that would vary depending on the asset class of the collateral.  

Like minimum margin requirements for derivatives, numerical floors for SFT haircuts would be 

                                                            
5 Although the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission primary responsibility in this area, a broad range of federal financial regulators (including the Federal 
Reserve) is responsible for developing margin requirements for over-the-counter derivatives transactions.  These 
requirements will limit the amount of leverage that market participants can take on through the use of derivative 
instruments.  In addition, by requiring margin to be posted at the outset of a transaction and mark-to-market gains 
and losses to be continually offset through transfers of additional collateral, these requirements will help to avoid 
situations in which firms face margin calls only when they are most pressed for liquidity.
