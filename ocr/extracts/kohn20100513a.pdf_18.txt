Third, it appears that large-scale asset purchases at the zero bound do help to ease 

financial conditions.  Our best judgment is that longer-term yields were reduced as a result of our

supported demand to help stabilize the housing market.  Moreover, low rates on corporate bonds 

contributed to a wave of longer-term business financing that has strengthened the financial

Fourth, central banks also need to be mindful of the potential effects on inflation 

expectations of the expansion of their balance sheet.  Most policymakers do not tend to put too

mentioned earlier.  But we are aware that the size of our balance sheet is a potential source of 

policy stimulus, and we need to be alert to the risk that households, businesses, and investors 

could begin to expect higher inflation based partly on an expanded central bank balance sheet.  

As always, the Federal Reserve monitors inflation developments and inflation expectations very 

closely and any signs of a significant deterioration in the inflation outlook would be a matter of 

concern to the FOMC.   

Fifth, central banks need to have the tools to reverse unusual actions--to drain reserves 

and raise interest rates--when the time comes.  Confidence in those tools should help allay any

economy heads into recession.  In the case of the Federal Reserve, our ability to pay interest on 

excess reserves, which we received only in September 2008, is a very important tool that made 

us more comfortable taking extraordinary steps when they were needed; it allows us to put
