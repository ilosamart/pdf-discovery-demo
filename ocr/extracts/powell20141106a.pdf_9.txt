relating to liquidity, transparency, stress testing, “skin in the game,” and recovery and 

resolution.     

Liquidity   

The adoption of the PFMIs around the world is driving improvements in CCP 

liquidity.8    Ultimately, CCPs and their supervisors will need to maintain vigilance to 

ensure that liquid resources are sufficient to withstand the kinds of liquidity shocks that 

would likely accompany a member’s default.  In addition, it is crucial that liquidity 

scenario analysis be a regular part of a CCP’s stress-testing program to help ensure that 

appropriate liquidity planning does not suffer from a lack of vision or imagination.      

Transparency   

Enhanced transparency is central to the reform agenda, and there has been some 

progress in this area.  But CCPs need to provide still greater transparency to their clearing 

members and to the public.  The G-20’s central clearing mandate shifted a significant 

amount of activity and control away from dealers to CCPs.  With this shift, CCPs took on 

the responsibility of managing risks in a way that is transparent to the clearing members 

who are subject to the decisions of the CCP.  Clearing members need a full and detailed 

understanding of their risk exposure to CCPs, which means that clearing members must 

have detailed and appropriate information on stress-test results, the specification and 

application of margin models, and the sizing of default funds to cover losses.  Without a 

clear picture of a CCP’s risk profile, clearing members cannot make informed decisions 

                                                 
8 In the United States, these standards were implemented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 

for derivative-clearing organizations in November 2013 and by the Federal Reserve for certain financial 

market utilities that are designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

in October 2014.
