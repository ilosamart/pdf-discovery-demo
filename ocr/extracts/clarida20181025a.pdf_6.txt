these market-based measures are not perfect and need to be adjusted for liquidity and 

term premium factors, they can provide a useful signal about market inflation 

expectations, which can be combined with signals from surveys of expected inflation to 

get a read on inflation expectations.  Breakeven inflation rates have only recently risen to 

a range that is in line--but just barely--with the expectation that inflation will remain 

close to our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium-to-longer run.  Survey-based 

measures of inflation expectations also appear consistent with the Fed’s inflation goal.   

In short, the labor market today is robust, and inflation is at or close to the Fed’s 

2 percent inflation goal.  Thus, the economy is as near as it has been in a decade to 

meeting both of the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, which suggests to me that monetary 

policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and 

employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation at or close to the 2 percent rate 

consistent with price stability.  By contrast, until this year, the appropriate focus of policy 

had been to return employment and inflation to levels consistent with our dual-mandate 

objectives.  With the economy now operating at or close to mandate-consistent levels for 

inflation and unemployment, the risks that monetary policy must balance are now more 

symmetric and less skewed to the downside. 

Policy Remains Accommodative 

I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to raise the target for the federal 

funds rate to a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent.  With the economy growing briskly, the labor 

market operating in the vicinity of full employment, and inflation running close to 

2 percent, I saw our decision as another step in removing the extraordinary degree of 

accommodation put in place in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis.  However,
