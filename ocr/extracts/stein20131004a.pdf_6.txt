term collateralized basis, with very high leverage—often in the range of twenty-to-one, 

fifty-to-one, or even higher. Hence, there is a strong potential for any one borrower’s 

distress—and the associated downward pressure on prices—to cause a tightening of 

collateral or regulatory constraints on other borrowers. 

I won’t go into much detail about the institutional aspects of SFTs and the repo 

market.  Instead, I will just lay out two stylized examples of SFTs that I can then use to 

illustrate the properties of various regulatory tools.  

Example 1: Broker-dealer as principal 

In this first example, a large broker-dealer firm borrows in the triparty repo 

market—from, say, a money market fund—in order to finance its own holdings of a 

particular security.  Perhaps the broker-dealer is acting as a market-maker in the 

corporate bond market, and uses repo borrowing to finance its ongoing inventory of 

investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  In this case, the asset on the dealer’s balance 

sheet is the corporate bond, and the liability is the repo borrowing from the money fund. 

Example 2: Broker-dealer as SFT intermediary 

In this second example, the ultimate demand to own the corporate bond comes not 

from the dealer firm, but from one of its prime brokerage customers—say, a hedge fund.  

Moreover, the hedge fund cannot borrow directly from the money market fund sector in 

the triparty repo market, because the money funds are not sufficiently knowledgeable 

about the hedge fund to be comfortable taking it on as a counterparty.  So instead, the 

hedge fund borrows on a collateralized basis from the dealer firm in the bilateral repo 

market, and the dealer then turns around and, as before, uses the same collateral to
