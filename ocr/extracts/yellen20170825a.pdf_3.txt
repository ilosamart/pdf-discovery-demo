address risks that arise outside the regulatory perimeter.   

Nonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand 

that policymakers and researchers remain alert to both areas for improvement and 

unexpected side effects.  The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to evaluate the 

effects of regulation on financial stability and on the broader economy and to making 

appropriate adjustments. 

I will start by reviewing where we were 10 years ago.  I will then walk through 

some key reforms our country has put in place to diminish the chances of another severe 

crisis and limit damage during times of financial instability.  After reviewing these steps, 

I will summarize indicators and research that show the improved resilience of the U.S. 

financial system--resilience that is due importantly to regulatory reform as well as actions 

taken by the private sector.  I will then turn to the evidence regarding how financial 

regulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity.

by 50 basis points and announced a change to the Reserve Banks’ usual practices to allow the provision of 

term financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower.  The changes were announced to remain 

in place until the Federal Reserve determined that market liquidity had improved materially.  See Board of
