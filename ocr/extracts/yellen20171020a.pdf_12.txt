securities holdings.  If financial market participants perceived no change in the economic 

outlook and no intention on the part of the FOMC to alter the overall stance of monetary 

policy, the FOMCâ€™s inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be 

taken as an indication that the FOMC would instead rely more on increases in short-term 

interest rates to scale back accommodation, resulting in a faster pace of short-term 

interest hikes.  On net, longer-term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical 

scenario:  While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term 

premiums and hold longer-term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short-term 

interest rate increases would push longer-term yields higher.16   

A Key Question for the Future 

As the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the stance of 

monetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible 

future role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis.  

My colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible, influencing short-

term interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool.  As I 

have already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory 

goals.  In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities 

holdings for that purpose.   

Where does this assessment leave our unconventional policy tools?  I believe their 

deployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit--that is, 

                                                 
16 In contrast, when the Federal Reserve was purchasing assets, short-term interest rates were at their 
effective lower bound, and they were expected to remain there for the foreseeable future.  As a result, 
decisions to buy additional assets--and the resulting additional downward pressure on term premiums--were 
not offset by expectations of a higher path for short-term interest rates.  The end result was that there was 
greater potential for asset purchases to have a discernible effect on longer-term yields in the years 
immediately following the financial crisis than in current circumstances.
