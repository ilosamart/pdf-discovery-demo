mechanism for systemically important firms will be important for reducing uncertainty, 

enhancing market discipline, and reducing moral hazard. 

Our continuing challenge is to make financial crises far less likely and, if they 

happen, far less costly.  The task is complicated by the reality that every financial panic 

has its own unique features that depend on a particular historical context and the details 

of the institutional setting.  But, as Stan Fischer has done with unusual skill throughout 

his career, one can, by stripping away the idiosyncratic aspects of individual crises, hope 

to reveal the common elements.  In 1907, no one had ever heard of an asset-backed 

security, and a single private individual could command the resources needed to bail out 

the banking system; and yet, fundamentally, the Panic of 1907 and the Panic of 2008 

were instances of the same phenomenon, as I have discussed today.  The challenge for 

policymakers is to identify and isolate the common factors of crises, thereby allowing us 

to prevent crises when possible and to respond effectively when not.
