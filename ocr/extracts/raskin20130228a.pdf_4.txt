investment.  In traditional banking, this means that financial intermediation occurs most 

effectively when the interest rate charged for use of funds in lending is close to the interest rate 

paid for deposits.  As the difference between the two grows (which would be attributable to 

amounts extracted by intermediaries as compensation for essential intermediation), the costs of 

borrowing for the purposes of creating productive projects become higher than they should be, 

with arguably negative reputational consequences. 

Given these particular reputational dimensions associated with financial institutions, 

might financial regulators have an interest in considering reputational harms analytically?  Could 

there be benefits to understanding the ways that an individual financial institution’s reputation--

or that of the financial industry as a whole--might have particular effects on, for example, safety 

and soundness, financial inclusion, or financial innovation? 

In my remarks today, I want to consider various aspects of how reputational harm 

manifests itself in banks and begin a dialogue with you about how we might refresh our thinking 

about this category of risk.  I will start with a description of some factors that can affect a bank’s 

reputation, especially in the wake of the financial crisis.  Next, I will talk about ways in which 

reputation matters, including how supervisors can use their unique ability to see inside the 

institutions that they examine to uncover some early indicators of reputational problems.  I will 

then turn to other reasons why policymakers may want to think about reputation.  One reason 

involves possible consequences regarding financial inclusion; that is, a customer’s ability to have 

a relationship with his or her bank that puts them in the position to save, access credit in a 

sustainable way, and understand the nature of the financial transactions in which they participate.  

Reputation also may help or hinder a bank’s ability to innovate, so I will introduce this topic 

next.  Finally, I want to frame a discussion around the recent cybersecurity threats that banks are
