risk associated with a particular firm, there is certainly no generally accepted approach.

Indeed, differences among reasonable assumptions in applying the expected impact 

approach led to a fairly broad range of potential surcharges.  The 1–2½ percent amounts 

negotiated within the Basel Committee are at the low end of that range, reflecting a good 

deal of caution—frankly, more caution than I think would have been desirable, even 

given the uncertainties.  Regardless of one’s views on calibration, though, the motivation 

and methodology for what have become known as “SIFI surcharges” are clearly 

macroprudential. 

 One last point on macroprudential resiliency measures is that they can have 

secondary effects that serve the lean-against-the-wind aim of macroprudential policies.  

For example, a supervisory stress test can assign a higher loss rate to a certain class of 

assets in a hypothesized adverse scenario because they are particularly vulnerable to 

potential shocks and thus susceptible to particularly sharp declines in a serious recession.  

To the extent that firms learn over time that such assets will be treated that way, there is 

at least a mild disincentive to hold them.  As I will discuss in a moment with respect to 

countercyclical capital requirements, we should not overstate this lean-against-the-wind 

effect, but perhaps not dismiss it out of hand either.

 Among the useful efforts along these lines are a measure of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) (see 

Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2011), “CoVaR,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff 

Reports 348 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, September), 

www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr348.pdf) and a measure of systemic risk based on each firm's 

contribution to the expected capital shortfall of the entire financial system in a crisis (see Christian T. 

Brownlees and Robert F. Engle (2011), “Volatility, Correlation and Tails for Systemic Risk Measurement,” 

New York University Working Paper (New York: New York University, June), 

http://ssrn.com/abstract=1611229). The concept behind the latter measure is also described in Viral V. 

Acharya, Christian Brownlees, Farhang Farazmand, and Matthew Richardson (2011), “Measuring Systemic 

Risk,” in Regulating Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance (New 

York: Wiley Publishers), pp. 87–119. Updated systemic risk rankings are maintained by the authors at

Getmansky, Andrew W. Lo, and Loriana Pelizzon (2010), “Measuring Systemic Risk in the Finance and 

Insurance Sectors,” MIT Sloan School Working Paper 4774-10 (Cambridge, MA: MIT Sloan School of 

Management, March), http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/66679/systemic9.pdf.
