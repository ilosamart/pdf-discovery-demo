acutely by the neighbors and communities that must cope with the dangers and costs of vacant 

buildings.  Since vacant properties tend to be concentrated in a relatively few number of 

neighborhoods, some communities are adversely affected much more than others.  

 Homes that have been vacant for a long time tend to fall into severe disrepair.  Such 

physical blight can invite more property crime, as vacant houses are an appealing hide-out and 

target for criminals, and the absence of residents can mean fewer eyes in the neighborhood to 

look out for suspicious activity.  In fact, counties that experience a large increase in the number 

of long-term vacant homes tend to see an increase in burglary in the following year.  This 

correlation holds even after controlling for other county characteristics, such as changes in 

unemployment, changes in population, and changes in violent crime.8    

In turn, blight and crime make these neighborhoods less attractive to potential buyers, 

renters, and businesses.  Calculations by Board staff indicate that ZIP codes with a larger 

increase in long-term vacancy experience smaller increases--or larger decreases--in house prices 

in the next year.9  Falling home prices can harm both neighboring homeowners as well as local 

municipalities that are dependent on property tax revenue.   

Research conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland has shown that a home 

that is simply foreclosed, but not vacant, lowers neighboring property values by up to 3.9 

percent.  However, if a home is foreclosed, tax delinquent, and vacant, it can lower neighboring 

property values by nearly two and a half times that amount.10  Moreover, properties that have 

been vacant for a substantial period of time can impose even larger costs on the community, and
