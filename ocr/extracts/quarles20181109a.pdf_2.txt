Thank you to Brookings for inviting me to speak today. It is an honor and 

pleasure to talk to you about the next chapter in stress testing, particularly before this 

extremely distinguished audience of Brookings scholars that includes former Chairs, Vice 

Chairs, and senior leaders of the Federal Reserve who did the hard foundational work of 

developing and implementing this new approach to the assessment of bank resiliency.  In 

these circumstances, my discussing changes to our stress testing regime could sound 

uncomfortably close to the serene arrogance of Alfonso X of Castile, who famously said 

that “Had I been present at the creation, I would have given some useful hints for the 

better ordering of the universe.”  My thoughts today, however, are not a call to rewrite 

Genesis, but rather a recognition that our stress testing regime--like the banking and 

financial system that it evaluates--will and should evolve as we continue to learn from 

experience in the management of this tool.  In the best traditions of the Federal Reserve, 

this evolution should be grounded in rigorous analysis of the facts and a commitment to 

continual improvement of our methods. 

In my remarks today, I will begin with what has been successful about the stress 

tests and why those elements should remain.  I will then spend some time discussing 

some of the changes we have proposed to our stress testing program, and how we are 

now thinking about moving forward with those changes.  After that, I will discuss the 

tension between, on the one hand, providing additional information to the firms, while, 

on the other hand, ensuring that the tests remain effective.  And last, I will close with 

some thoughts on the “qualitative” element of our stress testing program. 

The adjustments I will discuss are intended to increase both the transparency and 

the efficiency of the stress testing regime.  Enhanced transparency goes to the very core 

of democratic accountability and the rights of all U.S. citizens--including the 

management and shareholders of the institutions that are subject to the stress tests--to 

understand the requirements to which they are subject. It also helps ensure the continued 

credibility of our regime. 

Background 

Let me begin with a short discussion of the core elements of our stress testing 

program.  As you know, one of the most visible aspects of our stress testing program is
