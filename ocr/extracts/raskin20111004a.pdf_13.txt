Conclusion 

The period since the onset of the financial crisis has been described as one of the 

worst economic episodes since the Great Depression, which was another time of 

tremendous strain on the housing market.  House prices declined about 30 percent from 

peak to trough, and the homeownership rate, as recorded by the decennial census, fell 

from 48 percent in 1930 to 44 percent in 1940.  Nonfarm mortgage foreclosures reached a 

thousand per day in 1933, and, in fact, foreclosures were so widespread that 28 states 

imposed foreclosure moratoriums.  Mortgage lending was disrupted, and private 

mortgage insurance companies and private mortgage securitization collapsed. 

One factor in the upheaval in mortgage lending was the mortgage contract.  

Before the Great Depression, the long-term fully amortized contract had not yet been 

widely adopted.  Instead, one common contract featured a short maturity, generally five 

years or less, and often did not call for any regular payments on the principal.  A 

borrower was likely to default at the end of the loan term if he was not able to roll over 

the loan or obtain a new loan to pay off the existing balance.  This contract also made it 

difficult to assess the health of financial institutions, as lenders booked the loans as

 See Disclosure of Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 4489 (Jan. 26, 2011) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 

229, 232, 240, and 249).  In addition, the risk retention requirements of section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are also important to a comprehensive effort to align 

incentives in the securitization markets in order to promote sound underwriting.  By requiring securitizers 

to retain a share of the economic risk in the mortgages they securitize from the outset of the transaction, the 

requirement creates incentives for securitizers to better monitor the credit quality of assets they securitize 

and ultimately discourages unsafe and unsound underwriting practices by originators.
