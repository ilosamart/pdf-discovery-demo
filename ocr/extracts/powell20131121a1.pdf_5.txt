improve transparency, which is important in reducing incentives for market participants 

to pull away from other institutions in times of stress.  Rather than trying to assess its 

exposure to all of its trading partners, a market participant would need to manage only its 

exposure to the central counterparty.  And CCPs can also reduce risk by imposing more 

effective risk controls on clearing members.  Since their origins in the 19th century, CCPs 

have evolved significantly, and that evolution has allowed them to survive and continue 

functioning through many crises, including the most recent one.5 

Of course, the other side of this coin is that concentrating risk in a central 

counterparty could create a single point of failure for the entire system.  Given their 

heightened prominence in the financial infrastructure, if CCPs are to mitigate systemic 

risks they must hold themselves to--and be held to--the highest standards of risk 

management.  In many respects, CCPs are the collective reflection of the financial 

institutions that are their members and the markets that they support.  The credit and 

liquidity risks borne by a CCP arise from the clearing activities of its members.  Those 

risks materialize when a clearing member defaults.  Most of the financial resources to 

cover risk exposures will come from a CCP’s members.  And a member’s default will 

require the CCP to work with surviving members in the context of prevailing market 

conditions.  CCPs play a critical role in ensuring a robust risk management regime that 

fully takes account of this interplay among markets, institutions, and infrastructure.  

Regulators, clearing members, and their clients also must be engaged in making sure
