and duplicative process whereby the Basel Committee, the FSB, and some other BIS committees 

are all involved in the same subjects.   

Fortunately, the agenda breaks down rather naturally into the new substantive topics, 

such as resolution and OTC derivatives, and the further refinement and implementation of 

established regulatory areas such as capital standards.  The new topics play to the coordinating 

and gap-filling strengths of the FSB, which includes both regulators and finance ministry 

representatives, and which can parcel out appropriate components of larger projects to standard-

setting committees.  Work in established regulatory areas obviously falls more appropriately 

within the province of the Basel Committee (or with respect to some securities regulatory issues, 

IOSCO), which consists of the regulators with responsibility for administering these standards 

domestically.  In this regard, it is important that the independence of regulators established 

domestically also be respected internationally.   

Conclusion 

The international dimension of financial regulation has grown even more important since 

the financial crisis.  Yet there are, as I have suggested, more subjects to be tackled.  At the same 

time, the pursuit of efficient and effective regulation requires priority-setting by, and 

rationalization of, the web of international arrangements dealing with these issues.
