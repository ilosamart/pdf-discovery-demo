Let me take an example that may be of particular relevance to many of you here tonight:  

our Regional Consultative Groups or RCGs.  These are six groups around the globe--the 

Americas, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Commonwealth of 

Independent States, and Asia--that bring together FSB members with about 70 additional 

jurisdictions.  These groups help the FSB get broader input into its policy development and 

improve our outreach efforts.  Each RCG meets once or twice a year to discuss policy 

development, regional and global financial vulnerabilities, and other current topics of particular 

interest to the respective region.  For instance, topics discussed at the last meeting in Asia 

included capital flow volatility, cyber resilience of financial institutions, and fintech.  

These RCGs are great in concept, but they have struggled in practice.  We have already 

begun a study to look back at how the RCGs have operated since their creation in 2011, how 

they interact with the FSB, and what best practices have been learned.  Even while that study is 

underway, I am committed to improving our mechanisms for reaching out to countries outside 

the FSB for genuine learning about the effects of FSB actions.  I plan to attend a number of RCG 

meetings each year because of the importance I place on making sure these groups are truly 

useful tools, and we will improve these vital conduits of two-way information in order to 

improve our effectiveness and our transparency. 

While the RCGs may be of particular interest to some here tonight, they are just the tip of 

the iceberg for what we have to do to improve our engagement and outreach.  Because the FSB’s 

authority is ultimately derived from the people and from the political power given to authorities 

in their countries, we have a responsibility to seek input from and to provide information about 

our deliberations and actions to the broader public.  To that end, for the first time in the FSB’s
