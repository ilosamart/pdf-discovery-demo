I want to emphasize that this focus on core and other inflation measures that may 

exclude recent increases in the cost of gasoline and other household essentials is not 

intended to downplay the importance of these items in the cost of living or to lower the 

bar on the definition of price stability.  The Federal Reserve aims to stabilize inflation 

across the entire basket of goods and services that households purchase, including energy 

and food.  Rather, we pay attention to core inflation and similar measures because, in 

light of the volatility of food and energy prices, core inflation has been a better forecaster 

of overall inflation in the medium term than overall inflation itself has been over the past 

25 years.3  

In my view, the marked decline in these trend measures of inflation since the 

intensification of the crisis largely reflects very low rates of resource utilization.  Strong 

productivity gains have also played a role in holding down inflation because, together 

with low wage inflation, they have markedly restrained the rise in firmsâ€™ production 

costs.  With resource slack likely to diminish only gradually over the next few years, it 

seems reasonable to anticipate that underlying inflation will remain subdued for some 

time, provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.   

Longer-Run Inflation Expectations 

In this regard, surveys and financial market data indicate that longer-run inflation 

expectations remain reasonably well anchored even though near-term inflation 

expectations have jumped in the wake of the surge in commodity prices.  For example, 

the Thomson Reuters/ University of Michigan Survey of Consumers indicates that 

median inflation expectations for the coming year moved up about 1-1/4 percentage 

                                                 
3   Overall inflation and core inflation regularly deviate from one another.  When this has occurred over the 
past 25 years, the tendency has been for overall inflation to subsequently converge to core inflation, and not 
the other way around.
