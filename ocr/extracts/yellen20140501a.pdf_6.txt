Improving Our Understanding of Community Banks 

In carefully considering how our actions affect community banks, the Federal Reserve is 

committed to understanding your institutions and the challenges you face.  We continue to try to 

improve that understanding in two important ways--research and outreach.  The Fed is uniquely 

positioned to employ these two methods because of our traditional strength as a research 

institution and because of our structure, with Reserve Banks that have deep roots in communities 

in every region of the country.  

In the past several years, research staff across the Federal Reserve System who were 

independently exploring issues related to community banking have developed an informal 

network to share findings and identify areas for further research.  After some of the fruits of this 

effort were shared with the Board, we decided to join with the Conference of State Bank 

Supervisors (CSBS) to host a research and policy conference focused on community banks.  This 

conference, “Community Banking in the 21st Century,” was held in October 2013 at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of St. Louis.6   It was one of very few research conferences to focus specifically 

on community banks and also brought together researchers, community bankers, policymakers, 

and bank supervisors to discuss the practical implications of the papers presented.   

Among the topics that researchers addressed in their papers were the link between bank 

failures and local economic performance,7 the role of management in the performance of
