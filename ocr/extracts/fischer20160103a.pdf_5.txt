and generally short lived.9 The past several years certainly require us to reconsider that 

basic assumption.  

Moreover, the experience of the past several years in the United States and many 

other countries has taught us that conducting monetary policy effectively at the ZLB is 

challenging, to say the least.10 And while unconventional policy tools such as forward 

guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful, there are many uncertainties 

associated with the use of such tools.11

I would note in passing that one possible concern about our unconventional 

policies has eased recently, as the Federal Reserve’s normalization tools proved effective 

in raising the federal funds rate following our December meeting.  Of course, issues may 

yet arise during normalization that could call for adjustments to our tools, and we stand 

ready to do that.  

The answer to the question “Will r* remain at today’s low levels permanently?” is 

that we do not know.  Many of the factors that determine r*, particularly productivity 

growth, are extremely difficult to forecast.  At present, it looks likely that r* will remain 

low for the policy-relevant future, but there have in the past been both long swings and 

short-term changes in what can be thought of as equilibrium real rates  Eventually, 

history will give the answer.  

But it is critical to emphasize that history’s answer will depend also on future 

policies, monetary and other, notably including fiscal policy.
