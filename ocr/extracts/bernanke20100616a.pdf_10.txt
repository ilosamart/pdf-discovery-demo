financial distress, and in some cases could lead firms to simplify their internal structures.  

While these contingency plans might not actually serve as templates for the resolution of 

firms that reach the brink of failure, the preparation and periodic review of the plans 

could be a valuable supervisory tool in preparing firms to withstand distress.
