It is good to be here in Cincinnati.  I want to thank my colleague, Loretta Mester, 

for inviting me to participate today, and it is a pleasure to participate in the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Policy Summit.1 

Today’s session is part of a series called Fed Listens.  The Federal Reserve is 

reaching out to communities around the country to hear how Americans are experiencing 

the economy day to day and to make sure we are carrying out the monetary policy goals 

assigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can.2   

The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve 

maximum employment and price stability.  These two goals are what we refer to as our 

dual mandate.  By price stability, we mean moderate and stable inflation.  The Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC)—the group at the Fed responsible for determining 

monetary policy—has announced that our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent over 

time.  The maximum-employment part of our dual mandate means that the Congress has 

directed us to achieve the highest level of employment that is consistent with 

price stability. 

The Outlook 

Earlier this week, President Mester and I participated in the meeting of the 

FOMC, where we had the opportunity to share our views on the economy and policy.
