stands.  As a result, and as I described in a recent speech, my colleagues and I consider a 

wide range of information when assessing that rate.2  As I will discuss, our assessments 

of the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years.   

In the Committee’s most recent projections last December, most FOMC 

participants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in 

the vicinity of 1 percent.3  This level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in 

part, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States, but 

also in many advanced economies.  Moreover, the current value of the neutral real 

federal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several 

additional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as 

subdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of 

households and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession.   

It is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of 

the effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are 

subject to a great deal of uncertainty.  Some recent estimates of the current value of the 

neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent.4  With the actual value of the 

real federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near-zero estimate of the neutral 

real rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative, 

an assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a 

pace--around 180,000 net new jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated

3 This estimate of the neutral real federal funds rate is based on the difference between the medians of the 
longer-run projections for the federal funds rate and inflation submitted by individual FOMC participants 
for the December 2016 FOMC meeting.  The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum 
to the minutes of that meeting, is available on the Board’s website at
