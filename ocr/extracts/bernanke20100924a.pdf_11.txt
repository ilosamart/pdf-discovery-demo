on the contract (whether explicit or implicit) between the principal and the agent, and, in 

particular, on the incentives that the contract provides the agent.  

Poorly structured incentives were pervasive in the crisis.  For example, 

compensation practices at financial institutions, which often tied bonuses to short-term 

results and made insufficient adjustments for risk, contributed to an environment in 

which both top managers and lower-level employees, such as traders and loan officers, 

took excessive risks.  Serious problems with the structure of incentives also emerged in 

the application of the so-called originate-to-distribute model to subprime mortgages.  To 

satisfy the strong demand for securitized products, both mortgage lenders and those who 

packaged the loans for sale to investors were compensated primarily on the quantity of 

“product” they moved through the system.  As a result, they paid less attention to credit 

quality and many loans were made without sufficient documentation or care in 

underwriting.  Conflicts of interest at credit agencies, which were supposed to serve 

investors but had incentives to help issuers of securities obtain high credit ratings, are 

another example.   

Consistent with key aspects of research in information economics, the public 

policy responses to these problems have focused on improving market participants’ 

incentives.  For example, to address problems with compensation practices, the Federal 

Reserve, in conjunction with other supervisory agencies, has subjected compensation 

practices of banking institutions to supervisory review.  The interagency supervisory 

guidance supports compensation practices that induce employees to take a longer-term 

perspective, such as paying part of employees’ compensation in stock that vests based on 

sustained strong performance.  To ameliorate the problems with the originate-to-
