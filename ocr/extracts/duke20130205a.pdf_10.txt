 After categorizing the banks, the first phase of analysis looked at the location and size of 

the thriving banks.  Thriving banks were found in 40 of the 50 states but were concentrated in 

states with larger economic contributions from agriculture and energy, which held up relatively 

well during the downturn.  The fewest thriving banks were found on the West Coast and in the 

Southeast, where real estate values fell the most.  This pattern is consistent with previous Federal 

Reserve studies, which found that bank performance is heavily affected by the local economy, 

but I think it is important to note that even in states with high unemployment rates or sharp 

declines in property values, some community banks were able to thrive. 

The St. Louis study did not find the thriving banks to be concentrated in any particular 

size range.  Many had total assets less than $50 million as of December 2011, but others had total 

assets between $1 billion and $10 billion.  And thriving banks did more than just rate well with 

supervisors--the thriving banks outperformed the surviving banks on a wide range of 

performance indicators, including return on assets, return on equity, loan losses, provision 

expense, efficiency ratio, asset growth, net interest margin, and net noninterest margin.  

 Looking at balance sheet structure, when the researchers compared the characteristics of 

thriving banks with surviving banks, they found that the thriving banks had lower levels of loans-

to-total-assets and were more reliant on core deposits.  Thriving banks also had lower 

concentrations in commercial real estate (CRE) lending and much lower concentrations in 

construction and land development loans.  Instead, thriving banks were slightly more 

concentrated in one- to four-family mortgage loans held in portfolio, as well as consumer loans.  

Despite these overall balance sheet findings, the researchers also noted the wide diversity of 

business models that they found among the thriving banks.
