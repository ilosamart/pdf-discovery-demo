authorities need in order to effectively resolve a CCP, the potential incentives related to using 

various loss-allocation tools in resolution, the application of the “no creditor worse off” 

safeguard, and the formation of crisis management groups--a key step in facilitating cross-border 

regulatory coordination in the event of a failure of a systemically important CCP. 

Ensuring the safety of the system also requires an understanding of the interdependencies 

between CCPs and their clearing members.  Work on this is ongoing.  Preliminary analysis 

confirms that there are large interdependencies between banks and CCPs, including common 

exposures related to financial resources held to cover market and credit risk, as well as common 

lending and funding arrangements. 

 Having pushed for the move to greater central clearing, global authorities have a 

responsibility to ensure that CCPs do not themselves become a point of failure for the system.  

The progress I have just described is helping to meet this responsibility by making central 

clearing safer and more robust.  Global authorities also have a responsibility to ensure that bank 

capital standards and other policies do not unnecessarily discourage central clearing.  In my 

view, the calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for the U.S. global 

systemically important banks (G-SIBs) should be reconsidered from this perspective.  A risk-

insensitive leverage ratio can be a useful backstop to risk-based capital requirements.  But such a 

ratio can have perverse incentives if it is the binding capital requirement because it treats 

relatively safe activities, such as central clearing, as equivalent to the most risky activities.  There 

are several potential approaches to addressing this issue.  For example, the BCBS is currently 

considering a proposal that would set a G-SIB’s SLR surcharge at a level that is proportional to 

the G-SIB’s risk-based capital surcharge.  Taking this approach in the U.S. context could help to 

reduce the cost that the largest banks face in offering clearing services to their customers.
