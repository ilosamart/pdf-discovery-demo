Reserve’s financial statements, though they contain very large numbers, are relatively 

straightforward--much simpler than those of a typical regional bank.   

The Fed’s operations, including its role regulating and supervising banks, are 

subject to extensive review by the GAO.  If you visit the GAO’s website, you’ll find 

more than 70 reports since the crisis that are wholly or partly dedicated to reviewing the 

Fed’s operations, including the emergency lending facilities I mentioned earlier.12  The 

GAO works closely with the Fed’s Office of Inspector General, which is involved in both 

financial audits and other oversight of our operations. 

The extensive oversight I describe intensified--appropriately so--as the Federal 

Reserve responded to the financial crisis.  Our lending facilities were also the subject of 

review by the Fed’s Inspector General, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled 

Asset Relief Program, the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry 

Commission established by the Congress, and numerous congressional hearings and 

reviews. 

The Fed’s actions were also fully transparent.  As always, monetary policy 

decisions were debated and voted on by the FOMC and announced immediately, with 

detailed explanations provided in the minutes of these deliberations.  The Fed provided 

public guidance on its plans to purchase assets and made those purchases in open, 

competitive transactions that were disclosed as soon as they occurred.  

The terms and conditions for every lending facility were publicly disclosed.  The 

amounts lent under each program were published on the Fed’s weekly balance sheet 

12 The reports are available on the GAO’s website, www.gao.gov.
