interest earnings we send the Treasury and because a stronger economy tends to lead to 

higher tax revenues and reduced government spending (on unemployment benefits, for 

example). 

 Even though our activities are likely to result in a lower national debt over the 

long term, I sometimes hear the complaint that the Federal Reserve is enabling bad fiscal 

policy by keeping interest rates very low and thereby making it cheaper for the federal 

government to borrow.  I find this argument unpersuasive.  The responsibility for fiscal 

policy lies squarely with the Administration and the Congress.  At the Federal Reserve, 

we implement policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as the law 

under which we operate requires.  Using monetary policy to try to influence the political 

debate on the budget would be highly inappropriate.  For what it’s worth, I think the 

strategy would also likely be ineffective:  Suppose, notwithstanding our legal mandate, 

the Federal Reserve were to raise interest rates for the purpose of making it more 

expensive for the government to borrow.  Such an action would substantially increase the 

deficit, not only because of higher interest rates, but also because the weaker recovery 

that would result from premature monetary tightening would further widen the gap 

between spending and revenues.  Would such a step lead to better fiscal outcomes?  It 

seems likely that a significant widening of the deficit--which would make the needed 

fiscal actions even more difficult and painful--would worsen rather than improve the 

prospects for a comprehensive fiscal solution. 

 I certainly don’t underestimate the challenges that fiscal policymakers face.  They 

must find ways to put the federal budget on a sustainable path, but not so abruptly as to 

endanger the economic recovery in the near term.  In particular, the Congress and the
