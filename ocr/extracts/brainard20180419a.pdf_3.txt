we may soon be approaching, there have been heightened risks either of inflation, in earlier 

decades, or of financial imbalances more recently. 

Currently, inflation appears to be well-anchored to the upside around our 2 percent target, 

but there are some signs of financial imbalances.  Our scan of financial vulnerabilities suggests 

elevated risks in two areas:  asset valuations and business leverage.  First, asset valuations across 

a range of markets remain elevated relative to a variety of historical norms, even after taking into 

account recent market volatility.  Corporate bond yields remain low by historical comparison, 

and spreads of yields on junk bonds above those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities are 

near the lower end of their historical range.  Spreads on leveraged loans and securitized products 

backed by those loans remain narrow.  Prices of multifamily residential and industrial 

commercial real estate (CRE) have risen, while capitalization rates for these segments have 

reached historical lows.   

Second, business leverage outside the financial sector has risen to levels that are high 

relative to historical trends. In the nonfinancial business sector, the debt-to-income ratio has 

increased to near the upper end of its historical distribution, and net leverage at speculative-grade 

firms is especially elevated.  As we have seen in previous cycles, unexpected negative shocks to 

earnings in combination with increased interest rates could lead to rising levels of delinquencies 

among business borrowers and related stresses to some banksâ€™ balance sheets. 

Safeguarding Resilience through the Cycle 

We continue to assess the overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to be 

moderate by historical standards in great measure because post-crisis reforms have strengthened 

the regulatory and supervisory framework for the largest U.S. banking firms.  The crisis revealed 

a stark weakness in the capital and liquidity positions of many of our large banking organizations
