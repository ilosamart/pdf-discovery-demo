Recent Economic Developments 

As you know, in late 2007 the financial crisis triggered a severe downturn in the 

U.S. economy.  The recovery from what has been referred to as the “Great Recession” 

officially began in the third quarter of 2009, but the pace of economic growth since then 

has been modest relative to the type of cyclical rebound that we had experienced in the 

prior 60 years.  In part, this modest pace of the expansion to date reflects the extent to 

which the effects of the global financial crisis on financial markets and financial 

institutions--and hence on the flow of credit to households and businesses--have been 

slow to unwind.   

The recession’s toll on households and businesses was enormous:  Between 

January 2008 and February 2010, we lost 8-3/4 million nonfarm payroll jobs and saw the 

unemployment rate double, from roughly 5 percent to around 10 percent.  Real gross 

domestic product (GDP) dropped 5 percent between its pre-recession peak in the fourth 

quarter of 2007 and the trough in the second quarter of 2009; the drop in real disposable 

personal income was similar in magnitude.  In addition, households lost an estimated 

$7 trillion in home equity--half of the aggregate home equity that existed in early 2006.   

The economic recovery is now about 2-1/2 years old, but only in mid-2011 did 

the level of real GDP return to its level just prior to the recession.  Perhaps more 

troubling is that real disposable personal income at the end of 2011 was still estimated to 

be lower than its pre-recession level.  As of January of this year, we had recovered just 

over one-third of the payroll jobs we lost, and the unemployment rate was still elevated at
