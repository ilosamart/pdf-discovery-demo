While the labor market has shown steady improvement over the past decade, the 

post-crisis performance of gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been more 

disappointing, averaging just 2 percent per year over the past seven years.  However, 

beginning with the second quarter of last year, growth has shown some momentum.  Over 

the past three quarters of 2017, real GDP increased at an average rate of almost 3 percent.

the pre-crisis period, one area that continues to lag is productivity growth, a condition 

that has been common across the advanced economies.  Beginning in 2011, the annual 

growth rate of labor productivity has averaged only 3/4 percent, compared with an
