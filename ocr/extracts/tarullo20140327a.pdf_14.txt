consolidated prudential regulation even were they to divest their insured depository institutions 

and, second, by giving the Financial Stability Oversight Council the authority to designate other 

financial firms as systemically important, a step that would place them under Federal Reserve 

regulation and supervision.  Dodd-Frank further required the Federal Reserve to apply 

progressively more stringent prudential regulation to bank holding companies with more than 

$50 billion in assets. 

Congress also required the Federal Reserve to apply special prudential standards to large 

FBOs.  As I have already implied, much of what we have done is simply to catch up to EU and 

U.K. practice.  Under our recently finalized Section 165 enhanced prudential standards 

regulation, an FBO with U.S. non-branch assets of $50 billion or more must hold its U.S. 

subsidiaries under an intermediate holding company (IHC), which must meet the risk-based and 

leverage capital standards generally applicable to bank holding companies under U.S. 

law.

  Such an FBO must also certify that it meets consolidated capital adequacy standards 

established by its home-country supervisor that are consistent with the Basel Capital Framework.  

FBOs with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must also meet liquidity risk-

management standards and conduct internal liquidity stress tests.  The IHC must maintain a 

liquidity buffer in the United States for a 30-day liquidity stress test.  The U.S. branches and 

agencies of an FBO must maintain a liquidity buffer in the United States equal to the liquidity 

needs for 14 days, as determined by a 30-day liquidity stress test.

  The IHCs of FBOs must also 

conform to certain risk-management and supervisory requirements at the IHC level.

 Actually, FBOs need not meet advanced approach risk-based capital requirements in the United States, unless 

they specifically opt in to that treatment.  See www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140218a.htm.

 An FBO with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more but with combined U.S. assets of less than $50 

billion must report the results of an internal liquidity stress test (either on a consolidated basis or for its combined 

U.S. operations) to the Board on an annual basis.
