have to cut policy rates in response to an economic downturn, easing the conduct of 

conventional policy.  

Conclusion 

So where does this discussion leave us?  My assessment of the current state of the 

economy is optimistic.  I also think there is a real possibility that some of the factors that 

have been holding back growth in recent years could shift, moving the economy onto a 

higher growth trajectory.  That said, I currently see this shift more as a clear possibility 

than an unarguable reality.  Importantly, we have not yet seen any sustained pickup in 

productivity growth.  However, given that conditions could shift, it is fair to ask what a 

higher growth path might mean.  As I discussed, it could mean a higher natural interest 

rate, which would increase the amount of accommodation provided at a given level of the 

Federal Reserveâ€™s policy interest rate.  But what would it imply about the appropriate 

stance of policy? 

It goes without saying, but always bears repeating, that at the Federal Reserve we 

are very focused on meeting our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and 

price stability.  In assessing the effect of higher growth on monetary policy, I will be 

carefully watching how that growth aligns with our dual mandate. 

It might seem reasonable to assume that faster growth would lead to firmer 

inflation.  However, I think a lot remains to be seen.  For one, the degree to which growth 

spurs inflation is likely to be determined by the underlying factors that are prompting the 

increase in growth.  A demand-led increase can be expected to have a greater positive 

effect on prices than a step-up in the pace of potential growth.  Growth led by an increase
