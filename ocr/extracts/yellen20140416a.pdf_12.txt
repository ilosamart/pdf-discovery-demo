that buffeted the economy during that period.  Many studies confirmed that the 

appropriate response of policy to those shocks could be described with a fair degree of 

accuracy by a simple rule linking the federal funds rate to the shortfall or excess of 

employment and inflation relative to their desired values.17  The famous Taylor rule 

provides one such formula.18   

The idea that monetary policy should react in a systematic manner in order to 

blunt the effects of shocks has remained central in the FOMC’s policymaking during this 

recovery.  However, the application of this idea has been more challenging.  With the 

federal funds rate pinned near zero, the FOMC has been forced to rely on two less 

familiar policy tools--the first one being forward guidance regarding the future setting of 

the federal funds rate and the second being large-scale asset purchases.  There are no 

time-tested guidelines for how these tools should be adjusted in response to changes in 

the outlook.  As the episodes recounted earlier illustrate, the FOMC has continued to try 

to adjust its policy tools in a systematic manner in response to new information about the 

economy.  But because both the tools and the economic conditions have been unfamiliar, 

it has also been critical that the FOMC communicate how it expects to deploy its tools in 

response to material changes in the outlook.   

Let me review some important elements in the evolution of the FOMC’s 

communication framework.  When the FOMC initially began using its unconventional 

tools, policy communication was relatively simple.  In December 2008, for example, the
