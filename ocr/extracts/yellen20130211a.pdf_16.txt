the outlook for the labor market.  The Committee currently intends to purchase MBS and 

Treasury debt at a pace that will add about $85 billion per month of such securities to the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of these 

purchases over time, the Committee will also take into account ongoing assessments of 

their efficacy and costs.    

The second unconventional policy tool that the FOMC has used is forward 

guidance, in the form of more-explicit and more-detailed information about the future 

path of monetary policy.  The longer-term interest rates that most profoundly influence 

housing demand, capital spending, and asset prices depend on current and expected 

future levels of short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate that has been the 

Fed’s conventional monetary policy tool.  Signaling the future path of the federal funds 

rate can therefore directly affect interest rates today on auto loans, home mortgages, and 

bonds issued by companies and state and local governments, even when the current level 

of the federal funds rate cannot be lowered. 

The FOMC has substantially expanded its forward guidance in recent years.  In 

2009, the Committee stated that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally 

low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”15  In 2011, the FOMC said 

this period would likely last “at least through mid-2013,” and extended this date guidance 

several times.16
