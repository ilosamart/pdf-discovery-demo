effective lower bound, above the rate necessary to bring the economy back to potential.5  

Relatedly, but more broadly, low equilibrium interest rates are a key pillar of the secular 

stagnation hypothesis, which Larry Summers has carried forward during the past few 

years.6  Second, a low natural rate could potentially hurt financial stability if it leads 

investors to reach for yield or hurts financial firms’ profitability.  And, third--and perhaps 

most troubling--a low equilibrium rate sends a powerful signal that the growth potential 

of the economy may be limited.7 

Slow trend growth 

One factor contributing to low equilibrium interest rates in the United States has 

been a slowdown in the pace of potential, or trend, growth.  According to the 

Congressional Budget Office (CBO), real potential growth in the United States is 

currently around 1.5 percent, compared with a pace about double that, on average, in the 

two decades leading up to the financial crisis.  A prime culprit in the growth slowdown 

has been the slow rate of labor productivity growth, which has increased only 1/2 percent, 

on average, over the past five years, compared with a 2 percent growth rate over the 

period from 1976 to 2005.8  A declining rate of labor force growth has also worked to 

push down trend growth.  The CBO is projecting that the potential labor force in the 

                                                 
5 In chapter 23, p. 353, Keynes includes an interesting discussion of the “strange, unduly neglected prophet 
Silvio Gesell (1862-1930), whose work contains flashes of deep insight and who only just failed to reach 
down to the essence of the matter.”  He adds that Gesell was a successful German merchant in Buenos 
Aires.  See Keynes (1936).     
6 See Summers (2014, 2015, 2016).  
7 See Fischer (2016a) for a fuller discussion of the risks associated with a low equilibrium interest rate.  
8 See Irwin (2017) for an examination of an alternative pattern of causality, where slow growth--and, in 
particular, weak wage growth--has led to low productivity growth rather than vice versa.  
     I should also remind the reader of Herbert Stein’s observation that the difference between a growth rate 
of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.
