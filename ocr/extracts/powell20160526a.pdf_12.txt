to see a significant strengthening in growth in the second quarter after the apparent 

softness of the past two quarters.  To support this growth narrative, I also expect the 

ongoing healing process in labor markets to continue, with strong job growth, further 

reductions in headline unemployment and other measures of slack, and increases in wage 

inflation.  As the economy tightens, I expect that inflation will continue to move over 

time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.   

If incoming data continue to support those expectations, I would see it as 

appropriate to continue to gradually raise the federal funds rate.  Depending on the 

incoming data and the evolving risks, another rate increase may be appropriate fairly 

soon.  Several factors suggest that the pace of rate increases should be gradual, including 

the asymmetry of risks at the zero lower bound, downside risks from weak global 

demand and geopolitical events, a lower long-run neutral federal funds rate, and the 

apparently elevated sensitivity of financial conditions to monetary policy.  Uncertainty 

about the location of supply-side constraints provides another reason for gradualism.   

There are potential concerns with such a gradual approach.  It is possible that 

monetary policy could push resource utilization too high, and that inflation would move 

temporarily above target.  In an era of anchored inflation expectations, undershooting the 

natural rate of unemployment should result in only a small and temporary increase in the 

inflation rate.15  But running the economy above its potential growth rate for an extended 

period could involve significant risks even if inflation does not move meaningfully above 

target.  A long period of very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking and,
