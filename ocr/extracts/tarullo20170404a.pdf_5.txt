Dodd-Frank Act does give regulators authority to require divestitures by firms posing risks to 

financial stability.  But these authorities, which contain only the most general of standards, seem 

intended to be used only if the panoply of other measures in the legislation have failed to contain 

the too-big-to-fail problem. 

 Thus, at least in the first instance, the Dodd-Frank Act forgoes structural solutions, which 

might have been cleaner conceptually, but perhaps much more complicated as a practical matter.   

Instead, it imposes a host of restrictions and requirements.  So we have counterparty credit limits, 

risk retention requirements, incentive compensation constraints, resolution planning 

requirements, and others.  These new statutory measures were meant to, and do, coexist with the 

capital and liquidity requirements put in place by the banking agencies under their pre-existing 

authority, as enhanced by the Dodd-Frank Act.  An important corollary of this basic approach 

was that the Dodd-Frank Act requires that many of these regulations be progressively more 

stringent as applied to firms of greater systemic importance.   

 From this perspective, then, it is not surprising that the Dodd-Frank Act implementation 

has been a major undertaking, that banks (and sometimes supervisors) feel overwhelmed by the 

breadth of the resulting compliance effort, and that there is some overlap among some of the 

regulations.  This outcome was, in effect, the price of the largest banks not being subject to a 

direct structural solution such as breakup.  

  None of this is to say that the Dodd-Frank Act got the mix of restrictions just right.  To 

the contrary, it would have been surprising for such a major piece of legislation passed in the 

immediate aftermath of the crisis to have done so.  Usually, a law like the Dodd-Frank Act 

would have been followed some months later by another law denominated as containing 

technical corrections, but also usually containing some substantive changes deemed warranted by
