 In my home state of South Carolina, as in many parts of the country, the effects of 

the crisis varies from community to community.  For instance, the city of Charleston, a 

popular tourist destination known for its historic architecture and fine cuisine, is faring 

relatively well overall.  Even so, both unemployment and poverty in the greater 

Charleston area increased significantly between 2007 and 2009.4  Median income in the 

nearby city of North Charleston, which has struggled ever since a naval base closed in 

1996, is about three-fourths that of Charleston.  In some older neighborhoods, families 

have moved out, leaving behind many vacant properties.  Some parts of the metropolitan 

area are experiencing economic growth, but the benefits of that growth do not reach all 

communities.  While some major corporations have expanded into the area, inadequate 

education and training, as well as the lack of public transportation, make it difficult for 

many residents of low-income and minority communities to take advantage of new jobs.  

Local development groups have been working to ameliorate the situation.  For example, 

Metanoia CDC, a community development corporation, is located in the heart of the old 

naval communities of North Charleston, and its work has visibly improved the hardest hit 

communities.  Its holistic range of programs--in community leadership, quality affordable 

housing, and economic development--appears to be contributing to decreasing crime, 

rising student grades, and homes for first-time homebuyers.  The group focuses on 

building assets--both physical and human--such as transforming vacant buildings into 

                                                 
4 For the Metropolitan Statistical Area, the poverty rate increased from 12.5 percent to 15.6 percent 
between 2007 and 2009 (for one-year estimates, see U.S. Census Bureau (2007), American Community 
Survey (Washington:  Census Bureau); and U.S. Census Bureau (2009), American Community Survey 
(Washington:  Census Bureau)) The unemployment rate in the area rose from roughly 4.5 percent to about 
11 percent between December 2007 and June 2009 (Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics).
