support longer-run growth in productivity.  Policies to strengthen education, to encourage 

entrepreneurship and innovation, and to promote capital investment, both public and 

private, can all be of great benefit.  

It also is possible that a portion of the relatively weak productivity growth we 

have seen recently may be the result of the recession itself.8  Firms slashed their capital 

expenditures during the recession, and as I noted earlier, the increases in investment 

during the recovery have been modest.  In particular, investment in research and 

development has been relatively weak.  Moreover, a lack of financing may have impaired 

the ability of people to start new businesses and implement new ideas and technologies.  

As the economy strengthens further, many of these processes could work in reverse, 

boosting our productivity prospects.  To the extent this is so, Federal Reserve actions to 

strengthen the recovery may not only help bring our economy back to its productive 

potential, but it may also support the growth of productivity and living standards over the 

longer run.
