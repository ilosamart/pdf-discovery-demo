resolution authority of the foreign GSIB with assurance of U.S. financial stability if that strategy 

cannot be executed successfully.12 

Conclusion 

 My view of shared responsibility for overseeing international banks emphasizes the 

importance of financial stability even as it allows for benefits specific to international banking.  

For the reasons I have explained, in the end host countries need to make the judgments on the 

tradeoffs between these goals.  But I have also explained how a strong set of international 

prudential standards and good institutional relationships among regulators could help tilt this 

balance toward greater flexibility for internationally active banks. 

 In response to positions akin to what I have presented today, one often hears complaints 

that the emphasis on financial stability will result in the balkanization of international banking.  I 

would note first that it is not at all clear that developments since the crisis have on net balkanized 

banking, so much as shifted some international banking assets from the Organisation for 

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries whose banks were 

disproportionately affected by the financial crisis to banks from some emerging market and 

developing countries.13  This development probably reflects both needed changes in some of the 

OECD nation banks and a logical reflection of the increasing economic importance of the non-

OECD countries.   

 Second, I wonder how these critics can think that the pre-crisis situation of supposedly 

consolidated oversight and substantial bank flexibility was a desirable one.  At least some of the 

                                                 
12 Our internal TLAC proposal effects this balance principally by not including parent GSIB surcharges in the 
calibration for FBO intermediate holding companies but also by lowering the baseline TLAC requirement for U.S. 
intermediate holding company subsidiaries of single-point-of-entry strategy FBOs from 18 percent of risk-weighted 
assets to 16 percent of risk-weighted assets.
