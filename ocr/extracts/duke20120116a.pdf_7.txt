 The Federal Reserve was originally created to guard against financial panics.  But 

in modern times, many people think of monetary policymaking as its primary role.  The 

Congress has given the Federal Reserve two objectives, known as our dual mandate:  to 

foster maximum employment and price stability.  In its conduct of monetary policy, the 

Fed influences the level of output and the level of prices in the economy through changes

short-term interest rates.  Interest rates can be lowered to stimulate borrowing and 

spending when demand is otherwise weak, or raised to damp demand and curb inflation.

short-term interest rate lever was effectively at zero, we moved beyond traditional 

monetary policy to purchase longer-term assets and push down longer-term interest rates.  

Those purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates generally and
