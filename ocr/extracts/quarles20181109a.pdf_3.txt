that the firms and the public receive an independent view of the capital adequacy of the 

largest banks.  The results are based on our own models and provide a consistent 

yardstick to measure resiliency across the banking system. 

But the stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve is only one part of our stress 

testing regime.  Just as important, we require each firm to run its own stress test, using its 

own models and a stressful scenario that reflects the firm’s assessment of its idiosyncratic 

risks and key vulnerabilities.  Underpinning a firm’s stress test is the firm’s ability to 

identify and measure risks under normal and stressful conditions and the strength of the 

firm’s internal processes, and we use the supervisory process to ensure that the firms’ 

stress testing practices employ sound methodologies. 

The combination of the Federal Reserve’s common yardstick, the firm’s own 

stress tests, and supervisory oversight over the firms’ practices has resulted in a 

meaningful increase in the post-stress resiliency of large financial institutions.  All of 

these core components will remain in place. 

Further, the changes I’ll speak about today are not intended to alter materially the 

overall level of capital in the system or the stringency of the regime.  A healthy U.S. 

economy relies on a strong, well-capitalized banking system that can weather stressful 

events and continue lending to households and businesses.  The U.S. banking 

organizations subject to the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--

the Fed’s evaluation of capital adequacy for large holding companies--have increased the 

dollar amount of their common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital from around $500 billion in 

2009 to more than $1.2 trillion as of the second quarter of this year, and have more than 

doubled CET1 risk-based capital ratios from approximately 5 percent to over 12 percent 

over the same period. 

While the regime has been successful overall, I believe it is prudent to review all 

our practices to ensure that they are as efficient and transparent as possible and that they 

remain appropriate in light of changes in the industry that have been achieved.  For 

instance, as firms become more resilient, they may no longer need to build capital to 

support their current level of risk taking, but rather move into the mode of retaining the 

capital they have already built.  Firms have also significantly improved their risk
