will inevitably be buffeted by shocks that cannot be foreseen.  What is certain, however, 

is that the Committee will respond to changes in the outlook as needed to achieve its dual 

mandate.   

Turning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed.  In December, 

the FOMC anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag 

from lower prices for energy and imports.  But as those transitory effects faded, the 

Committee expected inflation to move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided 

the labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable.  This assessment 

still seems to me to be broadly correct.  PCE prices were up only 1 percent in February 

relative to a year earlier, held down by earlier declines in the price of oil.  In contrast, 

core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy components, was up 1.7 

percent in February on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in 

December.  But it is too early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable.  Even 

when measured on a 12-month basis, core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to 

quarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the 

coming months.  For these reasons, I continue to expect that overall PCE inflation for 

2016 as a whole will come in well below 2 percent but will then move back to 2 percent 

over the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy prices or the 

dollar.  This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation 

remaining reasonably well anchored.  It is still my judgment that inflation expectations 

are well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some 

indicators of expected inflation do concern me.
