The combination of these tools was effective in restoring financial stability.  The 

Great Recession that followed the crisis posed a new set of challenges.  Given the 

constraint imposed by the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate, the Federal

Large-scale asset purchases provided additional monetary accommodation by 

putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through a portfolio-balance 

channel.  First used in November 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

subsequently initiated a series of purchase programs during the next several years and, in 

September 2012, implemented an open-ended program that would continue until there 

was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  With evidence 

accumulating that the labor market is improving materially, the Committee has begun to 

scale back the rate of these purchases. 

The Committee’s forward guidance is also intended to put downward pressure on 

longer-term interest rates by influencing market expectations about the future path of 

short-term rates.  Initially, the Committee relied on date-based descriptions of the likely 

path of interest rate policy.  But in December 2012 the Committee shifted to quantitative, 

state-contingent guidance to provide greater clarity about the likely course of the federal 

funds rate under different paths for the economy.  At that time, the Committee indicated
