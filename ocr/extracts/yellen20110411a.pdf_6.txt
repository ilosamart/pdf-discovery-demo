transactions were the primary cause of rising commodity prices, we would expect to see 

mounting inventories of commodities as speculators hoarded such commodities, whereas 

in fact stocks of crude oil and agricultural products have generally been falling since last 

summer.2       

A third concern expressed by some observers is that the exceptionally low level of 

U.S. interest rates has translated into excessive monetary stimulus in the EMEs.  In 

particular, even though their economies have been expanding quite rapidly, many EMEs 

have been reluctant to raise their own interest rates because of concerns that higher rates 

could lead to further capital inflows and boost the value of their currencies.  Some argue 

that their disinclination to tighten monetary policy has in turn resulted in economic 

overheating that has generated further upward pressures on commodity prices.   

I do not think this explanation accounts for much of the surge in commodity 

prices, in part because I believe that the bulk of the rapid economic growth in EMEs 

mainly reflects fundamental improvements in productive capacity, as those countries 

become integrated into the global economy, rather than loose monetary policies.  

Irrespective of monetary conditions in the advanced foreign economies, it is clear that the 

monetary and fiscal authorities in the EMEs have a range of policy tools to address any 

potential for overheating in their economies if they choose to do so.  Indeed, in light of 

the relatively high levels of resource utilization and inflationary pressures that many 

EMEs face at present, monetary tightening and currency appreciation might well be 

appropriate for those economies.  


                                                 
2 Longer-dated futures suggest that the prices of some important commodities, such as cotton, are expected 
to fall or at least remain flat in coming years; there is little incentive to speculate in commodities whose 
prices are not expected to increase further.
