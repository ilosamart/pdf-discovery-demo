in Slide 9.  The figure is drawn from a recent study of 20 industrial countries by the 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) (Fatás and others, 2009) and replicated by Board 

staff.  The vertical axis of the figure shows the change in real (inflation-adjusted) house 

prices in each country from the fourth quarter of 2001 until the third quarter of 2006, a 

period that spans the sharpest period of price appreciation in most countries.  Countries 

represented by diamonds that are further “north” in Slide 9 had relatively greater house 

price appreciation over this period.  You can see from the figure that house price 

appreciation in the United States, though of course large in absolute terms, was actually 

less than that in the majority of countries in the sample. 

The horizontal axis of the figure, following the IMF study, shows the degree of 

monetary policy ease or tightness in each country, measured by the average deviation of 

policy in each country from the prescriptions of a standard version of the Taylor rule over 

the corresponding period.  Countries shown further to the left in the figure had more 

accommodative monetary policies over the period, relative to the predictions of the 

Taylor rule.  The United States is shown as having a relatively accommodative policy, as 

you can see; however, that conclusion is driven in part by the use of current rather than 

forecast inflation in the Taylor rule, the point I discussed earlier.  Interestingly, 

essentially all of these countries had monetary policies easier than that prescribed by the 

Taylor rule, as shown by the fact that every country is situated on or to the left of the 

vertical axis in the figure.17 

                                                       
17 Note that the figure ascribes different degrees of monetary ease to different countries within the euro 
area; although these countries share the common monetary policy of the European Central Bank, 
differences across countries in inflation and output gaps imply that the degree of policy accommodation 
relative to economic conditions in each country can differ.  In particular, holding constant the interest rate 
set by the European Central Bank, the Taylor rule will tend to impute easier monetary policies to countries 
with strong economies.  Of course, all else equal, a strong economy, even if its strength is unrelated to 
monetary policy, should experience more robust house prices.  Consequently, the relationship shown in
