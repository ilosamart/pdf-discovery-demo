time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed.  

While this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that 

over time may have increased the prevalence of part-time employment, I think some 

room remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves 

further.   

The pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator, 

albeit an imperfect one, of the degree of labor market slack.  Until recently labor 

compensation had grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2-1/2 

percent.  More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of 

average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business 

sector.  While it is too soon to conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will 

continue, a sustained pickup would likely signal a diminution of labor market slack.   

Turning to overall economic activity, U.S. economic output--as measured by 

inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a 

moderate pace, on balance, during the expansion.  Over the first three quarters of this 

year, real GDP is currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent, 

close to its average pace over the previous five years.  Many economic forecasters expect 

growth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.   

Growth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted 

more than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth 

over the past three quarters.  Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in 

U.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last 

year, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper.
