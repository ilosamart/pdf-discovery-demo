Atlanta found themselves overwhelmed by the sharp rise in unemployment, which 

highlighted the need for a better connected and stronger network of job training and 

placement services.  I recently spent time with these organizations, along with 

community members and some of our Atlanta staff, who have been working on the 

creation of the Metro Atlanta eXchange (or MAX) for Workforce Solutions, the region’s 

only comprehensive directory for workforce development services.   

Just as there is a connection between maximum employment and inclusive 

growth, so, too, there is an important connection between potential output and 

opportunity.  If there are large disparities in opportunity based on geography or race or 

gender, such that households’ enterprise, exertion, and investments are not rewarded 

commensurately, then families and small businesses will invest less in the future and 

potential growth will fall short.11  Indeed, one worrisome trend is the decline in the labor 

force participation of prime-age workers with less education, a trend that has been going 

on for decades among men and that has more recently begun to be mirrored in the 

participation rate of women.12  Understanding this growing detachment from work is 

important to improving both opportunity and potential growth.   

In visits to Detroit, Milwaukee, North St. Louis, and Baltimore, I have heard from 

residents and community organizations about the challenging barriers standing between 

the many workers seeking jobs and the many jobs seeking workers.  The local barriers 

separating jobs from job seekers can be as concrete as the physical isolation created by 

major traffic arteries or poorly designed transit systems.13  I have visited Los Angeles,
