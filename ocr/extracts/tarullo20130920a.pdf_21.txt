banking agencies included the countercyclical capital provision in the capital regulation 

to implement Basel III adopted this summer.  However, because it will not take effect in 

the United States until 2016 and because other regulatory and supervisory tasks created 

by Dodd-Frank and other initiatives need to be completed more quickly, we have not yet 

built out this tool through policy statements or other institutional steps.   

Fortunately, when we do turn to the countercyclical capital buffer, we should have 

the benefit of a good deal of thinking and experience by the Bank of England.  The 

setting of countercyclical capital buffers is now committed to the Financial Policy 

Committee (FPC) under the reorganization of regulatory functions effected in the United 

Kingdom on April 1, 2013.  The FPC is required to set forth a general statement of its 

policy and to make quarterly determinations of whether to impose or change a 

countercyclical buffer.

  I should note, however, that Parliament extended the 

countercyclical power beyond the broad measure in Basel III and also granted the FPC 

authority to direct increases in the risk-weights applicable to specific sectors judged to 

pose a risk to the financial system.  While bank regulators in the United States certainly 

have similar authority as part of our broad power to set capital requirements, we have not 

to date considered, much less adopted, any regulation along these lines. 

4.  High Priority to Developing Measures to Control the Structural Vulnerability 

Presented by Short-Term Wholesale Funding.  The shared vulnerabilities of large 

banking organizations as a whole are underscored by something omitted from Sir 

Andrew’s otherwise prescient speech: the potential for damaging fire sales, itself

 A draft policy statement was published even before the April 1, 2013, effective date of the new FPC 

authority.  See Bank of England (2013), “The Financial Policy Committee’s powers to supplement capital 

requirements,” (London, U.K.: Bank of England, January),
