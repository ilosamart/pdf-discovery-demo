participation.8  I should note that the Fed has neither the tools nor the mandate to directly 

address the forces that are holding back labor force participation.  We can contribute by 

fostering a strong labor market, in accordance with our mandate.  While it is not the Fed’s 

role to advocate particular labor force policies, I do want to put a spotlight on this 

important issue.  I strongly believe policies that bring prime-age workers into productive 

employment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or 

educational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our 

economy.   

The second factor accounting for the slowdown in GDP growth is the slower pace 

of labor productivity growth, or output per hour worked.  When measured annually, labor 

productivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five-year averages, we can see that from 

1975 through 2007, productivity growth averaged about 2 percent while fluctuating 

between about 1 and 4 percent (figure 10).  Since then, growth seems to have settled at 

the low end of that historical range.  Unlike the situation with labor force participation, 

the slowdown in productivity growth is also evident in most advanced economies, and the 

U.S. experience is roughly comparable to that of other countries.   

There is an ongoing debate over the causes and implications of this global 

slowdown in productivity growth.  Some argue that the rapid growth seen over much of 

the 20th century was historically anomalous, and that we are destined to return to the 

slower growth of centuries past.  Others are more optimistic that strong growth can 

return.
