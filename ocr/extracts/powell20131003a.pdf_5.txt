Lee and Williams find that proximity to a community bank increases the likelihood that a new 

small business uses bank credit to finance its operations.  Their findings support the importance 

of local knowledge and “soft information” that emerges from a bank’s relationship with its 

customers in underwriting loans to particularly opaque small businesses.   

DeYoung and his coauthors look at differences in loan default rates across community 

banks and find that banks in rural areas make loans that default less often than loans made by 

community banks in urban areas.  They also find that loans made outside of a bank’s local area 

default at higher rates than do local loans.  Both results can be interpreted as showing the value 

of banking relationships, because loans default less often in situations in which soft information 

is likely to be more available to the lender. 

If any doubt remains about the importance of community banks to local economies, the 

Kandrac paper looks at the extreme situation in which a community bank fails, and documents 

the subsequent harm to local economic growth resulting from that failure.  Of particular 

relevance to regulators, Kandrac points out that the effect of a bank’s failure on the local 

economy differs depending on the resolution method.  In particular, he finds that resolutions that 

include loss-sharing agreements tend to have smaller negative effects on local economic growth 

than resolutions that do not include such agreements; Kandrac attributes these differences to the 

greater harm done to banking relationships when there is no loss-sharing agreement. 

In another result, Kandrac finds that relationship lending appears to be stronger in local 

markets where banking competition is more intense.  This is a contribution to a substantial 

economic literature that has discussed whether there is a conflict between the desire of antitrust 

authorities to maintain competitive markets and the desire to foster productive long-term
