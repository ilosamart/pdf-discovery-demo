To those who may doubt that GAO investigations would be used by the Congress 

to try to influence monetary policy, let me briefly describe another proposal which 

envisions exactly that.  This bill would require the FOMC to carry out monetary policy 

according to a simple equation and require immediate congressional hearings and a GAO 

audit whenever monetary policy deviates from this equation.17  Simple policy rules of this 

nature are used by the FOMC and by central banks around the world as a guide to policy.  

No central bank applies them in such a mechanical fashion, and there is very little support 

among economists for doing so.18  Based on my own experience in business, in 

government service, and in life, I doubt that important decisions can be reduced 

ultimately to such an equation.  The most such a rule might do is get you 80 percent of 

the way there; that last 20 percent makes all the difference. 

Finally, there has been discussion in the Congress of imposing new restrictions on 

the ability of the Fed to respond as it did with liquidity facilities during the financial 

crisis.  Although I am not aware of a specific bill at this point, the idea is to limit the 

Fed’s authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, under which the Fed is 

empowered to lend “in unusual and exigent circumstances” to firms beyond banks for the 

purpose of containing a financial crisis.

18 As part of its ongoing Initiative on Global Markets (IGM) poll, the University of Chicago, Booth School 
of Business, asked 44 prominent economists to respond to the following statement:  “Legislation introduced 
in Congress would require the Federal Reserve to “submit to the appropriate congressional committees…a 
Directive Policy Rule,” which shall describe “the strategy or rule of the Federal Open Market Committee 
for the systematic quantitative adjustment of the Policy Instrument Target to respond to a change in the 
Intermediate Policy Inputs.” Should the Fed deviate from the rule, the Fed Chair would have to “testify 
before the appropriate congressional committees as to why the [rule]…is not in compliance.”  Enacting this 
provision would improve monetary policy outcomes in the U.S.”  None of the participants agreed with the 
statement, and almost all disagreed or strongly disagreed. The results of the poll are available on the Booth 
School’s IGM Forum website at www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-
results?SurveyID=SV_doNZ9FbNq7tDi97.
