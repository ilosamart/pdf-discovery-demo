Bilateral and Centrally Cleared Networks 


A. Fully Bilateral Network 



B. Centrally Cleared Network 




Note:  Panel A shows a bilateral network in the credit default swap (CDS) market for a single and highly traded CDS contract.  Panel B shows the hypothetical 

network that would exist if the contract were cleared through a single central counterparty.  In each panel, a red circle denotes a protection seller and a blue one 

denotes a protection buyer.  The size of the circle represents the amount of protection bought or sold.
