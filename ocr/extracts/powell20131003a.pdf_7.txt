Gilbert, Meyer, and Fuchs have completed two important studies on the experiences of 

community banks during the recent recession.  Their first paper looked at banks that thrived 

throughout that period of economic distress while the second paper, presented this morning, 

looks at community banks that endured some level of financial distress during the downturn but 

then recovered.  This research goes beyond statistical analysis to conduct interviews with a 

sample of bank presidents and CEOs to gain further insight into banks’ unique experiences in 

recent years.  They identify two paths to recovery from financial distress.  The first is a return to 

conservative underwriting practices and sound policies and practices, work that can provide a 

“road map” for community bankers to follow when confronted with the next--one hopes, less 

extreme--financial downturn.  The second path to recovery is a change of bank ownership or 

management. 

Consolidation among community banks has been a constant theme in recent decades, and 

the Ferrier and Yeager study yields some interesting results on the profitability of community 

bank acquisitions and reorganizations.  Their findings on bank acquisitions echo both the 

findings of DeYoung and his coauthors and the wisdom of many community bankers, namely 

that you increase your profits by sticking to what you know.  Post-acquisition performance of 

community banks is better, the closer the target bank is to the acquirer.  While more-distant 

acquisitions might lead to greater diversification benefits, these appear to be outweighed by the 

greater difficulties in managing the performance of two banks operating far apart from each 

other. 

I should note that these findings could conflict to some extent with the antitrust 

responsibilities of financial regulators and the Department of Justice.  While a merger with a 

crosstown rival might lead to the greatest efficiency gains, the Federal Reserve has a statutory
