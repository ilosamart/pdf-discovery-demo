transactions.  Since then, as it has become increasingly apparent that central banks can 

fulfill many functions, the number of central banks has expanded from 23 in 1920 to over 

160 currently.  And not only are there more central banks, but also the functions of 

central banks have continued to evolve. 

Until the Great Financial Crisis, both the practice and the theory of modern 

central banking revolved around the inflationary tendencies inherent in the conflict 

between the short- and long-run effects of monetary expansion and in the temptations of 

monetary financing of government spending.3  Taking into account the fact that many 

leading central banks have recently had to deal with below-target inflation, one would 

have to amend the previous sentence to say that the practice and the theory of modern 

central banking revolve around the benefits of keeping monetary policy independent of 

short-term political considerations--with respect to both the stabilization of the price level 

and the temptations of monetary financing of the budget. 

The earliest central banks provided financing for governments and helped develop 

the financial system, often by bringing order to the note issue.  As the practice of central 

banking developed during the 19th century, central banks took on the primary 

responsibility for protecting the stability of the financial system and the external value of 

the currency.  The mandate given to central banks in legislation passed in the 1930s and 

1940s typically included both monetary stability and the promotion of full employment 

and maximum output--and frequently other goals as well.

which was written for the conference celebrating the tercentenary of the Bank of England.  See Capie and 
others (1994).
