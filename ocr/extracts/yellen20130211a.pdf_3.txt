the previous 10 U.S. recessions, real GDP grew, on average, more than twice as fast--at a 

4.6 percent annual rate.3  So, why has the economy’s recovery from the Great Recession 

been so weak? 

The slow recovery was preceded, of course, by the deepest recession since the end 

of the Second World War.  The bursting of an unprecedented housing bubble, together 

with the financial crisis that followed, dealt a huge blow to demand.  These developments 

robbed homeowners of wealth built over a generation, impaired their access to credit, 

decimated retirement savings, and shattered the confidence of consumers.  Businesses 

slashed capital spending and payrolls, and real GDP contracted by 4.7 percent, more than 

twice the average for the 10 other recessions since World War II.  The Great Recession 

was also the longest postwar recession--it lasted 18 months, compared with an average of 

10 months for the others.   

The experience of the United States and other advanced economies suggests that 

deeper recessions are usually followed by stronger-than-average recoveries.  While it’s 

also true that longer recessions tend to result in weaker recoveries, even after accounting 

for this factor, this recovery has been significantly weaker than past experience would 

have predicted. 

The dashed line in exhibit 1 shows how real GDP would have been expected to 

increase in this recovery, based on the experience of the United States and other 

advanced economies and given the depth and duration of the Great Recession.4  The gap

periods following the 1957-58 and 1980 recessions, which included at least part of subsequent recessions. 
4 The results in the figure are derived from a model that relates GDP growth in recoveries to recession 
depth and duration.  See Greg Howard, Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2011), “Are Recoveries 
from Banking and Financial Crises Really So Different?” International Finance Discussion Papers 1037
