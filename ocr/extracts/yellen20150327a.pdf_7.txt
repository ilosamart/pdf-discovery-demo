significant pickup in incoming readings on core inflation will not be a precondition for 

me to judge that an initial increase in the federal funds rate would be warranted.  With 

respect to wages, I anticipate that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick 

up to a rate more in line with trend labor productivity growth as employment settles in at 

its maximum sustainable level.  We could see nominal wage growth eventually running 

notably higher than the current roughly 2 percent pace.  But the outlook for wages is 

highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market 

conditions continue to improve as projected.  For example, we cannot be sure about the 

future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global 

competition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that may also 

influence the pace of real wage growth over time.  These factors, which are outside of the 

Federal Reserve’s control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with 

productivity growth for at least the past 15 years.  For such reasons, we can never be sure 

what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and 

this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed’s progress 

in achieving its inflation objective.     

I have argued that a pickup in neither wage nor price inflation is indispensable for 

me to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.  

That said, I would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage 

discussed extensively in the literature; for instance, see Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is 
Alive and Well:  Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390 
(Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August).  In addition, the apparent lack of 
disinflationary pressure seen during the recent recession is not necessarily a puzzle for the New Keynesian 
Phillips curve, as shown in Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2015), “Inflation 
in the Great Recession and New Keynesian Models,” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics, 
vol. 7 (January), pp. 168-96.
