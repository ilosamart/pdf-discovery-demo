Congressional Budget Office estimates that participation is currently 0.7 percentage point 

below its trend rate, which suggests remaining upside potential.  By contrast, other recent 

work does not find a strong case for a meaningful further slack.6  The issue has important 

implications, since changes in participation can have material effects on the 

unemployment rate:  Holding the level of employment constant, a 25 basis point change 

in the participation rate would lead roughly to a corresponding 40 basis point change in 

the unemployment rate. 

Longer-Run Issues 

Productivity and growth 

Our economy is strong and operating near its capacity.  But we face important 

challenges when it comes to the longer-term growth rate of the economy.  Long-term 

economic growth depends mainly on nonmonetary factors such as population growth and 

workforce participation, the skills and aptitudes of our workforce, the tools at their 

disposal, and the pace of technological advance.  Fiscal and regulatory policies can have 

important effects on these factors.  The main long-run contribution monetary policy can 

make is to provide a stable macroeconomic and financial environment.  The level of 

potential growth does have important implications for monetary policy. 

One of the surprising features of this expansion has been that 2 percent growth in 

real gross domestic product (GDP) has been enough to create solid job gains and 

unexpectedly large declines in unemployment.  During much of the recovery, forecasters
