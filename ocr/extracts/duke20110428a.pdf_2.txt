The Federal Reserve is best known for its role in the national economy and 

monetary policy.  But through the 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country, it also 

gets involved in efforts to support local communities and their economies.  This work 

helps to enhance our understanding of the pace of economic recovery and further creates 

a backdrop for a national dialogue about common problems and their potential solutions. 

Over the last several years, every community across the country has felt the 

effects of the financial crisis.  Foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties threaten 

neighborhoods nationwide, and community leaders are working to stabilize those 

neighborhoods.  While the problem touches every community, it doesn’t look the same in 

each because it’s shaped by the circumstances that prevailed in those neighborhoods 

before the crisis hit. 

Neighborhood stabilization efforts are critical, now more than ever, as not all 

communities will be stabilized without intervention.  This is because the market will not 

correct equally in all places.  Through the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board, the Federal 

Reserve System facilitates community development activities as communities strive to 

repair the damage wrought by the financial crisis.  We participate in local collaboration 

efforts, help evaluate what’s working and what’s not, and highlight promising practices.  

We do this by combining research and local outreach, and also by bringing together 

financial institutions, policymakers, and community leaders.
