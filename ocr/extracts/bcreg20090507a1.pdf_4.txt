â€¢ The SCAP buffer does not represent a new capital standard and is not expected to be maintained 

on an ongoing basis. Instead, that capital is available to help BHCs absorb larger-than-expected 

future losses, should they occur, and to support the BHCs ability to serve their customers, 

including lending to creditworthy borrowers during the economic downturn. 

The results of the SCAP suggest that if the economy were to track the more adverse scenario, 

losses at the 19 firms during 2009 and 2010 could be $600 billion. The bulk of the estimated losses -

approximately $455 billion - come from losses on the BHCs' accrual loan portfolios, particularly f rom 

residential mortgages and other consumer-related loans. The estimated two-year cumulative losses on 

total loans under the more adverse scenario is 9.1 percent at the 19 participating BHCs; for comparison, 

this two-year rate is higher than during the historical peak loss years of the 1930s. Estimated possible 

losses from trading-related exposures and securities held in investment portfolios totaled $135 billion. 

In combination with the losses already recognized by these firms since mid-2007, largely from charge-

offs and write-downs on the values of securities, the SCAP results suggest financial crisis-related losses 

at these firms, if the economy were to follow the more adverse scenario, could total nearly $950 billion 

by the end of 2010. 

The potential losses facing these 19 firms have to be weighed against the potential resources 

available to them to absorb those losses. At year-end 2008, capital ratios at all 19 BHCs exceeded 

minimum regulatory capital standards, in many cases by substantial margins, and most met supervisory 

expectations on the composition of capital. Tier 1 capital at these firms totaled about $835 billion in Q4 

2008. The practical implication of this capital is that many of the BHCs already had substantial capital 

buffers in place to absorb their share of the estimated $600 billion of losses. In addition, banks will 

realize revenues f rom ongoing businesses to absorb losses, though at a lower level in the weak 

economic conditions of the stress scenario than in the baseline. However, some of those revenues will 

need to go into building loan loss reserves against credit problems in 2011. 

After taking account of losses, revenues and reserve build requirements, in the aggregate, these 

firms need to add $185 billion to capital buffers to reach the target SCAP capital buffer at the end of 

2010 under the more adverse scenario. There are two important things to note about this estimate. 

First, the $185 billion accrues to 10 of the 19 firms, meaning 9 of the 19 firms already have capital 

buffers sufficient to get through the adverse scenario in excess of 6 percent Tier 1 capital and 4 percent 

Tier 1 Common capital. Second, the vast majority of this $185 billion comes from a shortfall in Tier 1 

Common capital in the more adverse scenario, with virtually no shortfall in overall Tier 1 capital. This 

result means that while nearly all the firms have sufficient Tier 1 capital to absorb the unusually high 

losses of the more adverse scenario and still end 2010 with a Tier 1 risk-based ratio in excess of 6 

percent, 10 of these firms had capital structures that are too strongly t i l ted toward capital other than 

common equity. Thus, each of the 10 firms needing to augment their capital as a result of this exercise 

must do so by increasing their Tier 1 Common capital. 

The $185 billion estimated additional capital buffers correspond to the estimate that would 

have applied at the end of 2008. But a number of these firms have either completed or contracted for 

asset sales or restructured existing capital instruments since the end of 2008 in ways that increased their 

Tier 1 Common capital. These actions substantially reduced the final SCAP buffer. In addition, the pre-

Provision net revenues of many of the firms exceeded what was assumed in the more adverse scenario 

by almost $20B, allowing them to build their capital bases. The effects of these transactions and 

revenues rendered the additional capital needed to establish the SCAP buffer equal to $75 billion.
