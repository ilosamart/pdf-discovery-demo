 There is an almost unlimited number of variations on the shared approach and, in fact, 

one or another variants on that approach have been adopted by most jurisdictions during the 

modern banking era (though there have been instances of countries severely limiting or 

prohibiting foreign banking altogether).  Before turning to a discussion of how the shared 

approach has evolved and may be further modified, I think it useful to identify both the appeal 

and the problems with the other three, conceptually purer, approaches. 

 Both the attraction and limitations of the host country model are fairly apparent.  On the 

one hand, the host country is most likely to be attentive to the risks posed to its financial system 

by foreign banks.  More generally, the host jurisdiction is at least presumptively best positioned 

to craft a regulatory and supervisory framework to protect its financial system from the particular 

risks engendered by economic and financial conditions.  Having all foreign banking operations 

meet local capital and other standards helps achieve that end.  The risks of abrupt shifts of capital 

and liquidity out of the country can be minimized, and depositors can be better protected.   

On the other hand, a fully local regulatory system would make the costs of entry very 

high.  For example, if no foreign branches were allowed, or were required to operate as if they 

were separately chartered and capitalized, the commitment of resources needed to enter a foreign 

market would be considerably higher than those typically associated with opening a branch.  In 

addition, even complete local subsidiarization might not protect a foreign banking operation 

from suffering some contagion if its parent is under stress.  Thus, the quality of home country 

regulation may have some bearing even under the host country model. 

 Not surprisingly, the home country model presents essentially the obverse set of 

advantages and limitations.  Having a consolidated set of capital requirements and a single 

supervisor allows for the quickest deployment of capital and liquidity where it is most in
