appreciate as investors rebalance their portfolios in favor of assets denominated in its 

currency in response to the higher interest rate differential.6   

There is also evidence that monetary policy actions can influence investors’ 

willingness to hold risky assets, the so-called risk-taking channel.7  Such effects seem to 

be most potent when financial conditions are stressed.  And countries that offer high 

prospective returns but have weak policy frameworks or other structural vulnerabilities 

may be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in international investment associated with 

global risk factors.8   

Effects of monetary accommodation since the global financial crisis 

After the 2007-08 global financial crisis, there has been heightened concern about 

the international spillovers of monetary policies--and of ours, in particular.  Some EME 

critics argued that U.S. policy accommodation contributed to a surge of capital inflows 

and excessive credit growth in their economies, creating risks of financial instability.  

But, as time wore on, most EMEs seemed glad to receive those flows.   

There is little doubt that the aggressive actions the Federal Reserve took to 

mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis significantly affected asset prices at 

                                                 
6 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962).  One key implication of the Mundell-Fleming framework is that 
a central bank can exercise full control over both the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate only 
when there are significant barriers to the international capital mobility.  Accordingly, policymakers face the 
constraint of the “impossible trinity,” which states that a country cannot simultaneously have an 
independent monetary policy, free capital movement, and a fixed exchange rate.  
7  Several recent papers discuss risk-taking channels through which monetary policy influences financial 
conditions more broadly than the level of safe interest rates.  See Borio and Zhu (2012), Rey (2015), Morris 
and Shin (2014), Bruno and Shin (2015), and the Hanson and Stein (2015) “reaching for yield” concept.   
8  Studies using panel data typically have found that country-specific factors help explain cross-sectional 
differences in international investment and capital flows.  See, for example, Furceri, Guichard, and 
Rusticelli (2011); Fratzscher (2012); and Luca and Spatafora (2012).  Avdjiev and Takáts’s (2014) study of 
cross-border bank lending during the “taper tantrum” shows a larger pullback for countries with weaker 
current account balances, and Sahay and others (2014) find that country-specific market reactions during 
this period also were affected by high inflation, weak growth prospects, and relatively low reserves.
