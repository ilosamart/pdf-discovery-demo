Nearly five years into the expansion that began after the financial crisis and the 

Great Recession, the recovery has come a long way.  More than 8 million jobs have been 

added to nonfarm payrolls since 2009, almost the same number lost as a result of the 

recession.  Led by a resurgent auto industry, manufacturing output has also nearly 

returned to its pre-recession peak.  While the housing market still has far to go, it seems 

to have turned a corner.   

It is a sign of how far the economy has come that a return to full employment is, 

for the first time since the crisis, in the medium-term outlooks of many forecasters.  It is a 

reminder of how far we have to go, however, that this long-awaited outcome is projected 

to be more than two years away.  

Today I will discuss how my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) and I view the state of the economy and how this view is likely to shape our 

efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.  I will 

start with the FOMC’s outlook, which foresees a gradual return over the next two to three 

years of economic conditions consistent with its mandate.  

While monetary policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the 

path of the economy is uncertain, and effective policy must respond to significant 

unexpected twists and turns the economy may take.  My primary focus today will be on 

how the FOMC’s monetary policy framework has evolved to best support the recovery 

through those twists and turns, and what this framework is likely to imply as the recovery 

progresses.
