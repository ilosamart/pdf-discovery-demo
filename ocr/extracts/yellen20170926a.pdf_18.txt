Conclusion 

To conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC’s outlook that, with 

gradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will stabilize at around the FOMC’s 

2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening 

in labor market conditions.  But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things, 

the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and 

other factors.  As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as 

warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary 

policy.  But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain 

unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
