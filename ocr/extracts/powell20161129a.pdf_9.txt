and much harder to predict.  Productivity varies significantly over time, as figure 11 

showed.  If productivity growth returns to, say, 1.5 percent, then the U.S. economy could 

grow at about 2.0 percent over the long term.  Actual growth may turn out to be weaker 

or stronger, and the choices we make as a society will have something to say about that.    

Why Are Long-Term Interest Rates So Low? 

Let’s turn to the related question of why long-term interest rates are so

benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury security has increased lately, but at 2.3 percent it is still 

far below what was normal before the financial crisis.  In fact, this next chart shows that, 

as growth and inflation have fallen, longer term interest rates have fallen as well over the 

past 35 years (figure 13).  

So why are long-term interest rates so low?  Many of you will no doubt be 

thinking, “They are low because you people at the Fed set them low!”  While there is an 

element of truth there, that is not the whole story.  The FOMC has considerable control 

over short-term interest rates.  We have much less influence over long-term rates, which 

are set in the marketplace.  Long-term interest rates represent the price that balances the 

supply of saving by lenders and demand for funds by borrowers, such as businesses 

needing to fund their capital expenditures.  Lenders expect to receive a real return and to 

be compensated for inflation and for the risk of nonpayment.  Meanwhile, borrowers 

adjust their demand for funds based on their changing assessment of the risks and 

expected returns of their investment projects.  When desired saving rises or investment
