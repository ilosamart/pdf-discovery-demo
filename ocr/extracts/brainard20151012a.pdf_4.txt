the year, and recent indicators suggest a similar pace in the second half.  Perhaps most 

notable, personal consumption expenditures are estimated to have increased at an annual 

rate of a little over 3 percent in the three months ending in August, and auto sales moved 

up to a strong 18.1 million unit annualized pace in September.  Thus, even though equity 

prices are down this year, continued job growth, lower gas prices, rising house prices and 

some loosening in consumer credit look likely to support consumer spending over the 

second half of the year.   

Moreover, domestic investment also looks to be increasing at a moderate pace 

despite the drag from the energy sector.  New orders and shipments of nondefense capital 

goods have turned up recently, pointing to positive equipment investment going forward, 

and investment in nonresidential buildings looks to have risen noticeably in the middle of 

the year.  While investment in energy-related structures will likely move lower over the 

second half of the year in response to the most recent step-down in oil prices, the decline 

should be smaller than the sharp decline in the first half.   

Importantly, recent data suggest that the gradual recovery in housing continues.  

Single-family building permits were close to an annual rate of 700,000 units in August, 

up nearly 5 percent from the fourth quarter of last year.  The improvement in single- 

family housing is welcome after having been somewhat slow to materialize.  Even so, 

current levels remain below what would be suggested by fundamentals, such as 

population growth. 

While private consumption and investment thus appear to be on reassuringly solid 

trajectories, growth in government expenditures on goods and services is likely to remain 

tepid.  Combined purchases at the federal, state, and local levels rose at an annual rate of
