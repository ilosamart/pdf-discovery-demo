borrow from a money fund in the triparty market.  In this case, the asset on the dealer’s 

balance sheet is the repo loan it makes to the hedge fund. 

Clearly, there is the potential for fire-sale risk in both of these examples. One 

source of risk would be an initial shock either to the expected value of the underlying 

collateral or to its volatility that leads to an increase in required repo-market haircuts 

(e.g., the default probability of the corporate bond goes up).  Another source of risk 

would be concerns about the creditworthiness of the broker-dealer firm that causes 

lenders in the triparty market to step away from it. 

In either case, if the associated externalities are deemed to create significant social 

costs, the goal of regulatory policy should be to get private actors to internalize these 

costs. At an abstract level, this means looking for a way to impose an appropriate 

Pigouvian (i.e., corrective) tax on the transactions.7  Of course, the tax must balance the 

social costs against the benefits that accompany SFTs; these benefits include both 

“money-like” services from the increased stock of near-riskless private assets, as well as 

enhanced liquidity in the market for the underlying collateral—the corporate bond 

market, in my examples.8  So in the absence of further work on calibrating costs and 

                                                 
7 Of course, the Pigouvian taxation approach by itself cannot completely eliminate the ex post costs 
associated with fire sales. This would require a broad and active lender-of-last resort function, which I do 
not discuss here.  The best that any form of ex ante regulation can hope to do is to reduce the incidence and 
magnitude of ex post fire-sales damage.
