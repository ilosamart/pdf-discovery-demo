leading to the buildup of system-wide risk.”10   Because stricter capital requirements lead 

to higher levels of bank equity--which is typically more expensive than debt--they would 

likely result in higher funding costs for the bank-intermediated credit utilized by other 

market participants.  In this regard, time-varying macroprudential policies can be thought 

of as addressing cyclical systemic risks via interest rates in a manner somewhat akin to a 

tightening of monetary policy, which by raising benchmark interest rates affects a similar 

increase in funding costs.   

Clearly, time-varying macroprudential policies could not be viewed as a substitute 

for monetary policy.  Like ad hoc supervisory policies, they would influence a narrower 

set of transactions and, as such, would not “get in all the cracks” of the financial system, 

to use a phrase coined by my colleague Jeremy Stein.  But, to shift metaphors, they could 

potentially provide something of a speed bump, while not producing the much broader 

effect on the economy that a federal funds rate increase would.  Moreover, time-varying 

macroprudential policies may also give monetary policymakers more of an opportunity to 

assess whether the asset inflation is generalized and sustained enough to warrant a change 

in monetary policy.11   

Although the three federal banking agencies included a countercyclical capital 

provision in the capital regulation to implement Basel III adopted last summer, the 

provision will not take effect in the United States until 2016.  However, when the 

countercyclical capital buffer provision of Basel III does come into effect in the United

11 It is worth noting that time-varying macroprudential policies like the countercyclical capital buffer also 
bolster resilience in the financial sector by increasing bank and dealer loss absorbency.  Countercyclical or 
even through-the-cycle minimum haircuts on SFTs bolster resilience by reducing the amount that haircuts 
might jump when conditions weaken.
