So what’s an Asian economy to do?  I would argue that, instead of trying to restore 

growth through enhancing external surpluses, under the circumstances it makes more sense for 

emerging Asia to focus on domestic demand as an engine of its growth, and to allow their trade 

and current account surpluses to shrink.  When looking at these economies in aggregate, as 

shown in your next slide, current account surpluses narrowed greatly after the Global Financial 

Crisis but rebounded substantially thereafter.17  However, as you can see in slide 16, we have 

seen some narrowing of current account balances as a share of GDP in several emerging Asian 

economies, although in some others, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, the surpluses 

have increased.  Encouraging domestic demand and allowing for downward adjustment of these 

surpluses in emerging Asia, with more balances turning into deficits, would provide a much-

needed injection of demand into the global economy and also support economic growth in the 

region by providing another source of growth in place of the lessened impetus from external 

demand. 

A shift toward external deficits in Asia would be advantageous, considering the low level 

of external financing costs at present.  Many observers are raising the possibility of a “new 

normal” for the global economy, in which moderate global demand, low productivity growth, 

and slow trade may persist for some time, keeping interest rates in the advanced economies “low 

for long.”  To be sure, bond yields have moved up recently, but they remain quite low by 

historical standards.  Accordingly, the cost of external finance to Asian economies has fallen, 

which should support strong private capital flows to emerging markets.  Normally, we would
