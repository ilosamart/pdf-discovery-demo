expected in a healthy labor market and not evidence that the economy as a whole is 

experiencing a serious worker shortage.   

The recent behavior of wages provides additional evidence pertaining to the 

degree of labor market slack.  As shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings, 

the employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only 

modestly of late.6  Again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor 

market.  Moreover, signs of overheating in the broader economy are also scarce.  For 

example, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is well below its historical 

average.  Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level, 

this increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar, 

not upward pressure from resource utilization. 

Of course, even if the labor market is not overheated currently, one might worry 

that overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further, 

causing inflation to surge.  I consider this unlikely for several reasons.  First, the pace of 

labor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years:  For 

example, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000 

last year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over 

                                                           
6 An exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fedâ€™s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a 
noticeable acceleration in hourly wages as self-reported in the Current Population Survey.  Like average 
hourly earnings, the WGT excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the ECI or business-
sector compensation per hour (CPH).  In addition, the WGT is based on a smaller sample than the measures 
shown in Figure 3 and it only covers a sub-set of the workforce--specifically, employed individuals who 
were also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year.  Finally, because 
average hourly earnings and business-sector CPH are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an 
increase in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned 
increase for lower-wage workers, and this is not so for the WGT.
