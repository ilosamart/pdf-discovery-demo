they rebuild their financial strength.  For example, we continue to receive numerous 

proposals from private equity investors to take stakes in regional and community banks, 

and over the past two years we have approved many of these proposals, including some 

that bring both new capital and management to the organization and some that provide 

new capital through minority investments. 

Lending to Creditworthy Borrowers 

A key objective of the stress assessments and our efforts with smaller institutions 

has been to restore confidence in the stability of our banking system, confidence that was 

lacking in early 2009.  Our goal, though, was to accomplish more than stability; for 

example, in the SCAP, by setting reasonably ambitious capital targets, we hoped also to 

hasten the return to a better lending environment. 

Clearly that objective has not yet been realized, as bank lending continues to 

contract and terms and conditions remain tight.  Consequently, restoring the flow of 

credit through the banking system remains a central objective of the Federal Reserve.  To 

achieve this outcome, we have been taking measures to ensure that our supervisory 

actions do not inadvertently impede sound lending.  Businesses need access to credit to 

maintain or expand their payrolls and make productive investments.  And banks need to 

make sound loans to preserve their earnings stream, absorb credit losses, and support 

capital growth, as necessary.  For this reason, we have joined with the other federal 

banking agencies to issue a series of policy statements to examiners:  on the importance 

of bank lending to creditworthy borrowers, on small business lending, and on commercial 

real estate loan restructuring.2  We have followed up this formal guidance with training
