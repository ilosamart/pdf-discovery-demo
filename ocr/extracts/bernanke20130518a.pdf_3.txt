generation to generation.  For centuries, many, if not most, people produced much of 

what they and their families consumed and never traveled far from where they were born.  

By the mid-1700s, however, growing scientific and technical knowledge was beginning 

to find commercial uses.  Since then, according to standard accounts, the world has 

experienced at least three major waves of technological innovation and its application.  

The first wave drove the growth of the early industrial era, which lasted from the mid-

1700s to the mid-1800s.  This period saw the invention of steam engines, cotton-spinning 

machines, and railroads.  These innovations, by introducing mechanization, 

specialization, and mass production, fundamentally changed how and where goods were 

produced and, in the process, greatly increased the productivity of workers and reduced 

the cost of basic consumer goods.  The second extended wave of invention coincided 

with the modern industrial era, which lasted from the mid-1800s well into the years after 

World War II.  This era featured multiple innovations that radically changed everyday 

life, such as indoor plumbing, the harnessing of electricity for use in homes and factories, 

the internal combustion engine, antibiotics, powered flight, telephones, radio, television, 

and many more.  The third era, whose roots go back at least to the 1940s but which began 

to enter the popular consciousness in the 1970s and 1980s, is defined by the information 

technology (IT) revolution, as well as fields like biotechnology that improvements in 

computing helped make possible.  Of course, the IT revolution is still going on and 

shaping our world today. 

Now here’s a question--in fact, a key question, I imagine, from your perspective.  

What does the future hold for the working lives of today’s graduates?  The economic 

implications of the first two waves of innovation, from the steam engine to the Boeing
