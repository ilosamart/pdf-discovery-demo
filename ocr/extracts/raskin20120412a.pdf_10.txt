Monetary Policy and other Federal Reserve Actions 

    How should the Federal Reserve respond to a recession with these contours?  

The Fed’s accommodative monetary policy response has been intended to ease the effects 

of the recession and support a recovery in the context of its dual mandate to foster 

maximum employment and stable prices.  As the economy descended into recession, the 

Federal Reserve promptly and aggressively pushed the federal funds rate down to near 

zero.  The Fed then substantially expanded its holdings of longer-term securities and 

more recently moved to lengthen the average maturity of its holdings to put downward 

pressure on longer-term interest rates.   

These actions were intended to help bring down both short-term and longer-term 

interest rates, thereby reducing borrowing costs for households and firms.  Reductions in 

interest rates usually expand credit and encourage firms to invest and households to 

borrow for durable goods purchases, thereby stimulating aggregate demand.  A more 

accommodative stance of monetary policy also boosts the economy by raising the prices 

of equities and other assets, and therefore supporting household spending through the 

wealth effect that I mentioned earlier.  In addition, a more accommodative stance of 

monetary policy can also help by contributing to a somewhat lower foreign exchange 

value of the dollar, thus promoting the competitiveness of our goods and services in 

overseas markets. 

The Federal Reserve’s policy actions have indeed contributed to lower interest 

rates.  For example, the yield on 10-year nominal Treasury securities has come down 

from more than 4-1/2 percent prior to the recession to around 2 percent recently--a 

historically low level.  As we had hoped, the influence of these policy actions has been
