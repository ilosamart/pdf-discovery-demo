Thank you for inviting me. I appreciate the opportunity to listen and learn about the 

important work that you do.1 

One of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities is to understand how communities across 

America are experiencing the economy.  That is why Congress established a network of Federal 

Reserve Banks and Branches across the country.  Our local presence gives us valuable 

opportunities to engage with communities across a broad spectrum--from those who are thriving 

to those who are confronting challenges, and from inner-city neighborhoods to rural towns.   

One of the lessons that our community engagement has taught us is that there is an 

important connection between the strength of regional food systems and community health.  

Today’s meeting is one in a series that Federal Reserve Banks are holding across the country to 

talk about local efforts to support regional food systems, and how such efforts can advance 

communities’ goals. These meetings build on the Federal Reserve Board’s release last August of 

Harvesting Opportunity, a publication that explores the community and economic development 

potential of investing in regional food systems.2  Through this collaborative research effort, we 

learned several important lessons about what works to strengthen regional food systems. 

First, we learned that appropriately tailored investments in regional food systems have 

the potential to support the creation of new jobs and small businesses in local communities, as 

well as to improve farm profitability and financial resilience. 

Second, we learned that in order to take advantage of new business opportunities in the 

regional food sector, entrepreneurs need access to capital, specialized knowledge, and general
