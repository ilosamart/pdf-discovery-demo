Recent Economic and Financial Developments 

For the past three and a half years the U.S. economy has been in a recovery--

albeit a very weak one--from a severe financial crisis and the deepest recession of the 

post-World War II period.  The unemployment rate, which reached a high of 10 percent 

in the fall of 2009, has since come down 2-1/2 percentage points, to 7.5 percent in April.   

The increase in economic activity and the decline in the unemployment rate are, 

of course, welcome, but we still have a long way to go to reach what feels like a healthy 

economy.  In fact, the pace of recovery has been slower than most had expected.  The gap 

between actual output and the economy’s potential remains quite large, according to 

estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, and the unemployment rate today 

remains well above levels seen prior to the recession, and well above the level that the 

Committee thinks can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved.  In addition, 

the number of long-term unemployed--people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks 

or more--remains historically high.   

My interpretation of the economic data that we have received over the past few 

quarters is that the recovery has continued to gain traction.  The Bureau of Economic 

Analysis reported last month that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual 

rate of 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter of this year after barely expanding at all in the 

fourth quarter of 2012.  The step-up in growth in the first quarter partly reflected a 

rebound from last year’s drought and Hurricane Sandy.  Smoothing through these factors,
