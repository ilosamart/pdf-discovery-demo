About a year ago, the FOMC introduced a variation on its earlier purchase 

programs, known as the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the Federal 

Reserve would purchase $400 billion of long-term Treasury securities and sell an 

equivalent amount of shorter-term Treasury securities over the period ending in June 

2012.10  The FOMC subsequently extended the MEP through the end of this year.11  By 

reducing the average maturity of the securities held by the public, the MEP puts 

additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and further eases overall 

financial conditions.   

How effective are balance sheet policies?  After nearly four years of experience 

with large-scale asset purchases, a substantial body of empirical work on their effects has 

emerged.  Generally, this research finds that the Federal Reserve’s large-scale purchases 

have significantly lowered long-term Treasury yields.  For example, studies have found 

that the $1.7 trillion in purchases of Treasury and agency securities under the first LSAP 

program reduced the yield on 10-year Treasury securities by between 40 and 110 basis 

points.  The $600 billion in Treasury purchases under the second LSAP program has been 

credited with lowering 10-year yields by an additional 15 to 45 basis points.12  Three 

studies considering the cumulative influence of all the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, 

including those made under the MEP, found total effects between 80 and 120 basis points 

on the 10-year Treasury yield.13  These effects are economically meaningful.

and agency MBS into agency MBS.  See Board of Governors (2011a).

12 Studies of the effects of securities purchases include, among others, D’Amico and King (forthcoming), 
Gagnon and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011), 
Meaning and Zhu (2011), Swanson (2011), D’Amico and others (forthcoming), and Wright (2012).  
13 See Pandl (2012), Meyer and Bomfim (2012), and Li and Wei (2012).  One important feature of these 
analyses is that they are not just based on event studies.  For example, the Li and Wei study employs a no-
