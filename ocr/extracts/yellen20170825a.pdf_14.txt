regulation.18  Economic models of the resilience of the financial sector--so called top-

down stress-testing models--reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the 

riskiness of large banks has diminished over the past decade.19  Similarly, model-based 

analyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire sale spillovers across banks or broker-

dealers have been substantially mitigated.20 

Is This Safer System Supporting Growth? 

I suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so 

far:  The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and 

these reforms have made the system safer.  Now--a decade from the onset of the crisis 

and nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and international 

agreement on the key banking reforms--a new question is being asked:  Have reforms 

gone too far, resulting in a financial system that is too burdened to support prudent risk-

taking and economic growth? 

The Federal Reserve is committed individually, and in coordination with other 

U.S. government agencies through forums such as the FSOC and internationally through 

bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB, to evaluating

19 For example, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have developed a top-down stress-

testing model, and simulation results from the model suggest that the resilience of the U.S. banking system 

has improved since the crisis; see Beverly Hirtle, Anna Kovner, James Vickery, and Meru Bhanot (2014),
