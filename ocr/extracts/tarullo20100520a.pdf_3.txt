government borrowing costs.  Remarkably, the spread of Greek 10-year bond yields over those on 

German bonds fell below 30 basis points for a number of years.  Despite these low borrowing 

costs, Greece was consistently unable to meet EU budget deficit targets or to reduce its sizable 

debt, putting the government’s finances in a very precarious position at the onset of the global 

financial crisis.     

 Many date the start of the acute phase of the current problems to the revelation last fall that 

the Greek government’s deficit for 2009 was likely to be several times larger than previously 

thought--it is now estimated at near 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)--and that its debt 

would significantly exceed 100 percent of GDP.  In response, the Greek government announced 

substantial fiscal consolidation plans involving sizable increases in revenue and sharp wage cuts 

for government workers.  However, concerns about the plan’s feasibility, especially as growth 

prospects worsened, combined with what financial market participants took to be inconsistent 

signals from other European countries about the possibility of support, undermined the market’s 

belief in an implicit guarantee.  As a result, a sharp widening of spreads, rating downgrades of 

Greek debt, and stresses in the Greek banking system followed.  By mid-April, it was clear that 

Greek financial institutions and the Greek government were rapidly losing access to market 

financing, just as sizable redemptions on the government’s debt were looming.   

 After attempts at smaller and less well-defined support mechanisms for Greece failed to 

stabilize markets, EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) leaders announced on May 2 a joint 

€110 billion support package.  This international financing package is the largest ever extended to 

a single country and amounts to about 50 percent of Greece’s GDP.  In return, Greece was 

expected to implement an aggressive, front-loaded consolidation program to reduce its budget 

deficit from double-digit rates to less than 3 percent of GDP between now and 2014, with one-half 

of that reduction occurring this year alone.
