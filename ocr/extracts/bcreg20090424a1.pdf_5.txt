traditional role of capital, especially common equity, is to absorb unexpected losses and thus to protect 
depositors and other creditors. Given the heightened uncertainty about the economy and potential 
losses in the banking system, and the potential in the current environment for adverse economic 
outcomes to be magnified through the banking system, supervisors believe it prudent for large BHCs to 
hold substantial capital to absorb losses should the economic downturn be longer and deeper than now 
anticipated. The SCAP was designed to assess these capital needs as part of the ongoing supervisory 
process. The program is consistent with current regulatory capital guidelines, which require BHCs to 
hold capital commensurate with their risks, and to generally hold a dominant share of their regulatory 
capital in the form of common equity. 
The SCAP was designed under the assumption that the institutions continue to operate under 
the regulatory and accounting frameworks existing as of December 31, 2008 and considering the effect 
of significant changes that have or are expected to occur during the next two years.2 [Footnote 2. Significant 
changes in accounting considered included the recently issued Financial Accounting Standards Boards Financial 
Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
that is effective in 2009 and expected changes to consolidation accounting that will be effective in 2010. 
End footnote 2.] Loans held in portfolio subject to accrual accounting are carried at amortized cost, net of an 
allowance for loan losses. The use of accrual accounting for these assets is based on BHCs' intent and ability to 
hold these loans to maturity, which reflects, in part, a combination of more stable deposit funding and information 
advantages about the quality of the loans they underwrite. The economic value of loans in the accrual 
book is reduced through the loan loss reserving process when repayment becomes doubtful, but is not 
reduced for fluctuations in market prices, which may be driven by market liquidity considerations, if 
those factors do not affect the ultimate likelihood of repayment. The adherence of SCAP to current 
practices is important because the majority of assets at most of the BHCs participating in the SCAP are 
loans that are booked on an accrual basis. As a result of the loss recognition framework for assets in the 
accrual loan book, the results of this exercise are not comparable with those that would evaluate such 
assets on a mark-to-market basis. 
The SCAP analysis is forward looking, but over a limited time horizon. Losses and resources are 
projected over a two-year period (2009 to 2010) and include an assessment of the sufficiency of loan 
loss reserves expected at the end of 2010, which captures expected losses in 2011. This choice of 
horizon reflects a tradeoff between capturing the full extent of losses that might be incurred on assets 
that were originated when underwriting standards were more lax in 2006 and 2007 and a reasonable 
ability to project with some degree of confidence the losses and resources at more distant future points. 
Given the profile of the consensus baseline outlook for the macro economy and the alternative more 
adverse scenario that includes a return to positive real GDP growth within the two years, this horizon 
seems likely to capture a large portion of losses from positions held as of the end of 2008. 
While this approach likely captures the bulk of the losses that might be realized on these assets, 
it is important to note that it does not include the substantial losses that have already been taken. That 
is, forward-looking losses in the SCAP are not "lifetime" losses which occur from origination to the life-
end of the assets, but they do represent a substantial addition to those losses that have already been 
realized and, as noted above, when combined with losses already taken, are likely to represent a 
substantial share of the losses associated with loans originated from 2005 to 2007. Losses taken in the 
6 quarters through the end of 2008 by these firms and firms they acquired are substantial, estimated at 
approximately $400 billion for the 19 BHCs participating in the SCAP. They include charge-offs, write-
