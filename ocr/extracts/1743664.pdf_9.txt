Such a prognosis, however, must be qualified according to 
the changing picture of Government finance. Among the primary 
financing uncertainties of the year ahead must be the rate of budget 
stimulus or deficit. The President's budget for fiscal year 1977 
shows expenses advancing $20 billion to a level of $394 billion, 
while revenues are expected to increase by $53 billion to a level of 
$351 billion. The expected budget deficit is $43 billion for the 
coming year. Expenses are expected to rise only for income security, 
national defense, and interest payments. All other Government 
expenditure elements are expected to show a reduction in 1977. Revenue 
gains are expected from the higher level of economic activity, offset 
to some extent by a $28 billion cut in taxes. If one views this 
budget in light of the inflation, it is clear that the real dollars 
to be spent by the Federal Government for 1977, according to the 
President, would be reduced by 3 percent. Whether the President 
actually realizes his expectations with regard to the budget will, of 
course, depend heavily upon Congressional handling of expenditure and 
tax legislation over the coming nine months. If Congress views 
this year as one in which further stimulation by Government spending 
is not necessary, it may accede to the President's budget, and if 
Congress strictly adheres to its own budget reform act, there are 
some elements of optimism that our heavy Government expenditure 
advances may be dampened.
