the share accruing to those in the 1st through 80th percentiles fell 9 percentage points.9  

And while it is true that those at the upper end of the income distribution were 

disproportionately affected during the financial crisis, with the result that inequality 

actually fell a bit in the wake of the recession, high earners also appear to be benefiting 

disproportionately from the recovery.  Thus, the crisis does not seem really to have 

changed the trajectory of inequality.  

As interesting as these statistics on inequality are, they obscure a key part of the 

story--one that has been an important part of our identity as Americans:  whether a family 

has the ability, through hard work, to attain a better standard of living.  And on that point, 

we find that households in the middle and lower parts of the earnings distribution have 

experienced, at best, only modest improvements in inflation-adjusted income.10  Between 

1979 and 2007, households in the middle quintile of the income distribution--a functional 

definition of the middle class--saw their real labor income (adjusted for household size) 

rise only about 3 percent.  Meanwhile, households in the bottom one-fifth of the 

distribution did a bit better, experiencing about a 24 percent rise, although this figure 

reflects an improvement of just 1 percent per year, and that from a very low base.  In 

contrast, income rose more than 70 percent among households in the top one-fifth of the 

earnings distribution.   

The polarization of the labor income distribution has been mirrored in the types of 

jobs we are creating.  Since the 1990s, job gains have been concentrated at the upper and
