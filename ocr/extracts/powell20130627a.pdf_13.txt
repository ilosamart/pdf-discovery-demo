for the economy, the Committee could continue to reduce the pace of purchases in 

measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid-year.  At 

that time, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with growth 

consistent with further improvements and inflation heading back toward our objective.  If 

unemployment reaches the 7 percent range, that would constitute a substantial 

improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee 

announced the current program of asset purchases. 

I want to emphasize the importance of data over date.  If the Committee’s 

economic outlook is broadly realized, there will likely be a moderation in the pace of 

purchases later this year.  If the performance of the economy is weaker, the Committee 

may delay before moderating purchases or even increase them.  If the economy 

strengthens faster than the Committee anticipates, the pace of purchases may be 

moderated somewhat more quickly.  The path of purchases is in no way predetermined; 

we will monitor economic data and adjust our purchases as appropriate. 

In my view, there has been real progress in the labor market.  The Committee first 

adopted the “substantial improvement” test at the September 2012 meeting, so it is 

appropriate to measure the economy’s progress against economic conditions at that time.  

When the Committee met in September, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent.  

Today, just nine months later, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent--a larger decline than 

most FOMC participants expected in September.  At the time of the September meeting, 

nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the 

prior six months.9  Today the trailing six-month average payroll growth is 194,000.  

                                                 
9 The level of payroll employment would subsequently be revised up, but the Committee didn’t know at the 
September 2012 meeting that the revision would occur.
