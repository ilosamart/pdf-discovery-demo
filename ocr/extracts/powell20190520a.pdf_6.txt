Risks to Financial Stability:  Using the Framework Deployed since the Crisis 

As you can see, there are similarities to the subprime mortgage crisis.  As with the 

mortgage boom, the business debt story begins with rapid growth of debt to new highs 

and a surge in lending to risky borrowers made possible by aggressive underwriting using 

securitization vehicles.   

But there are also important differences.  One difference is that financial 

authorities now closely monitor financial stability vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis, 

armed with lessons learned from the crisis.  The Board of Governors meets at least four 

times a year to assess threats to the financial system and is constantly monitoring 

developments.  We use a checklist of potential financial vulnerabilities that we have 

described elsewhere, most recently in the Financial Stability Report we published earlier 

this month.1  This approach gives us a way to organize and weigh the mass of facts, 

anecdotes, and speculation we confront as we monitor financial stability.  

In assessing financial stability risks, we constantly consult our four-point 

checklist:  borrowing by businesses and households, valuation pressures, leverage in the 

financial system, and funding risk.  If households or businesses have borrowed too much, 

they will be forced to cut back spending and investing or even default if their incomes fall 

or the value of the collateral backing their loans declines.  Valuation pressures give us a 

sense of overall risk appetite and, should investors lose that appetite, how far prices could 

fall.  If lenders face defaulting borrowers and have too little loss-absorbing capacity, they
