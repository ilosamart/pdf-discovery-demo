some markets and a moderate increase in leverage provided by dealers.  I will also briefly touch 

on the role of supervision and regulation in this context and the development of new 

macroprudential tools for addressing financial imbalances. 

Monetary Policy and Financial Imbalances 

 In the aftermath of the crisis, the primary objective of U.S. monetary policy was to 

promote financial conditions likely to spur spending on goods and services through a number of 

channels.  To this end, the Federal Reserve first lowered the federal funds rate and other rates at 

the short end of the yield curve and, once the zero lower bound was binding, sought to push 

down yields at the longer end through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury and agency 

securities.  We anticipated that lowering rates on these securities would place downward pressure 

on a range of private yields as well, in turn supporting home values, equity prices, and other asset 

prices.  After all, this is the primary mechanism through which monetary policy in its 

conventional form stimulates the economy.  But a sustained period of very low and stable yields 

may incent a phenomenon commonly referred to as “reaching for yield,” in which investors seek 

higher returns by purchasing assets with greater duration or increased credit risk.   

The shift toward riskier assets is a normal channel through which monetary policy 

supports economic activity.  But taken too far, this dynamic has the potential to facilitate the 

emergence of financial imbalances.  For example, with interest rates at very low levels for a long 

period of time, and in an environment of low volatility, investors, banks, and other market 

participants may become complacent about interest rate risk.2  Similarly, in such an environment,

supervisory expectations regarding sound practices for the management of interest rate risk. Regulators noted that in 
an environment of historically low short-term interest rates, it is important for institutions to have robust processes 
for measuring and, where necessary, mitigating their exposure to potential increases in interest rates.  See Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation (2010), “Interagency 
Advisory on Interest Rate Risk,” Supervision and Regulation Letter SR 10-1 (January 11),
