To borrow from the title of a popular marital advice column, Can this contract be 

saved?  I think the answer is no--at least not in its current form.  This contract might have 

been adequate if servicers had followed the age-old advice and used their profits from the 

fat years when defaults were low in order to build their capacity for lean years when 

defaults were high.  But in practice, this does not appear to have happened--and perhaps 

even the most knowing servicer a few years ago might not have anticipated the 

subsequent level of mortgage defaults. 

Given that failure, it is imperative to reconsider the compensation structure so that 

servicers have adequate incentives to perform payment processing efficiently on 

performing mortgages, and to perform effective loss mitigation on delinquent loans.  

After the compensation structure is reconsidered, the PSAs need to be amended or 

renegotiated in order to facilitate more workouts.  Finally, PSAs should clarify the 

situations in which loan modifications and other mitigation strategies should be pursued.  

One tool that could aid in providing such clarity, and has received substantial attention 

over the last few years, is the net present value model.  Requiring servicers to take 

mitigative actions that are net-present-value positive to the investor could encourage the 

fair and consistent treatment of borrowers.   

 Investors also need tools that will allow them to better monitor servicer 

performance and take action accordingly.  These tools should be developed and described 

in the contract.  Currently, metrics that allow investors to measure servicersâ€™ execution 

are not widely available.  Such metrics could include customer satisfaction ratings, 

delinquency and cure rates, the average time that a homeowner waits on the phone to talk 

with the servicer, and servicer error rates.  Indeed, one can even imagine the development
