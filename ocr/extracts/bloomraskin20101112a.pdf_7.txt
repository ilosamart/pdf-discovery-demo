but not yet foreclosed upon, borrowers.  Loss mitigation options, such as forbearance and 

loan modification, require individualized case work.  Thus, the servicer needs to invest in 

additional resources, including trained personnel who can deal with often complex one-

off transactions.  In the case of a private-label security, many of the costs of this work 

may not be reimbursed by the trust.  Other costs result from even temporary forbearance, 

such as the servicer’s requirement, in most cases, to advance principal and interest to the 

investor every month, even though it has not received payment from the borrower.  Even 

in the case of a servicer who has every best intention of doing “the right thing,” the 

bottom-line incentives are largely misaligned with everyone else involved in the 

transaction, and most certainly the homeowners themselves. 

   We don’t know yet what the end results will be for homeowners.  But the best 

third-party servicers would have to be diligent and willing to absorb relative losses when 

the standard business model for the industry would seem to put a thumb on the scale in 

favor of foreclosure.  The most urgent needs of the servicing world today require a 

sufficient number of personnel with the adequate mix of training, tools, and judgment to 

deal with problem loans on a large scale--in other words, activities with few economies 

of scale.  The skill set of personnel hired and trained for routine work--efficiency and 

accuracy in following rules, and little discretion in decisionmaking--is likely a poor 

match for loss mitigation activities that require constant creativity and case-by-case 

judgment.  Therefore, simply transferring work from one part of a company to another 

does not achieve much without significant investments in training and retraining.  

Servicers have been publicly pledging for several years to increase their servicing 

capacity, and many have.  Unfortunately, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that many
