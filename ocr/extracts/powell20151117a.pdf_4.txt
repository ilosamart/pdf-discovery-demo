Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).3  The PFMIs lay out 

comprehensive requirements for financial market infrastructures, including CCPs.   

Clearing and settlement activities are cross-border and indeed global in 

nature.  Major U.S. financial institutions interact with market infrastructures 

around the world.  The PFMIs have established a rigorous set of internationally 

agreed upon standards for the quality and quantity of loss-absorbing resources and 

liquidity, governance, risk management, stress testing, recovery and  orderly wind-

down, and other key areas.   

I believe that there has been reasonably good progress in implementing these 

reforms here in the United States.  For example, according to the Financial 

Stability Board, over 70 percent of new U.S. interest rate and credit derivatives are 

now centrally cleared.4  And the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulatory 

agencies have recently announced final margin rules for uncleared derivatives as 

well, which should enhance the resilience of trading that still occurs outside of 

central clearing.5
