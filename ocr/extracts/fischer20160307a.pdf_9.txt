3. The rate of growth of output per worker is roughly constant over long periods 

of time. 

4. The capital/output ratio is roughly constant over long periods of time. 

5. The rate of return on investment is roughly constant over long periods of time. 

6. The real wage grows over time. 

Well, that was then, and many of the problems we face in our economy now relate 

to the changes in the stylized facts about the behavior of the economy:  Every one of 

Kaldor’s stylized facts is no longer true, and unfortunately the changes are mostly in a 

direction that complicates the formulation of economic policy.6   

While the basic approach outlined so far remains valid, and can be used to address 

many macroeconomic policy issues, I would like briefly to take up several topics in more 

detail.  Some of them are issues that have remained central to the macroeconomic agenda 

over the past 50 years, some have to my regret fallen off the agenda, and others are new 

to the agenda.   

1. Inflation and unemployment:  Estimated Phillips curves appear to be flatter 

than they were estimated to be many years ago--in terms of the textbooks, 

Phillips curves appear to be closer to what used to be called the Keynesian 

case (flat Phillips curve) than to the classical case (vertical Phillips curve).  

Since the U.S. economy is now below our 2 percent inflation target, and since 

unemployment is in the vicinity of full employment, it is sometimes argued 

that the link between unemployment and inflation must have been broken.  I 

don’t believe that.  Rather the link has never been very strong, but it exists,
