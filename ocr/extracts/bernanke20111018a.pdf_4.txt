numerical inflation target.  But, as a practical matter, the Federal Reserve’s policy 

framework has many of the elements of flexible inflation targeting.  In particular, like 

flexible inflation targeters, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to 

stabilizing inflation over the medium run while retaining the flexibility to help offset 

cyclical fluctuations in economic activity and employment.   

Also, like the formal inflation targeters, over time the Federal Reserve has 

become much more transparent about its outlook, objectives, and policy strategy.  For 

example, since early 2009, the Federal Reserve’s “Summary of Economic Projections” 

has included the FOMC’s longer-run projections, which represent Committee 

participants’ assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and 

inflation will converge over time.  These projections are conditioned on the assumptions 

of appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy; consequently, the 

longer-run projections for inflation in particular can be interpreted as indicating the rate 

of inflation that FOMC participants judge to be most consistent, over time, with the 

Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices.  These 

longer-run inflation projections are thus analogous to targets although, importantly, they 

represent the Committee participants’ individual assessments of the mandate-consistent 

inflation rate, not a formal inflation goal of the Committee as a whole.1   

 To what extent, if at all, has the pre-crisis consensus framework for monetary 

policy been changed by recent events?  In part because they recognized the benefits of 

continuity and familiarity during a period of upheaval, central banks generally retained 

their established approaches to monetary policy during the crisis; and, in many respects, 

                                                            
1 In a similar vein, since 2006 the Bank of Japan has provided the range of individual policy board 
members’ understanding of the inflation rate consistent with price stability.  That understanding is reviewed 
annually.
