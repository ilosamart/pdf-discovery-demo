flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation 

expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.11 

Textbook macroeconomics teaches us that understanding the economy and getting 

monetary policy right requires that we do our best to understand if—and if so, how—the 

forces of aggregate demand and supply are evolving relative to historical experience and 

the predictions of our models.  While predicting the future is difficult, with available data 

it appears that in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019, the supply side of the economy—

employment, participation, and productivity—expanded faster than most forecasters 

outside and inside the Fed expected.  Notwithstanding robust growth in demand over 

these five quarters, PCE price inflation fell somewhat short of the Fed’s 2 percent 

objective.  With this background, let me now turn to the outlook for U.S. monetary 

policy. 

Monetary Policy 

As I mentioned earlier, my colleagues and I on the FOMC understand that our 

priority today is to put in place policies that will help sustain maximum employment and 

price stability in an economy that appears to be operating close to both of our dual-

mandate objectives.  In our most recent statements, we have indicated that “the 

                                                 
11 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy, and see Erceg and others 
(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the 
precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) show that while the 
level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in 
these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low 
and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in 
determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.
