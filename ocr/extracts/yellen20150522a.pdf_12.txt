growth, defined as increases in how much can be produced in an hour of work.  Over 

time, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising incomes. 

Here the recent data have been disappointing.  The growth rate of output per hour 

worked in the business sector has averaged about 1-1/4 percent per year since the 

recession began in late 2007.  This rate is down from gains averaging 2-3/4 percent over 

the preceding decade.  I have mentioned the tepid pace of wage gains in recent years, and 

while I do take this as evidence of slack in the labor market, it also may be a reflection of 

relatively weak productivity growth. 

Productivity depends on many factors, including our workforce’s knowledge and 

skills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they 

have to work with.  Economists debate how optimistic to be about our nation’s 

productivity prospects.  Some argue that the decade starting in the mid-1990s was 

exceptional, with unusually large advances in information technologies, and that the more 

recent period provides a better guide to the future.  Others are more optimistic, suggesting 

that recent technological innovation remains as impressive as ever, and that history shows 

it may take some years to fully reap the economic benefits of such innovations.7  I do not 

know who is right, but I do believe that, as a nation, we should be pursuing policies to 

7 For a relatively pessimistic view of productivity growth because “the low-hanging fruit is picked,” see

Headwinds,” NBER Working Paper Series 18315 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic 
Research, August); and Tyler Cowen (2011), The Great Stagnation:  How America Ate All the Low-
Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better (New York:  Dutton).  For a 
more optimistic perspective, see Joel Mokyr (2014), “Secular Stagnation? Not in Your Life,” in Coen 
Teulings and Richard Baldwin, eds., Secular Stagnation:  Facts, Causes and Cures (London:  CEPR 
Press), pp. 83-89; and Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age:  Work, 
Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York:  W.W. Norton & Company).  The 
greatest return to adopting information technology appears five to seven years after investment, according 
to Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin M. Hitt (2003), “Computing Productivity:  Firm-Level Evidence,” Review 
of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), pp. 793-808.
