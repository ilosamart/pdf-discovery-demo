 As we now know, the financial turmoil dealt an economic body blow that spread 

worldwide.  Businesses slashed production and payrolls, including in countries that had 

not thus far experienced much effect.  International trade collapsed, and many nations 

dependent on trade experienced even sharper slides in economic activity than the United 

States.  

The Federal Reserveâ€™s Policy Response 

As the crisis became global, the policy response became global as well.  After 

watershed meetings in Washington of finance ministers and central bank governors on 

October 10-11, 2008, many countries, including the United States, announced 

comprehensive plans to stabilize their banking systems.  They expanded deposit 

insurance, injected public capital into banks, guaranteed bank-issued debt, and increased 

access to funding from central banks.1  This strong and unprecedented response--a sharp 

contrast to the failures of international cooperation that helped make the depression of the 

1930s so devastating--proved broadly effective.  During the subsequent months the risk 

of a global financial meltdown and economic collapse receded. 

In support of these efforts to stabilize the financial system, and in its traditional 

central bank role as backstop liquidity provider, the Federal Reserve developed 

innovative programs to provide well-collateralized, mostly short-term credit to the 

financial system.  Without this credit, otherwise sound financial institutions could have 

been forced to dump assets onto the market, further depressing prices, or even been 

driven into failure, intensifying the crisis.  We provided this liquidity through a number 

of channels.  To help stabilize banks of all sizes, we eased the terms of lending to banks

Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Iceland--took steps to prevent the disorderly failures 
of distressed financial firms.
