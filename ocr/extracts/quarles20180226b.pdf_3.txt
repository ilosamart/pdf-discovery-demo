Reserve is committed to strategies that will result in measureable enhancements to the cyber 

resiliency of the financial sector.  Given the dynamic and highly sophisticated nature of cyber 

risks, collaboration between the public sector and private sector toward identifying and 

managing these risks is imperative.  While we know that successful cyber attacks are often 

connected to poor basic information technology hygiene, and firms must continue to devote 

resources to these basics, we also know that attackers always work to be a step ahead, and we 

need to prepare for cyber events.  

Many of you provide services that are critical to maintaining the functionality of the 

financial system.  Those critical services should be highly resilient.  But at the same time, some 

of the solutions in place to improve the resiliency of those critical services may actually 

contribute to a cyber event.  One example would be the replication of bad data across data 

centers.  As the Federal Reserve thinks about its financial stability mandate, this concern will be 

a particular focus.  Solutions will not come easily, but I am confident that with strong public and 

private efforts, solutions will emerge. 

The Federal Reserve also focuses on the sharing of threat information and collaborates 

with a number of partners toward protective mechanisms.  We work with other domestic 

agencies as well as international authorities, and we have partnerships between the public and 

private sectors to introduce and participate in programs that combat the increasingly frequent and 

sophisticated cyber threats.   

Specifically, we collaborate with government and industry partners to plan and execute 

cybersecurity tabletop exercises focused on identifying areas where sector resilience and 

information sharing can be enhanced.  We also participate in community and industry outreach 

forums and actively share threat intelligence with sector partners including the Financial Services
