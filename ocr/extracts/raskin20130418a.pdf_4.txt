Trends in Income, Wealth, and Debt 

In order to “level set” our understanding, let me begin by reviewing some of the 

changes to the structure of income, wealth, and debt in the years leading up to the Great 

Recession--changes that have had significant implications for the well-being of most 

American households.  Long before the recession--decades before, in fact--income data 

show only sluggish increases in real incomes for low- and middle-income American 

households, and more-rapid increases for high-income households, resulting in a much 

greater concentration of income among those at the very top of the income distribution.  

As just one example of the broader trend, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 

between 1979 and 2007, inflation-adjusted, pretax income for a household in the top 

1 percent more than doubled, while, in contrast, income for a household in the middle of
