standard setters developed a framework and a set of policy measures intended to reduce the 

moral hazard risks posed by systemically important financial institutions.  These measures are 

intended to make the financial system more resilient, for example through higher capital and 

liquidity requirements, while simultaneously allowing these institutions to fail without causing 

disruption to critical services, such as payments.  A key element of the FSBâ€™s policy measures to 

address too big to fail is its total loss absorbing capacity standard.  Under this standard, the FSB 

introduced a bail-in (in contrast to a bailout) strategy that necessarily employs a gone concern or 

post-failure loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity for the set of global systemically 

important banks.  

Crucially, by raising resolution standards, we have improved the potential for non-

disruptive bank failure.  The implementation of these standards is most advanced in the banking 

sector, especially for the largest globally important banks.  The FSB established crisis 

management groups, collections of supervisors who monitor resolution plans of the firms.  At the 

same time, we must be conscious that we have not actually tested the failure of a large bank in 

the marketplace--surely a good thing! 

 Standing over a decade on from the start of the financial crisis, we must ask ourselves, 

how effective have we been at reducing the problem of too big to fail?  Have we achieved our 

objective to reduce or eliminate the problem?  Have we introduced new unintended risks to the 

financial system or costs to other financial market participants? 

To start answering these important questions, as part of its broader effort to evaluate the 

effects of reforms, the FSB is launching an evaluation of the effects of these too-big-to-fail 

reforms.  We intend to bring analytical rigor to these questions, and we recognize that the 

academic community has undertaken much work in this area.  As a result, we will draw
