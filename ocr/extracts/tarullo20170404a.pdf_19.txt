stress minimum capital requirements a short time in which to adjust its plan.12  Last fall, I gave a 

speech in which I previewed the Board’s additional thinking on this subject, following the 

Board’s year-long review of the stress testing program.13  One point was our intention to remove 

the “qualitative” part of the annual stress testing exercise for participating banks with less than 

$250 billion in assets.  We have since done just that, in recognition of the fact that these firms 

had generally met the supervisory expectations for capital planning and risk management put in 

place after the crisis.  In that speech I also indicated that the Board of Governors was considering 

a significant revision to our stress testing program that would both integrate it into other 

applicable capital requirements and begin to reduce the amount of attention directed at the annual 

announcement of stress test results. 

The proposal for what our staff has called a “stress capital buffer” (SCB) would simplify 

our capital regime by replacing the existing 2.5 percent fixed capital conservation buffer 

applicable to all banks with a buffer requirement equal to the maximum decline in a firm’s 

common equity ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the stress test.14  This change would, 

of course, apply only to the roughly 30 banks that participate in the supervisory stress test.  This 

buffer would be recalculated after every year’s stress test.  Then, through the succeeding year, a 

bank would have to observe the constraints on capital distributions written into our point-in-time 

capital requirements if its capital ratio fell below the sum of our minimum capital requirement 

and the applicable stress capital buffer. 

                                                 
12 This change did not lead to any reduction in the post-stress capital requirements.  It simply gave the firm an 
opportunity to reduce its planned capital distributions so that they would not lead to a quantitative objection.

14  The SCB would be floored at 2.5 percent such that if a firm’s maximum common equity tier 1 capital ratio 
decline under the severely adverse scenario is less than 2.5 percent, its SCB would be 2.5 percent.
