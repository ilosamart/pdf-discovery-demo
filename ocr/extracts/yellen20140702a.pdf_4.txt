objectives.  Such situations are important, since it is only when conflicts arise that 

policymakers need to weigh the tradeoffs among multiple objectives.  But it is important 

to note that, in many ways, the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals 

of price stability and full employment.  A smoothly operating financial system promotes 

the efficient allocation of saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and 

employment.  A strong labor market contributes to healthy household and business 

balance sheets, thereby contributing to financial stability.  And price stability contributes 

not only to the efficient allocation of resources in the real economy, but also to reduced 

uncertainty and efficient pricing in financial markets, which in turn supports financial 

stability. 

Despite these complementarities, monetary policy has powerful effects on risk 

taking.  Indeed, the accommodative policy stance of recent years has supported the 

recovery, in part, by providing increased incentives for households and businesses to take 

on the risk of potentially productive investments.  But such risk-taking can go too far, 

thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.1  This possibility does not 

obviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full 

employment--the costs to society in terms of deviations from price stability and full 

employment that would arise would likely be significant.  I will highlight these potential 

costs and the clear need for a macroprudential policy approach by looking back at the 

vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy before the crisis.  I will also discuss how these 

1 The possibility that periods of relative economic stability may contribute to risk-taking and the buildup of 
imbalances that may unwind in a painful manner is often linked to the ideas of Hyman Minsky (see 
Hyman P. Minsky (1992), “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” Working Paper 74 (Annandale-on-
Hudson, N.Y.:  Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, May), 
www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf).   For a recent example of an economic model that tries to explore 
these ideas, see, for example, Markus K. Brunnermeier and Yuliy Sannikov (2014), “A Macroeconomic 
Model with a Financial Sector,” American Economic Review, vol. 104 (February), pp. 379-421.
