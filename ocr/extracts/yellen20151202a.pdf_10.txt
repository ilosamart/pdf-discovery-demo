would depend on what the incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the 

associated risks to that outlook.   

In the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its 

judgment that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds 

rate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were 

reasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent 

objective over the medium term.  That initial rate increase would reflect the Committee’s 

judgment, based on a range of indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a 

pace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to 

2 percent, even after the reduction in policy accommodation.  As I have already noted, I 

currently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or 

two to result in further improvement in the labor market.  Ongoing gains in the labor 

market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain 

reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 

2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane. 

Committee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is 

uncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our 

projections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  In particular, recent 

monetary policy decisions have reflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate 

near zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, 

and employment than to downside shocks.  This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate 

to be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case
