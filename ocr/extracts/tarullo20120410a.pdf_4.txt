 Though conceived and developed in the midst of the financial crisis, SCAP will be 

remembered as a watershed for supervisory policies applicable to large institutions.  Congress 

drew on the lessons of the 2009 exercise by including a requirement for stress testing in the 2010 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  But well 

before Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, the SCAP experience had already profoundly 

affected attitudes toward supervision within the Federal Reserve.  It demonstrated in practice, not 

just in theory, the value of a simultaneous, forward-looking projection of potential losses and 

revenue effects based on each bank’s own portfolio and circumstances.  The forward-looking 

feature overcame the limitations of static capital ratios.  The simultaneity, along with stress test 

features such as an assumed instantaneous market shock, introduced a critical macroprudential 

dimension that offered insights into the condition of the entire financial system, including 

whether banks were sufficiently resilient to continue to provide their critical intermediation 

functions even under such adverse conditions.   

 Regular and rigorous stress testing thus provides regulators with knowledge that can be 

applied to both microprudential and macroprudential supervision efforts.  Disclosure of the 

methodology and firm-specific results of our stress testing has additional regulatory benefits.  

First, the release of details about assumptions, methods, and conclusions exposes the supervisory 

approach to greater outside scrutiny and discussion.  Such discussions will almost surely help us 

improve our assumptions and methodology over time.  Second, because bank portfolios are 

difficult to value without a great deal of detailed information, the test results should be very 

useful to investors in and counterparties of the largest institutions.  The market discipline 

promoted by means such as resolution mechanisms will be most effective if market participants 

have adequate information with which to make informed judgments about the banks.
