unemployed longer than in the past.  And more people are underemployed as employers reduce 

costs by shifting to part-time staffing models. 3    

So far, most of the stabilization in the unemployment rate has come from a sharp 

reduction in layoffs and terminations.  We have not yet seen any substantial improvement in 

hiring rates.  Aggressive moves by businesses to reduce costs by cutting jobs and work hours 

have resulted in solid gains in aggregate productivity.  This bodes well for increased employment 

in the coming year, but I anticipate that employers will add jobs cautiously in order to preserve 

these cost savings and efficiency gains for as long as possible. 

Improvement in labor market conditions is clearly a key component of a sustained 

economic recovery.  It is important to note that unemployment is not distributed evenly across all 

segments of the population.  Men, young workers, and low-skilled job seekers are 

disproportionately affected by current job losses.4  Most notably for purposes of this discussion, 

the prolonged unemployment of so many low-skill workers, in particular, is increasing the 

demand for training and education.   

Retraining workers to acquire the skills demanded in todayâ€™s job market is an ongoing 

challenge as employment shifts away from low-skill manufacturing toward the service sector, 

technology, and health care.  The recent economic crisis and the rise in unemployment have only 

made the need to retrain workers more urgent.   

Effective workforce development is necessary to ensure that workers have the skills they 

need to find new employment and that communities have a consistent supply of well-qualified 

workers to remain competitive.  Traditional workforce development strategies include pre-

employment training and job placement to help low- and moderate-income people transition
