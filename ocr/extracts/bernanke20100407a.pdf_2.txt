This is a momentous time.  During the past two and a half years, our nation has 

endured the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis that in turn

and economic downturn, with a particular focus on the policy response of my institution, 

the Federal Reserve.  I will then turn to some near-term and longer-term challenges 

facing our country.

home prices.  The housing slump in turn brought to light some very poor lending 

practices, especially for subprime mortgages extended to less-creditworthy borrowers.  

Relative to the global financial system, the market for subprime mortgages was quite 

small, probably less than 1 percent of global financial assets.  How, then, did problems in
