no effect. 5  In addition, there is limited evidence of any decline in consumption volatility 

due to increased financial openness.  More generally, capital has been observed to flow 

from capital-poor emerging market economies to capital-rich advanced economies over 

the past decade, a finding that appears to undermine one of the central rationales for free 

capital mobility. 

 These empirical results notwithstanding, it may be that benefits exist but are 

difficult to identify in empirical research due to methodological difficulties in measuring 

financial openness, issues of endogeneity, and the coincidence of greater openness with 

other types of reform.  But the failure of the empirical literature to identify clear gains 

from financial openness likely also reflects that countries have struggled to effectively 

manage sizable flows of capital.   

 Notably, a separate literature that considers the link between domestic financial 

development and growth finds somewhat stronger evidence for such a relationship.6  This 

research finds that countries with stronger domestic financial systems grow faster, partly 

because firms are better able to access financing from sources besides their own retained 

earnings.7  This finding suggests that the benefits of greater financial openness among 

countries may be larger than has been identified to date. 

Managing Capital Inflows 

 Despite the practical challenges associated with managing capital inflows, we 

should be careful not to conclude that limiting capital mobility is a first-best policy 

                                                 
5 See Obstfeld (2008) and Kose and others (2006) for a survey of the empirical literature.  One example of 
a paper using cross-country data that finds little evidence of a connection is Edison and others (2002); an 
example of a paper using firm-level data that finds a more substantial effect is Chari and Henry (2004). 
6 See Levine (2005) for a survey of research on the link between financial development and growth. 
7 Recently some researchers have argued that the financial sector can become so large relative to the size of 
the economy that it begins to harm growth.  See Arcand, Berkes, and Panizza (2011) for an example.
