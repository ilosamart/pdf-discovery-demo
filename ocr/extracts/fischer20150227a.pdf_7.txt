Indeed, testing to date suggests that ON RRP operations have generally been successful 

in establishing a soft floor for money market interest rates.6 

The Fed could also employ other tools, such as term deposits issued through the 

Term Deposit Facility and term RRPs, to help drain reserves and put additional upward 

pressure on short-term interest rates.  We have been testing these tools and believe they 

would help support money market rates, if needed.   

Finally, with regard to balance sheet normalization, the FOMC has indicated that 

it does not anticipate sales of agency mortgage-backed securities, and that it plans to 

normalize the size of the balance sheet primarily by ceasing reinvestment of principal 

payments on its existing securities holdings when the time comes.  As illustrated in 

figure 4, cumulative repayments of principal on our existing securities holdings from now 

through the end of 2025 are projected to be about $3.2 trillion.  As a result, when the 

FOMC chooses to cease reinvestments, the size of the balance sheet will naturally 

decline, with a corresponding reduction in reserve balances.   

Conclusion 

I will close by highlighting that the Fed’s asset purchases have been a critical 

means by which the FOMC has provided policy accommodation at the zero lower bound 

on nominal interest rates.  In other words, the Fed--and other central banks--can 

implement an expansionary monetary policy even when the policy interest rate is at the
