community banks face.  I want to be careful not to overstate those challenges--to 

paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of your demise are greatly exaggerated--and I believe 

that the community bank model has many advantages and will continue to play an 

integral role in our financial system.  

These sorts of dynamics are one reason that community banks are an important 

topic for research.  As you probably know, this is the sixth annual community banking 

conference cosponsored by the Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank 

Supervisors (CSBS), and it is the first conference for which the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation is joining as a cosponsor.  The organizers of the inaugural 

conference decided that, rather than holding a traditional academic-style conference, they 

would invite bankers and bank supervisors to hear what the researchers had to say and to 

share their real-world experience with the researchers.  The hope was that these 

interactions would prove beneficial to all three groups.  The positive feedback that we 

have received from conference attendees over the past five years strongly supports the 

wisdom of the organizersâ€™ decision.  

Over time, the conference has evolved, with some new features introduced each 

year.  The Case Study Competition, which is sponsored by the CSBS, introduces 

undergraduates to community banking and some of the challenges that community 

bankers face.  The Emerging Scholars Program was also added to the conference a few 

years ago.  This program is intended to support Ph.D. students who are considering or 

working on a dissertation on a banking-related topic and encourage them to develop a 

research agenda that focuses on community banking issues.  I would like to congratulate
