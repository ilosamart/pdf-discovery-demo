existing facilities to boost the provision of liquidity in their local currencies.  The types of 

facilities have varied across countries commensurate with differences in financial 

systems.  In the euro area, where the banking sector plays a relatively large role in 

financial intermediation, the ECB focused on increasing liquidity to banks.  Similarly, the
