decreased.  In addition, low interest rates and lower house prices have made 

homeownership potentially more affordable.  In fact, by one measure, housing is 

hovering around its most affordable level in the 22-year history of the series.5  Of course, 

tight credit standards have precluded many households from taking advantage of the 

affordable conditions.  Over time, however, as the economy continues to grow and credit 

conditions improve, more households should be able to benefit from the greater 

affordability. 

The Housing Market in Low- and Moderate-Income Communities 

 As I indicated earlier--and as many of you already know--these sobering national 

trends have had even more devastating effects in low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods.  To investigate this issue further, researchers at the Federal Reserve 

classified neighborhoods into three broad categories: low and moderate income, middle 

income, and high income.6  A comparison of housing and mortgage market conditions in 

low- and moderate-income neighborhoods with conditions in high-income neighborhoods 

reveals several interesting facts.7 

 One notable fact is that house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods 

rose more than in other neighborhoods during the national boom in house prices, and 

subsequently fell more during the bust.  For example, from 1998 through 2006, house 

prices, as measured by the CoreLogic repeat-sales house price index, rose 11 percent per

6 Zip codes and census tracts were classified by whether median household income in that Zip code or 
census tract was below 80 percent of the median in its metropolitan statistical area, 80 to 120 percent of the 
median, or more than 120 percent of the median.  These income thresholds are used under the Community 
Reinvestment Act to identify neighborhoods as low and moderate, middle, or high income.  Under this 
scheme, a neighborhood is low income relative to other neighborhoods in its own metropolitan statistical 
area. 
7 As might be expected, conditions in middle-income neighborhoods lie between the low- and moderate-
income and high-income neighborhoods.
