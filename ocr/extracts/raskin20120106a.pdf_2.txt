Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon.  It is always a 

pleasure to be back in Baltimore and to see so many old friends.  I was here during the 

most intense days of the financial crisis, and I will never forget how bankers worked 

around the clock to ensure that the credit needs of Maryland residents and businesses 

could continue to be met--a dedicated effort that benefited communities across the state.  

That episode is behind us now, but community banks continue to face numerous 

challenges, including challenges from an enhanced regulatory regime that has evolved in 

the wake of the crisis.  This regime includes the potential effects of the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  From my many 

conversations with you, I have a sense of the challenges that you face regarding the 

changing regulatory landscape.  Against that backdrop, I appreciate the opportunity to 

speak at the First Friday Economic Outlook, at the start of a promising new year, and 

share my thoughts with you on two vitally important topics:  how the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

monetary policy aims to increase the availability of credit to foster economic growth, and 

how we are tailoring our examination and supervision of community banks to ensure that 

we are not inadvertently constraining lending.   

I believe that examination and supervision of community banks is a timely and 

important topic.  Why do I say that?  Because, as I will discuss shortly, lending by 

community banks plays an important role in the ongoing economic recovery, especially 

by providing credit to small businesses.  And it is absolutely critical that examination and 

supervision do not produce outcomes that are barriers to small business expansion.
