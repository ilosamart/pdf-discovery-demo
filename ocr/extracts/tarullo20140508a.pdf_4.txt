 were oriented mostly toward protecting the insured 

depository institution and the federal deposit insurance fund (DIF) from possible depredation by 

those nonbank  businesses.  The activities of broker-dealers, for example, were relevant to 

prudential regulation only insofar as they affected an affiliated depository institution.   

 Of course, banking law had not only tried to protect the DIF from the risky activities of 

banks and their affiliates.  It had also, albeit far less explicitly, tried to protect banks from 

nonbank competition and, to some degree, from each other.

  Just as banks were supposed to 

stick to their knitting—the business of banking—so everyone else was supposed to stay out of 

that business.  But as we all know, the distinction between demand for commercial bank loans 

and for investment bank underwriting of public debt issuance was never absolute, and in the 

1970s it began to erode more rapidly with the growth of capital markets and financial 

innovations such as money market funds.   

The financial crisis has confirmed that the pre-crisis regulatory structure reflected a view 

of the financial system that was at once too broad and too narrow.  It was too broad in that 

prudential rules generally applied to all banks and bank holding companies through a 

microprudential approach focused on the soundness of each individual bank.  The rules were 

implemented somewhat differently, based on the size and relative complexity of banking 

organizations, and separate supervisory portfolios were created.  But the principles informing 

regulation were basically the same whether the institution was a community bank or a holding 

company with a $1 trillion balance sheet whose failure might shake the entire financial system.

 For example, restrictions on branching across state lines and, in some cases, within states limited competition 

significantly until they were loosened through statutory changes, such as the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking & 

Branching Efficiency Act, P.L. 103-328 (1994).
