policymakers could commit to enacting in the near term a clear and specific plan for 

stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP within the next few years and then subsequently 

setting that ratio on a downward path.  Indeed, such a trajectory for the ratio of debt to 

GDP is comparable to the one proposed by the National Commission on Fiscal 

Responsibility and Reform.4  To make the framework more explicit, the President and 

congressional leadership could agree on a definite timetable for reaching decisions about 

both shorter-term budget adjustments and longer-term changes.  Fiscal policymakers 

could look now to find substantial savings in the 10-year budget window, enforced by 

well-designed budget rules, while simultaneously undertaking additional reforms to 

address the long-term sustainability of entitlement programs.  Such a framework could 

include a commitment to make a down payment on fiscal consolidation by enacting 

legislation to reduce the structural deficit over the next several years.   

Conclusion 

The task of developing and implementing sustainable fiscal policies is daunting, 

and it will involve many agonizing decisions and difficult tradeoffs.  But meeting this 

challenge in a timely manner is crucial for our nation.  History makes clear that failure to 

put our fiscal house in order will erode the vitality of our economy, reduce the standard 

of living in the United States, and increase the risk of economic and financial instability.
