economies and a stabilization in commodity prices should, in turn, boost the growth 

prospects of emerging market economies.   

A final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal 

policy.  This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly 

neutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and 

fiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on 

growth.4  Also, the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved 

as the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing 

them to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of 

the Great Recession.  Looking ahead, I anticipate that total real government purchases of 

goods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the 

next few years.5   

Regarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in 

prices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year.  

With less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure 

from a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up 

to the FOMCâ€™s 2 percent objective over the next few years.  Of course, inflation 

expectations play an important role in the inflation process, and my forecast of a return to 

our 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment that longer-term 

inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  In this regard, recent measures 

                                                   
4 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on 
economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth 
roughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would 
have been otherwise.  See Congressional Budget Office (2015a).
