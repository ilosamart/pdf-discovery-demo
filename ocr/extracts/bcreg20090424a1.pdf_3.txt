The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: 
Design and Implementation 

I. Introduction and Executive Summary 
Most U.S. banking organizations currently have capital levels well in excess of the amounts 

required to be well capitalized. However, losses associated with the deepening recession and financial 

market turmoil have substantially reduced the capital of some banks. Lower overall levels of capital— 

especially common equity—along with the uncertain economic environment have eroded public 

confidence in the amount and quality of capital held by some firms, which is impairing the ability of the 

banking system overall to perform its critical role of credit intermediation. Given the heightened 

uncertainty around the future course of the U.S. economy and potential losses in the banking system, 

supervisors believe it prudent for large bank holding companies (BHCs) to hold additional capital to 

provide a buffer against higher losses than generally expected, and still remain sufficiently capitalized at 

over the next two years and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers should such losses materialize. The 

purpose of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), which is being conducted by the 

supervisory agencies, is to assess the size of these capital needs. 

The SCAP is a forward-looking exercise designed to estimate losses, revenues, and reserve needs 

for BHCs in 2009 and 2010 under two macroeconomic scenarios, including one that is more adverse 

than expected. Should the assessment indicate the need for a BHC to raise capital or improve the 

quality of its capital to better withstand losses that could occur under more stressful-than-expected 

conditions, supervisors will expect that firm to augment its capital to create a buffer. This buffer would 

be drawn down over time if losses were to occur. In evaluating the SCAP results, it is important to 

recognize that the assessment is a "what if" exercise intended to help supervisors gauge the extent of 

additional capital needs across a range of potential economic outcomes. A need for additional capital or 

a change in composition of capital to build a buffer under an economic scenario that is more adverse 

than expected is not a measure of the current solvency or viability of the firm. 

This paper describes the SCAP process conducted by the federal bank regulatory agencies (the 
agencies) from Feb. 25, 2009 through late April of 2009.1 [Footnote 1. The federal bank regulatory agencies that 
participated in the SCAP are the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Banks, 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. End footnote 1.] All 
domestic BHCs with year-end 2008 assets exceeding $100 billion were required to participate in the SCAP as part 
of the ongoing supervisory process. These 19 firms collectively hold two-thirds of the assets and more than one-half 
of the loans in the U.S. banking system, and support a very significant portion of the credit intermediation done by 
the banking sector. The firms were asked to project their credit losses and revenues for the two years 2009 
and 2010, including the level of reserves that would be needed at the end of 2010 to cover expected 
losses in 2011, under two alternative economic scenarios. The baseline scenario reflected the consensus 
expectation in February 2009 among professional forecasters on the depth and duration of the 
recession, while the more adverse scenario was designed to characterize a recession that is longer and 
more severe than the consensus expectation. The firms were also asked to provide supporting 
documentation for their projected losses and resources, including information on projected income and
