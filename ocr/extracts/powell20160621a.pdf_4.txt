workable and credible plan for creating liquidity in a new rate and beginning the process of 

moving trading to it.     

We need input from end users and others to finalize the ARRCâ€™s plans, and I look 

forward to hearing the views of those in attendance.  Successful implementation will require a 

coordinated effort from a broad set of market participants.  This effort will certainly entail costs, 

but continued reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR on the current scale could entail much higher costs 

if unsecured short-term borrowing declines further and submitting banks choose to leave the 

LIBOR panels, especially if there were no viable alternative rate.  Simply put, this effort is 

something that needs to happen, and if the ARRC members, the official sector, and end users and 

other market participants all jointly coordinate in finalizing these plans, then a successful 

transition can be made with the least disruption to the market, leaving everyone in a better place.
