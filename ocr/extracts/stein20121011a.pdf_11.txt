the 10-year rate directly, via asset purchases--without changing the future path of short 

rates--the usual historical relationships will continue to apply.   

While we should acknowledge these doubts, it is important to keep them in 

perspective.  In addition to lowering interest rates, LSAPs also boost equity prices and 

other asset values.  Taken together, these effects of LSAPs seem likely to be meaningful, 

even if the benefits of an impetus to rates are less than in the baseline scenario sketched 

earlier.  And to be sure, there is a wide confidence interval around any estimate we might 

make of the benefits.   

Moreover, it is worth repeating a point made earlier: whatever direct hydraulic 

effects LSAPs create by pushing down term premiums and discount rates, their overall 

impact may be reinforced via a signaling effect, whereby they enhance the credibility of 

our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate.  Indeed, this 

signaling benefit strikes me as an important part of the argument in favor of LSAPs in the 

current environment. 

Let me turn now to the cost side of the equation.  Several potential costs of 

LSAPs have been discussed.  One is the exit problem--that a large balance sheet may 

make it harder for the FOMC to raise rates when the time comes.  Between the ability to 

pay interest on reserves, as well as various reserve-draining methods that the Fed has 

been methodically testing, I am confident that we have the tools to raise rates.  If the 

FOMC needs to act in the face of an emerging threat to price stability, there is little doubt 

in my mind that we can.  As to whether we will, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly made 

clear its commitment to both sides of its mandate--to price stability as well as to 

maximum employment.
