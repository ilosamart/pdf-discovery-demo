path of policy that is likely to prove appropriate, given the Committee’s objectives and its 

outlook for the economy.   

The views of Committee members regarding the likely timing of policy firming 

represent a balance of many factors, but the current forward guidance is broadly 

consistent with prescriptions coming from a range of standard benchmarks, including 

simple policy rules and optimal control methods.23  Some of the policy rules informing 

the forward guidance relate policy interest rates to familiar determinants, such as inflation 

and the output gap.  But a number of considerations also argue for planning to keep rates 

low for a longer time than implied by policy rules developed during more normal periods.  

These considerations include the need to take out insurance against the realization of 

downside risks, which are particularly difficult to manage when rates are close to their 

effective lower bound; the possibility that, because of various unusual headwinds slowing 

the recovery, the economy needs more policy support than usual at this stage of the cycle; 

and the need to compensate for limits to policy accommodation resulting from the lower 

bound on rates.24  

Has the forward guidance been effective?  It is certainly true that, over time, both 

investors and private forecasters have pushed out considerably the date at which they 

expect the federal funds rate to begin to rise; moreover, current policy expectations 

appear to align well with the FOMC’s forward guidance.  To be sure, the changes over 

time in when the private sector expects the federal funds rate to begin firming resulted in

24 On responding to unusual headwinds (technically, a situation in which a lower real interest rate is 
required to achieve full employment), see Williams (2009).  On risk management near the zero lower 
bound, see Orphanides and Wieland (2000).  On compensating for limits to policy accommodation 
attributable to the lower bound on rates, see Reifschneider and Williams (2000).  Another argument for 
sustaining low rates follows because optimal policies may involve a slow, or “inertial,” adjustment of rates; 
see, for example, Woodford (2003).
