  This panel will focus on the settlement infrastructure for U.S. government securities -- a 

vital component of the Treasury market and one that is undergoing an important transition.  This 

segment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades 

now.  Thirty years ago, there were six banks providing a full suite of settlement services for U.S. 

government securities.  Due to mergers and exits, two firms, Bank of New York Mellon 

(BNYM) and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC), have been the two dominant providers of these 

services since the 1990s.  And soon there will be just one, given JPMC’s planned exit. 

  Given the importance of these services, the official sector has had a long involvement as 

the market structure has evolved.  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal 

Reserve convened the private-sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and 

Settlement to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to 

these services.  That work led to the “NewBank” proposal.1  Although the proposal was 

ultimately put aside, NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring 

into action in the event of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the 

clearing banks. Some of today’s panelists were actively involved in that work.  Of course, at that 

time, the business was roughly evenly split between the two providers.   Today’s situation is very 

different – BNYM now has over 80 percent market share, due mainly to consolidation among 

end users.    

 The Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to 

ensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit.   JPMC has said that it recognizes the need
