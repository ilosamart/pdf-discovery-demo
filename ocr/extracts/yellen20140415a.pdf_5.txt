While it would be a mistake to give undue weight to any one study, this study 

provides some support for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and 

liquidity standards for large banks than have been adopted so far.   

As the Board continues to weigh such steps to further strengthen the financial 

system, I expect that conferences like the FMC will continue to be a vital part of the 

process, providing the ideas, analysis, and debate that will help us make the best possible 

judgments.  Thank you for listening and for this opportunity to be a part of this important 

conference.
