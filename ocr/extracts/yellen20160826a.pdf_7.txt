federal funds rate well below zero during the economic downturn.8  That doing so was 

impossible highlights the second serious limitation of our pre-crisis policy toolkit:  its 

inability to generate substantially more accommodation than could be provided by a near-

zero federal funds rate.  

Our Expanded Toolkit   

To address the challenges posed by the financial crisis and the subsequent severe 

recession and slow recovery, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its monetary 

policy toolkit.  In 2006, the Congress had approved plans to allow the Fed, beginning in 

2011, to pay interest on banks’ reserve balances.9  In the fall of 2008, the Congress 

moved up the effective date of this authority to October 2008.  That authority was 

essential.  Paying interest on reserve balances enables the Fed to break the strong link 

between the quantity of reserves and the level of the federal funds rate and, in turn, 

allows the Federal Reserve to control short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.  

In particular, once economic conditions warrant a higher level for market interest rates, 

the Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate paid on excess reserves--the IOER rate.  

                                                 
8 Consider the following policy rule:  R(t) = R* + π(t) + 0.5[π(t)-π*]-2.0[U(t)-U*], where R is the federal 

funds rate, R* is the longer-run normal value of the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation, π is the four-

quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, π* is the FOMC’s target for inflation (2 percent), U is the 

unemployment rate, and U* is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  Based on the medians of 

FOMC participants’ latest longer-run projections, R* is approximately 1 percent and U* is about 

4.8 percent.  Accordingly, with the unemployment rate climbing to 10 percent and core PCE inflation 

falling to 1 percent in 2009, this rule would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 

9 percent at the depths of the recession.  In contrast, the standard Taylor rule, which is half as responsive to 

movements in resource utilization, would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 

3-3/4 percent using the same estimates for R* and U*.  The more aggressive rule does a reasonably good 

job of accounting for movements in the federal funds rate in the decade prior to its falling to its effective 

lower bound in late 2008, see David Reifschneider (2016), “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond 

to Future Recessions,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-068 (Washington:  Board of

Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank.
