Third, and most importantly, I believe these proposals fail to anticipate the 

significant costs and risks of subjecting monetary policy to political pressure and 

constraining the Fed’s ability to carry out its traditional role of providing liquidity in a 

crisis. 

Appropriate and Effective 

There is no dispute that the Fed’s actions after the onset of the financial crisis 

were unprecedented in scale and scope.   

To help stabilize the financial system and keep credit flowing to households and 

businesses, the Federal Reserve lent to banks through the discount window and to 

financial institutions and markets through numerous new broad-based lending facilities it 

created using emergency lending authority granted by the Congress during the Great 

Depression.4  In a limited number of cases, the Fed also extended liquidity support to 

individual institutions whose imminent failure threatened to bring down the global 

financial system. 

At the same time, the Federal Reserve used monetary policy to help stabilize the 

economy.  After cutting our target for the overnight interest rate on loans between banks-

-our usual monetary policy tool--as low as it could go, the Fed took further action using 

unconventional policy tools.  These policies involved communication, providing 

“forward guidance” that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expected to keep 

rates low for longer than had been expected, and also purchasing large amounts of 

longer-term Treasury debt and other securities to put downward pressure on long-term 

interest rates.
