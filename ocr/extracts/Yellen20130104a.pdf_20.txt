requirements diminish the likelihood of the kind of information gridlock explored by 

Caballero and Simsek.   

More controversially, the proposed framework requires the collection of initial 

margin.  While variation margin collateralizes current derivatives losses, initial margin 

collateralizes future losses that could occur in the event of a counterpartyâ€™s default.  In 

essence, initial margin is a kind of performance bond.  In the event that a counterparty 

does not perform as required, the initial margin is used to replace the position with a new 

counterparty.       

It is here that some of the most significant policy tradeoffs arise, because higher 

initial margin requirements will make it more costly for market participants to use 

derivatives to hedge risk.  Liquid resources that are set aside as initial margin cannot be 

deployed for other purposes.  Given the sheer size and scope of derivatives markets, 

requiring initial margin on all derivatives transactions could result in significant 

opportunity and liquidity costs.  In a public comment letter to the Federal Reserve and 

other regulators, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association estimated that 

initial margin requirements could lock up as much as $1.7 trillion in liquid assets 

globally.

  This number is eye opening, to say the least.  In an effort to better gauge the 

liquidity costs of initial margin requirements, the Federal Reserve, as part of the 

international group of prudential and market regulators that issued the July proposal, has 

conducted a detailed impact study to quantify the liquidity costs associated with initial 

margin requirements.  The results of this study, as well as comments received on the 

proposal, will help ensure that in the final framework, the need to reduce systemic risk is 

appropriately balanced against the resulting liquidity costs.
