the solvency and functioning of these institutions.  Leverage at intermediaries is much 

reduced relative to pre-crisis norms, and gross leverage at hedge funds, based on the 

partial information available, has not changed much in recent years.  Research from 

economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the decline in leverage, 

among other factors, has substantially reduced potential fire sale externalities in the 

banking and broker-dealer sectors.14  Thus, the regulatory changes appear to be having a 

positive effect on financial system stability, and these benefits may outweigh the 

potential costs of a possible reduction in liquidity.  

Regulatory changes are in train for the asset management industry, whose 

vulnerabilities have been under examination by the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

and the Financial Stability Board.15  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has 

recently approved rules to modernize and enhance the reporting and disclosure of 

information by registered investment companies and to enhance liquidity risk 

management by open-end funds, including mutual funds and certain exchange-traded 

funds.16  The SEC has also proposed rules that would put new limits on registered 

fundsâ€™ gross notional derivative exposures, enhance the requirements for asset 

segregation in derivatives transactions, and include new risk-management requirements 

for the use of derivatives.17
