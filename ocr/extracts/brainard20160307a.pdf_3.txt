on consumer confidence and the boost to household purchasing power from persistent 

declines in energy prices. 

The housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year.  

With housing activity well below pre-recession norms, it appears there is still scope for 

continued growth in construction activity.   

In contrast, sectors of the economy that are sensitive to energy prices or 

international demand have been a drag.  In response to the plunge in oil prices, 

investment in drilling and mining structures fell 50 percent last year, and continued 

reductions in the number of drilling rigs this year suggest that further declines are likely.2  

At the same time, firms and workers in the energy sector have experienced extreme 

financial difficulties and severe job losses.  

Although the euro area and Japan are recovering, their demand growth remains 

very low, despite extraordinary monetary accommodation.  In emerging market 

economies growth last year came in at only one-half the average rate from 2009 to 2013.  

Because China has accounted for one-third of the growth in world Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP) and trade, the recent slippage in Chinese economic growth is having an 

important effect globally.  Even if Chinese growth does not slide further, the changing 

composition of its growth toward consumption and services and away from resource-

intensive manufacturing and investment will pose important challenges to commodity 

exporters and other emerging economies, especially since China had previously 

accounted for upwards of one-half of global imports of many base metals. 

                                                 
2 Despite the drop-off in drilling investment, oil production has been surprisingly resilient, as producers 
have increased the productivity of established wells.
