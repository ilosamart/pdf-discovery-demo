homes by REO holders, now account for 30 percent of home sales.  Although it is 

difficult to forecast future REO flows, we estimate that an additional 1 million foreclosed 

properties could be added to the REO held by banks, guarantors, and servicers in each of 

the next few years.  These inflows will continue to exert downward pressure on home 

prices.    

In contrast to the markets for owner-occupied homes, rental housing markets 

across the nation have recently strengthened somewhat, as I mentioned earlier.  Fueled by 

increased demand from families who are either unable or reluctant to purchase homes, 

rents are up and vacancy rates for multifamily properties are down in most metropolitan 

areas.     

With home prices falling and rents rising, it could make sense in some markets to 

turn some of the foreclosed homes into rental properties.  According to Federal Reserve 

staff calculations, most REO properties are in neighborhoods with median house values 

and incomes that are roughly similar to the medians for the metropolitan area overall.

Moreover, these properties are not unusually far, in terms of commuting times, from 

where jobs are located.

  We have compared computations of the expected annual cash 

flows from renting properties to the discounted prices that REO property holders 

typically receive when selling a home.  The comparison suggests that some REO holders 

might come out ahead by renting, rather than by selling, some of their properties.

 More precisely, Federal Reserve staff estimate that about 75 percent of REO properties are in 

neighborhoods where the median house values and incomes are greater than 80 percent of the medians for 

the metropolitan area.

 Data on median home values, income, and commute times are from the 2000 census, available on the 

U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html.
