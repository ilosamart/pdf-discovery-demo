putback risk for securitized mortgages, and the substantial part of the underwater 

mortgage problem that cannot be solved by refinancing.  But I believe that MBS 

purchases are worth considering as a monetary policy option precisely because they carry 

the promise of addressing the feature of the current aggregate demand shortfall that 

differs from typical recessions and recoveries. 

Conclusion 

 Many labor market problems took years to develop, and they will not be 

remedied quickly.  The employment situation we hope for will require an extended 

commitment over many years.  As I said earlier, I am not even going to try to do justice 

to the longer-term employment policy agenda.  It is easy to echo the nearly universal call 

for improvements in education, innovation in retraining, and other more effective labor 

market policies.  It is harder to specify what those policies are, much less how to fund 

them.  But I do want to emphasize that the challenge is more than determining which 

education and training policies are both effective and affordable.   

The nation needs a model for economic growth that will generate innovation and 

productivity enhancements that will, in turn, generate the kinds of jobs for which we hope 

we are educating and training our people.  For much of the past decade, the implicit 

growth model was too heavily dependent on the assumption of ever-rising home prices.  

Needless to say, that model did not work out so well.  Elements of the needed model 

include a healthy macroeconomic environment and a well-functioning financial system.  

But there should also be a premium on measures that expand the growth potential of the 

country even as they support near-term economic activity.
