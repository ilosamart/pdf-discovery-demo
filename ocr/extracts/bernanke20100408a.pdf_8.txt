form which was not well anticipated by financial institutions or regulators.  In an 

additional variation on the theme of the bank run, in September 2008 money market 

mutual funds saw massive outflows after one prominent fund suffered losses related to 

the failure of Lehman Brothers. 

 The Federal Reserve, with its discount window, was well positioned to provide 

liquidity to banks by making short-term, collateralized loans.  (The discount window was 

the tool the Federal Reserve could have used, had it chosen, to stem the banking panics of 

the 1930s.)  However, our traditional tools, developed in an earlier era, were of little use 

in addressing panic in the shadow banking system or in the money market mutual fund 

industry.  So, we engaged in what I call “blue sky thinking”--generating many ideas.  

Most were discarded, but, crucially, some led to the development of new ways for the 

Federal Reserve to fulfill the traditional stabilization function of central banks.  Using 

emergency authority last employed during the Depression, we created an array of new 

facilities to provide backstop liquidity to the financial system (and, as a byproduct, 

coined many new acronyms).  Thus, we were able to help restore the flow of credit to 

American families and businesses by shoring up important financial markets, such as 

those for commercial paper and securities backed by consumer loans. 

 Undoubtedly, researchers and scholars will devote considerable energy in the 

years ahead to expanding and refining the lessons this most recent crisis has provided us.  

I hope that some of you might contribute to that endeavor.  I congratulate the Center 

fellows whose work is also being recognized this evening and thank you, once again, for 

honoring me with the Hamilton Award.
