internal models could undermine our desire for consistent, cross-firm comparisons and can lack 

transparency to market participants and supervisors.   

Another framework that could have informed the development of the BBA is the ICS, but 

much of ICS’s evolution has been in the direction of a valuation method and overall framework 

that reflect approaches used elsewhere in the world.  This may not be optimal for the United 

States insurance market.  Importantly, the BBA will appropriately reflect, rather than unduly 

penalize, long duration liabilities in the United States, facilitating the continued robustness of 

product availability in the U.S. that contributes to greater financial security for Americans.  In 

the U.S., an aggregation-based approach like the BBA could also strike a better balance between 

entity-level, and enterprise-wide, supervision of insurance firms.   

Having spoken enough about what the proposed BBA is not, I should spend some time 

previewing what it is, and I suspect there is some interest in this room about that topic.   

Preview of the Building Block Approach 

The proposed BBA is an approach to a consolidated capital requirement that considers all 

material risks within the enterprise by aggregating the capital positions of companies under an 

insurance holding company, after making some adjustments and scaling them to a common 

capital regime.  To streamline implementation burden while reflecting all material risks, I think it 

would make sense to use the NAIC’s insurance capital framework as the common capital regime.   

As the name implies, the BBA constructs “building blocks”--or groupings of entities in 

the supervised firm--that are covered under the same capital regime.  These building blocks are 

then used to calculate combined, enterprise-level capital resources and requirements.  In each 

building block, the BBA generally applies the capital regime for that block to the subsidiaries in
