account in part reflects sharp reversals in the current account deficits of Greece, Portugal, 

Spain, and Ireland--all countries that had witnessed large increases in their deficits during 

the global saving glut period prior to the crisis, in a pattern similar to that experienced by 

the United States.  However, the euro-area increase also reflects increased surpluses in 

Germany and the Netherlands, countries that were already in considerable surplus during 

the pre-crisis period.           

What, If Anything, Can Be Done about Low Interest Rates? 

Given the potential risks around low interest rates I discussed earlier, including 

the impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy and financial stability concerns, what 

should policymakers do to address the problem?   

Monetary policy has a role to play.  Transparent and sound monetary policy can 

boost confidence in the stability of the growth outlook, an outcome that can in turn 

alleviate precautionary demand for savings and encourage investment, pushing up the 

equilibrium interest rate.   

However, as I have said before--and Ben Bernanke before me--“Monetary policy 

is not a panacea.”19  Also, to repeat myself, policies to boost productivity growth and the 

longer-run potential of the economy are more likely to be found in effective fiscal and 

regulatory measures than in central bank actions.  This statement is true not only in the 

United States, but also around the globe.  But it is not to say that monetary policy is 

irrelevant to the growth rate of the economy. 


                                                 
19 See Bernanke (2012).  Of course, there are no panaceas--except, I have been told by experts, aspirin, and 
perhaps also statins.
