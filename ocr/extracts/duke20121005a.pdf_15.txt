to maintain their properties.  This combination of new measurements and old tools to develop 

solutions should serve as an example to many “traditional suburban” areas around the country 

that have experienced, and will continue to experience, vacancy issues.   

Conclusion 

The potential fallout of high rates of vacancy--blight, crime, lowered home values, and 

decreased property tax revenue--is the same for every neighborhood and community.  But there 

is no one-size-fits-all solution to the vacancy problem.  I’ve used some examples of communities 

around the country that are facing high vacancy rates in order to illustrate their different 

characteristics and the different origins of their vacancy problems.  Taking account of such 

differences will be important in crafting solutions to the problems caused by those vacancies.  

Hopefully, these examples and other ideas that have been shared throughout this conference will 

inspire new and creative solutions to the difficult issues faced by communities.  Certainly, 

different housing markets will recover in different ways and at different paces.  In some areas, 

the private market will lead the way, while in others, government will have to use precious 

resources wisely to catalyze recovery.   

The examples I’ve discussed also illustrate the value of using data to understand vacancy 

issues, to determine which neighborhoods are experiencing which challenges, and to design 

appropriate policy solutions.  Solving the problems of long-term vacancies will require the best 

efforts of public, private, and non-profit leaders locally and across the country.  I can assure you 

the Federal Reserve System will continue to support recovery through the use of all its policy 

tools and research capacity. 

Thank you.
