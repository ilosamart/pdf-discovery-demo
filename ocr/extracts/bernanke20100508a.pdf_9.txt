the all-star team.  Well, it appears to be a scientific fact that it’s not true.  No particular 

achievement or occurrence can guarantee long-term happiness by itself, because you will 

get used to your new status and your degree of happiness will eventually revert to 

something close to what it was before X, whatever it was, occurred.8  Interestingly, Adam 

Smith, the intellectual father of modern economics, understood this point; he once wrote:  

“[T]he mind of every man, in a longer or shorter time, returns to its natural and usual 

state of tranquility.  In prosperity, after a certain time, it falls back to that state; in 

adversity, after a certain time, it rises up to it.”9  Does this mean that achievement is not 

worth the effort, that nothing we can do can make us happy?  Not at all, and I’ll explain 

why in a moment. 

 But first, let’s revisit the central question.  If, as your parents always told you, 

money doesn’t buy happiness, then what factors do contribute to life satisfaction?  

Psychologists and economists have done good work on this point, going your parents one 

better by identifying statistically just what factors are linked to self-reported happiness 

and how short-run happiness is related to, but distinct from, long-run life satisfaction.10 

 Some of them won’t surprise you, but are nevertheless worth repeating.  Happy 

people tend to spend time with friends and family and put emphasis on social and 

community relationships.  We are social creatures.  Research has demonstrated that 

                                                      
8 The adaptation of mood or satisfaction to changing circumstances is called “hedonic adaptation” in some 
of the scholarly literature.  For a survey of related evidence, see Shane Frederick and George Loewenstein 
(1999), “Hedonic Adaptation,” chapter 16 in Daniel Kahneman, Ed Diener, and Norbert Schwarz, eds., 
Well-Being:  The Foundations of Hedonic Psychology (New York:  Russell Sage Foundation), pp. 302-29.

These authors summarize their findings as follows:  “We would emphasize that the happy person is blessed 
with a positive temperament, tends to look on the bright side of things, and does not ruminate excessively 
about bad events, and is living in an economically developed society, has social confidants, and possesses 
adequate resources for making progress toward valued goals” (p. 295).
