open until June for new CMBS, but the March subscriptions will be the last for all other 

ABS and previously issued CMBS.  We are also tightening the term on primary credit as 

we return to normal discount operations.  Earlier today, the Board announced that we had 

approved an increase in the discount rate, and that we are shortening the typical maturity 

for primary credit loans to overnight.    With these changes, we expect that banks will use 

private sources for normal funding and only use primary credit as a backup source of 

funds.  As I mentioned earlier, the discount rate is the rate we charge banks that borrow at

facilities to meet new challenges as the crisis unfolded.  We responded with care and with

liquidity facilities have been paid down to slightly more than $100 billion.  The funds 

were repaid without a single penny of loss, and we still expect to collect every dollar of 

the loans that remain outstanding.  We also continue to expect that we will ultimately 

incur no losses on the credit we extended to support Bear Stearns and AIG.  Lending such
