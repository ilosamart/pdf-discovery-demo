University of Baltimore.  I have learned a bit about you recently, with the help of the 

university’s staff.  Let me tell you a few things about some of your classmates that you

countries before coming to the University of Baltimore for a master’s degree.  Many of 

you have contributed to the sense of community at the University of Baltimore by

that can pave the way to college and graduate school.  You overcame obstacles to make it
