unconventional policy tools, although we always try to communicate policy as clearly as 

possible. 

Our forward guidance has evolved over time--from qualitative, to date-based, to 

quantitative guidance, and from largely unconditional to state-contingent guidance 

explaining how the Committee will react to future economic outcomes.  In March 2009, 

the Committee offered the qualitative guidance that it expected to hold the federal funds 

rate near zero “for an extended period.”

  In August 2011, the Committee moved to date-

based guidance, saying that it expected to hold the rate near zero at least until mid-2013.

In December 2012, the Committee adopted quantitative thresholds that were explicitly 

tied to future economic conditions.  In particular, it stated its intention to hold the policy 

rate near zero “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, 

inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half 

percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 

inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”

More recently, at the March 2014 FOMC meeting, as the 6-1/2 percent 

unemployment threshold approached, the Committee offered new guidance that 

contained qualitative and time-based elements but retained the state-contingent nature of 

the threshold guidance.  First, the Committee said that, in determining how long to hold 

the federal funds rate near zero, it “will assess progress--both realized and expected--

toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation”; it also indicated
