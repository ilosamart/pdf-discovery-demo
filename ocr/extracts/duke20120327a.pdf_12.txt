 I donâ€™t want to underestimate the difficulty of the task.  The recession damaged 

communities of all types, but particularly lower-income neighborhoods, and economic 

recovery has been stubbornly slow.  Nonetheless, the commitment and innovation 

demonstrated in communities all across the country is encouraging.  Taking an 

entrepreneurial approach to community development and thinking about the needs of 

both people and places will, I believe, make for stronger, more resilient communities in 

the future.
