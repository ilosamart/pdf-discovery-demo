could augur a permanent falloff in this kind of credit, at least a portion of which may not be 

maintained in the more standardized approach to lending characteristic of larger banks.   

 Banking regulators have taken a number of steps to try to avoid unnecessary regulatory 

costs for community banks, such as fashioning simpler compliance requirements and identifying 

which provisions of new regulations are of relevance to smaller banks.  But a number of new 

statutory provisions apply explicitly to some smaller banks or, by failing to exclude any banks 

from coverage, apply to all banks.  This means that smaller banks do need to expend at least 

some compliance effort.  And, even where regulatory frameworks try to place a lesser burden on 

smaller banks, there may be some risk of “supervisory trickle down,” whereby supervisors 

informally, and perhaps not wholly intentionally, create compliance expectations for smaller 

banks that resemble expectations created for larger institutions. 

 It would be worthwhile to have a policy discussion of statutes that might be amended 

explicitly to exclude community banks (which, again, are generally defined as those with less 

than $10 billion in assets) from their coverage.  In my view, two candidates would be the 

Volcker rule and the incentive compensation requirements in section 956 of Dodd-Frank.  The 

concerns addressed by these statutory provisions are substantially greater at larger institutions 

and, even where a practice at a smaller bank might raise concerns, the supervisory process 

remains available to address what would likely be unusual circumstances.  Indeed, relieving both 

banks and supervisors of the need to focus on formal compliance with a range of regulations less 

relevant to community bank practice would free them to focus on the actual problems that may 

exist at smaller banks.     

 Middle-range banks.   As I have already suggested, financial stability and 

macroprudential aims do not apply equally to all 80 of the banks in this wide category of firms
