A third key uncertainty for the U.S. economy is the outlook for productivity 

growth--that is, increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked.  While the 

job market has strengthened significantly, GDP increases have been less impressive.  

That combination of solid labor market gains and moderate GDP growth reflects the fact 

that labor productivity growth has been unusually weak in recent years, averaging less 

than 1/2 percent per year since 2010.9   

Over time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living 

standards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers.  

Recent weak productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage 

gains during this economic expansion.  Therefore, understanding whether, and by how 

much, productivity growth will pick up is a crucial part of the economic outlook.  But this 

is a very difficult question, and economists are divided.  Some are relatively optimistic, 

pointing to the ongoing pace of innovations that promise revolutionary technologies, 

from genetically tailored medical therapies to self-driving cars.  Others believe that the 

low-hanging fruit of innovation largely has been picked and that there is simply less 

scope for further gains.10   

My position has been, and remains, cautiously optimistic.  There is some evidence 

that the deep recession had a long-lasting effect in depressing investment, research and 

                                                 
9 The figures measure output per hour worked in the business sector.  From 2007:Q4 through 2016:Q1, 
productivity growth averaged about 1 percent per year.  By comparison, business-sector productivity 
growth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, and 
then it averaged 2Â¬3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years until the latest recession began. 
10 On the relatively optimistic side, see Mokyr (2014) or Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014).  For a less 
optimistic perspective, see Gordon (2016) or Cowen (2011).  Similarly, Fernald (2014) dates the most 
recent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, in 2005.  For evidence that 
the recent slowdown cannot be fully explained by measurement difficulties, see Byrne, Fernald, and 
Reinsdorf (2016).
