components of the shadow banking system include securitization vehicles, asset-backed 

commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, money market mutual funds, markets for repurchase 

agreements (repos), investment banks, and mortgage companies.  Before the crisis, the 

shadow banking system had come to play a major role in global finance. 

Economically speaking, as I noted, shadow banking bears strong functional 

similarities to the traditional banking sector.  Like traditional banking, the shadow 

banking sector facilitates maturity transformation (that is, it is used to fund longer-term, 

less-liquid assets with short-term, more-liquid liabilities), and it channels savings into 

specific investments, mostly debt-like instruments.  In part, the rapid growth of shadow 

banking reflected various types of regulatory arbitrage--for example, the minimization of 

capital requirements.  However, instruments that fund the shadow banking system, such 

as money market mutual funds and repos, also met a rapidly growing demand among 

investors, generally large institutions and corporations, seeking cash-like assets for use in 

managing their liquidity.  Commercial banks were limited in their ability to meet this 

growing demand by prohibitions on the payment of interest on business checking 

accounts and by relatively low limits on the size of deposit accounts that can be insured 

by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 

As became apparent during the crisis, a key vulnerability of the system was the 

heavy reliance of the shadow banking sector, as well as some of the largest global banks, 

on various forms of short-term wholesale funding, including commercial paper, repos, 

securities lending transactions, and interbank loans.  The ease, flexibility, and low 

perceived cost of short-term funding also supported a broader trend toward higher
