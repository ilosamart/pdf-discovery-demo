exporters--did indeed evince a strong preference for very safe and liquid U.S. assets in 

the middle of the past decade, especially Treasury and agency securities. 

Although a large share of the net capital inflows to the United States came from 

emerging markets, substantial gross capital inflows were received from the advanced 

economies as well.  An additional contribution of the paper is to examine the portfolio 

preferences of these advanced economy, especially European, investors.  The paper finds 

that, like the global saving glut countries, European investors placed a high value on 

safety and liquidity in their U.S. investments; however, relative to purchases by emerging 

markets, those of European investors encompassed a broader range of U.S. securities, 

including sizable amounts of private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as well as 

other highly rated asset-backed securities.  Unlike the global saving glut countries, which 

funded their acquisitions of U.S. assets through their current account surpluses, Europe 

on net had a roughly balanced current account and thus issued liabilities to fund 

acquisitions of U.S. assets.  However, as these liabilities were tilted toward more 

traditional securities, including sovereign debt, as well as bank deposits, the result here 

too was a net increase in the global demand for highly rated U.S. assets.  

The preferences of foreign investors for highly rated U.S. assets, together with 

similar preferences by many domestic investors, had a number of implications, including 

for the relative yields on such assets.  Importantly, though, the preference by so many 

investors for perceived safety created strong incentives for U.S. financial engineers to 

develop investment products that “transformed” risky loans into highly rated securities.  

Remarkably, even though a large share of new U.S. mortgages during the housing boom 

were of weak credit quality, financial engineering resulted in the overwhelming share of
