the operational goals, it has goal independence; if those operational goals are defined by 

some other body, the central bank does not have goal independence.      

The academic literature was developed during the early 1990s when the Federal 

Reserve had already been given its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price 

stability.  After careful deliberation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

clarified that inflation of 2 percent is most consistent with the goal of price stability.   

The powers and instruments the central bank has at its command are also 

generally specified in legislation.  If the central bank has control over the policy 

instruments it has been assigned, it has instrument independence.  Virtually every central 

bank has the authority to engage in asset market transactions, with the goal of setting a 

specific--typically short-term--interest rate or, closely related, of controlling the money 

supply.  There have been proposals--for instance, by Milton Friedman--that the central 

bank be required to cause the money supply to grow at a constant rate, 4 percent.  Such a 

central bank would have neither instrument nor goal independence. 

Third, the power to set the short-term interest rate or the money supply is a 

formidable one.  Well exercised, that power can support the stability of both prices and 

output; poorly exercised, it can create economic havoc.  Any institution to which such 

responsibility has been delegated must be held accountable for carrying out its mission 

effectively and efficiently.  In almost all countries, the central bankâ€™s accountability is 

enforced by requiring regular reporting on monetary policy actions and outcomes to the 

legislature, to the executive branch, and to the public.  The formal centerpiece of the 

required reporting is generally exercised by the regular publication and presentation to 

the legislature of an inflation report or monetary policy report, followed by public
