points in March, whereas the median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years 

increased only 1/4 percentage point.  While such movements obviously bear watching, I 

would note that such a combination--namely, a substantial jump in near-term inflation 

expectations coupled with a relatively modest uptick in longer-run expectations--has 

often accompanied previous sharp increases in gasoline prices, and when it did, those 

movements were largely reversed within a few months.4 

Information derived from the Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) 

market also suggests that financial market participantsâ€™ longer-term inflation expectations 

remain well anchored even as the near-term outlook for inflation has shifted upward.  In 

particular, while the carry-adjusted measure of inflation compensation for the next five 

years has increased about 1/4 percentage point since earlier this year, forward inflation 

compensation at longer horizons is roughly unchanged on net.  Much of the increase in 

five-year inflation compensation has been associated with the surge in food and energy 

prices, and the level of this measure appears consistent with a normal cyclical recovery 

after adjusting for those effects. 

Commodity Prices and Inflation 

Now I would like to explain in further detail why I anticipate that recent increases 

in commodity prices are likely to have only transitory effects on headline inflation.  The 

current configuration of quotes on futures contracts--which can serve as a reasonable 

benchmark in gauging the outlook for commodity prices--suggests that these prices will 

roughly stabilize near current levels or even decline in some cases.  If that outcome 

materializes, the prices of gasoline and heating oil are likely to flatten out fairly soon, and 

retail food prices are likely to continue rising briskly for only a few more months.  
                                                 
4 An example of this pattern was seen in the months following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
