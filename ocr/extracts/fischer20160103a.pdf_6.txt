What Steps Can Be Taken to Mitigate the Constraints Associated with the ZLB?

Against that backdrop, a second key question for central banks is, What steps, if 

any, can be taken to mitigate the constraints associated with the ZLB?  

Raising the Inflation Target: One step that has been proposed by many, including 

Olivier Blanchard, is the possibility of raising the target rate of inflation from 

2 percent to some higher level.  One concern I have raised in the past about such 

proposals is that high levels of inflation may also be associated with higher 

inflation variability. The welfare costs of high and variable inflation could be 

substantial.  For example, more variable inflation would make long-run planning 

more difficult for households and businesses.  And higher and more variable 

inflation would likely also lead to higher levels of indexation in the economy over 

time that, in turn, would make it more difficult for central banks to achieve their 

inflation goals.  

Negative Interest Rates:  Another possible step would be to reduce short-term 

interest rates below zero if needed to provide additional accommodation.  Our 

colleagues in Europe are busy rewriting economics textbooks on this topic as we 

speak--and also helping us to remember earlier discussions of negative interest 

rates by Keynes, Irving Fisher, Hicks, and Gesell.12

To provide further monetary accommodation amid weak inflation prospects, the 

European Central Bank lowered its deposit rate into negative territory in June 

12 The Europeans have long been intrigued by the possibility of negative rates, beginning with Gesell’s 
stamp scrip proposal in 1906 and some apparently successful experiments with stamp scrip in Austria in the 
1930s.  See Keynes (1936), Fisher (1933), and Hicks (1937). For an extensive discussion of Gesell’s work, 
see Keynes (1936), chap. 23, pp. 353-58.
