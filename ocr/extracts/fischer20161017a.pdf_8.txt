economists suggests that population aging--through its effects on saving--could be 

pushing down the longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate relative to its level in the 

1980s by as much as 75 basis points.10  

In addition to slower growth and demographic changes, a third factor that may be 

pushing down interest rates in the United States is weak investment.  Analysis with the 

FRB/US model suggests that, given how low interest rates have been in recent years, 

investment should have been considerably higher in the past couple of years.  According 

to the model, this shortfall in investment has depressed the long-run equilibrium federal 

funds rate by about 60 basis points.  

Investment may be low for a number of reasons.  One is that greater perceived 

uncertainty could also make firms more hesitant to invest.  Another possibility is that the 

economy is simply less capital intensive than it was in earlier decades.11      

  Fourth on my list are developments abroad:  Many of the factors depressing U.S. 

interest rates have also been working to lower foreign interest rates.  To take just one 

example, many advanced foreign economies face a slowdown in longer-term growth 

prospects that is similar to that in the United States, with similar implications for 

equilibrium interest rates in the longer run.  In the FRB/US model, lower interest rates 

abroad put upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar and thus lower 

net exports.  FRB/US simulations suggest that a reduction in the equilibrium federal 

funds rate of about 30 basis points would be required to offset the effects in the United 

States of a reduction in foreign growth prospects similar to what we have seen in the 

United States.
