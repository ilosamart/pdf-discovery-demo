A higher IOER rate encourages banks to raise the interest rates they charge, putting 

upward pressure on market interest rates regardless of the level of reserves in the banking 

sector.    

While adjusting the IOER rate is an effective way to move market interest rates 

when reserves are plentiful, federal funds have generally traded below this rate.  This 

relative softness of the federal funds rate reflects, in part, the fact that only depository 

institutions can earn the IOER rate.  To put a more effective floor under short-term 

interest rates, the Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed.  For 

instance, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility is available to a 

variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-sponsored 

enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions.  Through it, eligible 

counterparties may invest funds overnight with the Federal Reserve at a rate determined 

by the FOMC.  Similar to the payment of IOER, the ON RRP facility discourages 

participating institutions from lending at a rate substantially below that offered by the 

Fed.10   

Our current toolkit proved effective last December.  In an environment of 

superabundant reserves, the FOMC raised the effective federal funds rate--that is, the 

weighted average rate on federal funds transactions among participants in that market--by 

the desired amount, and we have since maintained the federal funds rate in its target 

range.  

                                                 
10 Other tools that could help strengthen the floor under short-term interest rates but are not currently in use 

include the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repurchase agreements.
