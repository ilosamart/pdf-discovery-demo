Conclusion 

Overall, liquidity is  adequate by most measures, in most markets, and most of the 

time.18  Bid-ask spreads and price-impact measures point toward liquidity that is good by 

historical standards, and we have not observed declines in market liquidity in recent 

episodes of high market volatility.  Nevertheless, the market structure is changing, and 

trades in certain situations and in certain market segments might have become more 

costly.  Also, flash events may be more frequent today, and the dynamics of a system 

with frequent flash events are likely to become complicated.  Moreover, some regulatory 

changes are only now being phased in.  In light of these changes and the evolving 

structure of financial markets, it will be important to monitor and continue to analyze the 

state of market liquidity.  As we monitor, we should continue to emphasize how the 

evolution of market liquidity interacts with broader changes to affect the efficient 

allocation of capital and financial stability.  And we should always bear in mind the 

possibility that new financial developments could change the dynamics of market 

responses to unanticipated economic developments.
