effectiveness of the firms’ processes for determining and addressing their own capital needs.  We 

discovered that, at the time, many of the firms had critical deficiencies in the fundamental risk-

measurement and risk-management practices necessary to assess their capital needs.  Many firms 

did not have a systematic program for assessing their capital needs and even lacked the basic 

data on firm-wide risks and exposures needed to begin such a program.  Not surprisingly, there 

appeared to be a correlation between firms found to be insufficiently capitalized to withstand 

further financial and economic stress and firms lacking effective processes for assessing their 

risks and vulnerabilities.   

In response to these deficiencies, the Federal Reserve initiated the annual CCAR process 

for assessing the capital adequacy and internal capital planning processes of large, complex bank 

holding companies (BHCs).  CCAR is premised on the belief that thorough, rigorous risk 

management must underpin all the activities of all such firms.  Risks that are identified and 

understood can be evaluated and, where appropriate, assumed with proper safeguards and capital 

planning.  Risks that are overlooked, misunderstood, or taken outside of a well-considered and 

comprehensive risk-management framework plant the seeds for serious trouble for individual 

firms and potentially for the financial system.  Through CCAR, we have sought to ensure not 

only that all large BHCs have strong capital positions as determined through our supervisory 

stress test, but also that they have strong capital planning practices that are appropriately focused 

on the capital needed to withstand possible losses from the specific risks in each firm’s business 

model.  These processes, grounded in strong quantitative and qualitative risk management, also 

give supervisors a clearer window into each firm’s activities and thus increase the effectiveness 

of regular supervision.
