The large shortfall of employment relative to its maximum level has imposed 

huge burdens on all too many American households and represents a substantial social 

cost.  In addition, prolonged economic weakness could harm the economy’s productive 

potential for years to come.  The long-term unemployed can see their skills erode, making 

these workers less attractive to employers.  If these jobless workers were to become less 

employable, the natural rate of unemployment might rise or, to the extent that they leave 

the labor force, we could see a persistently lower rate of labor force participation.  In 

addition, the slow recovery has depressed the pace of capital accumulation, and it may 

also have hindered new business formation and innovation, developments that would 

have an adverse effect on structural productivity.   

In contrast to the large gap between actual and maximum employment, inflation, 

apart from fluctuations due to energy and other commodity prices, has been running for 

some time now a little below the rate of 2 percent per year that the Committee judges to 

be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  The Committee anticipates that 

inflation will continue to run at or below 2 percent over the medium term.  Moreover, 

expectations for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years remain well anchored, according to 

surveys of households and professional forecasters. 

With employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation running 

below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, I believe it’s appropriate for progress in the 

labor market to take center stage in the conduct of monetary policy.  Let me therefore

 In my view, and as I’ve argued elsewhere (Yellen, 2013), the evidence indicates that elevated 

unemployment and the disappointingly slow improvement in the labor market are primarily the result of 

weak aggregate demand and not an increase in structural unemployment.
