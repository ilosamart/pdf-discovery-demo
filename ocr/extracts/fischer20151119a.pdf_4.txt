prospects for India to recharge the region’s growth dynamic.  I will end with some 

thoughts on Asia’s place in the global economy both now and in the years to come. 

Why Is Growth in Emerging Asia Slowing? 

The first thing to say and think about Asian growth is that growth at a rate of 

above 6 percent is not slow; it is slower than it has been, but it remains impressive.  There 

are four factors weighing on emerging Asian growth that I would like to highlight.  First, 

emerging Asia continues to be negatively affected by slow demand growth elsewhere, 

including in the advanced economies.  Second, economies generally decelerate as they 

develop, a pattern that has already been evidenced in many of emerging Asia’s growth 

pioneers.  Third, the tremendous growth of trade in the region, driven by the process of 

global integration and the growth of production-sharing networks, may have plateaued.  

Lastly, demographic trends in a number of emerging Asian countries are likely to affect 

growth in the coming years.5     

Regarding the first of the factors that I just listed, contrary to often-repeated and 

often-resurrected stories of emerging market growth “decoupling” from that of the 

advanced economies, the truth is that advanced-economy demand continues to play a key 

role in emerging Asia’s economic conditions.6  And, as we all know, advanced-economy 

demand for imports in recent years has been lackluster.  Real goods imports in the United 

States, Japan, and the euro area have all increased at an average annual pace of about 

                                                 
5 In a speech of this length and scope, it is not possible to relate all important developments affecting Asian 
growth.  In particular, I will not address the need for further development of financial systems and 
infrastructure in Asian emerging economies, which will be important factors in determining future rates of 
growth.    
6 This point is particularly well made in Monetary Authority of Singapore (2007).
