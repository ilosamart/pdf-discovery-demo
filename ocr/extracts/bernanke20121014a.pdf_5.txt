recognize that unconventional monetary policies come with possible risks and costs; 

accordingly, the Federal Reserve has generally employed a high hurdle for using these 

tools and carefully weighs the costs and benefits of any proposed policy action. 

International Aspects of Federal Reserve Asset Purchases

in supporting the U.S. economy, concerns have been raised about the spillover effects of 

our policies on our trading partners.  In particular, some critics have argued that the Fedâ€™s 

asset purchases, and accommodative monetary policy more generally, encourage capital 

flows to emerging market economies.  These capital flows are said to cause undesirable 

currency appreciation, too much liquidity leading to asset bubbles or inflation, or 

economic disruptions as capital inflows quickly give way to outflows.      

 I am sympathetic to the challenges faced by many economies in a world of 

volatile international capital flows.  And, to be sure, highly accommodative monetary 

policies in the United States, as well as in other advanced economies, shift interest rate 

differentials in favor of emerging markets and thus probably contribute to private capital 

flows to these markets.  I would argue, though, that it is not at all clear that

economies, for several reasons. 

First, the linkage between advanced-economy monetary policies and international 

capital flows is looser than is sometimes asserted.  Even in normal times, differences in 

growth prospects among countries--and the resulting differences in expected returns--are 

the most important determinant of capital flows.  The rebound in emerging market
