Identifying and Addressing Structural Forms of Systemic Risk 

I want to turn now to structural sources of systemic risk and discuss how 

macroprudential policy can be used to mitigate them.  Structural vulnerabilities may go 

largely unnoticed until they are exposed in financial crises--and at considerable cost.  

Indeed, many of the regulations now being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, as 

well as the international agreements relating to bank capital and liquidity standards, are a 

reaction to the events of 2007 through 2009.  Such responses include regulations and 

reforms that address risks resulting from the existence of SIFIs and systemically 

important financial market utilities (FMUs) as well as other efforts to improve the 

resilience of important financial markets and infrastructure. 

Because the material distress or failure of a SIFI can have outsized effects on the 

financial sector and the real economy, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the Federal 

Reserve to reduce the probability of such events through tougher prudential standards, 

including enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, 

an early remediation regime, and restrictions on activities.  The act also requires the 

Federal Reserve to consider systemic risk effects when reviewing and ruling on 

applications for mergers among financial firms.  In addition, to ensure that the failure of a 

SIFI can occur without serious damage to the financial system, the act gives the Federal 

Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation new tools, such as improved 

resolution planning by firms and an orderly liquidation authority.  The act also requires 

centralized clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and introduces 

margin requirements for noncleared derivatives and other measures to strengthen the 

integrity and functioning of financial markets.
