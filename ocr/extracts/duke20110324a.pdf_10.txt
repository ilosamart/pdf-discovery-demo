To look at credit indicators, I decided to focus on business owners in order to examine 

the impact of changes in wealth on access to business as well as consumer credit. 

Business Owners 

The preretirement and business owner groups I have chosen are not mutually exclusive.  

Indeed, there is quite a bit of overlap.  More than 30 percent of small business owners in 2007 

were part of the preretirement group, and they tended to be among the wealthier members of that 

group.  In fact, the business owner group held nearly half of all household wealth in 2007.   

Small businesses employ roughly half of private-sector workers, they fill critical niches 

throughout the economy, and they are often seen as sources of innovation.  For many, the ability 

to leverage personal assets is a critical factor in developing their businesses.   

Concern over credit availability for small businesses has appropriately been a recurring 

worry throughout the crisis, but information about the intersection between business 

performance, personal finances, and credit has been hard to find.  While the data are still not 

definitive, the panel survey allows us to look at supply, demand, and assessment of 

creditworthiness from the borrowers’ point of view. 

Although the SCF is focused on families, not businesses, it does collect substantial 

information on the closely held businesses families own.  The survey clearly shows a high degree 

of interdependence of personal and business finances for many families with businesses.  For 

example, families make loan guarantees for their businesses using personal assets as collateral, 

and loans between business owners and their businesses are common in both directions.  

According to the most recently available data from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Business 

Owners, 6 in 10 small business owners use personal savings or assets to finance or expand their 

businesses.
