large amounts of short-term liquidity to financial institutions, including primary dealers 

as well as banks, on a broad range of collateral.

  Reflecting the contemporary 

institutional environment, it also provided backstop liquidity support for components of 

the shadow banking system, including money market mutual funds, the commercial paper 

market, and the asset-backed securities markets.  To be sure, the provision of liquidity 

alone can by no means solve the problems of credit risk and credit losses, but it can 

reduce liquidity premiums, help restore the confidence of investors, and thus promote 

stability.  It can also reduce panic-driven credit problems in cases in which such problems 

result from price declines during liquidity-driven fire sales of assets. 

The pricing of the liquidity facilities was an important part of the Federal 

Reserve’s strategy.  Rates could not be too high; to have a positive effect, and to 

minimize the stigma of borrowing, the facilities had to be attractive relative to rates 

available (or nominally available) in illiquid, dysfunctional markets.  At the same time, 

pricing had to be sufficiently unattractive that borrowers would voluntarily withdraw 

from these facilities as market conditions normalized.  This desired outcome in fact 

occurred:  By early 2010, emergency lending had been drastically reduced, along with the 

demand for such lending. 

The Federal Reserve’s responses to the failure or near failure of a number of 

systemically critical firms reflected the best of bad options, given the absence of a legal 

framework for winding down such firms in an orderly way in the midst of a crisis--a 

framework that we now have.  However, those actions were, again, consistent with the 

Bagehot approach of lending against collateral to illiquid but solvent firms.  The
