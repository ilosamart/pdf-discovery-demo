monetary economics, but also—and more importantly—on the practice of monetary 

policy.  For our purposes today, I will note that the crucial insight of John’s paper was 

that, whereas a central bank could pick the “k” in a “k-percent” rule on its own, without 

any reference to the underlying parameters of the economy (including r* and u*), a well-

designed rule for setting a short-term interest rate as a policy instrument should, John 

argued, respect several requirements.6  First, the rule should anchor the nominal policy 

rate at a level equal to the sum of its estimate of the neutral real interest rate (r*) and the 

inflation target.  Second, to achieve this nominal anchor, the central bank should be 

prepared to raise the nominal policy rate by more than one-for-one when inflation 

exceeds target (the Taylor principle).  And, third, the central bank should lean against the 

wind when output—or, via an Okun’s law relationship, the unemployment rate—deviates 

from its estimate of potential (u*). 

In other words, whereas in Friedman’s k-percent policy rule u* and r* are 

destinations irrelevant to the choice of k, in the Taylor rule—and most subsequent 

Taylor-type rules—u* and r* are necessary inputs.  As Woodford (2003) demonstrates 

theoretically, the first two requirements for a Taylor-type rule are necessary for it to be 

consistent with the objective of price stability.  The third requirement—that monetary 

policy lean against the wind in response to an output or unemployment gap—not only 

contributes to the objective of price stability, but is also obviously desirable from the 

perspective of a central bank like the Fed that has a dual mandate.  The Taylor approach 

                                                 
6 On the specification and properties of the Taylor rule, see especially Taylor (1993, 1999) as well as 
Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999, 2000) and Woodford (2003).  Another key study of simple interest rate 
rules was Henderson and McKibbin (1993).  It should be noted that a Taylor type rule is an instrument rule 
for achieving the inflation objective that enters the rule.  In practice, it is one way to implement a flexible 
inflation targeting regime.  See Bernanke and others (1999) and Svensson (1997, 1999) for important 
contributions on the considerations involved in specifying an inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy.
