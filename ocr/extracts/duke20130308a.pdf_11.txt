crowding out borrowers with lower credit scores, whose applications may be more time 

consuming to process.  Indeed, staff research suggests that the increase in the refinance 

workload during the past 18 months appears to be associated with a 50 percent decrease 

in purchase originations among borrowers with credit scores between 620 and 680 and a 

15 percent decrease among borrowers with credit scores between 680 and 720.  Purchase 

originations among borrowers with higher credit scores appear to be affected to only a 

small degree. 

Any crowding-out effect that does exist due to capacity constraints should start to 

unwind if mortgage rates stay at the current levels or rise, in which case the current 

refinancing boom will begin to run out of steam.  Lenders might then ease credit 

conditions to fill declining refinance pipelines with additional purchase volume.  At the 

same time, as lenders gain more confidence in the strength of the economic recovery and 

the upswing in house prices, their outlook for home-purchase originations may brighten, 

making them more confident in easing standards or increasing capacity.  Even so, there 

are still a number of nonmarket forces at work that could make lenders more cautious 

than normal.   

For example, lenders remain concerned about the risk that they will be required to 

repurchase defaulted loans from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)--the so-

called putback risk.  The ability to hold lenders accountable for poorly underwritten loans 

is a significant protection for taxpayers.  However, if lenders are unsure about the 

conditions under which they will be required to repurchase loans sold to the GSEs, they 

may shy away from originating loans to borrowers whose risk profiles indicate a higher 

likelihood of default.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency launched an important
