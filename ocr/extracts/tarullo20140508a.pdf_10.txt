risks associated with loans held across such institutions, there should be a macroprudential 

objective in the regulation of at least some of these firms.   

 Of course, I would not lump all 80 of these institutions into the same category for 

purposes of specifying the aims of regulation.  In particular, only a small fraction of these firms 

have a significant enough systemic footprint that their stress or failure would impose sizable 

negative externalities on the rest of the financial system.  And the lines delineating the possible 

categories are not as easy to draw as for community banks and LISCC firms.  Nonetheless, I will 

suggest in a few moments some possible classifications for this group of banks, along with 

examples of the varying regulations that might apply. 

Rationalizing the Regulatory Framework 

   The preceding observations have portrayed the prudential regulatory framework as one 

that should be constructed with different aims in mind.  With respect to all depository 

institutions, this framework maintains the traditional aim of protecting the DIF and limiting the 

use of insured deposits to engage in nonbank activities.  With respect to banks of a certain size—

even those predominantly involved in conventional lending activities—a macroprudential aim 

should be added.  Finally, with respect to banking organizations of such size and complexity that 

serious stress or failure could pose risks to the entire financial system, a financial stability aim 

should be the basis for additional forms of regulation.  As suggested in section 165 of Dodd-

Frank, the stringency of these additional regulations should increase in proportion to the systemic 

importance of the banking organizations. 

 Let me now give a few examples of how specifying these aims can help us think through 

ways in which the current overlays of regulatory and supervisory requirements might be 

rationalized.  In part, such a rationalization is motivated by the familiar goal of limiting
