however, lower-income and minority households have substantially higher rates of being 

unbanked.  

The widespread adoption of mobile phones and the data they generate are 

expected to extend these gains even further.  The World Bank noted, for instance, that 

about 1.1 billion unbanked people, about two-thirds of the unbanked population, has a 

mobile phone.6  Here in the United States, the Federal Reserve Board’s 2015 Survey of 

Consumers’ Use of Mobile Financial Services found that nearly 60 percent of the U.S. 

adult population had a smart (internet-enabled) phone. 7   It also found that the rates of 

mobile banking usage are higher among minorities.  And even amongst the unbanked 

population, 40 percent of adults had access to a smartphone in their households; the same 

was true for 70 percent of underbanked adults.  

Another proxy used to gauge financial inclusion is access to credit.  When I 

worked on microcredit 3 decades ago, it was very difficult to scale up the provision of 

loans to small businesses.8  Reaching small enterprises and evaluating their 

creditworthiness was very expensive, especially in small cities and rural areas, and it was 

difficult to secure loans with collateral.  The high transaction costs were reflected in 

interest rates many times greater than those available for established businesses in urban 

areas.
