With Friday morning’s labor market data prominently in the news, I will start 

with the labor market and end with a discussion of monetary policy.1   

Recent reports pertaining to the labor market, including Friday’s release, have 

been solid, showing continued improvement.  So far this year, payrolls are reported to 

have increased by 180,000 per month.  That is down from last year’s gains of 230,000 per 

month but well above what is needed to provide jobs for new entrants into the labor 

force.  Despite the strong job growth, the unemployment rate, at 5 percent in September, 

has essentially moved sideways this year as individuals have come back into the labor 

market in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages.  As a 

consequence, the labor force participation rate has edged up against a backdrop of a 

declining longer-run trend owing to aging of the population.  This increase is a very 

welcome development.   

All told, with the unemployment rate not far from levels that most Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) participants view as normal in the longer run and the rise in 

the participation rate, I see the U.S. economy as close to full employment, with some 

further improvement expected.   

Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a subdued 1 percent pace during the 

first half of the year and only 1-1/4 percent over the past four quarters.  This pace likely 

underestimates the momentum in aggregate demand because it includes a sizable 

inventory correction that began early last year.  It is likely that this correction has by now 

run its course, and most analysts are expecting inventories to make a positive contribution
