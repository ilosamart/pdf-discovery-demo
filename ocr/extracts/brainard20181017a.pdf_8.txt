a check-cashing firm and a payday lender.18  Servon observed that check-cashing firms 

used simple fee structures that were transparent and prominently displayed, similar to an 

overhead priced menu at a fast-food restaurant.  As a result, individuals could understand 

clearly what fees they will have to pay up front.  In contrast, checking accounts can be 

more unpredictable.  The funds from a deposited check may not be immediately 

available.  By the same token, it may not be clear exactly when the funds associated with 

a payment by check are likely to be deducted from the account.  That lack of 

predictability can be extremely important to a family that is living paycheck to paycheck.   

Bouncing a rent check, phone payment, or utility payment can have a 

destabilizing impact on day-to-day life with further knock-on effects and costs.  When a 

check for a utility payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, for instance, the account 

holder may have to make time-consuming calls to get the lights turned back on, while 

also struggling to pay the associated overdraft fee.  That may, in turn, lead to a vexing 

chain of additional late payments and fees.  A 2013 study by the Bureau of Consumer 

Financial Protection found that more than a quarter of checking accounts in the study 

experienced at least one overdraft fee in 2011.19  The average fee total for overdrawn 

accounts was $225, but varied as much as $200 between banks.  Among bank customers 

who bounced checks, a relatively small minority bore the brunt of the fees:  A quarter of
