Importantly, the surcharge is calibrated in proportion to how an institution scores on 

specific metrics that capture the system-wide costs of its failure--risks associated with size, 

interconnectedness, complexity, cross-border activities, substitutability, and short-term 

wholesale funding. With respect to the last, the logic is that greater reliance on short-term 

wholesale funding increases the risks of creditor runs and asset fire sales that can both erode the 

institutionâ€™s capital and spark contagion.  By calibrating the enhanced capital expectation in 

direct proportion to a set of measures of size, interconnectedness, and complexity, the proposal 

provides clear and measurable incentives for institutions to simplify and reduce their systemic 

footprint. 

Second, the crisis also provided a stark reminder that what may seem like thick capital 

cushions in good times may prove dangerously thin at moments of stress, when losses soar and 

asset valuations plummet. Therefore, in addition to static capital requirements, large banking 

institutions must undergo the forward-looking Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 

(CCAR) and supervisory stress test each year to assess whether the amount of capital they hold is 

sufficient to continue operations through periods of economic stress and market turbulence, and 

whether their capital planning framework is adequate to their risk profile.  

While supervisory stress tests with adverse and severely adverse macroeconomic 

scenarios are required by statute for all bank holding companies with assets over $50 billion, for 

the eight U.S. systemic banking institutions, the stress tests are tailored to include a counterparty 

default scenario, and, for the six systemic institutions with significant trading activities, the stress 

tests also include a global market shock.  In significant part as a result of these additional 

requirements, in 2015, the eight systemic institutions needed to hold common equity worth 4.7 

percent of risk-weighted assets on average above the 7 percent minimum and capital
