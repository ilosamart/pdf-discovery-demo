have maintained tight terms and conditions on mortgage loans, even for potential 

borrowers with relatively good credit.8  Lenders cite a number of factors affecting their 

decisions to extend credit, including ongoing uncertainties about the course of the 

economy, the housing market, and the regulatory environment.  Unfortunately, while 

some tightening of the terms of mortgage credit was certainly an appropriate response to 

the earlier excesses, the pendulum appears to have swung too far, restraining the pace of 

recovery in the housing sector.   

Other factors slowing the recovery in housing include the fact that many people 

remain unable to buy homes despite low mortgage rates; for example, about 20 percent of 

existing mortgage borrowers owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, 

making it more difficult for them to refinance or sell their homes.  Also, a substantial 

overhang of vacant homes, either for sale or in the foreclosure pipeline, continues to hold 

down house prices and reduce the need for new construction.  While these headwinds on 

both the supply and demand sides of the housing market have clearly started to abate, the 

recovery in the housing sector is likely to remain moderate by historical standards. 

A second set of headwinds stems from the financial conditions facing potential 

borrowers in credit and capital markets.  After the financial system seized up in late 2008 

and early 2009, global economic activity contracted sharply, and credit and capital 

markets suffered significant damage.  Although dramatic actions by governments and 

central banks around the world helped these markets to stabilize and begin recovering, 

                                                 
8 For example, according to the April 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending, about 
one-half of lenders reported that they were “somewhat less likely” or “much less likely” than in 2006 to 
originate a mortgage to a borrower with a FICO score of 680 and a 10 percent down payment.  The
