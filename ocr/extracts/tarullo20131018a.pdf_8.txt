 A second reason is, in some sense, the converse of the first.  If creditors and 

counterparties do not believe the FDIC can successfully resolve the firm, they may not price in 

the potential for losses that should be incorporated in their dealings with large firms.  That is, if 

investors and other market actors think the prospects for orderly resolution seem low, they may 

assume the firm will be rescued by the government, and any moral hazard present in these 

markets will continue.  By specifying which financial obligations will be maintained and where 

the FDIC will look to impose losses, a well-developed approach to resolution can create 

incentives for private action compatible with the overall aims of systemic firm resolution. 

 The FDIC has made great progress in implementing Title II, in particular by developing 

the single-point-of-entry approach to resolution of a systemic financial firm.  Under the single-

point-of-entry approach, the FDIC will be appointed receiver of only the top-tier parent holding 

company of the failed firm.  After the parent holding company is placed into receivership, the 

FDIC will transfer assets of the parent company to a bridge holding company.  The firm’s 

operating subsidiaries (foreign and domestic) will remain open for business as usual.  To the 

extent necessary, the FDIC will then use available parent holding company assets to recapitalize 

the firm’s critical operating subsidiaries.  Equity claims of the failed parent company’s 

shareholders will effectively be wiped out, and claims of its unsecured debtholders will be 

written down as necessary to reflect any losses or other resolution costs in the receivership.  The 

FDIC will ultimately exchange the remaining claims of unsecured creditors of the parent for 

equity or debt claims of the bridge holding company and return the restructured firm back to 

private sector control.   

This conceptual approach to resolution under Title II represents an important step toward 

ending the market perception that any U.S. financial firm is too big or too complex to be allowed
