Amplified Spillovers   

Of course, policy divergence among major economies could be limited by rapid 

and strong transmission of foreign shocks across borders.  In particular, although the U.S. 

real economy has traditionally been seen as more insulated from foreign trade shocks 

than many smaller economies, the combination of the highly global role of the dollar and 

U.S. financial markets and the proximity to the zero lower bound may be amplifying 

spillovers from foreign financial conditions.  By one rough estimate, accounting for the 

net effect of exchange rate appreciation and changes in equity valuations and long term 

yields, over the past year and a half, the United States has experienced a tightening of 

financial conditions that is the equivalent of an additional increase of over 75 basis points 

in the federal funds rate.10   

The transmission of divergent economic conditions across borders typically 

occurs though a couple of different channels.  First, a decline in demand in one country 

reduces its demand for imports from other countries.  Second, the fall in economic 

activity would be expected to trigger a more accommodative monetary policy, which 

helps offset the effect of the shock by both supporting domestic demand and weakening 

the exchange rate.  The weaker exchange rate in turn leads domestic consumers to switch 

their expenditures away from more expensive foreign imports to cheaper domestic 

products while increasing the competitiveness of exports.  The extent to which monetary 

policy offsets the shock by dispersing it to trade partners as opposed to strengthening 

                                                 
10 These estimates are based on rough rules of thumb regarding the effects on output of changes in long-
term interest rates, equity prices, the exchange rate, and the federal funds rate from the FRB/US model and 
assume a highly persistent change in the federal funds rate.  Some private-forecaster estimates of financial 
tightening--expressed in terms of the federal funds rate--are larger, which may reflect an assumption of a 
less persistent funds rate change.  An alternative estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkâ€™s 
DSGE model, which explicitly includes a financial sector, suggests the tightening in financial conditions 
since mid-2015 is equivalent to an increase in the federal funds rate of roughly 100 basis points.
