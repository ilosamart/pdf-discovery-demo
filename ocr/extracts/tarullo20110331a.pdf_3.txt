firms as well.  The result is an adverse feedback loop, as these steps force still more 

sales.2  

 Third is a contagion effect, whereby market participants conclude from the firm’s distress 

that other firms holding similar assets or following similar business models are likely 

themselves to be facing similarly serious problems.   

 Fourth is the discontinuation of a critical function played by a failing firm in financial 

markets when other firms lack the expertise or capacity to provide ready substitutes. 

 The first two effects are largely a function of the interconnectedness of the distressed firm 

with other large firms, either through direct counterparty exposures or through common 

exposures of the firm’s balance sheet with those of other firms.  Typically, these first two effects 

will scale with a firm’s size as well.  These effects are directly relevant to concerns about the 

too-big-to-fail (TBTF) syndrome that have animated much of the reform debate in the past few 

years.   

The traditional TBTF concern is that of moral hazard--the expectation that, when faced 

with the prospect of either variant of a major blow to the financial system, government 

authorities will provide funds or guarantees to the firm to keep it functioning.  Creditors and 

managers of firms who anticipate such support may not price into their credit or investment 

decisions the full risk associated with those decisions.  As a result, the firms may become more 

leveraged and thus still larger, an outcome that would only reinforce the belief that the 

government will not allow them to fail.  The consequence can be both a competitive funding 

advantage for these large firms and more underlying risk to the financial system. 

  Important as it is, moral hazard is not the only worry engendered by very large, highly 

interconnected firms in financial markets.  Assuming that a government overcomes time-
