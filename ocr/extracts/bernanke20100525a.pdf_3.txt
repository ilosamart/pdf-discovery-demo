their decisions, but both theory and experience strongly support the proposition that 

insulating monetary policy from short-term political pressures helps foster desirable 

macroeconomic outcomes and financial stability. 

 In my remarks today, I will outline the general case for central bank independence 

and review the evolution of the independence of the Federal Reserve and other major 

central banks.  I will also discuss the requirements of transparency and accountability that 

must accompany this independence.  

The Case for Central Bank Independence 

A broad consensus has emerged among policymakers, academics, and other 

informed observers around the world that the goals of monetary policy should be 

established by the political authorities, but that the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit 

of those goals should be free from political control.2  This conclusion is a consequence of 

the time frames over which monetary policy has its effects.  To achieve both price 

stability and maximum sustainable employment, monetary policymakers must attempt to 

guide the economy over time toward a growth rate consistent with the expansion in its 

underlying productive capacity.  Because monetary policy works with lags that can be 

substantial, achieving this objective requires that monetary policymakers take a longer-

term perspective when making their decisions.  Policymakers in an independent central 

bank, with a mandate to achieve the best possible economic outcomes in the longer term, 

are best able to take such a perspective. 

                                                            
2 A useful distinction is that between “goal independence” and “instrument independence.”  Goal 
independence for central banks--the freedom of the central bank to set its own goals--is difficult to justify 
in a democratic society, but, as I will argue today, instrument independence--the ability of the central bank 
to determine the appropriate settings of monetary policy without interference--is vital for economic 
stability.
