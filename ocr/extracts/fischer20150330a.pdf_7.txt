during the crisis.  Thus, we will not go far wrong if we begin by considering how to 

promote solvency and liquidity, taking into account the unique structures and activities of 

each type of nonbank. 

Liquidity challenges vary across nonbank firms and activities.  In some, the issue 

is whether a firm can fund itself in a distressed situation.  For example, a broker-dealer 

that relies heavily on short-term wholesale funding may find its funding evaporating at 

the first sign of trouble--a situation that could force the sale of assets at fire sale prices.  

One way to mitigate such problems is by having direct restrictions on the structure of 

liabilities, such as on their duration or on the use of wholesale funding.  Analogously 

with banks, one could also imagine requiring some nonbanks to maintain buffers of 

highly liquid assets that are sized according to the risk that their liabilities will run off 

quickly in a stress situation.   

In other nonbanks, withdrawable liabilities are part of the structure of the entity or 

activity, and what varies is the degree of mismatch between the liquidity of assets and 

liabilities.  For example, some open-ended mutual funds offer daily withdrawal privileges 

but invest in assets that take longer to sell and settle, giving investors an incentive to 

withdraw quickly when distress arises.  The fire sales of assets that may result can 

depress asset prices and increase volatility, with knock-on effects on other institutions 

and markets.  Concerns have grown about this liquidity mismatch as the aggregate value 

of less liquid assets in such funds has grown.  In part because of this concern, in a 

December Federal Register notice last year, the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

(FSOC) requested public comment on potential systemic risks posed by asset manager 

activities and products.
