Labor Market Disparities  

Turning to the workforce more broadly, I want to spend some of my time today 

talking about disparities and share some findings from a conference we hosted yesterday 

at the Board titled “Disparities in the Labor Market:  What Are We Missing?”  In 

fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target 

of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum 

employment.  That is because the level of maximum employment depends on 

“nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which 

“may change over time and may not be directly measurable.”3  Understanding how close 

the labor market is to our full-employment goal requires consulting a variety of evidence 

along with a healthy dose of judgment.  This approach to maximum employment has 

allowed the FOMC to navigate the current expansion in a way that has likely brought 

more people back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed 

unemployment rate target based on pre-crisis standards.  

The Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor 

force participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the 

growth capacity of the economy.  When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we 

need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive
