survey, poll, or otherwise collect information about communities in their District.  At the 

Board, we are also conducting our own surveys to help validate the District results.   

Although the project is in its infant stage, I would like to share some initial 

findings from two of the Reserve Banks that are already participating in the process.  The 

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s “Community Indicators Project” is a quarterly 

survey tool that includes a collection of open-ended questions to inform community 

development policy and practice in a richer way than quantitative data alone.  Leaders 

from banks, nonprofits, community-based organizations, foundations, local government, 

and the private sector are asked about the conditions and trends affecting low-income 

households.  The lack of jobs was the dominant theme in the first year of data collection, 

with the majority of respondents identifying unemployment as the primary cause of new 

distress in the housing sector as increasing numbers of residents struggled to make 

mortgage or rent payments.  One survey participant stated that “prolonged unemployment 

and underemployment are causing a huge growth in the number of low-and moderate-

income individuals and communities.  Unemployment is now the driving force behind 

most of the other crises we are facing.”11    

Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has been using their Emerging 

Issues Surveillance Tool (EIST) to identify the most significant current and emerging 

community development issues in the District’s diverse communities.  The top three 

issues in the spring 2011 data release were employment opportunities, access to housing, 

and home foreclosures.  The jobs issue surfaced again, with a focus on the need for 

training, when a participant stated:  “Employment is the key to sustained self-sufficiency.
