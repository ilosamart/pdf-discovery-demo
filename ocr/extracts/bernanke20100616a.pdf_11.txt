Although individually customized derivatives still have an important place in the 

financial marketplace, we believe that systemic risk can be reduced in derivative markets 

by increasing the standardization of contracts and by requiring standardized derivatives to 

be cleared through well-regulated central counterparties.  In addition, it is also critical 

that relevant financial regulators have access to detailed information on the derivatives 

markets--including both standardized and customized transactions--so that they can 

assess the extent to which derivatives trades might concentrate risk or transmit localized 

or regional shocks throughout the financial system. 

The market for repurchase agreements, or repos, also played a prominent role in 

transmitting risk during the crisis.  The Federal Reserve is working to improve the 

infrastructure arrangements in the triparty repo market and is exploring what other steps 

should be taken to improve the stability of this key funding market. 

Given the important role played by financial market infrastructures, we support 

the current legislative provisions that would help ensure that payment, clearing, and 

settlement systems--including central counterparties--are subject to robust and consistent 

risk-management standards and do not pose dangers to the financial system as a whole.
