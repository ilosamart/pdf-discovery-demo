• In the long run, the balance sheet should be no larger than it needs to be to 

allow the Committee to conduct monetary policy under its chosen 

framework.15 

Taken together, the Committee’s communications present the broad outline of our 

likely approach to normalizing the balance sheet.  Although the process of normalizing 

the size of the balance sheet will be in the background, that process will interact with the 

Committee’s decisions regarding the federal funds rate.  As the Fed’s balance sheet 

shrinks, so debt held by the public will grow, which in theory should tighten financial 

conditions by putting upward pressure on long-term rates.  Any such tightening could 

affect the Committee’s decisions on the federal funds rate.  But how big is this effect 

likely to be? 

Model-based approaches to that question estimate changes to financial conditions 

through increases in the term premium as the balance sheet shrinks.  These estimates vary 

but are generally modest.16  One reason is that, for several years, the FOMC has signaled 

its intention to normalize the balance sheet as economic conditions allow, and so some of 

the effects of normalization should already be priced in.  A recent research paper by 

Federal Reserve staff estimated that unconventional policies are holding down term
