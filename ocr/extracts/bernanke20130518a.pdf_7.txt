Well, that’s sort of depressing.  Is it true, then, as baseball player Yogi Berra said, 

that the future ain’t what it used to be?  Nobody really knows; as Berra also astutely 

observed, it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.  But there are some 

good arguments on the other side of this debate.  

First, innovation, almost by definition, involves ideas that no one has yet had, 

which means that forecasts of future technological change can be, and often are, wildly 

wrong.  A safe prediction, I think, is that human innovation and creativity will continue; 

it is part of our very nature.  Another prediction, just as safe, is that people will 

nevertheless continue to forecast the end of innovation.  The famous British economist 

John Maynard Keynes observed as much in the midst of the Great Depression more than 

80 years ago.  He wrote then, “We are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic 

pessimism.  It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic 

progress which characterised the 19th century is over; that the rapid improvement in the 

standard of life is now going to slow down.”3  Sound familiar?  By the way, Keynes 

argued at that time that such a view was shortsighted and, in characterizing what he 

called “the economic possibilities for our grandchildren,” he predicted that income per 

person, adjusted for inflation, could rise as much as four to eight times by 2030.  His 

guess looks pretty good; income per person in the United States today is roughly six 

times what it was in 1930. 

Second, not only are scientific and technical innovation themselves inherently 

hard to predict, so are the long-run practical consequences of innovation for our economy 

and our daily lives.  Indeed, some would say that we are still in the early days of the IT
