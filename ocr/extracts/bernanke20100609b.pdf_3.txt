Although our country continues to endure high unemployment, we see some signs 

of modest improvement in the labor market.  Nationally, private payroll employment rose

market recovers, innovative workforce development programs can play important roles in 

anticipating future job market demands and by helping workers improve their skills to 

meet the requirements of businesses as they adopt more advanced technologies.

Although forecasting future job opportunities can be difficult, we do know that in 

some areas, such as health services, the number of jobs continued to increase throughout 

the recession.  And the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates that the demand for workers
