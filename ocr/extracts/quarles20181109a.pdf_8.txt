in the regime, and we are exploring alternatives.  Last, the SCB proposal would have 

included a post-stress leverage requirement.  As the Federal Reserve has long maintained, 

leverage requirements are intended to serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital 

requirements.  By definition, they are not intended to be risk-sensitive.  Thus, I am 

concerned that explicitly assigning a leverage buffer requirement to a firm on the basis of 

risk-sensitive post-stress estimates runs afoul of the intellectual underpinnings of the 

leverage ratio, and I would advocate removing this element of the stress capital buffer 

regime.  Of course, leverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage 

requirements, would remain a critical part of our regulatory capital regime, and we will 

maintain the supervisory expectation that firms have sufficient capital to meet all 

minimum regulatory requirements. 

Together, the adjustments we are contemplating to the SCB offer promise in 

improving the efficiency, coherence, and transparency of the regulatory capital regime 

while maintaining the overall level of capital in the system and the core principles of the 

regime that have proven successful.  That being said, we welcome a continued dialogue 

with the public as we implement these changes, and through that implementation, we will 

ensure that we maintain the incentives for effective stress testing practices that exist 

today. 

Transparency 

Transparency of the stress test and its inputs and outputs is key to the credibility 

of the stress test, and there are several initiatives underway to provide additional 

transparency regarding the supervisory stress test models and scenario design process.  

We believe that the adjustments under development strike the right balance of advancing 

transparency, while maintaining incentives for firms to think critically about their own 

risks. 

I expect that soon you will see the Federal Reserve issue a policy statement 

describing governing principles around the supervisory stress testing process.  As a part 

of that statement, I would expect a commitment to disclose additional detail about 

supervisory stress test models and results and to publish portfolios of hypothetical loans 

and associated loss rates.  I expect that we will begin providing some of this additional
