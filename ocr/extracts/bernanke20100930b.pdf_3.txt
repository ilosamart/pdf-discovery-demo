signed.  Today, students need a solid understanding of the benefits and risks of borrowing 

money to buy a car or a home, and of the effect that too much credit card debt can have 

on their finances.  Besides improving their personal financial decisionmaking, teaching 

your students economic principles will help them as citizens understand and make 

choices about many of the critical issues confronting our nation.  

The Federal Reserve works hard to advance financial literacy and economic 

education--both through our own programs and by working with other organizations.3  

Our financial education website provides easy access to free educational materials, a 

resource search engine for teachers, and games for students of various ages and 

knowledge levels.4

Thank you for accepting the invitation to join us in this conversation.  I appreciate 

the time you are spending away from personal and professional commitments to be with 

us.  And, as a central banker, economist, educator, and parent, I thank you for your work.  

I also applaud the ongoing partnerships between regional Reserve Banks and educators, 

  Some Reserve Banks offer economic and financial education 

workshops for teachers, and several Reserve Banks periodically provide lessons in 

personal finance to middle school and high school students.  A number of the Reserve 

Banks also run academic competitions for middle school, high school, and college 

students, such as the Fed Challenge, Econ Bowl, and essay contests.  And some Reserve 

Banks have opened learning centers or museums in their lobbies that feature interactive 

exhibits and related educational programs.  Teachers tell us that visits to these centers 

have provided their students with valuable learning experiences.
