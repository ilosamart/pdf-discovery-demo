appears to have been broken:  The downward trend in Chinese growth has flattened, 

growth in other EMEs has picked up some, and Brazil seems to be moving into recovery 

mode.  The factors that underlie the pickup in EMEs to a large extent represent a reversal 

of developments that led to the slowing.  The improvement in the performance of the 

advanced economies has become more widespread.  Chinese authorities have bolstered 

their economy by providing more credit stimulus.  And commodity prices have bounced 

back from their lows in early 2016, bolstering activity and allaying financial stability 

concerns in commodity-exporting economies.  These developments have also contributed 

to a modest reversal of the slowdown in global trade seen in recent years.2   

A rebound in capital flows has come along with the pickup in economic 

performance in the EMEs.  Slide 2 shows net private capital flows to EMEs--the 

difference between gross private inflows and gross private outflows.  These private net 

inflows are quite volatile, as the experience of the past 10 years shows.  Strong pre-GFC 

net inflows to major emerging markets (the black line)--hovering in the neighborhood 

of 3 to 4 percent of EME gross domestic product (GDP)--were interrupted by a collapse 

during the crisis, but inflows quickly recovered and stayed strong through 2010.  After 

that, net inflows trended down for several years and turned negative by 2015.  Part of this 

retrenchment reflected Chinese net inflows turning into net outflows due to what might 

be considered special circumstancesâ€”notably, changes in expectations of Chinese 

exchange rate policy.  But even taking China out of the picture, as shown by the dashed 

blue line, there was a clear downward trend in net inflows.
