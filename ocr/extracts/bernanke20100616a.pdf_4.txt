has initiated changes along these lines within its own operations.  In the remainder of my 

remarks I will elaborate briefly on these recommendations, with particular attention to 

how they are currently helping shape regulatory reform and the Fedâ€™s own regulatory and 

supervisory activities. 

The Systemic Approach to Supervision 

The report correctly notes that most financial regulatory systems throughout the 

world are designed primarily to ensure the soundness of individual institutions.  While 

this is an important mission, we agree with the authors of the report that it is not 

sufficient.  The failure of large, complex, and interconnected financial firms can disrupt 

the broader financial system and the overall economy, and such firms should be regulated 

with that fact in mind.  Likewise, the costs of the failure of critical financial 

infrastructures, such as payments and settlements systems, are likely to be much greater 

and more widely felt than the costs imposed directly on the owners of and participants in 

those systems.  Regulatory agencies must thus supervise financial institutions and critical 

infrastructures with an eye toward overall financial stability as well as the safety and 

soundness of each individual institution and system.  Indeed, the crisis has demonstrated 

that a too-narrow focus on the safety and soundness of individual institutions or systems 

can result in a failure to detect and thwart emerging threats to financial stability that cut 

across many firms or markets.   

A critical building block of a successful systemic, or macroprudential, approach 

to supervision is a requirement that all systemically important financial firms be subject 

to consolidated supervision.  That is, one regulator must be responsible and able to 

review the full range of activities of such firms.  Before the recent financial crisis, many
