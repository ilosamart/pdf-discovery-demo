short-term loans.  When investors lost confidence in the underlying securities and pulled 

their funding, many firms that sponsored the off-balance sheet vehicles found that they 

were bound by explicit or implicit promises to stand behind the securities.  Together with 

other direct or indirect exposures to risky debt, these commitments left financial 

institutions dangerously exposed to rising losses.   

These risks grew rapidly in the period before the crisis, in part because the 

regulators--like most financial firms and investors--did not fully understand or appreciate 

them.  But significant gaps in the regulatory framework itself also contributed to the 

inadequate government response.  For example, firms like the insurance giant American 

International Group (AIG), which sold credit insurance on large quantities of risky 

securities, or the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which speculated heavily in these 

securities, were not subject by law to strong consolidated supervision by federal 

regulators.  Moreover, none of the federal regulators had a mandate or sufficient powers 

to evaluate and respond to the risks posed by large financial organizations to the financial 

system as a whole. 

Thus, the stage was set for the unraveling that began in the summer of 2007 and 

continued throughout 2008.  As house prices and the equity of homeowners fell, 

mortgage delinquencies and defaults soared.  As I mentioned, investors--stunned by the 

resulting losses on mortgage-backed securities and other credit instruments they had 

believed to be safe--pulled back from a wide range of credit markets and financial 

institutions.  As funding dried up, losses mounted, and confidence plummeted, a number 

of major financial firms, both here and abroad, came under severe pressure.  In March 

2008, the investment house Bear Stearns became the first major firm to come to the brink
