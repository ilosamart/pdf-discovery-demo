and regulations, each banking organization is also required to maintain a customer identification 

program as part of the BSA compliance program and perform due diligence on its customers.2  

In addition, a banking organization must identify and report known or suspected criminal 

violations of the BSA or certain other federal laws and suspicious transactions related to money-

laundering activity.3  Criminal prosecutors at the Department of Justice and other law 

enforcement officials have direct access to the database that holds these Suspicious Activity 

Reports and rely on this information to initiate criminal investigations. 

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have published an 

examination manual intended to provide practical and flexible guidance to examiners and 

banking organizations regarding acceptable customer due-diligence and risk-mitigation practices 

as part of an effective BSA program.4  The Federal Reserve expects a banking organization to 

maintain adequate policies and procedures to address risks associated with customer 

relationships.  The scope of these policies and procedures will depend on the banking 

organization’s ongoing assessment of the risks posed by the particular customer relationship.  A 

banking organization takes many factors into account when conducting a customer risk 

assessment including, in particular, the standards the customer has in place to ensure compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations, and the relationship the customer seeks with the banking 

organization.  It is essential that banking organizations make a judgment as to customers with 

respect to the level of risk they pose.
