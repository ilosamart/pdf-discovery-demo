incorporating the impact of adverse outcomes or stressful events into their existing risk 

management and business decision-making process.   

 The capital stress testing framework that we have developed is a dynamic way of looking at 

potential threats to capital in the context of the company’s ability to replace capital through its 

earnings power, the current level of capital, and plans for capital distribution.  For traditional 

community banks, the primary threat to capital is the risk of loan losses.  We now have data on 

losses by loan category for two periods of severe financial stress, the recent financial crisis and 

the savings and loan crisis. 

 One way to test whether community banks have enough capital to withstand stress would 

be to apply the level of losses generally experienced in a stressed environment to bank loan 

portfolios to estimate potential losses.  In such an analysis, a bank with concentrations in a 

lending category that could experience high losses during times of economic stress, such as 

construction lending or credit card loans, would have a high potential loss rate applied to those 

portfolios and thus require more capital than a bank with a more conservative portfolio.  The 

rough estimates based on average losses by loan category could be further refined by looking at 

the individual bank loan classifications.  We could similarly study the impact of stressful 

conditions on pre-provision net revenue, but I don’t believe these fluctuations will have nearly as 

strong an impact on stressed capital as loan losses would have.  And this analysis could be 

accomplished in smaller banks using existing call report data and supervisory asset 

classifications. 

 There are two points here.  First, stress testing does not necessarily have to involve 

additional burden on the banks.  Second, and perhaps most importantly, I hope that bankers do
