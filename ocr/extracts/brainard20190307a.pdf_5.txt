In the United States, financial markets saw substantial volatility late last year, 

which may still be affecting sentiment.  From September to December of last year, 

financial conditions tightened considerably, with the stock market falling as much as 20

into heightened focus, and the accumulation of these risks could lead to some erosion in 

sentiment that could in turn feed into activity. 

Trade dispute escalation remains a risk.  The tariffs and trade disruptions that 

have occurred so far are estimated to have had relatively modest effects on aggregate 

growth and inflation, although damaging disruptions have been concentrated in some 

sectors, such as soybeans.  While recent reports suggest some progress, the prospect of
