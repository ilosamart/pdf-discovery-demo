Section 211.24—Approval of Offices of
Foreign Banks; Procedures for
Applications; Standards for Approval;
Representative-Office Activities and
Standards of Approval; Preservation of
Existing Authority

This section addresses the application proce-
dures and approval process for branches, agen-
cies, representative offices, and commercial lend-
ing companies of foreign banks. The section
also lists the activities in which a representative
office may engage. In addition, this section
requires uninsured federal and state branches,
uninsured state branches, all state agencies, and
all representative offices to file a suspicious
activity report in accordance with the Federal
Reserve Board’s Regulation H.

Section 211.25—Termination of Offices of
Foreign Banks

This section addresses the grounds under which
a foreign bank may be required to terminate the
activities of its representative office, commercial
lending company subsidiary, or state branch or
agency. The section also includes termination
procedures. The license of a federal branch or
agency would be terminated by the OCC. A
state branch or agency license can only be
terminated by the respective state’s banking
authority.

Section 211.26—Examination of Offices
and Affiliates of Foreign Banks

This section requires an annual on-site exami-
nation of each branch, agency, or commercial
lending company of a foreign bank by:

• the Federal Reserve Board;

• the FDIC, if the branch is FDIC insured;

• the OCC, if the branch or agency is licensed
by the Comptroller; or

• the state supervisor, if the branch or agency is
licensed by the state.

To the extent possible, these examinations
should be coordinated with all the regulatory
agencies; and the examination of all U.S. offices
of the FBO should be conducted simultaneously.

Section 211.27—Disclosure of Supervisory
Information to Foreign Supervisors

As the title suggests, this section addresses the
disclosure of information to a foreign banking
regulatory or supervisory authority. Refer to the
regulation for details.

Section 211.28—Limitation on Loans to
One Borrower

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
aggregate of all outstanding loans and exten-
sions of credit at one time to a single borrower
by all state and federal branches and agencies of
the same FBO are subject to the limitations and
other provisions of section 5200 of the Revised
Statutes (12 USC 84). Section 5200 of the
Revised Statutes (12 USC 84) limits loans and
extensions of credit to a person outstanding at
one time which are not fully secured, to 15% per-
cent of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus for the association. Separate from and in
addition to this 15% limitation, loans and exten-
sions of credit to a person outstanding at one
time which are fully secured by readily market-
able collateral having a market value, are limited
to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus of the association. In the case of a
branch, the ‘‘unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus of the association’’ is the unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus of the FBO as
reported on the FBO’s Annual Report of FBO
(FR Y-7). Section 5200 allows for some exemp-
tions to these limits; however, the examiner
should place the burden of proof upon the
branch to justify qualifications for these
exemptions.

of Depository Institutions—
12 CFR 204

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System’s Regulation D was issued under the
authority of section 19 (12 USC 461) and other
provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and of
section 7 of the IBA (12 USC 3105). The
regulation relates to the reserves that depository
institutions are required to maintain. The reserve
requirements apply to a foreign bank’s branch or
agency located in the U.S., in the following
instances:
