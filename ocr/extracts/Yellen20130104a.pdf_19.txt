derivatives that would provide for harmonized rules and a level playing field, which is 

crucial given the global nature of derivatives markets.  In July, the Basel Committee and 

the International Organization of Securities Commissions proposed a framework for 

margin requirements on non-centrally-cleared derivatives.

  The finalized framework 

will inform rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators.    

The proposed framework would require financial firms and systemically 

important nonfinancial firms to collect two types of margin.  First, they would be 

obligated to collect variation margin on a regular basis, so if a derivative loses market 

value, the party experiencing a loss must realize the loss immediately.  This requirement 

codifies current best market practice, since the largest derivatives dealers already 

exchange variation margin daily.  However, and importantly, the framework extends this 

prudent risk-management practice to other derivatives counterparties.  Requiring timely 

payment of variation margin will go a long way toward ensuring that an AIG-like event 

will not happen again, since current exposures will not be allowed to build over time to 

unmanageable levels.

  Moreover, variation margin requirements will ensure that market 

participants will know that counterparties that they deal with will not be carrying large 

uncollateralized exposures that could impair their ability to perform in the future.  Those

 As documented by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, from 1998 to 2007, AIG, through its 

subsidiary AIG Financial Products, built up huge indirect exposures to real-estate-backed debt by writing 

OTC credit protection on structured finance products, including mortgage-backed securities and 

collateralized debt obligations that were in many cases ultimately backed by mortgages.  Importantly, 

because AIG enjoyed a credit rating of AAA for much of this period, its derivatives counterparties did not 

typically require it to post collateral at the time that new contracts were written.  Rather, AIG agreed to post 

collateral only if contracts fell in market value and AIG itself was downgraded.  AIG was first downgraded 

to AA in the spring of 2005.  It faced its first margin calls for credit default swaps covering mortgage-

backed collateralized debt obligations in mid-2007.  Initially, AIG was able to delay or minimize the 

collateral it had to post by disputing the contract valuations proposed by its counterparties.  But as the 

bonds it had insured continued to fall in value and AIG was further downgraded, it faced increasing and 

ultimately insurmountable collateral demands from its derivatives counterparties.  For more information, 

see Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011).
