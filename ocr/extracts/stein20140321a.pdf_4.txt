Do Financial Stability Considerations Belong in a Monetary Policy Framework? 

However, let me start with the conceptual question of whether financial stability 

considerations belong at all in a monetary policy framework.  As I said earlier, I think the 

clear in-principle answer here is “yes.”  The generic argument rests on three assumptions.  

First, suppose that the Federal Reserve focuses only on its traditional dual mandate of 

maximum employment and price stability.  To keep things simple, suppose further that 

these two goals are not in conflict with one another--say, because aggregate demand is 

weak, depressing both employment and inflation--so that we can boil things down to one 

objective:  keeping unemployment close to target.  With the usual quadratic loss objective 

function, this assumption would say that the Federal Reserve cares about minimizing the 

expected value of (U – U*)2.  A little bit of algebra shows that this objective function can 

in turn be decomposed into two pieces:  (1) an “expected shortfall” term, given by the 

squared deviation of expected unemployment from the target level of U*; and (2) a “risk” 

term, given by the variance of realized unemployment, U.5 

Second, the argument assumes that there is some variable summarizing financial 

market vulnerability--I will be abstract for the moment and just call it FMV--which is 

influenced by monetary policy.  That is, easier monetary policy leads to increased 

vulnerability as measured by FMV.  Moreover, when FMV is elevated, there is a greater 

probability of an adverse event--some kind of financial market shock--that, if it were to 

occur, would push up the unemployment rate, all else being equal.6    

                                                 
5 Kocherlakota (2014) emphasizes the same decomposition of the Federal Reserve’s loss function.  Note 
that, in focusing only on mean and variance, this functional form sets aside what may be another important 
aspect of vulnerabilities:  tail risks that are not well captured in variance as opposed to higher moments. 
6 If I had introduced an explicit time dimension, it might be more natural to assume that easier monetary 
policy today raises the probability of an adverse event at some medium-run future date, even while 
reducing the probability in the short run.  In this case, there might be an interesting set of intertemporal
