the potential for considerable social costs.  Application of the perspective to the proposal 

for a nondeposit liability cap revealed a number of important questions, an analysis of 

which could help determine the elements of such a proposal that would be most effective, 

identify costs, and possibly suggest alternative means to the same policy goals.  In the 

case of the third proposal, for minimum long-term debt requirements, the perspective did 

not immediately suggest any unfavorable unintended consequences, thereby perhaps 

strengthening its appeal as a near-term policy priority. 

I have only grazed the surface of useful work that may spring from this hybrid 

subdiscipline.  And, as with policy-relevant areas in which considerable work has already 

been done, we will never have all the analysis we might like before deciding whether to 

act and, if so, how.  That is the condition that usually prevails in policymaking.  But I am 

encouraged that Brookings has assembled this forum, which I hope will be a catalyst for 

much more academic activity in this area.
