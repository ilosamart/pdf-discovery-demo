problem, appraise the regulatory approach toward such institutions since the crisis, and consider 

alternatives. 

An appraisal of whether more or, as some would have it, fewer measures are needed 

under the approach taken in the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory actions will, I admit, be a 

little challenging.  Some measures--including stress testing, capital requirements, and resolution 

planning--are still in train, and others may be forthcoming as a result of the research program the 

Federal Reserve is launching to consider the potential for additional explicitly macroprudential 

features in capital and liquidity stress testing.3  Still, I think it is feasible to teach and assess the 

general approach of using multiple regulatory tools that impose requirements that force 

systemically important firms to internalize the costs their distress or failure would impose on the 

financial system, and then leaving the regulated firms to make decisions as to how to alter their 

size and activities in order to make themselves most profitable within the stricter regulatory 

constraints.  This approach can be usefully compared to structural or other approaches to the SIFI 

issue, such as caps on overall size or reimposition of the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial 

and investment banking. 

In addressing this topic, I have found it useful to try to specify as clearly as possible the 

adverse systemic consequences that may be feared by public authorities confronting the possible 

failure of a systemically important institution.  This exercise helps identify the regulatory 

measures that would be most effective in promoting the resiliency and orderly resolvability of 

such institutions.  On virtually any short list of concerns would be reliance on short-term 

wholesale funding sources, which may dry up quickly under stressed conditions.  A firm with
