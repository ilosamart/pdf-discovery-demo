however, that these measures are near levels that prevailed in the late 1990s or early 

2000s, a period when core inflation remained under 2 percent.  

While the late 1990s case proves that elevated values of these tightness measures 

do not automatically translate into rising inflation, a single episode provides only limited 

reassurance.  Thus, the FOMC takes seriously the possibility that tight markets for labor 

or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline 

outlook.  Our best estimates, however, suggest that so long as inflation expectations 

remain anchored, a modest steepening of the Phillips curve would be unlikely to cause a 

significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18  Once again, the 

key is the anchored expectations. 

Is the Natural Rate of Unemployment Lower Than Expected? 

A third risk--in this case an upside risk--is that the natural rate of unemployment 

could be even lower than current estimates.  Some have argued that the Fed should be 

removing policy accommodation much more slowly, pushing the economy to see if the 

natural rate of unemployment is lower still.  

Advocates of this view note that over the past several years of policy 

normalization, the economy has continued to strengthen and unemployment has fallen, 

but inflation has remained quiet.  As I discussed in a recent speech, many analysts have 

accounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural 

rate.19  For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 

percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from four well-known sources have 

fallen over that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent (figure 9).
