 supervision.4  Making data public--to the degree consistent with protecting firm-specific 

proprietary information--would have additional benefits.  In the specific context of 

greater transparency in supervisory stress tests, I see at least two. 

First, the release of details about assumptions, methods, and conclusions would 

expose the supervisory approach to greater outside scrutiny and discussion.  Sometimes 

those discussions will help us improve our assumptions or methodology.  At other times 

disclosure might reassure investors about the quality of the tests.  Either way, the public’s 

reaction to our assumptions and methods would be useful.   

Second, because loan portfolios are inherently difficult to value without a great 

deal of detailed information, increased transparency could be an important addition to the 

information available to investors and counterparties of the largest institutions.  If, as I 

believe, progress on the too-big-to-fail problem is integral to an effective reform of 

financial regulation, we must enhance market discipline.  The market discipline made 

possible by such means as special resolution mechanisms and contingent capital will be 

most effective if market participants have adequate information with which to make 

informed judgments about the banks.  

There are, to be sure, countervailing concerns.  In more normal economic times, 

when market participants are not fearing the worst and when banks do not have access to 

government capital injections as a backstop, the revelation that some major banks may 

have capital needs under a stress scenario might be unnecessarily destabilizing.  This
