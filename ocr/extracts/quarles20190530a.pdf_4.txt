instance, low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, and so may prompt businesses 

and households to overborrow.  Low rates may lead to a speculative bubble by 

compressing risk premiums for assets—such as equity, corporate bonds, and housing—

and potentially leading investors to extrapolate price gains into the future in a bout of 

irrational exuberance.  Low rates may also squeeze the profitability of financial 

intermediaries through narrow interest margins and other factors.  In turn, these 

intermediaries as well as investors that had promised fixed nominal rates of return—such 

as insurance companies and pension funds—may “reach for yield,” or take on more credit 

or duration risk in their portfolios in order to maintain high returns.  Taken to extremes, 

this story often does not end well.  Periods of excessive leverage, rapid credit growth, or 

buoyant credit market sentiment increase the risk to economic growth.3   

These dynamics point to the possibility that accommodative monetary policy, 

while necessary to support activity during the early stages of an economic expansion, 

may also increase vulnerabilities in the financial system, especially if maintained for too 

long.  These vulnerabilities weaken the financial system’s ability to absorb negative 

shocks, and so when a shock arrives, losses mount, the financial system weakens, lending 

slows, and economic activity slows by more than it would have otherwise, potentially 

leading to an economic downturn or a more severe recession.   

Should Financial Vulnerabilities Affect the Stance of Monetary Policy? 

These observations lead to the important question of whether and how financial 

vulnerabilities should affect the setting of monetary policy.  One simple framework for 

evaluating the tradeoffs associated with actively setting monetary policy to lean against
