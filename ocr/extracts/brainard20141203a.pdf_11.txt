increases at times of stress, reducing the associated “fire sales” in short-term wholesale 

funding markets.  

Consideration of the utility of these authorities is in preliminary phases.  It is 

being undertaken as part of a broad review of macroprudential authorities and not with 

regard to developments in any particular sector. 

Time-varying borrower-side tools 

For purposes of comparison, it is instructive to focus on how central banks in 

several advanced economies have dealt with housing booms in recent years.6  Financial 

authorities in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, and New Zealand have recently 

confronted rapidly rising residential housing prices in macroeconomic environments 

where there were compelling reasons not to use the policy rate as the first line of defense.  

They responded by imposing strictures on borrowers, through loan-to-value or debt-to-

income limits, in some cases in concert with disincentives to lenders, and in many cases 

in an escalating pattern.  Indeed, restrictions on borrowing are among the most commonly 

employed macroprudential tools and, according to some research, among the most 

effective in stemming the buildup of borrowing.7  

This is not a problem we face today.  If anything, the most pressing problem 

currently facing housing authorities in the United States is to restore vitality to the single-

family housing market, where construction activity remains puzzlingly weak.  However, 

6 As shown by Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert (2013), the United States had an active macroprudential 
policy that included frequent use of borrower restrictions until 1980; however, the use of borrower 
restrictions, and the underlying legal authorities, have diminished significantly since then.  See Douglas J.
