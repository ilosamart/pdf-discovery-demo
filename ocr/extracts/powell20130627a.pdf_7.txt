I see the first tool, forward guidance about rates, as really an extension of 

traditional central bank rate-setting policy.  By stating an intention to hold rates low and 

linking that intention to the path of the economy, forward guidance affects the path of 

longer-term rates and allows the market to make adjustments to these rates as economic 

conditions evolve.   

The second tool is large-scale asset purchases.  By purchasing and holding large 

amounts of Treasury securities and MBS, we put additional downward pressure on term 

premiums and so on long-term rates.  Asset purchases are an innovative, unconventional 

policy.  Their likely benefits may be accompanied by costs and risks, the nature and size 

of which remain uncertain. 

These two policies are complementary but play somewhat different roles.  Asset 

purchases are being deployed to add near-term momentum to the economy.  After those 

purchases are eventually completed, the purchased assets will remain on the Fedâ€™s 

balance sheet for some time and continue to put downward pressure on rates.  The 

Committee will continue to use interest rate policy, including forward guidance about 

short-term rates, as we return to full employment.  Provided inflation remains in check, 

the Committee will begin to assess whether to increase short-term rates when 

unemployment reaches 6.5 percent.  Two important considerations are likely to arise at 

that time.  First, if inflation remains low, as expected, that would be a signal that there is 

still significant slack in the economy.  Second, a variety of other information will shed 

further light on the health of the labor market, including the labor force participation rate, 

flows into and out of employment, and other measures of labor slack.  After the 

Committee first raises short-term rates, it will take a balanced, and in all likelihood
