 In closing, let me repeat my strong belief that community banks will continue to play an 

important role in our financial system in the years ahead, serving the credit needs of the 

communities they are a part of and know so well.  The Federal Reserve will continue to promote 

a stronger and more resilient financial system, while carefully considering the effects of our 

actions on community banks and tailoring supervision appropriately.  

Thank you.
