This sense of increased caution is reinforced by the answers to questions the survey posed 

to families about the amount of money they think they need to cope with emergencies and other 

unexpected events.  The median value of this measure of desired precautionary savings increased 

substantially from 2007 to 2009 for the preretirement groups that experienced large changes in 

wealth, regardless of whether the change was a gain or a loss, and was virtually unchanged for 

others (figure 7).  Furthermore, the largest percentage increase was for families that experienced 

wealth gains. 

The large changes in asset prices over the period may have had an effect on the 

willingness of the families in this age group to consume out of gains to assets or to reduce 

spending in response to asset losses.3  The survey responses suggest that the large drop in asset 

prices over the period may have increased boomer families’ sensitivity to future losses more than 

it affected their sensitivity to future gains.  In other words, it made them more cautious. 

In the boom years leading up to the crisis, many economists believed that increases in 

wealth, especially increases in home equity, helped fuel consumer spending.  However, fewer 

than 30 percent of boomer families reported in 2007 that they would be willing to spend out of 

any increase in asset values.  In 2009, that willingness declined for boomer families that 

experienced losses as well as for boomer families that experienced only small gains.   

Somewhat counterintuitively, boomer families that experienced significant gains in their net 

worth from 2007 to 2009--gains greater than the equivalent of six months of income--also 

remained largely unwilling to spend out of increases in asset values.  In fact, they were among 

the least willing in 2007 and they remained among the least willing two years later.  Thus, 

                                                 
3 The SCF asks whether families agree or disagree (on a five-point scale) with the following statements: “When the 
things that I own increase (decrease) in value, I am more (less) likely to spend money.”  Note that the “spend less” 
version of the question was only asked in 2009.
