Securities Holdings by the Federal Reserve  

The FOMC has also provided monetary accommodation by modifying the size 

and composition of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.  In particular, during 2009 

and early 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased about $1.4 trillion in agency mortgage-

backed securities (MBS) and agency debt securities and about $300 billion in longer-term 

Treasury securities.  Last November, the Committee initiated an additional $600 billion 

in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, and those transactions were completed at 

the end of June. 

At our recent September meeting, the FOMC announced that we intend to extend 

the average maturity of our securities holdings over coming months by selling 

$400 billion of short-term Treasury securities and purchasing an equivalent amount of 

long-term Treasury securities.  This maturity extension program should exert downward 

pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more 

accommodative, thereby supporting a stronger economic recovery.  At that meeting, we 

also decided that the principal payments from our holdings of agency securities will now 

be reinvested in agency MBS rather than in Treasury securities; this step was taken to 

support mortgage markets.   

Both of these decisions will affect the composition of our securities holdings 

without affecting the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet or the level of 

reserve balances of depository institutions.  Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the scale 

of the maturity extension program is necessarily limited by the amount of our holdings of 

shorter-term securities; furthermore, purchasing a very large proportion of the 

outstanding stock of longer-term Treasury securities could potentially have adverse
