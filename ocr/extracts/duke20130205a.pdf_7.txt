Community Bank Research 

 To help us better understand community bank issues, our subcommittee established an 

informal working group of economists from both the research and supervision functions in the 

Federal Reserve System.  The group is focused on understanding the factors that influence the 

viability and performance of community banks including, importantly, the effect of regulatory 

changes and their associated costs and benefits.  Members of this working group are exploring a 

number of interesting topics that I hope will help us to better understand the issues that affect 

community banks and, where appropriate, have a practical impact on how we supervise these 

banks. 

Determinants of Community Bank Profitability  

For example, a recent study undertaken by two Federal Reserve Board economists 

explores the determinants of community bank profitability from 1992 through 2010.

  The 

findings indicate that a number of bank characteristics are strongly correlated with performance, 

including relative bank size, portfolio composition, and management quality.  Within the group 

of banks with less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets included in this study, larger bank 

size is associated with significantly higher profitability.  Community banks with higher portfolio 

shares of real estate loans earn significantly lower profits, while those with higher portfolio 

shares of construction loans earn higher profits through most of the study period.  But, perhaps 

not surprisingly, the latter relationship does not hold for 2008 through 2010, when greater 

reliance on construction lending is associated with lower profitability.  Managerial quality, as 

measured by the management component of the banks’ regulatory ratings, is strongly related to

 Dean F. Amel and Robin A. Prager (2010), “Performance of Community Banks in Good Times and Bad Times,” 

unpublished paper, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, May.  

The study defines community banks as those with total organizational banking assets less than $1 billion in constant 

2005 dollars and at least 70 percent of deposits derived from a single metropolitan area or rural county.
