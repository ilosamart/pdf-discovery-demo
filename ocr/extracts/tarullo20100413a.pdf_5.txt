First, as already noted, there is wide support for a resolution mechanism for large 

financial firms that would create a third alternative to the current, unsatisfactory options of 

bailout or possibly destructive disorderly bankruptcy.  Both the reform bill passed by the House 

last year and the bill to be considered on the floor of the Senate contain variations on this basic 

proposal.   

Yet the debate around resolution proposals has highlighted the challenge of crafting a 

workable resolution regime for large, interconnected firms. The basic design problem is that such 

a regime must advance the goals of both financial stability and market discipline. While these 

goals are usually complementary, they can at times be competing--especially in periods of high 

financial stress, when time consistency problems can loom large. In the midst of a crisis, 

governments fearful of financial upheaval can be tempted to provide assistance to supposedly 

uninsured creditors, even at the cost of increasing moral hazard in the post-crisis period.  

Despite the design difficulties, I think certain features are essential in any special 

resolution process.  One is that any new regime should be used only in those rare circumstances 

where a firm's failure would have serious adverse effects on financial stability.  That is, the 

presumption should be that generally-applicable bankruptcy law applies to nonbank financial 

firms--even large, interconnected ones.  Another is that once the new regime is invoked, the 

government should have broad authority to wind down the financial firm in an orderly way.   

Most importantly, there should be a clear expectation that the shareholders and creditors 

of the failing firm will bear losses to the fullest extent consistent with preserving financial 

stability.  To personalize things for this audience, we must ensure that if you have invested 

money in a large financial firm that runs aground, you will suffer losses.  Shareholders of the 

firm ultimately are responsible for the organization's management (or mismanagement) and are
