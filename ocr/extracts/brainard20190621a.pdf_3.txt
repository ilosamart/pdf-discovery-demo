My own assessment is that the most likely path for the economy remains solid.  The latest 

data suggest that consumer spending is robust, and consumer confidence is high.  

Although the pace of payroll gains has moderated recently, unemployment is at a 50-year 

low, wages are growing, participation in the labor force has expanded, and 

unemployment insurance claims are at cycle lows.  Despite recent volatility, financial 

conditions overall remain supportive. 

Recent weeks, however, have seen important downside risks.  Crosscurrents from 

policy uncertainty have risen since early May, crimping business investment plans, 

raising concerns in some financial market segments, and weighing on global growth 

prospects.  Foreign authorities are seeking additional policy space to address growth and 

inflation shortfalls.  In addition, recent indicators of inflation and inflation expectations 

have been disappointing, making it all the more important to sustain the economyâ€™s 

momentum.   

The downside risks, if they materialize, could weigh on economic activity.  Basic 

principles of risk management in a low neutral rate environment with compressed 

conventional policy space would argue for softening the expected path of policy when 

risks shift to the downside.3   

Our Review 

With recent indicators suggesting the expansion is continuing at a solid pace and 

unemployment at a 50-year low, inflation has not yet moved to our goal on a sustained 

                                                 
3 One reason for caution is the risk of building financial market imbalances, such as currently elevated 
levels of risky corporate debt.  In my view, it is better to address such financial imbalances by activation of 
our countercyclical capital buffer, rigorous use of stress tests, and beefed-up monitoring of leveraged 
lending than by monetary policy.
