future overall stance of monetary policy.  This suggests there may be benefits in 

communications and predictability of a unified policy framework across the tools that is 

more predictable and continuous.  Relatedly, one helpful elaboration of the framework 

Bernanke proposes might be to incorporate a unified measure, or shadow rate, that would 

capture the degree of policy accommodation provided through the combined settings of 

both asset purchases and the policy rate.14  

Greater Cross-Border Spillovers 

Moving away from the policy proposal in the paper, there are two other aspects of 

a low neutral rate world that I want to touch on briefly:  cross-border spillovers and 

financial imbalances.  The new normal appears to be characterized by low neutral rates 

and a weak relationship between overall inflation and unemployment not only in the 

United States, but also in many other advanced economies with lower-bound episodes 

likely to be more prevalent.  The current environment appears also to evidence intensified 

cross-border feedback into financial conditions.15  In this kind of environment, it is 

conceivable the kind of committed forward guidance associated with the temporary price-

level targeting framework proposed by Bernanke, by helping rule out anticipation of a 

standard preemptive tightening, could help avoid unwarranted premature tightening 

through the exchange rate. 

 Given available data, it is difficult to disentangle whether the heightened cross-

border feedback effects are attributable to the low level of neutral rates, particular 

features of todayâ€™s lower-bound episodes, or the interaction of the policies adopted by 

many central banks.  In any case, recent Federal Reserve staff analysis suggests that
