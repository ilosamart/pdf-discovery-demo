potential for high inflation or in uncertainty about policy could boost term premiums on

Treasury securities, which could trigger declines in asset prices across a range of markets.

The scenarios for this year’s stress tests, which were announced in February, 

feature material decreases in asset prices--notably including CRE prices--along with a 

substantial rise in Treasury term premiums.  Although the severely adverse scenarios 

always include severe recessions and sharp declines in asset prices, in past years, they 

have been accompanied by large declines in Treasury yields, which have resulted in 

capital gains on these securities.9 In contrast, in this year’s severely adverse scenario, 

yields on longer-maturity Treasury securities are flat. In this way, this year’s severely 

adverse scenario addresses one of the salient vulnerabilities that have been identified. By 

encouraging institutions at the core of the system to build resilience against such an 

eventuality, we seek to lessen the severity of the distress to the overall financial system 

should asset prices fall and term premiums rise sharply in a challenging macroeconomic 

environment.

Even with these design features, the Fed’s stress-testing framework has some 

limitations in counteracting the inherent pro-cyclicality in the availability of credit.

Indeed, the stress tests have become less binding on banks as the recovery has gathered 

strength.  Thus, losses on loans and positions in the severely adverse scenario among 

participating banks have declined over time as the economy has strengthened. For 

example, in the 2016 exercise, losses amounted to $526 billion, while in 2017 they had 

fallen to $493 billion, despite a larger increase in the unemployment rate in the scenario.

As economic conditions strengthen, typical measures of underwriting quality look strong,

9 Over the years, our adverse scenarios, which are not designed to be the binding scenario for capital 
planning purposes, have featured large increases in Treasury yields across the maturity curve.
