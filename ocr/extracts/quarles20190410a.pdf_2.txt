I am pleased that we have this opportunity to meet with many of the institutions 

active in helping to achieve a transition from LIBOR to the risk-free rates identified by 

working groups in each of our jurisdictions.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has 

coordinated the international effort to reform interest rate benchmarks at the direction of 

the G-20.  This is an important effort across the globe, but nowhere is it of more 

importance than in the jurisdictions relying on LIBOR.    

Letâ€™s review the reasons that we are here.  By the time of the financial crisis, 

much of the global financial system had come to rely on LIBOR.  And yet LIBOR was a 

very poorly structured rate; contributing banks were asked to submit quotes without any 

requirement of evidence of transactions or other facts to back them up, which made them 

susceptible to manipulation.  Thanks to subsequent reforms, contributors now provide 

this type of evidence where possible, but LIBOR is based on an underlying market with 

so few transactions that there is relatively little direct evidence they can provide.  Many 

submitting banks are uncomfortable with this situation, and some sought to stop their 

participation.  As a result, the official sector has had to step in to support LIBOR by 

securing a voluntary agreement with the remaining banks to continue submitting through 

2021.  At the same time, the official sector has convened national working groups to help 

develop alternative risk-free rates and navigate a very complicated transition.   

Many people have used reference rates with little thought.  The experience with 

LIBOR should teach us that this has to change and that we cannot risk making this kind 

of mistake again.  Banks should conduct at least as much due diligence on the reference 

rates that they use as they conduct on the creditworthiness of their borrowers.  The 

national working groups convened by many of the FSB member authorities have
