Tomorrow” series.  My public remarks often concern short-run economic developments, 

but it is important once in a while to place those shorter-term developments in the context 

of the powerful long-term trends shaping the global economy.  Of these trends, surely one 

of the most important is the rapid and sustained economic growth achieved by the 

emerging market economies.  Today, by some measures at least, developing and 

emerging market economies now account for more than one-half of global economic 

activity, up substantially from less than one-third in 1980.1  Today I will discuss what the 

experience of the emerging markets teaches us about the sources of economic growth and 

conclude with some thoughts about the prospects for future growth in this critical part of 

the global economy. 

Among the emerging market economies, the Asian “growth miracle” is, of course, 

the most conspicuous success story, with the case of China being particularly dramatic.  

Over the past three decades, growth in Chinese output per person has averaged roughly 

9 percent a year, putting per capita output about 13 times higher now than in 1980.  The 

economy of Korea, another East Asian success story, has expanded, on average, at better 

than a 6 percent annual rate over the past 30 years.  Growth in Latin America has been 

more moderate, but that continent has made substantial economic progress as well, most 

notably in terms of lower inflation and greater economic stability.  More recently, the

valuation of a country’s GDP based on purchasing power parity exchange rates.  The emerging market and 
developing economies group used here includes the IMF’s classification of newly industrialized Asian 
economies.  There is no consensus definition of emerging economies, as contrasted with developing 
economies, but generally speaking, emerging market economies are defined as those economies in the low- 
to middle-income category that are advancing rapidly and are integrating with global capital and product 
markets.  Emerging economies account for most of the rise in the share of the developing and emerging 
economies in global output, and they are the focus of this speech.
