wrong to assume that all shadow banking ought to be regulated to safeguard financial stability.  

This view is reflected in the Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report for 2015, which has just 

been issued by the Financial Stability Board.  The report begins by including all activities that 

could arguably be included in the very broad category of shadow banking, but then classifies 

these activities by economic function and risks.  The result is about a 70 percent decrease in the 

amount of intermediation otherwise captured by the broader definition.4 

Thus, assessing whether regulation is appropriate for specific forms of nonbank 

intermediation requires a balancing of the resulting increase in socially beneficial credit, capital, 

or savings options against any associated increase in risks to the safety and stability of the 

financial system as a whole.  The chief relevant factors to consider include the extent of reliance 

on maturity or liquidity transformation, the creation of cash equivalent assets, the use of 

leverage, and the degree of interconnection with the traditional banking sector.   

 When growth in nonbank intermediation reflects a migration of traditional banking 

activities to less-regulated entities, a number of similar considerations are relevant to an 

evaluation of the costs and benefits of the migration and the potential need for a regulatory 

response.  Here, where the activity is probably quite bank-like, I am going to revert to the use of 

the term shadow bank.   

First, to what extent does the activity, as practiced by shadow banks, entail reliance on 

leverage or on maturity or liquidity transformation that could lead to a bank-like creditor run 

dynamic?  Bank regulation is primarily aimed at preventing the occurrence of such destabilizing
