when conditions deteriorate rapidly.  Even if supervisors were to announce a relaxation in 

regulatory requirements, in stressed economic conditions, investors and counterparties 

may well look unfavorably on reductions in capital levels (even from higher levels) or 

relaxation of underwriting standards at any one firm, notwithstanding the potential 

benefits for the economy as a whole were all large firms to follow suit.  Anticipating such 

a reaction, senior management of banks may thus have strong non-regulatory incentives 

to act as if microprudential regulation continued to dominate.  

In short, the task of buffering the financial system against a tail event seems more 

tractable than that of moderating the financial cycle.  But these questions of economic 

knowledge and institutional capacities should be grounds for proceeding cautiously, not 

for eschewing time-varying measures entirely.  It is true that the state of the art of 

financial stability risk assessment is still in a relatively early stage.  But it is reasonable to 

think that the amount of effort being put into these efforts in governments, central banks, 

international organizations, and universities will produce some well-conceived and well-

tested metrics over time.  Some deviations from historical patterns are, even under 

existing states of knowledge, surely clear enough to justify some action.    

Moreover, in the absence of time-varying macroprudential tools, the burden of 

systemic risk containment will rest entirely elsewhere.  For time invariant measures to 

bear this burden, it might be necessary to have through-the-cycle constraints that 

strengthen financial stability at greater cost to economic activity.  If a central bank is 

reluctant ever to use monetary policy in pursuit of financial stability goals at the expense 

of more immediate employment and price stability goals, the burden on time invariant 

measures would be large indeed.  Even if financial stability objectives are effectively
