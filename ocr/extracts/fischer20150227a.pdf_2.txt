Thank you.  It is a great pleasure to be here to discuss some of the important 

issues facing the Federal Reserve and other central banks in conducting monetary policy 

with a large balance sheet.  I will focus on two main sets of issues that the Fed has faced 

and will continue to face for some time.  The first involves our ongoing assessment of the 

effects of the asset purchases.  The second concerns policy normalization in the presence 

of a very large balance sheet.  

To set the stage, consider the size of the Fedâ€™s balance sheet over the past several 

years.  Assets have risen from about $900 billion in 2006 to about $4.5 trillion today, or--

as seen in figure 1--from 6 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) to about 

26 percent of nominal GDP.  The net expansion over this period reflects primarily our 

large-scale asset purchase programs. 

Of course, many other central banks have expanded their balance sheets 

substantially over recent years as well.  For example, assets of the Bank of Japan have 

increased from about 20 percent of nominal GDP to more than 60 percent of nominal 

GDP over this period, and assets of the Swiss National Bank have increased from 

20 percent of nominal GDP to more than 80 percent of nominal GDP.  The net increase in 

assets of the European Central Bank has so far been more modest, with assets increasing 

from less than 10 percent of nominal GDP to more than 20 percent of nominal GDP--but 

their quantitative easing (QE) program is not yet under way. 

For the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on the Fed, beginning with some 

remarks about the asset purchase programs.
