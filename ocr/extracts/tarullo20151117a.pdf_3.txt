prudentially regulated firms.  Shadow banking is not a single, identifiable “system,” but a 

constantly changing and largely unrelated set of intermediation activities pursued by very 

different types of financial market actors.  Indeed, the very rigor of post-crisis reforms to 

prudential regulation may create new opportunities for such activities.  The aphoristic warning to 

avoid too much emphasis on fighting the last war, since wholly new risks may have arisen, 

seems particularly applicable in this area.   

 Yet there is simultaneously the opposite danger that the regulatory response to shadow 

banking will be too broad and too unidimensional.  Indeed, the very term “shadow banking” tilts 

in that direction.  This afternoon, I will try to identify some of the considerations that could help 

navigate between the perils of underappreciating the risks to financial stability arising from, and 

the costs from overreacting to, new forms of nonbank financial intermediation.  Along the way I 

will make a few points.  One is that, analytically, it is essential to disaggregate the various 

activities that fall under the loose term shadow banking and to assess the risks and benefits they 

present on a discrete basis.  A second is that, notwithstanding the manifold nature of nonbank 

intermediation, it remains useful to identify the relationship of specific activities to the 

prudentially regulated sector.  A third is that institutional considerations will be important in 

defining the potential, and actual, regulatory responses to nonbank intermediation.  

The Legacy of Shadow Banking  

As you have probably noticed already, I have some misgivings about the continued use of 

the term shadow banking as a shorthand for various forms of nonbank financial intermediation 

that may need a regulatory response.  The term conjures up a picture of lending and borrowing 

that resembles activity associated with, but not conducted by, commercial banks which is both 

over- and under-inclusive of actual risks to financial stability.  Before elaborating on this point,
