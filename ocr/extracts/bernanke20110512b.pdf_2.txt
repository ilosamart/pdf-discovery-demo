Good evening.  I am very pleased to join the United States-Mexico Chamber of 

Commerce at this gala dinner as its members look back on another year of working to 

build the mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship between our two 

countries.  The ties between Mexico and the United States, both economic and cultural,

International Monetary Fund.  In late 2006, not long after I became Chairman, he became 

finance minister of Mexico, and last year he succeeded Guillermo Ortiz as governor of 

the Bank of Mexico.  We have had many opportunities to meet and share views about the
