that the Bank was initially glad to cede many of its financial powers, but that it was later 

even more glad to have those powers restored.

Financial supervision has also been reformed in the United States in light of the 

crisis.  The Federal Reserve, which always had regulatory powers, received enhanced 

authority and devoted more resources to financial stability.31 In both countries, it 

remains the case that not all financial stability responsibilities rest with the central bank--

so it is less independent in this area than in monetary policy proper--and the central 

bank’s tools for achieving financial stability are still being refined. Indeed, as I have

noted previously, a major concern of mine is that the U.S. macroprudential toolkit is not 

large and not yet battle tested.32

The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England benefit from each other’s 

experience as they develop and improve arrangements to meet their financial stability 

responsibilities.  One major innovation that deserves mention is that the Bank of England

has two policy committees: Alongside the MPC is the Financial Policy Committee 

(FPC).  Although they coordinate and have partially overlapping memberships, the MPC 

and FPC are distinct committees.

Why have both the MPC and the FPC? I offer a few possible reasons.  First, not 

all of a central bank’s responsibilities typically rest with its monetary committee.  This is 

true not only of the Bank of England, but also of the Federal Reserve:  Our financial 

regulatory authority resides in the Board of Governors, not the FOMC.  Second, 

aggregate monetary policy tools--typically, one is talking of the policy interest rate--are

Financial Stability Policy and Research (which later became the Division of Financial Stability).
