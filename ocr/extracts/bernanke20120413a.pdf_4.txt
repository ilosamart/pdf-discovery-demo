trillion in paper wealth.  However, on closer examination, it is not clear that even the 

large movements in house prices, in the absence of the underlying weaknesses in our 

financial system, can account for the magnitude of the crisis.  First, much of the decline 

in house prices has occurred since the most intense phase of the crisis; the decline in 

prices since September 2008 is probably better viewed as largely the result of, rather than 

a cause of, the crisis and ensuing recession.  More fundamentally, however, any theory of 

the crisis that ties its magnitude to the size of the housing bust must also explain why the 

fall of dot-com stock prices just a few years earlier, which destroyed as much or more 

paper wealth--more than $8 trillion--resulted in a relatively short and mild recession and 

no major financial instability.

  Once again, the explanation of the differences between 

the two episodes must be that the problems in housing and mortgage markets interacted 

with deeper vulnerabilities in the financial system in ways that the dot-com bust did not.   

So let me turn, then, to a discussion of those vulnerabilities and how they amplified the 

effects of triggers like the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.   

A number of the vulnerabilities I listed a few moments ago were associated with 

the increased importance of the so-called shadow banking system.  Shadow banking, as 

usually defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, 

carry out traditional banking functions--but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked 

to, the traditional system of regulated depository institutions.  Examples of important

 According to the Federal Reserve’s statistical release “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,” the 

value of real estate held by households fell from $22.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2006 to $20.9 trillion in 

the fourth quarter of 2007 (down 8.1 percent from the first quarter of 2006).  It then declined to 

$18.5 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 (down 18.6 percent from the first quarter of 2006) and to 

$16.0 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2011 (down 29.7 percent from the first quarter of 2006).  The stock 

market wealth of U.S. households peaked at $18.1 trillion in the first quarter of 2000 and fell $6.2 trillion to 

$11.9 trillion through the third quarter of 2001.  After a short-lived recovery, stock market wealth bottomed 

at $9.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2002.  Overall, stock market wealth fell $8.3 trillion (or 46 percent) 

between its peak in the first quarter of 2000 and its trough in the third quarter of 2002.  The flow of funds 

accounts are published quarterly and are available at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1.
