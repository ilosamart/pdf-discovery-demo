 I am not suggesting, and I do not expect, that the path ahead for monetary policy 

will be an easy one.  There are legitimate concerns associated with the costs and benefits 

of continuing asset purchases.  We may face challenges related to financial stability, as 

well as market function and inflation expectations.  I do not personally see fiscal 

dominance as high on the list of near term risks. 

I thank the authors for their interesting work.
