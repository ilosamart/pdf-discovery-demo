More generally, the Federal Reserve has invested substantial resources in developing 

technological tools for examiners to improve the efficiency of both off-site and on-site 

supervisory activities.  These measures should lead to greater consistency and more efficient, 

effective, and risk-focused examinations by better enabling staff to tailor the scope of 

examinations to the activities and risks of individual banks.  The automation of various parts of 

the community bank examination process can also save examiners and bankers time, as a bank 

can submit requested pre-examination information electronically rather than mailing paper 

copies to a Reserve Bank.  Through these efforts, the Federal Reserve aims to strike an 

appropriate balance between off-site and on-site supervisory activities to ensure that community 

banks are subject to supervision that is both high-quality and resource-efficient. 

Fourth, our supervisory oversight of community banks is itself grounded in the traditional 

relationship banking model of funding local lending with customer deposits.  There are risks in 

this model, of course, since geographic and portfolio concentration can make community banks 

vulnerable to local economic downturns, as we have witnessed during and after the Great 

Recession.  Even though the number of banks on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 

“Problem List” has fallen from a peak of 888 at the end of the first quarter of 2011 to 291 at the 

end of 2014, this number is still nearly three times the historical average.  But these risks are 

understood by supervisors and bankers.  Traditional regulatory and supervisory methods are well 

suited to deal with them.  Indeed, it is noteworthy that most community banks adhering to this 

model continued to thrive even during the worst years of the financial crisis.3
