force attachment of workers suffering long-term unemployment, thereby turning what was 

initially cyclical into structural unemployment.  This risk provides another important reason to 

support the recovery by maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. 

The Conduct of Policy with Unconventional Tools  

Now turning to monetary policy, I will begin by discussing the FOMC’s reliance on 

unconventional tools to address the disappointing pace of recovery.  I will then elaborate my 

rationale for supporting a highly accommodative policy stance.    

As you know, since late 2008, the FOMC’s standard policy tool, the target federal funds 

rate, has been maintained at the zero lower bound.  To provide further accommodation, we have 

employed two unconventional tools to support the recovery--extended forward guidance about 

the future path of the federal funds rate, and large-scale asset purchases and other balance sheet 

actions that have greatly increased the size and duration of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.   

These two tools have become increasingly important because the recovery from the 

recession has turned out to be persistently slower than either the FOMC or private forecasters 

anticipated.  Figure 6 illustrates the magnitude of the disappointment by comparing Blue Chip 

forecasts for real GDP growth made two years ago with ones made earlier this year.  As shown 

by the dashed blue line, private forecasters in early 2010 anticipated that real GDP would expand 

at an average annual rate of just over 3 percent from 2010 through 2014.  However, actual 

growth in 2011 and early 2012 has turned out to be much weaker than expected, and, as 

indicated by the dotted red line, private forecasters now anticipate only a modest acceleration in 

real activity over the next few years.   

In response to the evolving outlook, the FOMC has progressively added policy 

accommodation using both of its unconventional tools.  For example, since the federal funds rate
