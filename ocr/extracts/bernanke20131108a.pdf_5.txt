The recent crisis echoed many aspects of the 1907 panic.  Like most crises, the 

recent episode had an identifiable trigger--in this case, the growing realization by market 

participants that subprime mortgages and certain other credits were seriously deficient in 

their underwriting and disclosures.  As the economy slowed and housing prices declined, 

diverse financial institutions, including many of the largest and most internationally 

active firms, suffered credit losses that were clearly large but also hard for outsiders to 

assess.  Pervasive uncertainty about the size and incidence of losses in turn led to sharp 

withdrawals of short-term funding from a wide range of institutions; these funding 

pressures precipitated fire sales, which contributed to sharp declines in asset prices and 

further losses.  Institutional changes over the past century were reflected in differences in 

the types of funding that ran:  In 1907, in the absence of deposit insurance, retail deposits 

were much more prone to run, whereas in 2008, most withdrawals were of uninsured 

wholesale funding, in the form of commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and 

securities lending.  Interestingly, a steep decline in interbank lending, a form of wholesale 

funding, was important in both episodes.  Also interesting is that the 1907 panic involved 

institutions--the trust companies--that faced relatively less regulation, which probably 

contributed to their rapid growth in the years leading up to the panic.  In analogous 

fashion, in the recent crisis, much of the panic occurred outside the perimeter of 

traditional bank regulation, in the so-called shadow banking sector.5 

                                                 
5 As discussed in Bernanke, “Some Reflections on the Crisis” (see note 1), shadow banking, as usually 
defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, carry out traditional banking 
functions--but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked to, the traditional system of regulated 
depository institutions.  Examples of important components of the shadow banking system include 
securitization vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, money market funds, markets for 
repurchase agreements, investment banks, and mortgage companies.
