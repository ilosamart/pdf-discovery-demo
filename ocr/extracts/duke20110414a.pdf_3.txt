In addition, business start-ups are a critical component of the experimentation process 

that contributes to restructuring and growth in the United States on an ongoing basis.  

Indeed, each wave of firm start-ups creates a substantial number of jobs.  Over the past 

two decades, firms less than two years old accounted for about one-fourth of gross job 

creation even though such enterprises employed less than 10 percent of the workforce.1  

But, as a note of caution, these young firms also have high job destruction rates; within 

five years of starting up, about 40 percent of the jobs initially created have been 

eliminated by the firms’ exit from their market.  The “up or out” dynamics of start-ups 

and young firms are consistent with the innovation, learning, and market selection that is 

associated with entrepreneurship.   

Given the key role that start-up and established small businesses play in job 

creation, it is useful to consider how start-ups are typically funded and how the owners of 

more-mature, but still small, businesses tend to support their ongoing operations.  To this 

end, the Federal Reserve’s 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) provides some new 

and very preliminary data regarding the primary sources of money used to start, acquire, 

or expand closely held businesses.2  The survey was conducted largely over the second 

half of 2010. 

In this discussion, I will focus on the responses by owners of businesses with 

fewer than 500 employees that were in operation at the time of our survey.  For these 

small and nascent businesses, more than 70 percent were initiated using personal savings 

or assets, about 6 percent were initiated using a personal loan from a bank or savings

survey have been assessed and analyzed.
