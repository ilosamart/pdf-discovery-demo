people who are working part time for economic reasons, have improved less than the 

unemployment rate.  Labor force participation has continued to decline, and, although 

some of this decline reflects longer-term trends that were in place prior to the crisis, some 

of it likely reflects potential workersâ€™ discouragement about job prospects. 

In retrospect, at least, many of the factors that held back the recovery can be 

identified.  Some of these factors were difficult or impossible to anticipate, such as the 

resurgence in financial volatility associated with the European sovereign debt and 

banking crisis and the economic effects of natural disasters in Japan and elsewhere.  

Other factors were more predictable; in particular, we appreciated early on, though 

perhaps to a lesser extent than we might have, that the boom and bust left severe 

imbalances that would take time to work off.  As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff noted 

in their prescient research, economic activity following financial crises tends to be 

anemic, especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid 

growth in credit and real estate prices.16  Weak recoveries from financial crises reflect, in 

part, the process of deleveraging and balance sheet repair:  Households pull back on 

spending to recoup lost wealth and reduce debt burdens, while financial institutions 

restrict credit to restore capital ratios and reduce the riskiness of their portfolios.  In 

addition to these financial factors, the weakness of the recovery reflects the overbuilding 

of housing (and, to some extent, commercial real estate) prior to the crisis, together with 

tight mortgage credit; indeed, recent activity in these areas is especially tepid in 

comparison to the rapid gains in construction more typically seen in recoveries. 

Although the Federal Reserve, like other forecasters, has tended to be 

overoptimistic in its forecasts of real GDP during this recovery, we have also, at times,
