Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges to be consistent, over the longer run, 

with its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.   

In this context, the Federal Reserve decided at its November meeting to undertake 

additional monetary policy actions to satisfy its dual mandate.  After weighing carefully 

the uncertainties and risks, the FOMC decided to further expand the Federal Reserve’s 

holdings of longer-term Treasury securities.  The objective of this action is to reduce 

longer-term interest rates, thereby promoting a stronger pace of economic growth.  The 

purchase of longer-term securities, while in some ways “unconventional,” is actually 

quite similar to the Fed’s traditional approach to monetary policy, which involves 

lowering the overnight federal funds rate by increasing the supply of reserve balances. 

With the federal funds rate now effectively pinned at zero, purchases of longer-term 

securities are intended to push down rates further out the yield curve.  By bolstering 

activity in the United States and mitigating risks that could threaten the recovery, this 

policy should also provide support for a sustained expansion of the global economy. 

In announcing its intention to purchase an additional $600 billion of longer-term 

Treasury securities, the FOMC committed to review the purchase program regularly in 

light of incoming information and to make adjustments as needed to meet our objectives.  

The Committee, of course, recognizes that at the appropriate time, as the economy more 

fully recovers, the Federal Reserve will need to remove this extraordinary monetary 

accommodation in order to maintain price stability and keep inflation expectations well 

anchored.  I am confident that the Federal Reserve has both the commitment and the tools 

to achieve this unwinding.
