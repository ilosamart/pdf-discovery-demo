and securities lending.  Work is ongoing to develop globally uniform margin requirements for 

OTC derivatives, but there is not yet an agreement to develop globally uniform margin 

requirements for securities financing transactions.  Such a margining system would not only limit 

leverage, but—to the extent it is in fact uniform—also diminish incentives to use more 

complicated and less transparent transactional forms to increase leverage or reduce its cost.  

Some proponents suggest that such systems of uniform haircut and margin requirements could 

also dampen the observed procyclical character of many collateralized borrowings that results 

from changes in margins and haircuts following general economic or credit trends. 

Conclusion 

The shadow banking system today is considerably smaller than at the height of the 

housing bubble six or seven years ago.  And it is very likely that some forms of shadow banking 

most closely associated with that bubble have disappeared forever.  But as the economy recovers, 

it is nearly as likely that, without policy changes, existing channels for shadow banking will 

grow, and new forms creating new vulnerabilities will arise.  That is why I suggest what is, in 

essence, a two-pronged agenda: first, near-term action to address current channels where 

mispricing, run risk, and potential moral hazard are evident; and, second, continuation of the 

academic and policy debate on more fundamental measures to address these issues more broadly 

and proactively.
