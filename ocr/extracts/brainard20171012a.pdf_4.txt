not likely to be sufficient and proposes a framework that relies on forward guidance with 

commitment to help central banks achieve their inflation and employment objectives.  

The Makeup Principle  

The academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for 

preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation expectations.  

The paper argues convincingly that many of these proposals present practical difficulties 

that would create a very high bar for their adoption.  For instance, raising the inflation 

target sufficiently to provide meaningfully greater policy space could engender public 

discomfort or, at the other extreme, risk unmooring inflation expectations.  The transition 

to a notably higher target is likely to be challenging and could heighten uncertainty.    

As I have noted previously, the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our 

objective is an important consideration for monetary policy.7  The makeup principle, in 

which policy would make up for past misses of the inflation target, is not reflected in 

most standard monetary policy frameworks, although it is an important precept in 

theory.8  Some of the proposals that have been advanced to implement this principle 

present some difficulties.  For example, while price-level targeting would be helpful in 

the aftermath of a recession that puts the economy at the effective lower bound, it could 

require tightening into a negative supply shock, which is a very unattractive feature, as 

Bernanke points out.9

9 As Bernanke notes, one way to avoid this feature is to adopt “flexible price-level targeting,” in which 
policy takes into account resource utilization as well as the deviation of the price level from its target.  
Kiley and Roberts (2017) examine a form of flexible price-level targeting—which they refer to as a 
“shadow rate rule”—and find that it performs well.
