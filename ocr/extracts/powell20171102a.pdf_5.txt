the Financial Stability Board (FSB), we charged the ARRC with identifying a robust alternative 

to U.S. dollar LIBOR and with developing a plan to encourage its use in some derivatives and 

other transactions as appropriate.   

The ARRC has accomplished the things that we asked of it.  I want to thank the members 

for their work and also to extend my special thanks to Sandie O’Connor as the chair of the 

ARRC.  Sandie will discuss the ARRC’s work shortly, but I’ll make a few points.   

First, I’d note that, like most market participants, the ARRC members initially had a 

difficult time conceiving of any kind of transition from LIBOR.  As is the case for all of you, a 

transition will be a complicated task for the broker-dealers and other members of the ARRC, and 

will involve significant costs.  Over time, however, I think the ARRC members have developed a 

greater understanding of the risks to LIBOR and now see that, despite those complications and 

costs, a transition may prove necessary.  I also think that, having had time to consider the 

transition plans that Sandie will talk about, ARRC members have become more comfortable with 

the idea that a transition is feasible, even if the necessity of achieving it is regrettable.  

  Second, it is clear that any rate the ARRC selected as a potential alternative needed to be 

highly robust.  There would be no point in selecting a rate that might find itself quickly in the 

same kinds of conditions that LIBOR is in now.  In our view, the ARRC has chosen the most 

robust rate available.  In general, only overnight unsecured or secured funding markets appeared 

to have enough underlying transactions to produce a robust rate.  The overnight Treasury repo 

market is the largest and most active market in any tenor of U.S. rates markets.  Figure 2 

illustrates the point:  the transactions underlying the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), 

at about $700 billion per day or more, are much larger than the volumes in overnight unsecured 

markets, even much larger than estimates of the volume in Treasury bills, and they dwarf the
