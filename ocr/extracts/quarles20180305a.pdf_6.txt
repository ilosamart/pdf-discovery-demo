oversight.3  We are committed to continuing this outcomes-focused approach and to refining it 

where needed. 

Further, we recognize that effective stress testing regimes can take many different forms, 

specifically when interpreting the home-country stress testing requirements of the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Board has acknowledged, for example, 

that a foreign bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) may meet the 

minimum standards, provided that the firm’s ICAAP is on a consolidated basis and reviewed by 

the home country regulator.   

In addition, while we believe that the IHC requirement serves a valuable role in ensuring 

consistency of regulation across U.S. operations of an FBO, the Board has reserved authority to 

approve multiple IHCs if circumstances warrant based on the FBO’s activities, scope of 

operations, structure, home country regulatory framework, or similar considerations.  For 

example, the Board’s enhanced prudential standards rule contemplates allowing multiple IHCs in 

cases where home country legal requirements inhibit the combination of certain bank and 

nonbank operations.   

In practice, and in several instances, the Board has permitted a foreign bank to maintain 

certain U.S. subsidiaries outside of its IHC, so long as the foreign bank did not have practical 

control over that subsidiary.4  In addition, the Board recently approved an application by a 

foreign bank for a second IHC.  Part of our rationale for approving the dual IHC structure was 

                                                            
3 See 12 CFR 252.155(a)(3) (requiring an FBO with U.S. branches and agencies and combined U.S. assets of        
$50 billion or more to maintain its risk committee as a committee of the board of directors of its U.S. intermediate 
holding company (as applicable) or as a committee or the global board of directors (or equivalent thereof)); see also
