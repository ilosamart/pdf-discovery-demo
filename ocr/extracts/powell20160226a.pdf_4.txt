2013.”4  The calendar reference was later extended in a couple of steps to “at least 

through mid-2015.”5  This guidance was explicitly time-based, and the authors seem to 

agree that, through this point, the guidance served its intended purpose at the zero lower 

bound by pushing down medium- and longer-term rates.6 

At the December 2012 meeting, the Committee ended this calendar-based 

guidance.  The Committee instead adopted thresholds, saying that it did not intend to 

raise rates at least as long as unemployment remained above 6½ percent, inflation one to 

two years ahead was projected to be no higher than 2½ percent, and longer-term inflation 

expectations remained well anchored.7  The adoption of thresholds was a clear change to 

data-based guidance, as its principal sponsors had frequently urged.8  The point was not

6 Some viewed this guidance as merely a forecast of Committee action, designed to better inform the 
market and reduce uncertainty.  Others have argued that such guidance is understood as a promise to which 
the Committee will be held irrespective of future macroeconomic developments.  The Committee never 
offered a single explanation, and participants may have had different views.  Engen, Laubach, and 
Reifschneider (2015) argue that the Federal Reserve’s time-based guidance initiated in August 2011 was 
highly effective in inducing market participants to change their beliefs about the Committee’s reaction 
function and to regard monetary policy as more accommodative.  Using Blue Chip survey data, the authors 
estimate that the perceived weight on resource slack roughly doubled between March 2011 and March 
2012.  In an August 2011 speech, Chairman Bernanke indicated that the guidance about the federal funds 
rate path was highly conditional on the outlook, saying, “in what the Committee judges to be the most 
likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds 
rate would be held at its current low levels for at least two more years.”  (Ben S. Bernanke (2011), “The
