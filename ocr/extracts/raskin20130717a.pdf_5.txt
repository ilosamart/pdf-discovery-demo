For loans collateralized by an asset whose price is rising, lenders believe they can 

rely for repayment more on the appreciation of the asset and collateral and less on the 

borrower’s repayment ability. Lenders relax their underwriting standards, such as 

minimum requirements for borrower down payments, credit scores and credit history, or 

required maximum debt-to-income ratios. To compete for loans to buy or to hold the 

appreciating asset, or financial assets related to it, financial institutions could also 

decrease the margins and haircuts that usually protect them from asset price declines.  

Financial institution decisions to relax underwriting and impose less-stringent 

margins and haircuts will further increase the pool of potential borrowers and their 

borrowing capacity, further increasing credit growth and supporting still higher asset 

prices, but, at the same time, will also increase lenders’ credit risks and exposure--as 

secured creditors--to a decline in the asset’s price. Ultimately, the asset becomes severely 

overvalued, with its price untethered from economic fundamentals. We would then have 

on our hands a full-blown, credit-fueled asset bubble. 

 And, as we experienced in the financial crisis, when a bubble involving a widely-

held asset bursts, the consequent plunge in asset prices can seriously impair the balance 

sheets of households and firms.  Indeed, a dramatic decline in the price of a significant 

asset can reduce household wealth, spending, and aggregate demand.  When such effects 

on wealth, credit availability, and aggregate demand are large enough, the real economy 

can suffer a significant recession. And, of course, lower employment and incomes further 

depress asset prices and borrowers’ ability to repay loans, with further adverse effects on 

financial institutions and their ability to extend credit.
