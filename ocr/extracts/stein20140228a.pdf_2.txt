I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the paper “Market Tantrums and 

Monetary Policy.”  It is timely, provocative, and extremely insightful.  Let me start by 

summarizing what I take to be the paper’s main messages.

  First, the authors argue that 

policymakers should pay careful attention not just to measures of leverage in the banking 

and shadow banking sectors, but also to the financial stability risks that might arise from 

the behavior of unlevered asset managers, such as those running various types of bond 

funds.  Notably, assets under management in fixed-income funds have grown 

dramatically in the years since the onset of the financial crisis, even while various 

measures of financial-sector leverage have either continued to decline or remained 

subdued. 

Second, the authors develop a model of agency problems in delegated asset 

management, according to which an environment of low short-term rates can encourage 

asset managers concerned with their relative performance rankings to “reach for yield,” 

which in turn acts to compress risk premiums.  Moreover, the model has the feature that 

this reach for yield can end badly, with a sudden and sharp correction in risk premiums 

that arises endogenously in response to a small tightening of monetary policy.  The 

events of the spring and summer of 2013, when there was a rapid rise in bond market 

term premiums, are cited as a leading example of what the model sets out to capture. 

Third, the authors assert that the conventional regulatory toolkit, which is largely 

designed to contain intermediary leverage, is not well suited to dealing with the asset-

management sector.  Given this limitation of regulation, and because monetary policy has 

a direct influence on the behavior of asset managers, the financial stability risks that these
