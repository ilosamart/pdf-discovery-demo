Shorter duration and, if you will, increased “runnability” of its liabilities create greater threats to 

both its stability and that of the financial system as a whole.  Where a firm is significantly 

dependent on this kind of funding, it may need more common equity to convince counterparties 

and investors of its solvency during periods in which assets are very volatile and to maintain its 

solvency should it need to sell assets at fire sale prices.  This microprudential basis for higher 

capital requirements is complemented by the macroprudential rationale that intermediaries whose 

deleveraging could have a broad impact on market liquidity through fire sale or related effects 

should be required to hold still more capital. 

Let me make three additional points on this rationale for higher capital standards.  First, a 

run that cuts off funding to widely held assets is a greater risk to the system than a conventional 

bank run in the absence of deposit insurance.  A bank’s whole loans would not usually be sold in 

great number even under stressed circumstances and, even to the degree they were, other banks’ 

portfolios of loans are generally not marked down because of the stressed bank’s sales.  Second, 

the possible availability of central bank liquidity support does not obviate the need for higher 

capital for intermediaries reliant on short-term wholesale funding.  The same factors that make 

market actors uncertain about the value of the intermediary’s assets in times of stress will be 

relevant to the central bank’s ability to assure itself that the recipient of temporary liquidity is in 

fact solvent.  Third, because these risks to the firm and the financial system arise from of the 

composition of the liability side of the balance sheet, the concerns expressed here apply--though 

perhaps in somewhat different degrees--regardless of the particular form of intermediation in 

which the firm is engaged.
