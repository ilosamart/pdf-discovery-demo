longer horizon.  This poses the risk that term premiums could rise sharply--for instance, if 

investor perceptions of inflation risks increased.  I will return to this risk later.

Although asset valuations are elevated, vulnerabilities due to debt owed outside 

the financial sector appear to be moderate--in the middle of their historical range.  This 

reflects elevated leverage in the nonfinancial business sector and a moderate pace of 

borrowing in the household sector. In the nonfinancial business sector, the debt-to-

earnings ratio has increased to near the upper end of its historical distribution, and net 

leverage at speculative-grade firms remains especially elevated. Overall, however, the 

ratio of nonfinancial-sector borrowing to gross domestic product has been below an 

estimate of its trend for several years as a result of the deleveraging of the household 

sector following the crisis.  While the sustained period of post-crisis household 

deleveraging appears to have come to an end and savings rates have recently moved 

down, overall borrowing has been at a moderate pace and, on net, concentrated among 

borrowers with high credit scores. Even though the balance sheet of the household sector 

as a whole appears relatively strong, recent years have seen a rapid rise in student debt as 

well as rising default rates for borrowers with subprime credit scores on auto loans and, 

more recently, credit card balances.

Beyond the nonfinancial sector, the vulnerabilities associated with maturity and 

liquidity transformation in the financial system appear to have fallen significantly relative

to the levels seen prior to the crisis. The amount of wholesale short-term funding, which 

proved to be a substantial source of run risk during the crisis, has dropped substantially 

since its peak in 2008. Money market funds, which had been an area of vulnerability in 

the crisis, have undergone important reforms, including a move to floating net asset
