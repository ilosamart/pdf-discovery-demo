Home and foreign absorption depend on long–term interest rates according to the

Here rc is the component of long–term interest rates that is driven by 

conventional monetary policy, ru is the component of long–term interest rates that is 

driven by unconventional monetary policy, and u is an exogenous aggregate demand 

shock (with autocorrelation given by ρ).  These interest rate components are assumed to 

have identical effects on aggregate demand, with the parameter σ determining the 

sensitivity of aggregate demand to either component (n..b., interest rates are expressed in 

percentage points deviation from the steady state). 

Net exports are assumed to fall if the real exchange rate (e) rises/appreciates, and 

also if domestic demand is higher relative to foreign demand (since this boost imports).  

Thus: 

( )∗−−−= ddenx αη  

where η is the elasticity of net exports with respect to the exchange rate, and α is the 

elasticity of net exports to the differential between home and foreign absorption.  The real 

exchange rate is expressed in percent deviation from the steady state. 

The exchange rate is determined according to an interest rate parity condition 

which implies that the exchange rate appreciates when domestic interest rates are higher
