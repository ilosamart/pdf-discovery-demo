of a government-sponsored digital currency might even derail private-sector plans to enhance the 

payment services provided to their customers, thereby significantly disrupting the financial 

networks that exist today in ways that could create instability.  For example, if payment activity 

radically shifted from using deposits at financial institutions to using central-bank-issued digital 

currency, deposits could significantly shrink and potentially disrupt financial institutionsâ€™ ability 

to make loans that spur economic activity.    

That said, research into digital currency issues, including highly liquid and secure 

limited-purpose digital currencies for use as a settlement asset for wholesale payment systems, 

should continue.  As technologies are developed and refined, old issues are resolved and new 

issues arise.  Other countries may have different environments and experiences.  We should 

always be open to learning and understanding from the experiences of others.   

Prudent Innovation 

 For the United States, the alternative to privately issued digital currency is not 

necessarily a publicly issued digital currency.  Instead, the near-term alternative is to build on the 

trusted foundations of the existing payment system and work to improve private-sector payment 

services.  Importantly, this means looking to the banking system, which holds the bulk of the 

transaction deposits in this country, to improve services.  This began a number of years ago with 

internet banking.  Today, many banks offer around-the-clock internet-based access to accounts as 

well as mobile banking and payment capabilities.  Many banks typically allow real-time or near 

real-time transfers of funds among their own customer base.  What does not yet exist in the 

United States is the sort of ubiquitous, real-time payment system that would allow banks and 

their customers to make transfers and settlements of funds across the banking system instantly, 

conveniently, and securely all the time.
