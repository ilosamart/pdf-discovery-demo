more rapid than expected, it may be appropriate to remove monetary policy 

accommodation more quickly.  However, if progress toward our goals is slower than 

anticipated, then the Committee may move more slowly in normalizing policy.   

Long-Run Economic Growth  

Before I conclude, let me very briefly place my discussion of the economic 

outlook into a longer-term context.  The Federal Reserve contributes to the nation’s 

economic performance in part by using monetary policy to help achieve our mandated 

goals of maximum employment and price stability.  But success in promoting these 

objectives does not, by itself, ensure a strong pace of long-run economic growth or 

substantial improvements in future living standards.  The most important factor 

determining continued advances in living standards is productivity growth, defined as the 

rate of increase in how much a worker can produce in an hour of work.  Over time, 

sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising household incomes. 

Here the recent data have been disappointing.  The growth rate of output per hour 

worked in the business sector has averaged about 1-1/4 percent per year since the 

recession began in late 2007 and has been essentially flat over the past year.  In contrast, 

annual productivity gains averaged 2-3/4 percent over the decade preceding the Great 

Recession.  I mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while 

I do think that this is evidence of some persisting labor market slack, it also may reflect, 

at least in part, fairly weak productivity growth. 

There are many unanswered questions about what has slowed productivity growth 

in recent years and about the prospects for productivity growth in the longer run.  But we 

do know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors, including our workforce’s
