cash holdings have been increasing their debt loads the most.  Historically, high leverage 

has been linked to elevated financial distress and retrenchment by businesses in economic 

downturns. 

Regarding corporate bonds outstanding, recent years have witnessed little change 

in the relative shares of investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds.  Credit quality has 

deteriorated within the investment-grade segment, where the share of bonds rated at the 

lowest investment-grade level has reached near-record levels.  As of mid-2018, around 35 

percent of corporate bonds outstanding were at the lowest end of the investment-grade 

segment, which amounts to about $2-1/4 trillion.  In comparison, the share of high-yield 

bonds outstanding that are rated “deep junk” has stayed flat at about one-third from 2015 

to 2018, well below the financial crisis peak of 45 percent.   

In an economic downturn, widespread downgrades of these low-rated investment-

grade bonds to speculative-grade ratings could induce some investors to sell them 

rapidly--for instance, because lower-rated bonds have higher regulatory capital 

requirements or because bond funds have limits on the share of non-investment-grade 

bonds they hold.  This concern may be higher now than in the past, since total assets 

under management in bond mutual funds have more than doubled in the past decade to 

about $2.3 trillion this year.  These funds now hold about one-tenth of the corporate bond 

market, and the redemption behavior of investors in these funds during a market 

correction is unclear.  Bond sales could lead to large changes in bond prices and overall 

financial conditions if technological, market, or regulatory factors contribute to strains on 

market liquidity--a possibility that has been relatively untested over the course of the 

expansion.
