adjustments all yield an effective return of 3 percent.  As a result, the hurdle rate for new 

investment should remain pinned at 3 percent.  In other words, the negative term 

premium matters a lot for financing behavior, but in this stylized world, investment 

spending is decoupled from the term premium and is determined instead by the expected 

future path of short rates.  

This reasoning suggests why one might expect future rounds of Treasury-based 

LSAPs to have diminishing returns, at least for corporate investment.  As noted earlier, 

the data make clear that past rounds of LSAPs have pushed down interest rates and term 

premiums.  But the further the term premium is driven into negative territory, and the 

more financing constraints are thereby relaxed, the more the previous logic comes into 

play, and hence the weaker is likely to be the response of aggregate spending to further 

downward pressure on long-term rates.  

The corporate finance example is also consistent with what we have observed in 

markets in recent months.  Issuance of both investment-grade and high-yield bonds has 

been robust.  Indeed, domestic nonfinancial corporate bond issuance is on pace to set a 

record in 2012, and the speculative-grade segment appears on track to register a new high 

for the year.  At the same time, a large fraction of issuance has been devoted to 

refinancing--either to retiring existing debt or to payouts to equity holders via dividends 

and share buybacks.  These uses of proceeds have accounted for about two-thirds of all 

issuance by speculative-grade firms so far this year.  Such patterns are what one would 

expect based on the logic I have just discussed.   

Another way to make a similar point is to note that as borrowing costs have fallen,
