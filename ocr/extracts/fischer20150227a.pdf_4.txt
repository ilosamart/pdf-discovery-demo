program is estimated to have been as large as 100 basis points.  The documented effects 

associated with subsequent programs are generally smaller.  These results raise the 

question of whether the marginal effect of asset purchases has declined over time.  While 

that question is a valid one, our conclusion is that asset purchases over more recent years 

have provided meaningful stimulus to the economy, and continue to do so.  

Figure 2 provides a current estimate, based on Fed staff calculations, of the effect 

on the term premium on 10-year Treasury securities from the combination of all asset 

programs.2  The results suggest that the Fed’s balance sheet programs are currently 

depressing 10-year Treasury yields by about 110 basis points.  And, with the Fed 

continuing to hold these securities, they should apply downward pressure on rates for 

some time.   

The declines in long-term yields have led to an associated drop in long-term 

borrowing costs for households and firms and higher equity valuations.  Thus, the asset 

purchases have helped make financial conditions overall more accommodative and have 

provided significant stimulus for the broader economy.  As shown in figure 3, a recent 

study estimates that the QE programs along with increasingly explicit forward guidance 

have reduced the unemployment rate by 1-1/4 percentage points and increased the 

inflation rate by 1/2 percentage point relative to what would have occurred in the absence 

2 The estimates shown in figure 2 are based on an extension of the work done in Ihrig, Klee, Li, Schulte, 
and Wei (2012).  Because the term premium effect depends on both the Fed’s current and expected future 
asset holdings, most of this effect--without further unexpected policy actions--will likely wane over the 
next few years as the balance sheet begins to normalize.  See Jane Ihrig, Elizabeth Klee, Canlin Li, Brett 
Schulte, and Min Wei (2012), “Expectations about the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet and the Term 
Structure of Interest Rates,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2012-57 (Washington:  Board of
