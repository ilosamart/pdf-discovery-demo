to economic conditions.  But, even here, fewer loan officers reported reducing credit 

card limits and raising credit card interest rates relative to their cost of funds.      

 I consider the recent signs of new life in the consumer credit markets to be cause 

for optimism because they suggest that when households do regain confidence in the 

recovery and are ready to begin spending on consumer goods again, the credit markets 

will not be as much of a constraint as they were during the recession.  Indeed, an 

upside risk to my forecast is that consumers who postponed spending during the past 

few years could decide to unexpectedly take the plunge and make those purchases.  

For example, auto purchases seem to be especially good candidates for surprise as the 

average age of cars on the road indicates pent-up demand and credit is readily 

accessible.  Moreover, as households gain confidence that job and income prospects 

are improving, that should provide a further boost to spending and loan demand. 

   Businesses are in an even better position than households to increase spending 

as confidence returns.  Corporate cash positions are at record highs, and corporate debt 

is at similarly low levels (chart 21).  Although business spending has thus far powered 

much of the recovery, businesses have still only been spending at a pace sufficient to 

replace outworn capital and to support increases in capacity that are pretty modest for 

a business cycle recovery.  As businesses become more certain of the durability of the 

recovery, I expect that they will become more willing to further expand productive 

capacity, particularly with new business equipment and software. 

Of course, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant 

downside risks to the economic outlook.  Monetary accommodation works, in part, by 

lowering interest rates, increasing equity prices, and bolstering the availability of
