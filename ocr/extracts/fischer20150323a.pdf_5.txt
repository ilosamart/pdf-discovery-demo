The Fedâ€™s asset purchases did not have the conventional aim of increasing reserve 

balances to pull down short-term rates.8  Rather, purchases of longer-term securities 

lowered longer-term yields through portfolio balance effects. 

The evolution of our asset purchases reflected a learning process for 

policymakers.  In the early programs, the FOMC specified the expected quantities of 

assets to be acquired over a defined period.  In contrast, with QE3 (the most recent round 

of quantitative easing, implemented from September 2012 to October 2014), the FOMC 

announced that we would continue to purchase securities at a certain monthly pace until 

the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of price stability.  

Later, the FOMC noted that the pace of purchases was also data dependent, allowing the 

pace to be revised based on its assessment of progress toward its long-run objectives. 

With the federal funds rate near zero and the Fed creating and adjusting new asset 

purchase programs, it became difficult for the public to anticipate how the FOMC would 

likely conduct monetary policy and respond to changing economic conditions.  Thus, the 

FOMC began to rely heavily on enhanced forward guidance to communicate its 

intentions.  Forward guidance works in part because it also constrains the flexibility of 

decisionmakers when the time comes to make their future decisions.9  

8 Indeed, the maturity extension program--also known as Operation Twist--did not increase reserves at all. 
9 There is a long literature in monetary economics about time inconsistency.  Time inconsistency is the 
notion that, to achieve good outcomes, a central bank may need to make commitments about how it will act 
in the future--commitments that must be credible but that, ex post, the central bank might find hard to 
follow through on.  For canonical papers, see Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Lucas and Stokey (1983); 
see also Fischer (1980).  The early literature focused on the inability of central banks, in normal times, to 
commit to high future interest rates and low inflation.  Interestingly, at the zero lower bound, central banks 
may face nearly the opposite commitment problem:  To escape a liquidity trap, a central bank may want to 
commit to keep interest rates low and accommodate an output boom even after the headwinds from a crisis 
have dissipated.  See, for example, Eggertsson (2006) and Werning (2012).  For additional discussion of 
Federal Reserve communications, see Yellen (2012) and Stein (2014).
