Good morning. I am sorry that I cannot be with you in person for this third roundtable 

hosted by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), but I wanted to tape these 

remarks to make clear the Federal Reserve’s full commitment to mitigating the risk to financial 

stability should a key reference rate cease to be available.  We support the ARRC and its work.  

And support for the ARRC is not limited to the Federal Reserve System: the Bureau of 

Consumer Financial Protection, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of the Comptroller of the 

Currency, Office of Financial Research, Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S. 

Treasury Department are all ex officio members of the ARRC.   

Since many have only recently begun to pay more attention to these issues, let me remind 

you of our reasons for convening the ARRC four years ago.  The Federal Reserve began its role 

in co-chairing the Financial Stability Board’s working group on interest rate benchmarks and 

joined in international efforts to strengthen LIBOR following reports that employees at several 

banks sought to manipulate these rates.  We have served on the ICE Benchmark 

Administration’s (IBA’s) LIBOR Oversight Committee as an observer and actively worked with 

IBA in developing the reforms set out in IBA’s Roadmap for LIBOR.  Thanks in part to this, and 

thanks much more to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA’s) efforts as the regulator of 

LIBOR, the safeguards against that type of manipulation happening again have been greatly and 

appropriately tightened.  

But as part of this process, we also examined data that we had begun to collect on the 

markets that underlie LIBOR and found that those markets had become extraordinarily thin.  On 

most days, the banks that submit to LIBOR have been forced to rely on their own judgement and
