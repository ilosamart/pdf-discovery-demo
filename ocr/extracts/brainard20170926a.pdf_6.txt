recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and 

these differences shrink during recoveries.  For example, in the second quarter of 2017, 

the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points 

higher than for white adult men.  This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to 

the smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.  

Differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women 

relative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites.  Since racial disparities 

tend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that 

racial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall 

unemployment rate falls further.9   

More broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in familiesâ€™ income and wealth.  

According to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the 

average income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with 

$54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.10  Disparities in wealth, 

shown in figure 4, are even larger:  Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016 

were about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $138,000 for 

black families.11  Moreover, these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and 

                                                 
9 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity 
are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Historical gaps are provided by Cajner and others 
(2017). 
10 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data.  Recent estimates of household income from Current 
Population Survey data and reported by the Census in Semega, Fontenot, and Kollar (2017) are 
qualitatively similar, in that between 2013 and 2016 for both sets of data, family income has increased for 
whites, blacks, and Hispanics (with greater increases, in percentage terms, for black and Hispanic families). 
11 Racial and ethnic differences in median income and wealth are somewhat smaller.  For example, in 2016 
median income for white families was about $61,000, compared with $35,000 for black families and 
$39,000 for Hispanic families.  Median wealth was about $171,000 for white families, compared with
