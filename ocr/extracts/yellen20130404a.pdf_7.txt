depend on expectations of income, employment, and other economic conditions over the 

longer term, as well as longer-term interest rates.  The crucial insight of that research was 

that what happens to the federal funds rate today or over the six weeks until the next 

FOMC meeting is relatively unimportant.  What is important is the public’s expectation 

of how the FOMC will use the federal funds rate to influence economic conditions over 

the next few years.5  

For this reason, the Federal Reserve’s ability to influence economic conditions 

today depends critically on its ability to shape expectations of the future, specifically by 

helping the public understand how it intends to conduct policy over time, and what the 

likely implications of those actions will be for economic conditions.  To return to the 

example I used earlier, contrast this effect on expectations with that of a road project.  

Today’s commute, alas, will not be improved or changed at all by the news that a road 

will be widened one day.  But the effects of today’s monetary policy actions are largely 

due to the effect they have on expectations about how policy will be set over the medium 

term. 

Let me further illustrate this with some history.  Starting in the mid-1960s, the 

Federal Reserve didn’t act forcefully in the face of rising inflation, and the public grew 

less certain of the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation.  This uncertainty led 

expectations of future inflation to become “unanchored” and more likely to react to 

economic developments.  In 1973, an oil price shock led to a large increase in overall 

inflation.  Expectations of higher inflation in the future affected the public’s behavior--

workers demanded raises, and businesses set prices and otherwise acted in anticipation of 

                                                 
5 Another factor that adds to the importance of expectations is that changes in monetary policy affect real 
activity and inflation with a substantial time lag.
