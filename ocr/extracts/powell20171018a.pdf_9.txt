The Faster Payments Task Force’s mission was to identify and assess alternative 

approaches for implementing a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments system in the United 

States.  The task force began its work by developing a set of effectiveness criteria laying 

out desirable attributes for faster payment solutions covering the broad categories of 

ubiquity, efficiency, safety and security, speed, legal framework, and governance.  While 

the task force was focused on improving speed and convenience, it also underscored the 

importance of safety and security by establishing 11 criteria of a total of 36 focused on 

those objectives.   

The task force encouraged its members to submit proposals for faster payment 

solutions that would meet the criteria that its members had agreed upon.  A diverse range 

of task force members rose to the challenge by submitting 16 proposals to be vetted 

against its criteria.7  These proposals represent a broad universe of creative and 

innovative ways to deliver faster payments by embracing technology.  They range in 

structure from solutions that use a centralized clearing and settlement mechanism to 

others that focus on distributed networks.  Some are based on traditional assets held in 

transaction accounts, and others depend on new asset forms like digital currencies.  The 

role of the task force process was not to recommend or implement a faster payment 

solution, but rather to offer a range of ideas to move the United States further along the 

path to a better payment system.  We believe that the task force has successfully carried 

out this role.  

                                                 
7 The task force recommended establishing an external Qualified Independent Assessment Team to conduct 

objective proposal assessments. On behalf of the task force, the Federal Reserve selected McKinsey & 

Company to conduct a comprehensive assessment of each faster payment solution proposal against the task 

force’s set of criteria.
