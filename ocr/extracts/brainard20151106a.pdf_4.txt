and purchases of consumer durables, lowers the exchange rate, and increases the prices of 

risky assets, such as equities.   

In addition, many have also emphasized an indirect effect through a “signaling 

channel.”  By helping to shape expectations about the expected future path of the federal 

funds rate, asset purchases help reinforce forward guidance.  Thus, asset purchases can 

affect longer-run interest rates by lowering the expected path of short-term rates as well 

as by reducing the term premium of long-duration securities.3 

Spillovers from Unconventional Monetary Policy 

Turning to the cross-border effects, just as unconventional policy appears similar 

to conventional policy in its domestic effects, the analysis so far suggests that spillovers 

from unconventional monetary policy work through the same three channels as 

conventional monetary policy does.4  First, when monetary policy in one country 

responds to a negative economic shock by easing, this action helps support domestic 

demand, which in turn will likely lead to greater demand for the exports of foreign 

countries.  Second, monetary policy easing can also lead to a depreciation of the 

                                                 
3 A number of observers have suggested that the market and macroeconomic effects of the initial asset 
purchase programs announced at the most intense period of the financial crisis may have been larger than 
the programs announced later in the recovery.  The initial programs were important in bolstering 
confidence broadly and supporting liquidity in financial markets.  The later asset purchase programs, 
particularly the flow-based program whose duration was tied to a substantial improvement in the outlook 
for the labor market, were important in signaling that the Federal Reserve was committed to taking all 
actions necessary to achieve its mandated objectives.
