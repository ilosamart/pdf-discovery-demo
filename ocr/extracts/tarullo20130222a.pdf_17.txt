earlier this year, the Basel Committee is turning its attention back to the Net Stable Funding 

Ratio (NSFR), a proposal that was intended to complement the LCR by regulating liquidity 

levels beyond the 30-day LCR horizon.  Like the LCR, the NSFR proposal raised many 

questions even among those favoring robust measures to deal with the liability side of firm 

balance sheets.  There is some appeal to moving forward with this complementary measure fairly 

quickly by simply making some incremental changes to the NSFR while keeping its current 

structure.  But I think we may be better advised to take the opportunity of this review to examine 

whether there are approaches that might address more directly the vulnerabilities for the financial 

system created by large non-deposit, short-term funding dependence at major financial 

institutions.  I do not mean to prejudge the outcome of such an examination, or the degree to 

which we might build on measures being considered in various jurisdictions to address these 

vulnerabilities.  But I do think it worth the effort. 

Conclusion 

 Responses to what I have described as the three challenges to pre-crisis central bank 

policies will continue to evolve.  So will the reenergized international agenda for cooperation in 

international financial regulation.  My aim tonight has not been to lay out a comprehensive 

program for either, but to suggest that these changing agendas are neither completely correlated 

nor completely independent.  In suggesting some concrete next steps, I have tried to define some 

useful and important points of intersection between the two.
