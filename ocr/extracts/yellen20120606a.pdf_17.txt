being provided over time by the Federal Reserve’s other policy tool, the past and projected 

changes to the size and maturity of its securities holdings.21    

Figure 11 shows that, by keeping the federal funds rate at its current level for longer, 

monetary policy under the balanced-approach rule achieves a more rapid reduction of the 

unemployment rate than monetary policy under the Taylor (1993) rule does, while nonetheless 

keeping inflation near 2 percent.  But the improvement in labor market conditions is even more 

notable under the optimal control path, even as inflation remains close to the FOMC’s long-run 

inflation objective.  

As I noted, simple rules have the advantage of delivering good policy outcomes across a 

broad range of models, and are thereby relatively robust to our limited understanding of the 

precise working of the economy--in contrast to optimal-control policies, whose prescriptions are 

sensitive to the specification of the particular model used in the analysis.  However, simple rules 

also have their shortcomings, leading them to significantly understate the case for keeping policy 

persistently accommodative in current circumstances.   

One of these shortcomings is that the rules do not adjust for the constraints that the zero 

lower bound has placed on conventional monetary policy since late 2008.  A second is that they 

do not fully take account of the protracted nature of the forces that have been restraining 

aggregate demand in the aftermath of the housing bust.  As I’ve emphasized, the pace of the 

current recovery has turned out to be persistently slower than most observers expected, and 

forecasters expect it to remain quite moderate by historical standards.  The headwinds that 

explain this disappointing performance represent a substantial departure from normal cyclical 

                                                            
21 Optimal control takes account of the stimulus provided by the balance sheet operations because it conditions on a 
baseline forecast of real activity and inflation that (at least implicitly) incorporates the effects of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet operations on projected financial conditions, real activity, and inflation.
