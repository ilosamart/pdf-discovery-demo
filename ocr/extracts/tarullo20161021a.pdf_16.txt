even for commercial banks, much less for broker-dealers like Lehman Brothers or insurance 

holding companies like AIG.  And, of course, in the pre-crisis period there was no quantitative 

liquidity regulation to include in a casebook. 

Yet the financial crisis was, at least in its more virulent periods, as much a funding crisis 

as it was a solvency crisis.  Indeed, the very fact that it may be difficult to distinguish clearly 

between the two is indicative of the primacy of funding to the crisis.  Particularly in the context 

of systemic risk, funding and liquidity issues accordingly deserve something close to the 

attention devoted to capital if students are to understand the origins of the crisis, the regulatory 

response, and the challenges of regulation going forward.  A focus on liabilities will help 

students understand why, for example, the Federal Reserve plans on setting capital standards 

differently for traditional insurance companies (that is, not the pre-crisis AIG) than for bank 

holding companies and their affiliates.  An emphasis on runnable funding will help them see why 

systemic concerns extend beyond SIFIs as such.  It also provides a good occasion for introducing 

students to the role of a lender of last resort, now perhaps more of a contested concept than had 

previously been assumed. 

I have considerably less conviction regarding my second comment, but I offer it anyway, 

perhaps to contribute to the pedagogical discussions that will be bred by this conference.  Let me 

preface the observation by noting that were I to teach financial regulation again, the course 

would have to differ markedly from that fall 2008 version.  Still, I wonder whether students will 

acquire a strong enough foundation for understanding how a financial regulatory system works 

in a course that is taught essentially as a survey of financial regulatory issues, without some point 

of reference to which they can return as they proceed through the course (or, more probably, as 

they cram for the exam).  I was always struck by how much of a conceptual anchor for a banking
