Act data, the median time that elapsed between mortgage application and closing 

increased from about 4 weeks in 2008 to around 6 weeks in 2010.  Moreover, empirical 

evidence suggests that lenders might be nearly as capacity-constrained now as during the 

2003 refinance boom, even though current mortgage volume is only about one-third of 

the volume in 2003.  But capacity constraints alone are an unsatisfying answer to the 

question of why access to credit is so tight.  It seems reasonable to suppose that if lenders 

were eager to originate mortgages, they would have an incentive to invest in staff and 

systems to alleviate these constraints.  I believe uncertainty about the future on the part of 

lenders is inhibiting these investments. 

The Problem of Uncertainty 

Just as uncertainty about job prospects or house prices has likely discouraged 

some potential buyers from purchasing homes, it is likely that uncertainty has also 

affected mortgage lenders.  Indeed, uncertainty surrounds several key aspects of 

mortgage lending:  the strength of the economic recovery and the trajectory of future 

house prices; the costs and liabilities associated with originating and servicing mortgage 

loans; the regulatory environment; and the future structure of the mortgage market, 

including that of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and of private-label securitization.  I think 

the effects of these uncertainties have an important bearing on the future strength of the 

housing market and would like to discuss each in a bit more detail. 

Turning first to macroeconomic uncertainty, borrowers are more likely to default 

when they lose their jobs or when their houses decline in value.  So long as 

unemployment remains elevated and further house price declines remain possible, lenders 

will be cautious in setting their requirements for credit, and rightfully so.  But these
