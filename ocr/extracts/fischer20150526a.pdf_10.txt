The tightening of U.S. policy will begin only when the U.S. expansion has 

advanced far enough--when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and 

when we are reasonably confident that the inflation rate will rise to our 2 percent goal.18   

The stronger U.S. economy should directly benefit our foreign trading partners by raising 

the demand for their exports, and perhaps also indirectly, by boosting confidence 

globally.  And if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. 

economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise.   

The EMEs themselves have generally done a good job of reducing their financial 

and economic vulnerabilities over the past couple of decades, which should bolster their 

resilience should normalization lead to financial market stresses.  Since the 1990s, many 

EMEs have made remarkable progress in reducing inflation, improving government debt 

ratios, building foreign reserves, and better regulating and capitalizing their banking 

systems.  In addition, the development of local-currency debt markets has made EMEs 

less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.  To be sure, some EMEs continue to face a 

wide array of structural and policy challenges, including, prominently, rapid credit 

growth.  But it does not seem that the overall risks to global financial stability are 

unusually elevated at this time.   

Nevertheless, it could be that some more vulnerable economies, including those 

that pursue overly rigid exchange rate policies, may find the road to normalization 

somewhat bumpier.  This gives all the more reason for the Fed and other major central 

banks to communicate policy intentions clearly and for EMEs to continue to strengthen
