Surveys of households and firms also suggest that we are near full employment 

(figure 5).  For example, respondents are now more likely to say that jobs are plentiful 

than that they are hard to get--a response that has generally been seen when the economy 

is near full employment.  Job vacancies are running at high levels, and firms report that it 

is getting harder to find employees to fill open positions.  Moreover, wages are now 

rising faster than inflation, and faster than output per hour.  Taken together, labor market 

indicators show an economy that is on solid footing and close to our mandate of 

maximum employment. 

 It is interesting to compare this expansion to past U.S. expansions, and also to 

recoveries of other countries since the end of the Global Financial Crisis.  The picture is a 

mixed one.  The current recovery has been under way since June 2009--nearly seven and 

a half years.  It will soon be the third longest of the 20 recoveries since the founding of 

the Federal Reserve in 1913.  GDP, or output, is now 11 percent higher than its pre-crisis 

peak.  Employment is now 6.5 million higher than its pre-crisis peak.     

But this expansion has also had the slowest pace of GDP growth of any postwar 

recovery (figure 6).  Given steady but modest growth, we have seen surprisingly large 

gains in employment and, until this year, a rapid reduction in the unemployment rate.  

Even though GDP growth has been slow, job gains during this recovery have been 

stronger than those during the previous expansion--the so-called jobless recovery of the 

early 2000s.  The combination of weak growth and strong hiring in this expansion 

implies small increases in output per hour, or productivity.  In fact, productivity has been 

increasing at a dismal pace, compared with virtually any period in the postwar era.  I will 

return to productivity and growth in a moment.
