from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the 

Survey of Primary Dealers have continued to be generally stable.  The measure of longer-

term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in 

contrast, has lately edged below its typical range in recent years.  However, this measure 

often seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation, 

and the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help explain some 

of the recent decline in the Michigan measure.6  Market-based measures of inflation 

compensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low 

levels earlier in the fall.  While the low level of these measures appears to reflect, at least 

in part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to monitor this 

development closely.  Convincing evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have 

moved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations 

about inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of 

our 2 percent inflation goal more difficult.   

Monetary Policy 

Let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.  

Reflecting progress toward the Committeeâ€™s objectives, many FOMC participants 

indicated in September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the 

time, that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by the 

end of this year.  Some participants projected that it would be appropriate to wait until 

later to raise the target funds rate range, but all agreed that the timing of a rate increase 

                                                   
6 For example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations was 
temporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked 
and pushed up actual headline inflation for a time.
