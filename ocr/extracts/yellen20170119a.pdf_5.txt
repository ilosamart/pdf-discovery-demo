compared with only 1/2 percent during 2015.  Moreover, core PCE inflation--a better 

indicator of the underlying inflation trend--picked up 1/4 percentage point, to a little over 

1-1/2 percent.  This rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the 

effects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports.  In 

addition, slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on 

inflation, in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate 

was still quite elevated.  Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar, inflation is likely to move up to 2 percent over the next 

couple of years, aided by a strong labor market.   

In light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and 

inflation objectives and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the 

target range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting by 25 basis points, to 

between 50 and 75 basis points.  The Committee judges, however, that the stance of 

monetary policy remains modestly accommodative, and so policy should support some 

further strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our 2 

percent goal.  

Maintaining Sustainable Growth in a Context of Price Stability  

With the unemployment rate near its longer-run normal level and likely to move a 

bit lower this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the 

curve.  The short answer, I believe, is “no.”  It is true that many employers report 

difficulties in finding qualified workers in selected occupations, and that more workers 

are comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions.  But this is to be
