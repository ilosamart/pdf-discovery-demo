Key Additional Reform Measures 

 In sketching out the kinds of steps needed to address these remaining 

vulnerabilities, let me begin with wholesale funding generally, and then circle back to 

too-big-to-fail.    

Short-Term Wholesale Funding.  At a conceptual level, the policy goal is fairly 

easy to state: a regulatory charge or other measure that applies more or less 

comprehensively to all uses of short-term wholesale funding, without regard to the form 

of the transactions or whether the borrower was a prudentially regulated institution.  The 

aspiration to comprehensiveness is important for two reasons.  First, the risks associated 

with short-term funding are as much or more macroprudential as they are firm-specific.  

From a microprudential perspective, SFTs are low risk, because the borrowing is short-

dated, overcollateralized, marked-to-market daily, and subject to remargining 

requirements.  The dangers arise in the tail and apply to the entire financial market when 

the normally safe, short-term lending contracts dramatically in the face of sudden and 

significant uncertainty about asset values and the condition of counterparties.  A 

regulatory measure should force some internalization by market actors of the systemic 

costs of this intermediation.   

Second, to the degree that regulatory measures apply only to some types of 

wholesale funding, or only to that used by prudentially regulated entities, there will be a 

growing risk of regulatory arbitrage.  Ideally, the regulatory charge should apply whether 

the borrower is a commercial bank, broker-dealer, agency Real Estate Investment Trust 

(REIT), or hedge fund.
