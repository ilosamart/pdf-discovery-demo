 Closely associated with the work on resolution mechanisms is the living will 

exercise for SIFIs.  In addition, there are the proposed G-SIB capital surcharges and 

macro stress tests applied to the largest BHCs ($50 billion or more).  Countercyclical 

capital requirements are also likely to be applied primarily to large banks.  Similarly the 

Volcker rule, or the Vickers rules in the United Kingdom or the Liikanen rules in the euro 

zone, which seek to limit the scope of a bank’s activities, are directed at TBTF, and I 

believe appropriately so. 

What about simply breaking up the largest financial institutions?  Well, there is no 

“simply” in this area.  At the analytical level, there is the question of what the optimal 

structure of the financial sector should be.  Would a financial system that consisted of a 

large number of medium-sized and small firms be more stable and more efficient than 

one with a smaller number of very large firms?  That depends on whether there are 

economies of scale in the financial sector and up to what size of firm they apply--that is 

to say it depends in part on why there is a financing premium for large firms.  If it is 

economies of scale, the market premium for large firms may be sending the right signals 

with respect to size.  If it is the existence of TBTF, that is not an optimal market 

incentive, but rather a distortion.  What would happen if it was possible precisely to 

calculate the extent of the subsidy or distortion and require the bank to pay the social cost 

of the expansion of its activity?35  This could be done either by varying the deposit 

insurance rate for the bank or by varying the required capital ratios for SIFIs to fit each 

bank’s risk profile and structure.  This, along with measures to strengthen large banks,
