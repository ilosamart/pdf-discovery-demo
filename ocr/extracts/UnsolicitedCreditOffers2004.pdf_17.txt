Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 13 

for screening or any applicable criteria bearing on creditworthiness or insurability, or the 
consumer does not furnish required collateral; and (4) the consumer has the right to 
prohibit use of information in the consumer’s file in connection with future prescreened 
offers of credit or insurance by contacting the notification system established by the CRA 
that provided the report. The address and toll-free telephone number of the appropriate 
notification system also must be provided. 

In 2003, section 213 of the Fact Act amended the FCRA concerning disclosures about 
prescreened solicitations. Section 213(a)(2)(B) amends the FCRA to require that the 
notice provided by creditors or insurers with each written unsolicited prescreened offer 
“be presented in such format and in such type size and manner as to be simple and easy to 
understand, as established by the [FTC], by rule, in consultation with the federal banking 
agencies and the National Credit Union Administration.” These rules are to be in place 
by December 4, 2004. Beginning December 1, 2004, section 213(c) of the Fact Act 
extends from two years to five years the effective period of a consumer’s election not to 
receive prescreened solicitations through a telephone notification system described 
above. 

VOLUNTARY MECHANISMS 

The private sector has created voluntary mechanisms for consumers to avoid receiving 
prescreened solicitations in the mail with the goal of satisfying the needs both of 
consumers and of participating companies. Most notably, the Direct Marketing 
Association (DMA) maintains an opt-out list of consumers who have indicated they do 
not wish to receive advertising mail at home.12 The DMA’s Mail Preference Service 
(MPS) allows individuals to opt out of national mailing lists used by companies to 
identify individuals to whom they may send marketing materials. Consumers can 
participate in the system to avoid the receipt of unwanted prescreened solicitations, and 
companies participate to cut marketing expenses and to avoid upsetting consumers who 
have made it known that they do not want to receive prescreened solicitations in the mail. 

All companies that are members of the DMA are required to use the MPS. Members run 
their list of prospective customers against the MPS “do not mail” file to remove these 
individuals from any mailing. The MPS also is made available to nonmembers of the 
DMA, so that these marketers may also take advantage of the service. The DMA updates 
its do-not-mail list monthly, and it is distributed four times per year. The individual’s 
name is maintained on the list for a period of five years. To create a comprehensive opt-
out list, the CRAs add the individuals on the DMA’s do-not-mail list to those who have 
opted out directly with the CRAs. 

12 The DMA is the largest national trade association for the direct marketing industry. For more
