 At the Federal Reserve, we have formalized our process for considering the unique 

characteristics of community banks as we craft regulatory and supervisory policies.  A few years 

ago, we created a subcommittee of the Board, which I chair, that makes recommendations about 

matters related to community bank supervision and regulation.  This subcommittee reviews all 

regulatory proposals and supervisory guidance with an eye toward the possible effects on 

community banks.  Remembering the days when I had to find time to read all those new 

regulations stacked up on my desk, I have insisted that all new proposals and rules start with a 

clear statement of their applicability to community banks so that bankers can spend their time on 

the rules and guidance that apply to them.  

This approach was put into practice in a different way last year, when the banking 

agencies issued proposals for capital regulations that incorporated requirements of the Dodd-

Frank Act and the Basel agreement.

  To help community banks identify the provisions that 

affected them and submit their comments more easily, the proposal included a short summary of 

the provisions that were most likely to affect community banks.  We received more than 2,000 

comments, many from community banks, and we are reviewing them.  It’s too early in the 

process to know how we and the other agencies are going to address the issues raised, or when 

final rules may be released.  But what I can promise is that before we issue final capital rules, we 

will do everything possible to address the concerns that have been expressed by community 

bankers and still achieve the goal of having strong levels of high-quality capital--built up over a 

reasonable and realistic transitional period--in banks of all sizes, including community banks.
