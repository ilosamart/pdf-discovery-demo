In my comments today, I will only briefly review the case for taking action, as 

that ground has been well covered in a number of other places, most notably in Chairman 

Bernanke’s recent Jackson Hole speech.1  Instead, I will explore in more detail the factors 

that make decisions about LSAPs so challenging.  The Chairman discussed these 

challenges in his recent speech, saying:  “Estimates of the effects of nontraditional 

policies on economic activity and inflation are uncertain, and the use of nontraditional 

policies involves costs beyond those generally associated with more-standard policies.  

Consequently, the bar for the use of nontraditional policies is higher than for traditional 

policies.”2 

With this principle in mind, my aim is to lay out the thought process that I am 

bringing to bear in an effort to decide just how high the bar should be, and whether a 

proposed action clears that bar.  Along the way I also hope to highlight some gaps in 

economists’ collective understanding about LSAPs, and perhaps to provoke some further 

thought and research on these questions. 

However, let me begin by setting the context.  The point of departure for any 

analysis of monetary policy is our dual mandate--to foster maximum employment and 

price stability.  The first pass here is pretty clear.  Unemployment remains painfully high, 

and in my opinion, well above the long-run structural rate of unemployment.  Moreover, 

smoothing through the ups and downs of incoming data, it appears that the economy is 

growing at a pace such that, absent policy action, progress on reducing unemployment 

will likely be slow for some time.  Meanwhile, inflation is subdued, running at or below 

our long-run objective of 2 percent, while inflation expectations remain well anchored.  If
