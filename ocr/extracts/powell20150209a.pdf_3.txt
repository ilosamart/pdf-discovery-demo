Against that background, I am concerned about several troubling proposals that 

would subject monetary policy to undue political pressure and place new limits on the 

Fed’s ability to respond to future crises.  My remarks will address three such proposals.  

The first goes by the somewhat misleading name of “Audit the Fed,” and would subject 

the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy to unlimited congressional policy 

audits (not to be confused with financial audits, which are already conducted regularly.)2  

The second is a proposal to require the Fed to adopt and follow a specific equation in 

setting monetary policy and to face immediate congressional hearings and investigation 

by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) whenever it deviates from the policy 

dictated by that equation.3  And, third, there are discussions about imposing new 

limitations on the Fed’s long-held powers to provide liquidity during a financial crisis. 

I think these proposals are misguided for three reasons.   

First, they are motivated by the belief that the Fed’s response during the crisis was 

both ineffective and outside the bounds of its traditional role and responsibilities.  In fact, 

the Fed’s actions were effective, necessary, appropriate, and very much in keeping with 

the traditional role of the Fed and other central banks. 

Second, these proposals are based on the assertion that the Federal Reserve 

operates in secrecy and was not accountable for its actions during the crisis, a perspective 

that is in violent conflict with the facts.  The Fed has been transparent, accountable, and 

subject to extensive oversight, especially during and since the crisis.  We have also taken 

appropriate steps since the crisis to further enhance that transparency.
