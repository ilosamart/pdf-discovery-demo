mortgage loans to investors.  This model technically describes securities guaranteed by 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as private-label securities sponsored by financial 

institutions such as commercial or investment banks, but problems were more acute in the 

private-label market. 

Although the private-label originate-to-distribute model may have worked 

adequately at first, this discipline eroded as the securitization boom progressed.  

Originators and securitizers were generally able to complete securitization transactions 

while retaining very little or no economic stake in the performance of the loan after the 

sale, although some of these securities did ultimately make their way back onto the 

balance sheets of certain financial conglomerates, much to their dismay.  As a result, 

originators and securitizers had an increasing incentive to weaken underwriting standards 

in order to increase the volume of loan origination, and thereby the volume of 

securitizations. 

As securitization developed and became more prominent as a source of financing 

for mortgage lending, representations and warranties were one of the main tools market 

participants relied on to align incentives among originators and securitizers on the one 

hand and investors on the other.  These provisions describe the underwriting standards 

and other matters with respect to the assets that are the subject of the securitization.  The 

originator, in principle, is required to refund at par (less payments received) the value of 

the loan should it violate the originatorâ€™s representations and warranties or in some cases, 

should it default within a specified time from origination.  In practice, however, 

representations and warranties did not function as intended.
