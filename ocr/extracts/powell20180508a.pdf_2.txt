Thank you for inviting me to join you today as part of this distinguished panel.   

Our subject is the relationship between “center country” monetary policy and 

global financial conditions, and the policy implications of that relationship both for the 

center country and for other countries affected.  This broad topic has been the subject of a 

great deal of research and discussion in recent years.  Today I will focus in particular on 

the role of U.S. monetary policy in driving global financial conditions and capital flows.  

To preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role 

in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often 

exaggerated.  And while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary 

policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more 

resilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks.   

The well-known Mundell-Fleming “trilemma” states that it is not possible to have 

all three of the following things:  free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the 

ability to pursue an independent monetary policy.  The trilemma does not say that a 

flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from 

external shocks.1  And, indeed, that is not the case.  We have seen that integration of 

global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they 

have fixed or floating exchange rate regimes.   

Since the Fed is the central bank of the world’s largest economy and issuer of the 

world’s most widely used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the Fed’s policy 

actions will spill over to other economies.  To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the 

left side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following
