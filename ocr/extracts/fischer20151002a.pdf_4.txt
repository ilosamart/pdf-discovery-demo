vulnerable to runs.  For example, MMFs were pressured during the recent crisis, as their 

deposit-like liabilities--held as assets by highly risk-averse investors and not backstopped 

by a deposit insurance system--led to a run dynamic after a large fund broke the buck.  In 

addition (as highlighted in table 1), nearly half of the liabilities of broker-dealers 

consists--and consisted then--of short-term wholesale funding, which proved to be 

unstable in the crisis.   

The pros and cons of a multifaceted financial system 

The significant role of nonbanks in the U.S. financial system and the associated 

complex web of interconnections bring both advantages and challenges relative to the 

more bank-dependent systems of other advanced economies.4  A potential advantage of 

lower bank dependence is the possibility that a contraction in credit supply from banks 

can be offset by credit supply from other institutions or capital markets, thereby acting as 

a spare tire for credit supply.  As shown in table 2, historical evidence suggests that the 

credit provided by what I termed long-term investors--that is, insurance companies, 

pension funds, and mutual funds--has tended to offset movements in bank credit relative 

to GDP, as indicated by the strong negative correlation of credit held by these institutions 

with bank credit during recessions.  In other words, these institutions have acted as a 

spare tire for the banking sector.5
