I appreciate the opportunity to join the Forecasters Club to discuss the path ahead 

for our economy and monetary policy.1  In the months ahead, I expect to see tightening 

resource utilization in the U.S. economy as rising fiscal stimulus reinforces above-trend 

growth.  Continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be consistent 

with sustaining strong labor market conditions and inflation around target, with the 

balance sheet running off gradually and predictably in the background.  This outlook 

suggests a policy path that moves gradually from modestly accommodative today to 

neutral--and, after some time, modestly beyond neutral--against the backdrop of a longer-

run neutral rate that is likely to remain low by historical standards.  Let me consider each 

element in turn 

Growing above Trend 

Although indicators of economic activity were on the soft side earlier in the year, 

the outlook for the remainder of 2018 remains quite positive, supported by sizable fiscal 

stimulus as well as still-accommodative financial conditions.   

In the latest report, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.2 percent at an 

annual rate in the first quarter of 2018, a slowdown from the 3 percent pace in the final 

three quarters of 2017.  The first-quarter slowdown was especially noticeable in 

consumer spending, which increased at only a 1 percent pace last quarter, compared with 

2-3/4 percent in 2017.  By contrast, business fixed investment increased 9 percent at an 

annual rate last quarter, surpassing its robust 2017 pace.
