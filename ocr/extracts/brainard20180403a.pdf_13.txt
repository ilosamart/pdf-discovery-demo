Cyclical Considerations

As I have noted elsewhere, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus should boost the 

economy at a time when it is close to full employment and growing above trend.  It is 

hard to know with precision how the economy is likely to respond.  If unemployment 

continues to decline at the rate of the past year, it could reach levels not seen in several 

decades.  Historically, such episodes tended to see a risk of accelerating inflation in 

earlier decades or a risk of financial imbalances in more recent decades.  It is important to 

be attentive to the emergence of any imbalances, because we do not have much

experience with pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus at a time when resource constraints are

tightening and growth is above trend.

Despite elevated asset valuations, overall risks to the financial system remain

moderate in no small part because important financial reforms have encouraged large 

banking institutions to build strong capital and liquidity buffers.  History suggests,

however, that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards and an

attendant increase in risky debt levels.  At a time when valuations seem stretched and 

cyclical pressures are building, I would be reluctant to see our large banking institutions 

releasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the past 

few years, especially since credit growth and profitability in the U.S. banking system are 

robust.

Of course, if cyclical pressures continue to build and financial vulnerabilities 

broaden, it may become appropriate to ask the largest banking organizations to build a 

countercyclical buffer of capital to fortify their resilience and protect against stress.  

Alternatively, if there were to be a material adjustment to the calibration of the structural
