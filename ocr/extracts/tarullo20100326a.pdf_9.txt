An essential component of this new system will be a quantitative surveillance 

mechanism for large, complex financial organizations that will combine a more

Quantitative surveillance will use supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, 

and market-based indicators to identify developing strains and imbalances that may affect 

multiple institutions, as well as emerging risks to specific firms.  Periodic forward-

looking scenario analyses will enhance our understanding of the potential effects of 

adverse changes in the operating environment on individual firms and on the system as a 

whole.  

In fact, I believe that the most useful steps toward creating a practical, 

macroprudential supervisory perspective will be those that connect the firm-specific 

information and insight gained from traditional microprudential supervision to analysis of 

systemwide developments and emerging stresses.  Here, precisely, is where our SCAP 

experience has helped lead the way. 

The Question of Transparency    

One important element of the SCAP that has not yet been incorporated into our 

ongoing supervisory plans is the public disclosure of stress test information.  I think this 

issue deserves consideration.  As I recently testified, access to higher-quality and more-
