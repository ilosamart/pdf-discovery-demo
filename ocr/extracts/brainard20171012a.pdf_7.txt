necessity to rely on economic relationships derived from pre-crisis observations, when 

policy rates were comfortably above the lower bound. 

During a period when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound, Bernanke’s 

proposal would represent a substantial departure from the standard approach.  While a 

standard policy framework would tend to prescribe that tightening should start 

preemptively, well before inflation reaches target, Bernanke’s temporary price-level 

target proposal would imply maintaining the policy rate at the lower bound well past the 

point at which inflation has risen above target.  In principle, policymakers would have to 

be willing to accept elevated rates of above-target inflation for a period following a 

lengthy period of undershooting. 

Just as policymakers could run a risk of low inflation becoming entrenched in the 

standard preemptive framework, so, too, there are risks in the temporary price-level target 

framework.  One risk is that the public, seeing elevated rates of inflation, may start to 

doubt that the central bank is still serious about its inflation target.  It is worth noting that 

the policy is motivated by the opposite concern--that convergence from below, following 

an extended lower bound episode, may lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations to 

the downside.  Still, a conscious policy of overshooting may be difficult to calibrate, 

especially since the large confidence intervals around inflation forecasts suggest that the 

risks of an undesired overshooting are nontrivial.  A related risk is that the central bank 

would lose its nerve:  Maintaining the interest rate at zero in the face of a strong economy 

and inflation notably above its target would place a central bank in uncomfortable 

territory.
