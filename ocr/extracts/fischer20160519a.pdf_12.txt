Possibly Johnson was thinking of the central bank having to operate 

via open-market operations, through exchanges of assets, which would induce 

substitution effects, rather than through the printing of money, which in the 

first instance produced increases in real balances, which would produce 

wealth effects, but which are typically fiscal rather than monetary actions. 

6. Involuntary unemployment.  Chapters 13 and 14 of MIP deal with the 

consumption function when unemployment takes the household off its labor 

supply curve, and with other interactions between markets.  They are based on 

research by Leijonhufvud and Clower, and do an excellent job of clarifying 

the implications of disequilibrium in one market for behavior in other markets.  

This approach was developed further by Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman 

in their 1976 volume, Money, Employment, and Inflation, but began to go out 

of use and fashion in the 1980s.12 

7. Surprising omissions.  MIP definitely achieves its goal of integrating 

monetary and value theory, but shows signs of its age in two omissions: first, 

that expectations are not emphasized and indeed barely discussed; and second, 

there is no analysis in MIP of ongoing inflation--the latter omission being 

particularly striking given Israelâ€™s inflationary history.
