The Current Economic Outlook 

The FOMC’s current outlook for continued, moderate growth is little changed 

from last fall.  In recent months, some indicators have been notably weak, requiring us to 

judge whether the data are signaling a material change in the outlook.  The unusually 

harsh winter weather in much of the nation has complicated this judgment, but my 

FOMC colleagues and I generally believe that a significant part of the recent softness was 

weather related.  

The continued improvement in labor market conditions has been important in this 

judgment.  The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, has fallen three-tenths of 1 percentage 

point since late last year.  Broader measures of unemployment that include workers 

marginally attached to the labor force and those working part time for economic reasons 

have fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor force participation, 

which had been falling, has ticked up this year.   

Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, 

has slowed from an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent in early 2012 to less than 1 percent 

in February of this year.1  This rate is well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run 

objective.  Many advanced economies are observing a similar softness in inflation.  

To some extent, the low rate of inflation seems due to influences that are likely to 

be temporary, including a deceleration in consumer energy prices and outright declines in 

core import prices in recent quarters.  Longer-run inflation expectations have remained 

remarkably steady, however.  We anticipate that, as the effects of transitory factors 

subside and as labor market gains continue, inflation will gradually move back toward 

2 percent.
