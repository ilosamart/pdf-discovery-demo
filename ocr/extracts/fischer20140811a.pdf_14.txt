systemic risk.  Global bank regulators have also developed, for the first time, liquidity 

regulations designed to improve the funding durability and overall liquidity resiliency of 

internationally active banks. 

Additional steps have been taken in some countries.  For example, in the United 

States, capital ratios and liquidity buffers at the largest banks are up considerably, and 

their reliance on short-term wholesale funding has declined considerably.  Work on the 

use of the resolution mechanisms set out in the Dodd-Frank Act, based on the principle of 

a single point of entry--though less advanced than the work on capital and liquidity 

ratios--holds the promise of making it possible to resolve banks in difficulty at no direct 

cost to the taxpayer.  As part of this approach, the United States is preparing a proposal to 

require systemically important banks to issue bail-inable long-term debt that will enable 

insolvent banks to recapitalize themselves in resolution without calling on government 

funding--this cushion is known as a “gone concern” buffer. 

At the same time, the introduction of macroeconomic supervisory stress tests in 

the United States has added a forward-looking approach to assessing capital adequacy, as 

firms are required to hold a capital buffer sufficient to withstand a several-year period of 

severe economic and financial stress. The stress tests are a very important addition to the 

toolkit of supervisors, one that is likely to add significantly to the quality and 

effectiveness of financial sector supervision, and one that should spread internationally as 

a best practice.    

Still, more remains to be done.  Although the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision and the FSB reached impressively rapid agreement on needed changes in 

regulation and supervision, progress in agreeing on the resolution of G-SIFIs and some
