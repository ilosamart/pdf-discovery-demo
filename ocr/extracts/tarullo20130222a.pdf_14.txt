 Bearing in mind both these principles and the key areas for policy change at central banks 

and other financial regulators, let me now suggest some specific subjects for near-term emphasis.  

As to the framework for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), I would urge that 

two ongoing initiatives be completed over the next year and two ideas that have been in the 

discussion stage be developed into concrete proposals.   

First, the proposal for a capital surcharge for systemically important banking 

organizations is nearing completion.  The Basel Committee continues to refine the methodology 

to be used in identifying the firms and calibrating the surcharge amount--perhaps a byproduct of 

the fact that this methodology had to be developed in the Basel Committee without benefit of 

prior precedent.  But I have confidence that this work will be successfully completed.   

 The second ongoing initiative--work on designating non-bank SIFIs--has to date been 

pursued mostly in the IAIS and thus has concentrated on insurance companies.  It is important to 

take the time to evaluate carefully the actual systemic risk associated with these companies, and 

to understand the amount of such risk relative to other financial firms, before fixing on a list of 

firms and surcharges.  But this seems to me a realistic goal over the next six months. 

 Third, we should build on the very good analytic work in the Basel Committee, both on 

simplifying capital requirements for credit risk and on fashioning standardized capital 

requirements for market risk, to apply standardized credit and market risk capital measures to all 

internationally active banking firms.  As I mentioned earlier, the United States has already 

adopted such a requirement for capital requirements on credit risk.  These standardized measures 

serve as a floor to guard against the potential for models-based capital measures to understate 

capital needs under some circumstances.  They are also substantially less opaque than, for
