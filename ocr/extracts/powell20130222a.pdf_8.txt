normalizes, and there may be a period of zero remittances.  If so, the balance sheet would 

show a deferred asset representing a flow of future income to be retained and not remitted 

to the Treasury.  Nonetheless, we expect that the LSAPs, which began in late 2008, will 

result in a net increase in remittances over the life of these programs.  Moreover, any 

temporary losses should be weighed against the expected social benefits of the increased 

economic growth generated by the LSAPs, which would include higher tax revenue from 

increased output. 

Greenlaw and his coauthors also note that we have the flexibility to normalize the 

balance sheet more slowly.  For example, a “no asset sale” plan--under which assets 

would simply run off as they mature--would push out the date of normalization by only a 

year or so.  That approach would also address concerns over potential market disruption 

from the sale of off-the-run agency mortgage-backed securities.  And it would also 

smooth remittances.     

Remittances averaged about $25 billion per year, or 0.2 percent of GDP, over the 

decade before the crisis.  After the balance sheet is normalized, these remittances should 

return to a similar, modest share of GDP.  From the standpoint of the sustainability of 

federal fiscal policy, remittances are not a first-order concern.  That said, an extended 

period of zero remittances could certainly bring the Federal Reserve under criticism from 

the public and the Congress.  The question is whether the Federal Reserve would permit 

inflation and thereby abandon its post in the face of such criticism.  There is no reason to 

expect that to happen. 

The Federal Reserve was created as an independent agency, and a broad 

consensus has emerged among policymakers, academics, and other informed observers
