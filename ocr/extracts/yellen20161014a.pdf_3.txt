longer-run trend.1  This conclusion deserves to be reconsidered in light of the failure of 

the level of economic activity to return to its pre-recession trend in most advanced 

economies.  This post-crisis experience suggests that changes in aggregate demand may 

have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply--that is, on potential output.2   

The idea that persistent shortfalls in aggregate demand could adversely affect the 

supply side of the economy--an effect commonly referred to as hysteresis--is not new; for 

example, the possibility was discussed back in the mid-1980s with regard to the 

performance of European labor markets.3  But interest in the topic has increased in light 

of the persistent slowdown in economic growth seen in many developed economies since 

the crisis.  Several recent studies present cross-country evidence indicating that severe 

and persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long-term effects, even for 

downturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a shock to aggregate 

demand.4  With regard to the U.S. experience, one study estimates that the level of 

potential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its pre-

crisis trajectory, and it argues that much of this supply-side damage is attributable to 

several developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow 

recovery.5  In particular, the study finds that in the wake of the crisis, the United States 

experienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a result of reduced immigration and a 

fall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and

2 Or, as Summers (2014) asked in a pithy inversion of Say’s law, is it true that “lack of demand creates lack 
of supply?” (p. 37). 
3 As Blanchard and Summers (1986) discuss, the question at the time was whether the long-run 
equilibrium, or “natural,” rate of unemployment in European economies had been permanently raised by 
previous periods of high actual unemployment.
