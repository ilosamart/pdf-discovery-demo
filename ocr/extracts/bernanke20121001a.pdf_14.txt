policy because it allows policymakers to focus on what is best for the economy in the 

longer run, independently of near-term electoral or partisan concerns.  All of the 

members of the Federal Open Market Committee take this principle very seriously and 

strive always to make monetary policy decisions based solely on factual evidence and 

careful analysis.  

It is important to keep politics out of monetary policy decisions, but it is equally 

important, in a democracy, for those decisions--and, indeed, all of the Federal Reserveâ€™s 

decisions and actions--to be undertaken in a strong framework of accountability and 

transparency.  The American people have a right to know how the Federal Reserve is 

carrying out its responsibilities and how we are using taxpayer resources.   

One of my principal objectives as Chairman has been to make monetary policy at 

the Federal Reserve as transparent as possible.  We promote policy transparency in many 

ways.  For example, the Federal Open Market Committee explains the reasons for its 

policy decisions in a statement released after each regularly scheduled meeting, and three 

weeks later we publish minutes with a detailed summary of the meeting discussion.  The 

Committee also publishes quarterly economic projections with information about where 

we anticipate both policy and the economy will be headed over the next several years.  I 

hold news conferences four times a year and testify often before congressional 

committees, including twice-yearly appearances that are specifically designated for the 

purpose of my presenting a comprehensive monetary policy report to the Congress.  My 

colleagues and I frequently deliver speeches, such as this one, in towns and cities across 

the country.
