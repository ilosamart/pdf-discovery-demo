restricting the scope of bank activities.  It is true that the relative lack of geographic and portfolio 

diversification in many community banks can make them vulnerable to localized economic 

problems.  But that is just the kind of problem that traditional microprudential regulation has 

been concerned with addressing. 

What, then, of the 80 or so U.S. banks that have assets of $10 billion or more, but are not 

among the eight large, complex institutions that have been designated of global systemic 

importance?  Obviously they vary enormously in size, from just over $10 billion in assets all the 

way up to very large regional banks with hundreds of billions in assets.  They bridge the $50 

billion threshold for enhanced prudential standards established by Dodd-Frank.  Yet, whatever 

their size, most banking organizations in this group are overwhelmingly recognizable as 

traditional commercial banks (though a few do have significant capital market or other 

activities).  

 It is with this similarity in mind that some executives of some pretty sizable banks have 

described their institutions to me as essentially a community bank, but with a bigger balance 

sheet.  But there are at least two reasons why the aims for prudential regulation of such 

institutions might reach beyond conventional microprudential purposes.  First, some at the higher 

end of this range may have a large enough systemic footprint that their stress or failure could 

have material effects on the rest of the financial system, though less than the LISCC firms.  

Second, more than one-third of U.S. commercial banking assets are held by these 80 banks.  If a 

number of these banks simultaneously came under pressure or failed, a harmful contraction of 

credit availability in significant regions or sectors of the economy could ensue, even if there were 

little chance of a financial crisis.  Thus, particularly to the degree that there are correlations in the
