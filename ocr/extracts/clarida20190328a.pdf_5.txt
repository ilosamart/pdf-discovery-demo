assets that I highlighted earlier were an important mitigating factor, pushing down U.S. 

long-term yields.  To be sure, the Russian default of August 1998, followed by the 

collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, had more-substantial effects on global 

markets and posed greater risk to the U.S. economy, which triggered a policy response by 

the Fed in which the federal funds rate was cut 75 basis points between September and 

November of that year.8  Of note, after economic prospects appeared to stabilize, the Fed 

reversed those cuts in 1999.    

In recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for U.S. economic 

prospects and monetary policy.  Examples include the 2011-13 euro-zone recession and 

the China devaluation and capital flight episode of 2015 and ’16, when worries about a 

hard landing and renminbi depreciation, respectively, roiled world markets.  Both of 

these shocks originated in economies with large footprints in the global economy and 

financial system, and, as a result, they induced substantial disruptions in global financial 

markets.  During both episodes, U.S. stock markets fell and the dollar appreciated, 

especially during 2015 and 2016.  As ever, these negative shocks were associated with 

safe-haven flows that pushed U.S. Treasury yields down.9  Despite the drop in yields, 

overall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregate 

demand.10   

                                                 
8 Dell’Ariccia, Zettelmeyer, and Schnabel (2002) argue that the more-substantial response of global 
financial markets to the Russian default was because investors were expecting Russia to be rescued from 
having to default by the International Monetary Fund, and there was a global retreat from risk when that did 
not happen.  
9 Media commentary from 2015 and 2016 is replete with descriptions of the rout in global financial markets 
resulting from financial turbulence in China.  See, for example, Economist (2015).   
10 In May 2012, I gave an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations highlighting the potential risks to 
the fragile U.S. economic recovery posed by the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis; see Clarida (2012).
