made a strong impression on me in a lecture in 1963, in which he said, “You see, it (the 

balance of payments deficit) goes up and it goes down, and it is clear that we are moving 

toward a balance of payments crisis in 1964.”  I waited and I watched, and the crisis 

appeared on schedule, as predicted.  But Paish also warned us that forecasting was 

difficult, and gave us the advice “Never look back at your forecasts--you may lose your 

nerve.”  I pass that wisdom on to those of you who need it. 

I remember also my excitement at being told by a friend in a more senior class 

about the existence of econometric models of the entire economy.  It was a wonderful 

moment.  I understood that economic policy would from then on be easy:  All that was 

necessary was to feed the data into the model and work out at what level to set the policy 

parameters.  Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out that way.  On the use of econometric 

models, I think often of something Paul Samuelson once said:  “I’d rather have Bob 

Solow’s views than the predictions of a model.  But I’d rather have Solow with a model 

than without one.” 

We learned a lot at the LSE.  But wonderful as it was to be in London, and to 

meet people from all over the world for the first time, and to be able to travel to Europe 

and even to the Soviet Union with a student group, and to ski for the first time in my life 

in Austria, it gradually became clear to me that the center of the academic economics 

profession was not in London or Oxford or Cambridge, but in the United States. 

There was then the delicate business of applying to graduate school.  There was a 

strong Chicago tendency among many of the lecturers at the LSE, but I wanted to go to 

MIT.  When asked why, I gave a simple answer:  “Samuelson and Solow.”  Fortunately, I 

got into MIT and had the opportunity of getting to know Samuelson and Solow and other
