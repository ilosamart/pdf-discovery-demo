And then, in 2008, came the Great Recession and the Great Financial Crisis in the 

United States – a once-in-a-century event (one hopes), with deep worldwide 

repercussions.  Nearly seven years after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the economies of 

the United States, Japan, countries within the Euro zone and other European countries 

who continue to use their own currencies, among them the United Kingdom, are still 

struggling to return to sustained growth, two percent inflation rates, and positive real 

central bank interest rates, and thus to leave behind the imprint of the Great Recession.  


I. Learning from Crises 

Folk wisdom, policymakers and researchers see opportunities in crises.  Everyone is 

familiar with the notion that one should never waste a crisis.  Jean Monnet, among the 

founders of the European Union, said that “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be 

the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.”1  European Union and EMU decision-

makers have made similar statements in each of their crises, including the present one.  

And when talking about the present situation, they often conclude by saying “And we 

will emerge stronger this time too.” 

Policy economists seek to learn from crises, so that they can do better next time.  

During the thirty years from 1985 to 2015, I have been involved in a variety of roles in 

the management of crises, starting from the successful Israeli stabilization program of 

1985, during which I was part of a small team advising then Secretary of State, George 

Shultz, and through the ongoing management of monetary policy in the United States
