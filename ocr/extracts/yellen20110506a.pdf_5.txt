observers argue that greater financial openness may even yield better macroeconomic 

policy, as countries are subject to the discipline of outside capital markets. 

 Third, being more open to the rest of the world--both to financial flows and to 

trade--may help countries better absorb economic shocks by allowing temporary current 

account surpluses and deficits.  For example, a spending boom that leads the economy to 

overheat could induce a rise in the country’s currency and a decline in exports, restoring 

more normal conditions and avoiding an undesirable rise in inflation.  Any impediments 

to the free operation of international capital markets, including their role in setting 

exchange rates, can hamper this rebalancing of demand across countries. 

 Finally, openness also improves welfare by allowing countries greater scope to 

share risk.  Although financial openness may or may not reduce the volatility of an 

economy’s output, risk-averse consumers should benefit by diversifying their portfolios 

across countries and thus insuring themselves against the shocks hitting their own 

particular economy.  During domestic recessions, lower income from domestic assets 

may be offset by higher income from abroad, thereby reducing consumption volatility, as 

long as the shocks hitting the domestic and foreign economies are not too similar. 

Some Practical Challenges 

 Despite the strong case for financial openness, countries have faced some 

practical challenges in the pursuit of this objective.  In particular, capital flows can be 

volatile, and many countries have struggled with the adverse effects of this volatility on 

the domestic economy.  Access to foreign capital may also exacerbate domestic financial 

distortions, such as maturity mismatches or agency problems, by channeling funds into 

the domestic system that would not have otherwise been available.  A related matter is
