Why Is Mortgage Credit So Tight? 

Why are conditions still so tight for these potential first-time homebuyers, and 

when might they return to normal?  As I’ll discuss next, the mortgage market is reacting 

to a variety of economic, market, and regulatory issues that may not be present in other 

lending markets.  So it’s difficult to predict what a “normal” mortgage market will look 

like when things settle down.  After the crisis we have just experienced, I am pretty sure 

that we don’t want the market to return to the lending environment of the pre-crisis boom 

times.  But I also don’t think it would be a good idea to go back to the quite restrictive 

credit conditions of the early 1980s.   

Part of the tightening in mortgage credit standards is the result of lender fears 

about the economy and the trajectory of house prices.  Of respondents who reported 

tightening mortgage lending standards in the April 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion 

Survey on Bank Lending Practices, more than 80 percent identified concerns about the 

economy or house prices as a factor in their decision.  As the economic recovery 

continues, lenders should gain confidence that mortgage loans will perform well, and 

they should expand their lending accordingly. 

Credit for potential home purchasers with lower credit scores--in particular, the 

first-time homebuyers I discussed earlier--has likely also been affected by capacity 

constraints of mortgage lenders.  As most of you know very well, the mortgage industry 

has been operating near its capacity.  Although purchase originations have been subdued, 

refinancing originations, according to staff estimates, have responded to record-low 

interest rates by more than doubling from mid-2011 to the end of 2012.
