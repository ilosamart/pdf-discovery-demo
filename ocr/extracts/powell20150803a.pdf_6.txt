and we should be prepared to accept some increase in the cost of market making in order to meet 

those goals.   

  Regulation is only one of the factors--and clearly not the dominant one--behind the evolution 

in market making.  As we have seen, markets were undergoing dramatic change long before the 

financial crisis.  Technological change has allowed new types of trading firms to act as market makers 

for a large and growing share of transactions, not just in equity and foreign exchange markets but 

also in Treasury markets.  As traditional dealers have lost market share, one way they have sought 

to remain competitive is by attempting to internalize their customer trades--essentially trying to 

create their own markets by finding matches between their customers who are seeking to buy and 

sell.  Internalization allows these firms to capture more of the bid-ask spread, but it may also reduce 

liquidity in the public market.  At the same time it does not eliminate the need for a public market, 

where price discovery mainly occurs, as dealers must place the orders that they cannot internalize 

into that market.    

  While the changes I’ve just discussed are unlikely to go away, I believe that markets will 

adapt to them over time.  In the meantime, we have a responsibility to make sure that market and 

regulatory incentives appropriately encourage an evolution that will sustain market liquidity and 

functioning.  

In thinking about market incentives, one observer has noted that trading rules and structures 

have grown to matter crucially as trading speeds have increased--in her words, “At very fast 

speeds, only the [market] microstructure matters.”8  Trading algorithms are, after all, simply a set 

of rules, and they will necessarily interact with and optimize against the rules of the trading
