of monetary policy through open market operations.  In many of the developing 

countries, however, although financial systems are developing rapidly, they remain small 

and not well diversified, hindering the ability of central banks to conduct open market 

operations.  Indeed, in many countries, interbank markets are still underdeveloped, and, 

even though some central banks use policy rates, changes to these policy rates have only 

limited effect on other interest rates and on the economy more generally.  Thus, the 

ambitions of developing countries to modernize their monetary policy frameworks have 

to proceed in parallel with further efforts to develop the market institutions necessary to 

conduct monetary policy in a conventional way.7    

Concluding Remarks 

Central banking as a profession has come a long way, striving to adapt itself to the 

challenges faced by economies over time, and both the practice and theory of central 

banking will continue to evolve.  Like others, central banks in developing countries are 

making strides in modernizing their policy frameworks and better adapting them to the 

problems that their economies face.  Nonetheless, significant challenges remain to 

develop financial systems and accelerate financial inclusion, to enhance the effectiveness 

of monetary policy, and to further expand the institutional and operational capacities of 

central banks.   

I wish you--the governors and high officials of African central banks--well in 

carrying out your critical and difficult responsibilities, and I look forward to discussing 

with you the policy issues that you confront.
