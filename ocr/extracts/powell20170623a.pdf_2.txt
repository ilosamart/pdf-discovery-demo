Thank you for inviting me to speak today.1  The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and 

Darrell Duffie have provided a valuable public service in hosting this annual symposium on 

central clearing.  I will start my remarks by taking stock of the progress made in strengthening 

central counterparties (or CCPs), and then offer some thoughts on central clearing and liquidity 

risks. 

The huge losses suffered by the American International Group (AIG) on its over-the-

counter derivatives positions contributed to the financial crisis and highlighted the risks in 

derivatives markets.  In response, the Group of Twenty nations committed in 2009 to moving 

standardized derivatives to central clearing.  Central clearing serves to address many of the 

weaknesses exposed during the crisis by fostering a reduction in risk exposures through 

multilateral netting and daily margin requirements as well as greater transparency through 

enhanced reporting requirements.  Central clearing also enables a reduction in the potential cost 

of counterparty default by facilitating the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member's positions, 

and the sharing of risk among members of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of 

such a default.   

But central clearing will only make the financial system safer if CCPs themselves are run 

safely.  Efforts to set heightened expectations for CCPs and other financial market infrastructures 

have been ongoing for years, with the regulatory community working collectively to clarify and 

significantly raise expectations.  These efforts resulted in the Principles for Financial Market 

Infrastructures (or PFMI), which was published in 2012 by the Committee on Payments and 

Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions
