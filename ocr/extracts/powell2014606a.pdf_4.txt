“including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and 

inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.”

Second, the Committee indicated, “based on its assessment of these factors, that it 

likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for 

a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends”--a time-based reference, since 

the Committee has indicated that it expects to wind down its asset purchases by the end 

of this year if the economy continues to evolve as expected.

  Of course, the actual timing 

of liftoff will depend on the performance of the economy.   

Third, the Committee stated that it “anticipates that, even after employment and 

inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, 

warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal 

in the longer run.”

  Committee members have differing thoughts on why that may be the

Turning briefly to asset purchases, since last December’s FOMC meeting, the 

Committee has reduced asset purchases in a series of measured steps from a pace of 

$85 billion a month to its current pace of $45 billion per month.  If incoming information 

continues to broadly support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in 

labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, these

 The thresholds provided a useful guide to policy, but with the unemployment rate approaching its 

6-1/2 percent threshold, the Committee judged that it would need to look at a broader range of information 

in order to determine the appropriate stance of policy.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
