In the aftermath of the financial crisis, regulators around the world continue to implement 

reforms designed to limit the incidence and severity of future crises.  My subject today pertains 

to an area in which reforms have yet to be made--the regulation of the U.S. operations of large 

foreign banks.

  Applicable regulation has changed relatively little in the last decade, despite a 

significant and rapid transformation of those operations, as foreign banks moved beyond their 

traditional lending activities to engage in substantial, and often complex, capital market 

activities.  The crisis revealed the resulting risks to U.S. financial stability.           

In taking a fresh look at regulation of foreign banks in the United States, I by no means 

want to imply that the United States should revoke its welcome to foreign banks.  On the 

contrary, this reconsideration reflects the important role foreign banks have played.  The 

presence of foreign banks can bring particular competitive and countercyclical benefits because 

foreign banks often expand lending in the United States when U.S. banking firms labor under 

common domestic strains.  But just as we are adapting our regulatory approach to U.S. banks, so 

we need to incorporate important lessons learned from the crisis into our oversight program for 

foreign banks.   

The question of how best to regulate foreign banks is hardly a new one, either here or in 

other countries.  Debates over the relative merits of territorial versus global or mutual 

recognition approaches, the difficulties in achieving strictly equal terms of competition between 

banks with different home regulatory systems, and the degree to which harmonization of 

international standards and supervisory consultations can mitigate the resulting inconsistencies 

and frictions are all familiar topics to academics, banking lawyers, and supervisory authorities.
