macroprudential implications of wholesale funding discussed earlier.  If one wished to 

maintain the practice of grounding capital requirements in measures of assets, another 

possibility would be to add as a capital surcharge a specified percentage of assets 

measured so as to weight most heavily those associated with short-term funding.  

To provide a meaningful counterweight to the risks associated with wholesale 

funding runs, the additional capital requirement would have to be material.   The highest 

requirement would be at just the point where a firm had the minimum required level of 

liquidity.  The requirement then would diminish as the liquidity score of the firm rose 

sufficiently above minimum required levels.  If the requirement were significant enough 

and likely to apply to any large institution with substantial capital market activities, it 

might also be a substitute for increasing the capital surcharge schedule already agreed to 

in Basel.   

I readily acknowledge that calibrating the relationship would not be easy, and that 

the stakes for both financial stability and financial efficiency in getting it right would be 

significant.  But I think this approach is worth exploring, precisely because it rests upon 

the link between too-big-to-fail concerns and the runs and contagion that we experienced 

five years ago, and to which we remain vulnerable today.  Whether it proves feasible, or 

whether we would have to fall back on the more straightforward approach of 

strengthening liquidity requirements for systemically important firms, the key point is 

that the principle of increasing stringency be applied. 

Conclusion 

 Of late I find myself of two minds on the question of bringing to a close the major 

elements of regulatory change following the financial crisis.  On the one hand, I strongly
