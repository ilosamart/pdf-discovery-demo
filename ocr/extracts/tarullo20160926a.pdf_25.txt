less complex firms to invest in stress testing capabilities on par with the most complex firms and, 

given their profile, we feel these firms can maintain the progress they have made through the 

normal supervisory process, supplemented with targeted horizontal reviews of discrete aspects of 

capital planning.   

This shift will reduce the intensity of supervision of their capital planning processes, 

remove any uncertainty as to supervisory expectations for their firms relative to the largest firms, 

and eliminate the possibility of a public objection to their capital plans on qualitative grounds.  

They would still be included in the quantitative side of the stress test and the proposed stress 

capital buffer.  But we are also proposing to reduce the amount of data these firms are required to 

submit for the purpose of running the stress test, on what we call the Y-14 regulatory reports.  

Unlike the other substantial changes we are contemplating to CCAR and our stress test, we are 

proposing that these changes would be effective next year, for CCAR 2017. 

 Conclusion 

This set of changes we are considering for our stress testing regime has been motivated 

by somewhat different considerations, against the backdrop of what we intend to remain a 

dynamic regulatory instrument whose procedures will be regularly refined and whose substance 

will be regularly adapted to changing economic conditions and industry practices.  Still, in 

pulling this package of modifications together, we have consciously shaped them in accordance 

with the principle that financial regulation should be progressively more stringent for firms of 

greater importance, and thus potential risk, to the financial system.  Two features of the package 

reflect this principle.
