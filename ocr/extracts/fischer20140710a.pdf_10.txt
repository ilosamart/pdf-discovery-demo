action after the bubble had burst than as it was forming.12  The policy was tested in the 

bursting of the tech bubble in 2001 and appeared to be successful as the economy 

recovered from 2002 onward.13  However, the mopping-up doctrine did not include the 

second element of the macroprudential approach--the use of regulatory and supervisory 

measures to deal with undesired asset-price movements when the central bank interest 

rate was judged not to be available for that purpose. 

At present, the word macroprudential is used primarily in the second sense--of the 

use of regulatory and supervisory noncentral bank interest rate tools to affect asset prices.  

In this sense, the use of the word takes us back to a world that central bankers thought 

they had left by the 1990s.14   

Now, from etymology to economics: I want to review my experience with 

macroprudential policies--in the second sense of noninterest regulatory and supervisory 

policies--as Governor of the Bank of Israel to draw a few key lessons about the use of 

these policies.  To set the background: There was no financial crisis in Israel during the 

Great Recession.  As domestic interest rates declined along with global rates, housing 

12 As is well known, support for the mopping-up approach was not unanimous, with, for example, 
researchers at the BIS, notably Claudio Borio and Bill White, presenting the view that monetary policy 
should be used to deal with asset-price inflation.  See Claudio Borio and William R. White (2003),

13 It could be argued that the low interest rates of the 2003-06 period were the result of the mopping-up 
approach.  I do not see any necessary connection between the mopping-up doctrine and monetary policy in 
the period following the mopping up of the hi-tech boom.   
14 According to the ProQuest database, of the roughly 1,600 articles referring to the term “macroprudential” 
after the start of the Great Recession, almost all refer to regulatory and supervisory interventions.
