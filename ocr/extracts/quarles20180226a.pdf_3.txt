maximum employment and stable prices. 

The Economy Appears to Be in a Good Spot          

I will start with an assessment of current economic conditions.  In my view, the 

economy appears to be in a good spot right now.  This favorable position is particularly 

evident in the labor market.  After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the 

unemployment rate has declined to 4.1 percent, its lowest level since the 1960s outside of 

a brief period from 1999 to 2000.  With the unemployment rate below most estimates of 

its natural rate, wages appear to have accelerated a little of late after a period of relatively 

muted increases, and I expect a further modest step-up in the pace of wage gains.  

Another welcome development has been a break in recent years in the two-decade-long 

trend decline in the labor force participation rate. 

The robust job market has likely spilled over to other aspects of the economy.  

Consumer confidence has returned to pre-crisis levels, which, together with solid income 

gains and rising household wealth, has supported strong growth in consumption 

expenditures.  Likewise, surveys reveal increased business optimism, also evident in an 

acceleration in investment spending.  Real expenditures on capital equipment increased at 

a double-digit pace in the second half of last year, providing early hope that the 

investment drought that has weighed on growth in recent years might finally be breaking.   

The recent upturn in growth has not been confined to the United States.  In its 

latest projection, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global growth to run 

close to 4 percent in 2018, the fastest pace since the immediate post-crisis rebound in
