Nevertheless, there may be times when standard monetary policy and financial 

stability considerations conflict. In several recent instances, foreign economies have 

faced some tension between high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to the 

central bank’s target, on the one hand, and financial stability concerns associated with 

rapidly rising real estate prices on the other.  In the United Kingdom, policymakers put in 

place a range of measures to limit the buildup of risks in the housing market, and, partly 

as a result, the housing market appears to be cooling somewhat.  Nonetheless, U.K. 

policymakers have acknowledged the potential for monetary policy adjustments to play a 

role in the pursuit of financial stability.  The Bank of England’s 2013 forward guidance 

had a specific financial stability “knockout” for monetary policy accommodation if the 

Financial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a 

significant threat to financial stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of 

mitigating policy actions available to the FPC.”11 

If, in the future, the United States did face a similar dilemma, where financial 

imbalances are growing rapidly against a backdrop of subpar economic conditions, the 

Federal Reserve may consider monetary policy for financial stability purposes more 

readily than some foreign peers because our regulatory perimeter is narrower, the capital 

markets are more important, and the macroprudential toolkit is not as extensive.  Even in 

these circumstances, however, it is important to be prudent about the role of monetary 

policy, recognizing that the necessary adjustments in monetary policy could have broader 

consequences.  For example, a tightening in monetary policy sufficient to limit strong
