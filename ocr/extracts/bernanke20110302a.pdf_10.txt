state legislatures review their tax systems, they may wish to consider steps to enhance the 

cyclical stability of their revenue streams.  Of course, many considerations enter into tax 

policy, including the fairness of the code, the support it provides for economic growth 

and development, and the level of administrative and compliance costs. 

Budget balance and budget stability are important fiscal issues.  In the long run, 

though, the most important fiscal issue is whether the structure and composition of the 

government budget best serves the public interest.  Certainly, most people would support 

the goal of fostering healthy economic growth.  Government can contribute to this 

objective in a number of ways.  One critical means is by ensuring an adequate investment 

in human capital--that is, in the knowledge and skills of our people.  No economy can 

succeed without a high-quality workforce, particularly in an age of globalization and 

technical change.  Cost-effective K-12 and post-secondary schooling are crucial to 

building a better workforce, but they are only part of the story.  Research increasingly has 

shown the benefits of early childhood education and efforts to promote the lifelong 

acquisition of skills for both individuals and the economy as a whole.  The payoffs of 

early childhood programs can be especially high.7  For instance, preschool programs for 

disadvantaged children have been shown to increase high school graduation rates.8  

Because high school graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely 

to use public health programs, investing in such programs can pay off even from the 

narrow perspective of state budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to 

the individuals themselves are much greater.
