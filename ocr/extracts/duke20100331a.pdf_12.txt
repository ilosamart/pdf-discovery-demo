and their fates are closely linked.  Despite the best efforts of bankers and regulators, we 

continue to hear of the difficulties experienced by small businesses in obtaining credit.  A 

recent study conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) 

found that of small employers who attempted to borrow in 2009, about half received all 

the credit they wanted.  But nearly one-quarter received no credit at all.  A similar study 

in 2005 found nearly 90 percent of small employers had most or all their credit needs met 

and only eight percent obtained no credit.   

Even though conditions in financial markets have continued to improve in 2010, 

access to credit remains restricted for many smaller businesses, who largely depend on 

banks for credit.  Risk spreads on small business loans at banks have continued to rise, 

and the decline in loans outstanding has been stark.   

A number of factors are contributing to the reduced supply of bank loans.  For 

instance, in response to an increase in the number of delinquent and nonperforming loans, 

many banks have reduced existing lines of credit sharply and have tightened their 

standards and terms for new credit.  In other cases, banks with capital positions that have 

been eroded by losses or those with limited access to capital markets may be reducing 

risk assets to improve their capital positions, especially amid continued uncertainty about 

the economic outlook and possible future loan losses.   

A number of government programs intended to increase the supply of credit are 

currently in place or under consideration and a variety of approaches may be needed to 

address the different barriers to bank lending.  For example, to offset bank concerns about 

the level of credit risk, increases in the availability of Small Business Administration 

(SBA) guarantees and streamlining of the SBA application process may be helping to
