as attracting new, higher-income families.  An independently operated public charter 

school for grades kindergarten through 12, named the Drew Charter School, and an early 

learning center serving 135 children were built.  A new YMCA health and fitness center 

began to provide wellness programs and to serve as a neighborhood gathering place.  

Finally, the foundation worked to attract commercial investments in the neighborhood, 

including a grocery store, a bank branch, and restaurants.  

Creating this plan and navigating the complex array of interests and resources of 

the community, the local government, and the private sector took 10 years of effort.  But 

the character of the neighborhood was fundamentally changed.  Today crime in East Lake 

is down by 73 percent, and violent crime is down by 90 percent.  The percentage of low-

income adults employed has increased from 13 percent to 70 percent, and Drew Charter 

School moved from last place in performance among 69 Atlanta public schools after its 

first year of operation to fourth place.  With 74 percent of its students receiving free and 

reduced-price lunches, Drew performs at the same level as public schools in far more 

affluent areas.

  The educational outcomes alone argue for the wisdom of the holistic 

approach to community development.   

The success in East Lake raises the question of whether a similar approach can 

work in other communities.  In 2009, Cousins launched a community development 

organization, Purpose Built Communities, to try to attain the same good outcomes that 

were achieved in Atlanta in other cities around the country.  Experience so far suggests 

that, while the framework can be replicated, it requires certain neighborhood conditions 

to succeed.  These conditions include (1) housing developments of concentrated poverty,
