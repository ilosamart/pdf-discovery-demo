acceleration of the shift from a dominantly regulatory approach to achieving prudential aims--

one that rests on activities and affiliation restrictions, and other reasonably transparent 

rules--toward greater emphasis on a supervisory approach, which relies on a more opaque, firm-

specific process of watching over banks' own risk-management and compliance systems.   

 Yet the breadth and depth of the financial breakdown suggest that it has much deeper 

roots.  In many respects, this crisis was the culmination of fundamental shifts in both the 

organization and regulation of financial markets that began in the 1970s.  The New Deal reforms 

of financial regulation, themselves spawned by a systemic crisis, had separated commercial 

banking from investment banking, cured the problem of commercial bank runs by providing 

federal deposit insurance, and brought transparency and investor protections to trading and other 

capital markets activities.  This regulatory approach fostered a commercial banking system that 

was, for the better part of 40 years, quite stable and reasonably profitable, though not particularly 

innovative in meeting the needs of depositors and borrowers. 

 In the 1970s, however, turbulent macroeconomic developments combined with 

technological and business innovations to produce an increasingly tight squeeze on the 

traditional commercial banking business model.  The squeeze came from both the liability side 

of banks’ balance sheets, in the form of more attractive savings vehicles such as money market 

funds, and from the asset side, with the growth of public capital markets and international 

competition.  The large commercial banking industry that saw both its funding and its customer 

bases under attack sought removal or relaxation of the regulations that confined bank activities, 

affiliations, and geographic reach.  While supervisors differed with banks on some important 

particulars, they were sympathetic to this industry request, in part because of the potential threat 

to the viability of the traditional commercial banking system.
