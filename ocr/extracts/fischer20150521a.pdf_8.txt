members of the Union to become members of the ECB and adopt the euro, with the most 

notable standout being the United Kingdom.   

The ERM crisis also drove home the need for greater coordination of fiscal 

policies in the run-up to monetary union.  Members of the EU agreed to the Stability and 

Growth Pact in 1996.  Although, as we all know, the conditions of the pact have not 

always been observed, nor enforced by Brussels, the acknowledgment of the need for a 

coordinated fiscal policy to complement monetary union was still a step forward--one 

which may be drawn on in future.   

What lessons can we draw from this history of the regionâ€™s economic and 

monetary responses to earlier crises?  Do the results bear out the spirit of the statements 

by Monnet and others about each crisis leading to greater strength?  Certainly, each 

setback and each crisis spurred policymakers to take steps that they might not otherwise 

have taken at that time, and the end result of those steps has been a more unified 

European monetary union.  Successive crises have not deterred policymakers from the 

goal of economic integration, but rather seemed to strengthen their belief in the need for 

it--and that integration is stronger today than it ever was in the past.  

Looking back, the progress in this project from its earliest days after World 

War II until today has been impressive.  Trade integration has led to the free flow of 

goods within the EU, and this has brought economic gains.  Greater trade integration has 

in turn generated a continued desire for greater monetary integration, which was put in 

place in 1999, and until recently seemed to be a major success.  That success in turn 

made crystal clear the need for more fiscal integration--a challenge for the future, to 

which we will return.
