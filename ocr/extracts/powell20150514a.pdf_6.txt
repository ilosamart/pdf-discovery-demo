The Board has undertaken substantial efforts to tailor its supervisory practices to 

the size of the bank examined.  We supervise banks in four tiers, with requirements that 

are lowest for smaller, local institutions and increase with the size, complexity, and 

geographic reach of firms.  This system helps community banks by eliminating 

requirements that are relevant only to large, geographically diversified banks.  This tiered 

approach allows us to account for the differences in business models and risk levels 

among different types of banks.  Our goal is not to develop one state-of-the-art approach 

to regulation and supervision, but instead multiple state-of-the-art approaches that are 

appropriate for each type of institution we oversee.  Supervision of community banks is 

not a watered-down version of supervision of larger banks, but a significantly different 

process tailored to the business model of smaller banks. 

For community banks, the primary purpose of prudential regulation is to ensure the 

safety and soundness of each individual institution, thereby protecting the deposit 

insurance fund.  The crisis showed that such a focus on individual institutions was 

inadequate to account for and contain the systemic threats posed by risks at larger, more 

complex institutions, and much of the improvement in oversight has been directed at 

systemic risk.  The Board is committed to making sure that new supervisory standards do 

not trickle down to community banks when they may only be appropriate for larger 

institutions, whether they be systemically important institutions overseen by the Large 

Institution Supervision Coordination Committee, other large banking organizations with 

more than $50 billion in assets, or regional banking organizations with between 

$10 billion and $50 billion in assets.4
