The ongoing fiscal and financial strains in Europe may have affected lending conditions for nonfinancial 
companies that have operations in the United States and significant exposure to European economies, as well as 
banks headquartered in Europe and their affiliates and subsidiaries. Question 7 deals with changes in your 
bank's lending policies toward both types of firms over the past three months. In addition, developments in 
Europe may have affected these firms' demand for credit from U.S. banks. Questions 8-9 deal with such changes 
in demand. 

In answering these questions, please consider your bank's C&I lending to all nonfinancial companies with 
operations in the United States and significant exposure to European economies (that is, please consider your 
bank's C&I loans both to European firms that are located in the United States and to domestic firms that conduct 
a significant portion of their business with European firms). With regard to banks, please consider your bank's 
lending, or extension of credit lines, to banks headquartered in Europe and to the affiliates and subsidiaries of 
European banks regardless of the location of those affiliates and subsidiaries. 

7. Over the past three months, how have your bank's credit standards and terms for approving applications for 
loans or credit lines—other than those to be used to finance mergers and acquisitions—for the following types of 
firms changed?
