Good afternoon.  I am pleased to join the New York Economic Club for lunch 

today.  I know that many of you and your friends and neighbors are still recovering from 

the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and I want to let you know that our thoughts are with 

everyone who has suffered during the storm and its aftermath.   

My remarks today will focus on the reasons for the disappointingly slow pace of 

economic recovery in the United States and the policy actions that have been taken by the 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to support the economy.  In addition, I will 

discuss some important economic challenges our country faces as we close out 2012 and 

move into 2013--in particular, the challenge of putting federal government finances on a 

sustainable path in the longer run while avoiding actions that would endanger the 

economic recovery in the near term. 

The Recovery from the Financial Crisis and Recession 

The economy has continued to recover from the financial crisis and recession, but 

the pace of recovery has been slower than FOMC participants and many others had hoped 

or anticipated when I spoke here about three years ago.  Indeed, since the recession 

trough in mid-2009, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged only a 

little more than 2 percent per year.   

Similarly, the job market has improved over the past three years, but at a slow 

pace.  The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in the fall of 2009, has since 

come down 2 percentage points to just below 8 percent.  This decline is obviously 

welcome, but it has taken a long time to achieve that progress, and the unemployment 

rate is still well above both its level prior to the onset of the recession and the level that 

my colleagues and I think can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved.
