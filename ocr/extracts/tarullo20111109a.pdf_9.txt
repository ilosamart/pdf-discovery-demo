September 2010.  The GHOS said that banks should “maintain prudent earnings retention 

policies” so as to meet both the new minimum equity standard and the conservation buffer “as 

soon as reasonably possible.”2  In the spirit of that statement, we will expect large bank holding 

companies that have not yet met the fully phased-in Basel III requirements (including any 

expected capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks) to improve their capital 

ratios steadily during the transition period through prudent earnings retention policies, even if 

they already meet any applicable intermediate targets.  In practical terms, we will monitor their 

progress through the annual capital planning exercise, about which I shall have more to say a bit 

later in these remarks.  We will be comfortable with proposed capital distributions only when we 

are convinced they are consistent with a bank holding company readily and without difficulty 

meeting the new capital requirements as they come into effect.   

Turning now to the second thread of capital regulation reform, the introduction of a 

capital requirement keyed to the systemic importance of financial firms, I am sure you are all 

aware that last Friday the Basel Committee released its framework for calibrating capital 

surcharges for banks of global systemic importance.  This initiative is consistent with the Federal 

Reserve’s obligation under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act to impose more stringent capital 

standards on systemically important financial institutions, including the requirement that these 

additional standards be graduated based on the systemic importance of the bank.  Both the Dodd-

Frank provision and the Basel framework are informed by the fact that the failure of a 

systemically important firm would have substantially greater negative consequences on the 

financial system than the failure of other firms, even quite sizeable ones.  Yet obviously such a 

firm has no incentive to take account of these negative externalities.  An ancillary rationale is
