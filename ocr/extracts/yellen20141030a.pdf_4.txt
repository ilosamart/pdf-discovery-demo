and otherwise appealing to undergrads? 

The AEA has also done important work documenting and investigating the “leaky

about what is being taught in college, how economists are being trained in graduate 

school, and other questions that bear on the health and the future of the economics 

profession in general.   

These are not idle questions.  All of you know that there has been a fair amount of
