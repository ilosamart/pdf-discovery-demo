liquidity concerns.  Conceptually, the cleanest approach might be to integrate capital and 

liquidity requirements in a single regulatory framework, which would establish minimum levels 

of capital and liquidity and then increase the capital requirement for intermediaries with more 

vulnerable funding structures.  Higher capital levels would be especially warranted for 

intermediaries using large enough amounts of short-term debt that their response when funding 

liquidity is constrained--either selling assets or withholding funding from their own customers--

could adversely affect the financial system as a whole.   

Realistically, though, the goal of full integration of capital and liquidity regulation seems 

unattainable for the foreseeable future.  For one thing, it is hard to imagine all the relevant 

banking, market, and insurance regulators converging on such a novel approach anytime soon.  

In addition, though, without a more complete understanding of the precise relationship between 

liquidity and capital needs, placing so much weight on one form of regulation would be ill-

advised.  For the present, then, the Basel regime will maintain separate capital and liquidity 

regulations, which may differ among types of financial intermediaries.5  But we can at least 

strive to establish each set of regulations with reference to the other and to attain at least a rough 

consistency across regulatory regimes applicable to various intermediaries. 

In the United States, we have already taken one step in this direction.  As you may know, 

in implementing the Basel G-SIB capital surcharge, we decided that surcharges somewhat higher 

than those finally agreed in Basel were appropriate.  As we refashioned the Basel approach, we 

added a metric on short-term wholesale funding dependence to the formula for determining a 

                                                 
5 It is worth noting that the net capital rule for broker-dealers maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission is a form of hybrid capital and liquidity regulation.  However, it seems basically oriented to protecting 
customers, a bit like traditional regulation of life insurance companies, and was not developed with going concern or 
systemic implications in mind.  It does not, for instance, place higher requirements on firms with heavy reliance on 
short-term wholesale funding, though it does penalize firms that hold large amounts of illiquid assets.  In many 
respects the rule seems well-suited to smaller broker-dealers but, for reasons explained earlier, it does not seem 
optimal for the large broker-dealers in large bank holding companies.
