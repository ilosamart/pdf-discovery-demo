While the ability of businesses to access credit is a function of many factors, it is 

my view that the examination and supervision of the lender should not hinder the ability 

of creditworthy businesses to access credit.  To be clear, I do not think this is occurring in 

any significant way, but it is an issue that we at the Federal Reserve focus on continually. 

Of course, banks are far more likely to be able to lend when they are in sound 

financial condition.  In that regard, I am encouraged that community banks are faring 

better in the current environment.  There is still considerable uncertainty about the health 

of residential and commercial real estate markets in many parts of the country, and many 

community banksâ€™ balance sheets remain weighed down with nonperforming real estate 

loans.  At the same time, the competitive landscape is being shaped by increasing 

consolidation in the industry.  Having said that, despite the tough road that many 

community banks still must navigate, there are promising signs that conditions seem to be 

stabilizing.  While profitability remains below long-run historical norms, returns on 

equity and assets have reached their highest post-crisis levels.3  Earnings have steadily 

improved in recent quarters despite compressed net interest margins.  Although 

nonperforming asset ratios remain high, they have continued to decline for community 

banks broadly speaking, and small community banks (those with total assets of less than 

$1 billion) in recent quarters have registered their first overall decreases in this ratio since 

the crisis began.   

Nonetheless, we must continue to think about how we can improve the 

examination and supervision of community banks.  One issue that we constantly must 

evaluate is the appropriate balance in the allocation of responsibilities between banks and
