seems too large to be readily explainable by the stance of monetary policy alone.  

Moreover, cross-country evidence shows no significant relationship between monetary 

policies and the pace of house price increases. 

 What policy implications should we draw?  I noted earlier that the most important 

source of lower initial monthly payments, which allowed more people to enter the 

housing market and bid for properties, was not the general level of short-term interest 

rates, but the increasing use of more exotic types of mortgages and the associated decline 

of underwriting standards.  That conclusion suggests that the best response to the housing 

bubble would have been regulatory, not monetary.  Stronger regulation and supervision 

aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders’ risk management would have 

been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a 

general increase in interest rates.  Moreover, regulators, supervisors, and the private 

sector could have more effectively addressed building risk concentrations and inadequate 

risk-management practices without necessarily having had to make a judgment about the 

sustainability of house price increases. 

The Federal Reserve and other agencies did make efforts to address poor 

mortgage underwriting practices.  In 2005, we worked with other banking regulators to 

develop guidance for banks on nontraditional mortgages, notably interest-only and 

option-ARM products.  In March 2007, we issued interagency guidance on subprime 

lending, which was finalized in June.  After a series of hearings that began in June 2006, 

we used authority granted us under the Truth in Lending Act to issue rules that apply to 

all high-cost mortgage lenders, not just banks.  However, these efforts came too late or
