on well-developed economic ideas that have deep historical roots.5

Economic research and analysis have proved useful in understanding many other 

aspects of the crisis as well.  For example, one of the most important developments in 

economics over recent decades has been the flowering of information economics, which 

studies how incomplete information or differences in information among economic 

agents affect market outcomes.

  The problem in this 

case was not a lack of professional understanding of how runs come about or how central 

banks and other authorities should respond to them.  Rather, the problem was the failure 

of both private- and public-sector actors to recognize the potential for runs in an 

institutional context quite different than the circumstances that had given rise to such 

events in the past.  These failures in turn were partly the result of a regulatory structure 

that had not adapted adequately to the rise of shadow banking and that placed insufficient 

emphasis on the detection of systemic risks, as opposed to risks to individual institutions 

and markets.

5 A substantial modern literature has updated and formalized many of the insights of Bagehot and 
Thornton.  A classic example is Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983), “Bank Runs, Deposit 
Insurance, and Liquidity” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91 (3), pp. 401-19. 

  An important branch of information economics, 

principal-agent theory, considers the implications of differences in information between 

the principals in a relationship (say, the shareholders of a firm) and the agents who work 

for the principals (say, the firm’s managers).  Because the agent typically has more 

information than the principal--managers tend to know more about the firm’s 

opportunities and problems than do the shareholders, for example--and because the 

financial interests of the principal and the agent are not perfectly aligned, much depends

their leadership in the development of information economics.
