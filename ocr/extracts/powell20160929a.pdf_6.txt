The sharp difference in trends for the number of banks with less than $100 million 

in assets compared with larger community banks naturally leads to the question of 

whether this difference is reflected in basic bank performance measures.  I will begin 

with return on assets (ROA).  Breaking down all community banks into the same size 

categories I used earlier, with the addition of a category for all banks larger than $10 

billion in assets, we find striking differences in the patterns of bank profitability over 

time (figure 7).  The largest community banks--those with $1 billion to $10 billion in 

assets (in green, with diamonds to mark yearly values)--followed a pattern similar to that 

of our largest banks (in black, with crosses), but with slightly worse results throughout 

the past 20 years.  These large community banks had lower average levels of profitability 

than our largest banks prior to the recent recession, suffered worse losses in 2009, and 

have enjoyed lower levels of earnings since the crisis. 

Banks in the size range from $300 million to $1 billion in assets (in blue, with 

triangles) have been the most consistently profitable group among community banks, 

although their profit levels still lag those for the largest banks.  These midsize community 

banks performed as well as banks with $1 billion to $10 billion in assets before the recent 

recession and remained profitable, on average, even in 2009.   

The story is much the same for banks in the size class from $100 million to 

$300 million in assets (in red, with squares).  Their profit levels were slightly lower than 

those for larger community banks prior to the crisis, but they performed similarly until 

2015, when banks of this size showed a decline in profits not experienced by any other 

size grouping of community banks.  Time will tell whether this is an anomaly or the 

beginning of a pattern.
