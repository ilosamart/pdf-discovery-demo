Through the Fed’s 12 Reserve Banks and their branches, we are able to get a 

clearer picture of conditions in individual communities across the nation.  Each of the 

Reserve Banks has an active, well-staffed community development function--one of the 

great benefits of the Federal Reserve’s structure.  We get important and timely 

information on the state of local economic and financial conditions, including those 

affecting low- and moderate-income, as well as other underserved, communities. 

Our community development staff provide us with a more nuanced understanding 

of current economic and financial conditions.  They also help people in low-income and 

underserved communities overcome the challenges they face.  We support numerous 

initiatives in rural communities across the country, several of which I would like to 

highlight. 

The first initiative is the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s longtime 

commitment to the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta region.  This region has struggled for 

decades with persistent intergenerational poverty and a lack of resources and capacity to 

address this challenge.  Most recently, in 2016 the St. Louis Fed launched the Delta 

Communities Initiative, and since then it has held 26 regional forums with more than 

500 participants.  These forums help to build awareness of promising tools and strategies
