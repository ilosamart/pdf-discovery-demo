Global Links:  Why Has the Decline in Interest Rates Been So Widespread?   

Up until now, I have looked primarily at factors within the United States.  

However, as I have pointed out earlier, the decline in interest rates is a global 

phenomenon.  Why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread? 

One important reason is that many of the same factors that have been driving 

down the equilibrium interest rate in the United States have operated with equal or even 

greater force in many foreign economies.  The slowdown in labor productivity growth 

has been widespread across many countries.  Likewise, the advanced economies and 

some emerging markets have experienced demographic shifts that are in some cases 

much more pronounced than in the United States, with the working-age population in 

some countries even declining over the past decade.     

Another explanation is that we live in an integrated global economy where 

economic developments in one country spill over into other countries via trade and 

capital flows as well as prices, including interest rates and exchange rates.13  In the most 

general sense, these spillovers are captured in the pattern of current balances, shown in 

figure 4.  If we abstract from a somewhat sizable statistical discrepancy, the sum of 

global current accounts should be equal to zero, as, in the aggregate, one countryâ€™s deficit 

must be matched by a surplus in some configuration of other countries--but it is not 

always apparent who is spilling over onto whom.   

Current Account Balances and Global Spillovers 

Prior to the financial crisis, it was widely speculated that foreign developments 

were depressing U.S. interest rates.  Former Chairman Bernanke characterized the foreign
