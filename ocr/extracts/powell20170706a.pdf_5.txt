low doc, and no doc loans.2  These practices contributed to the catastrophic failure of the housing 

finance system.  Almost nine years ago, in September 2008, Fannie and Freddie were put into 

“temporary” conservatorship and received injections of taxpayer funds totaling $187.5 billion.  

In the end, the system privatized the gains and socialized the losses.   

The buildup of risks is clear in hindsight. But many officials and commentators raised 

concerns long before the collapse.3  The long-standing internal structural weaknesses of the old 

system ultimately led to disastrous consequences for homeowners, taxpayers, the financial 

system, and the economy.   

Reforms to Date 

Before considering the path forward, it is important to acknowledge that today’s housing 

sector is healthier and in some respects safer than it was in 2005.  Although there are significant 

regional differences, national data show that housing prices have fully recovered from their gut-

wrenching 35 percent drop during the crisis.  Mortgage default rates have returned to pre-crisis 

levels.  Mortgage credit is available and affordable for strong borrowers.
