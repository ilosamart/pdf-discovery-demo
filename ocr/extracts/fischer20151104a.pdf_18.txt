between--there will be far more experience on which to base the choice of regulatory 

system, and changes will quite likely be made.28 

Finally, as I mentioned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston last month, as a 

result of the currently limited nature of the macroprudential toolkit, there could be times 

when adjustments in monetary policy itself should be discussed as a means to curb 

emerging risks to financial stability.  Alternatively, financial stability considerations can 

sometimes point to the need for accommodative monetary policy.  For example, the 

accommodative U.S. monetary policy since 2008 has helped repair the balance sheets of 

households, nonfinancial firms, and the financial sector.  The challenge to monetary 

policy independence then derives from the use of a single tool to achieve multiple 

outcomes across different time horizons.  I do not regard this challenge as a serious 

constraint on monetary policy independence, but rather as an inherent aspect of the fact 

that monetary policy works in the first instance through financial markets and financial 

institutions.    

The multifaceted nature of macroprudential policy and its interactions with the 

governance of monetary policy have important consequences that are not yet fully 

understood.  The interaction between financial stability and monetary policy, its 

implications for central bank independence, and the resulting effects on macroeconomic 

outcomes deserve extensive study that is already well under way but probably still in its 

infancy.    

                                                 
28 In the U.K. case, all responsibility for supervision of the financial sector was taken away from the Bank 
of England shortly after it was given its monetary policy independence; it was returned to the bank in the 
reforms implemented after the outbreak of the global financial crisis.
