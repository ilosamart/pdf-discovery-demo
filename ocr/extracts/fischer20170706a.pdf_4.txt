before the increase in productivity growth of 1996-2003, “the computer is everywhere 

except in the growth data.”  And there are serious researchers who have made serious 

arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data.   

Factors determining productivity growth 

Clearly, a key question for economic forecasters, and even more so for U.S. 

citizens, and indeed for the entire global economy, is whether we should anticipate a 

return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the 

quarter century after the end of World War II, or should instead resign ourselves to tepid 

economic growth in future years.  And a central policy issue is whether government 

policies can help push the economy toward a higher-productivity regime.   

In this context, it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from 

three sources, as shown in figure 2.  First, greater investment by firms in tangible 

equipment and structures, as well as “intangible” investments such as software and 

product designs, raise labor productivity.  Second, improvements in labor quality, or the 

capabilities of the workforce, contribute as well--through education, training, and 

experience.  Finally, innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs--the 

same capital and labor--such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer-aided 

product design.  I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these 

channels.  It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower 

contribution from innovation, although weaker investment has played a role as well.  The 

contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little.
