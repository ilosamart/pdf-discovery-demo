less than the Federal Reserve’s estimates of U.S. potential growth and insufficient to 

meaningfully reduce unemployment.  And indeed, as figure 4 shows, the U.S. 

unemployment rate (the solid black line) has stagnated for about eighteen months near 10 

percent of the labor force, up from about 5 percent before the crisis; the increase of 5 

percentage points in the U.S. unemployment rate is roughly double that seen in the euro 

area, the United Kingdom, Japan, or Canada.  Of some 8.4 million U.S. jobs lost between 

the peak of the expansion and the end of 2009, only about 900,000 have been restored 

thus far.  Of course, the jobs gap is presumably even larger if one takes into account the 

natural increase in the size of the working age population over the past three years.   

Of particular concern is the substantial increase in the share of unemployed 

workers who have been without work for six months or more (the dashed red line in 

figure 4).  Long-term unemployment not only imposes extreme hardship on jobless 

people and their families, but, by eroding these workers’ skills and weakening their 

attachment to the labor force, it may also convert what might otherwise be temporary 

cyclical unemployment into much more intractable long-term structural unemployment.  

In addition, persistently high unemployment, through its adverse effects on household 

income and confidence, could threaten the strength and sustainability of the recovery. 

Low rates of resource utilization in the United States are creating disinflationary 

pressures.  As shown in figure 5, various measures of underlying inflation have been 

trending downward and are currently around 1 percent, which is below the rate of 

2 percent or a bit less that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants 

judge as being most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s policy objectives in the long
