One advantage of the FOMC’s chosen approach to scaling back accommodation 

is that both the FOMC and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in 

short-term interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions.  Nonetheless, the 

post-crisis environment presented a new test to the FOMC’s ability to influence short-

term interest rates. 

Before the crisis, the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate--the rate at which 

banks with excess reserves lend to banks with a reserve need--by removing a small 

amount of reserves from the banking system.  That would translate into a higher federal 

funds rate because reserves were relatively scarce to begin with.  The intuition was 

simple:  The FOMC would signal that it was going to tighten conditions in the reserve 

market, and the cost of obtaining reserves in the market--the federal funds rate--would 

rise.  Other market interest rates would then increase accordingly.   

After the crisis, however, reserves were plentiful because the Federal Reserve 

funded its large-scale asset purchases through adding reserves to the system--crediting 

the bank accounts of those who were selling assets to the Fed.  Moreover, in light of the 

FOMC’s decision not to sell the longer-term securities it acquired, reserves were likely to 

remain plentiful for the foreseeable future.  Consequently, when the time came to remove 

accommodation, a key question for the Committee was how to raise the federal funds rate 

in an environment of abundant reserves.10  An important part of the answer to that 

question came in the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on excess reserves.  The
