horizon, however, would be most unwelcome.  Higher expected inflation would lead to higher 

nominal interest rates, increasing the financing needs of the government yet further.  Moreover, 

higher expected inflation could lead to more variable inflation outcomes and reduced living 

standards, especially for those least able to protect themselves from unexpected price 

movements.9 

Central banks must take their own counsel when deciding upon the timing and force in 

removing monetary policy accommodation.  I am confident that any attempt to influence 

inappropriately the conduct of Fed policy would yield a strong and forceful rebuke by Fed 

officials and market participants alike.  The only popularity central bankers should seek, if at all, 

is in the history books. 

The second threat, in this case to central bank credibility, may be better intentioned, but it 

is no less risky.  Some suggest that central bankers themselves should choose to modify their 

definitions of price stability.  If inflation persisted at higher levels during normal times, the 

theory goes, central bankers could cut rates more substantially in response to economic 

weakness.  The theory, in my view, fails the real test of experience.   

Central banks that desire just a little more inflation may well end up with a lot more.  

Some point to a strategy to accept a little more inflation for less unemployment as a primary 

basis for the great inflation of the 1970s in the United States.10  By definition, an increase in an 

implicit inflation target would lead to an upward shift in inflation expectations.  And how would 

a central bank make credible its promise that such a shift would be only a one-time event?
