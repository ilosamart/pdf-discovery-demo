Board staff’s economic forecast, and dozens of tables and figures.  The Board staff’s 

baseline forecast of the most likely path for the economy over the next several years is a 

judgmental one, built by staff economists using their expertise on particular sectors 

together with econometric models and other inputs.   

In addition to this baseline judgmental forecast, the staff provides model-based 

simulations of a number of alternative scenarios or risks--for instance, if the price of oil 

were to be lower, the U.S. dollar stronger, or wage growth higher than envisioned in the 

baseline projection.  These scenarios are generated using one or more of the Board’s 

macroeconomic models.  The Tealbook also includes computations of policy paths 

derived from a range of policy rules and model-based estimates of optimal policy.  That 

is to say, before our FOMC meetings, we examine analyses and forecasts produced by 

our staff as well as empirical results from a range of models--and, of course, material that 

each participant in the FOMC has gathered from his or her own research and experience. 

The second part of the Tealbook includes the specific policy options that we 

consider at the meeting.  Typically, there are three policy alternatives--A, B, and C--

ranging from dovish to hawkish, with a centrist one in between.  This part of the 

Tealbook includes an analysis of each alternative and a draft of the associated public 

statement that the FOMC would release after the conclusion of its meeting. 

Four times a year, before the March, June, September, and December FOMC 

meetings, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents submit their own projections for 

real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the 

Committee’s policy rate target, the federal funds rate.  These forecasts are released to the
