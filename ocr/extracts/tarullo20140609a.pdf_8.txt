Corporate and securities law may establish a duty of management and directors to limit 

regulatory violations, but the rationale for these duties is to protect shareholders from the 

consequences of regulatory violation, not directly to further the public regulatory objective.6 

The answer, I think, lies at least in part with the centrality and nature of risk in the 

activities of financial intermediaries.  Risk-taking--whether well- or ill-considered--is perhaps 

the central activity of all financial intermediaries.  Where those intermediaries are significantly 

leveraged and engaged in maturity transformation, the risk-taking carries substantial potential 

societal consequences beyond the possible losses to investors, counterparties, and employees of 

the financial firm.  Microprudential and macroprudential regulation each respond to this 

divergence between the private and social balances of costs and benefits associated with a given 

level of risk-taking by financial intermediaries.   

The focus of microprudential regulation is on the distortions to funding costs that may 

arise when depositors or capital markets do not require the funds they provide fully to price in 

the risks assumed by banks in using those funds, whether because of federal deposit insurance or 

expectations of a government safety net.  The focus of macroprudential regulation is on the 

negative externalities that large financial firms can impose on the rest of the economy.  In both 

instances, the private assessment by shareholders and their representatives of the risk-reward 

tradeoffs of the financial firm’s activities will differ from the public’s assessment of that risk-

reward tradeoff.  That is, while the public has an interest in healthy, profitable banks, and thus 

the interests of shareholders and the public overlap, they are not coincident.
