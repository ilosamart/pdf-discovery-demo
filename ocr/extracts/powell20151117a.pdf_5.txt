But there is still plenty of work left to do.  CCPs are implementing the 

PFMIs under the oversight of national regulators; clearing members have been 

vocal commentators on this process.  To assure that the standards are consistently 

implemented across jurisdictions and across FMIs, CPMI and IOSCO are 

conducting joint reviews of the risk-management practices of a range of global 

derivatives-clearing CCPs.  Working in conjunction with the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), they have also set 

out a detailed work plan for further enhancing the resilience, recovery planning and 

resolvability of CCPs.   

Earlier this year, CPMI-IOSCO conducted surveys of more than 30 of the 

most systemically important CCPs regarding their stress testing, margin, recovery 

planning, and loss allocation frameworks.  The survey responses have now been 

received and are being analyzed.  I expect that these exercises will result in more 

granular guidance to CCPs covering a wide set of operational areas, further helping 

to ensure consistency of implementation of the PFMIs and market infrastructure 

resilience.    

Further work on resolution is also necessary.  The FSB has conducted a 

survey on CCP resolution regimes and resolution planning within its membership, 

and found that many jurisdictions are still in the process of developing resolution
