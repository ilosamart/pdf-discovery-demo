within the subsidiaries that may “pose a threat to . . . the stability of the financial system of the 

United States.”5  Another example is section 165, which requires that the Federal Reserve 

establish a special set of prudential requirements for bank holding companies with more than $50 

billion in assets in order to “prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States 

that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities of large, 

international financial institutions.”  Similarly, the far-reaching requirement in Title VII that five 

federal financial regulators establish margin requirements for uncleared swaps written by swap 

dealers and other major market participants is intended to “offset the greater risk to the [dealers] 

and the financial system arising from the use of [uncleared] swaps.”6   

 Second, Dodd-Frank takes a number of steps to enhance the capacity of the government 

to monitor and analyze threats to financial stability.  Most prominent among these are the 

creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial 

Research (OFR).7  The FSOC is composed of ten voting and five nonvoting members – the heads 

of relevant federal offices and regulatory agencies, and three representatives of state financial 

regulators.8  As I will discuss in a moment, the FSOC as a collective entity has a limited, though 

important, direct regulatory role.  Much of its time, however, will be spent fulfilling its mandate 

from Congress to assess risks to financial stability, including – where appropriate – making 

recommendations for action to agencies under existing regulatory authority or to Congress to fill 

gaps in existing authority in response to identified systemic risks.9  The stated purpose of OFR is 

to support the FSOC and its member agencies through research, the collection and 

standardization of data, the development of tools for measuring and monitoring risk, and related 

activities.10  FSOC and OFR are each also required to make an annual report to Congress on 

financial stability.11
