could come into at play:  Any further weakening of the economy that resulted in lower 

longer-term interest rates and a still-faster pace of mortgage refinancing would likely lead 

in turn to an even more-rapid runoff of MBS from the Fed’s balance sheet.  Thus, a 

weakening of the economy might act indirectly to increase the pace of passive policy 

tightening--a perverse outcome.  In response to these concerns, the FOMC agreed to 

stabilize the quantity of securities held by the Federal Reserve by re-investing payments 

of principal on agency securities into longer-term Treasury securities.  We decided to 

reinvest in Treasury securities rather than agency securities because the Federal Reserve 

already owns a very large share of available agency securities, suggesting that 

reinvestment in Treasury securities might be more effective in reducing longer-term 

interest rates and improving financial conditions with less chance of adverse effects on 

market functioning.  Also, as I already noted, reinvestment in Treasury securities is more 

consistent with the Committee’s longer-term objective of a portfolio made up principally 

of Treasury securities.  We do not rule out changing the reinvestment strategy if 

circumstances warrant, however. 

By agreeing to keep constant the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio, 

the Committee avoided an undesirable passive tightening of policy that might otherwise 

have occurred.  The decision also underscored the Committee’s intent to maintain 

accommodative financial conditions as needed to support the recovery.  We will continue 

to monitor economic developments closely and to evaluate whether additional monetary 

easing would be beneficial.  In particular, the Committee is prepared to provide 

additional monetary accommodation through unconventional measures if it proves 

necessary, especially if the outlook were to deteriorate significantly.  The issue at this
