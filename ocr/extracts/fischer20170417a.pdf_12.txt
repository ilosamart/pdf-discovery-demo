responsive to the incoming economic data and the implications for the economic outlook.   

Standard monetary policy rules suggest that the policy rate should respond to the level of 

economic variables such as the output gap and the inflation rate.  As unexpected shocks 

hit the economy, the target level of the federal funds rate should adjust in response to 

those shocks as the FOMC adjusts the stance of policy to achieve its objectives.  Indeed, 

it is these unexpected economic shocks that give rise to the range of uncertainty around 

the median federal funds rate projection of FOMC participants, represented through fan 

charts, which was recently incorporated into the SEP.  The Federal Reserve could be too 

predictable if this type of fundamental uncertainty about the economy does not show 

through to uncertainty about the monetary policy path, which could imply that the 

Federal Reserve was not being sufficiently responsive to incoming data bearing on the 

economic outlook. 

Let me conclude with a few words on the SEP results as portrayed in the dot 

plots.  The SEP is a highly useful vehicle for providing information to market participants 

and others for whom Fed actions are important.  But we need to remind ourselves that the 

SEP data for an individual show that personâ€™s judgment of the appropriate path of future 

fed funds rates and the corresponding paths of other variables for which the SEP includes 

forecasts. 

Thus, one may say that the SEP shows the basis from which each participant in 

the FOMC discussion is likely to start.  But the task of moving from that information to 

an interest rate decision is not simple and requires a great deal of analysis and back-and-

forth among FOMC participants at each meeting.
