channels that can be grouped under the heading of securities financing transactions 

(SFTs).

  The use of such funding surely has the potential to increase again during 

periods of rapid asset appreciation and ready access to leverage.  While SFTs are an 

important and useful part of securities markets, without effective regulation they can 

create a large run risk, and thus can increase systemic problems that may develop in 

various asset and lending markets. 

The risks associated with short-term funding are as much or more 

macroprudential as they are firm-specific.  From a microprudential perspective, SFTs are 

low risk, because the borrowing is short-dated, overcollateralized, marked-to-market 

daily, and subject to remargining requirements.  Capital charges are low because credit 

risk is low.  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), recently adopted by the Basel 

Committee and soon to be implemented in the United States through a proposed 

rulemaking, is an important step forward for financial regulation, since it will be the first 

broadly applicable quantitative liquidity requirement for banking firms.  But it, too, has a 

principally microprudential focus, since it rests on the implicit premise that maturity-

matched books at individual firms present relatively low risks.   

While maturity mismatch by core intermediaries is a key financial stability risk in 

wholesale funding markets, it is not the only one.  Even if an intermediary’s book of 

securities’ financing transactions is perfectly matched, a reduction in the intermediary’s 

access to funding can force the firm to engage in asset fire sales or to abruptly withdraw 

credit from customers.  The intermediary’s customers are likely to be highly leveraged 

                                                                                                                                                 
and supervisory expectations.  But it is also true that deposits were a safe haven for many households and 

non-household investors during the crisis.  It may be that, as financial and economic conditions continue to 

normalize, households and other investors will move more deposits into other investment vehicles.
