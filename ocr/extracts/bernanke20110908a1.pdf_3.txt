ambitious domestic and international efforts under way to enhance financial regulation 

and supervision, especially for the largest and systemically most important financial 

institutions.   

Nevertheless, it is clear that the recovery from the crisis has been much less

has not returned to the level that it had attained before the crisis.  Importantly, economic 

growth over the past two years has, for the most part, been at rates insufficient to achieve 

sustained reductions in the unemployment rate, which has recently been fluctuating a bit 

above 9 percent. 

The pattern of sluggish economic growth was particularly evident in the first half 

of this year, with real gross domestic product (GDP) estimated to have increased at an
