insulate the Federal Reserve from day-to-day political pressures and to ensure that all 

parts of the country have a voice in the central bank. 

Our monetary policy committee--the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)--

meets eight times a year at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington to make decisions 

about whether to change the short-term policy rate and other aspects of monetary policy.2  

Sitting around the massive conference table will be the policymakers of the Fed--the 

members of the Board of Governors and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents.  The Board has 

a maximum of seven members, but at present, two slots are empty.  All of the Federal 

Reserve Bank presidents take part in the discussion, although only five of them have the 

vote at any one time.3 

Each Board member or Reserve Bank president has his or her own way of 

preparing for those meetings.  In the case of the Reserve Bank presidents, these 

preparations can include consultations with their boards of directors, business contacts in 

their Districts, market experts, and other sources.  Written materials are distributed to all 

FOMC participants in advance of the meeting.4  The most extensive of these materials is 

called the Tealbook, a two-part document prepared by the Board’s staff and distributed to 

Board members and Reserve Bank presidents.5 

The first part of the Tealbook contains a summary and analysis of recent 

economic and financial developments in the United States and foreign economies, the 

                                                 
2 For example, the FOMC has discussed unconventional monetary policies (large-scale asset purchases and 

forward guidance), its plans for the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation and reducing the size of 

the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet (termed “normalization”), and the operational framework used to 

implement monetary policy. 
3 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a permanent vote on the FOMC, and 4 of the 

remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. 
4 For additional details on the preparations for and organization of FOMC meetings, see Duke (2010). 
5 Before June 2010, the Tealbook was two separate books known as the Greenbook and the Bluebook, 

corresponding roughly to the first and second parts of the Tealbook, respectively.
