reasonable in one part of the country may appear
lavish in another part. Thus, the branch may
establish, in its own code/policy, a range of
dollar values, which cover the various benefits
that its officials may receive from those doing or
seeking to do business with the branch.

In addition to the exceptions discussed above,
the branch may describe other appropriate
exceptions to the general prohibition in its code
of conduct or written policy, such as those that:

• Permit acceptance of meals, refreshments,
travel arrangements, accommodations, or
entertainment, all of reasonable value and in
the course of a meeting or other occasion the
purpose of which is to hold bona fide business
discussions, provided that the expenses would
be paid for by the branch as a reasonable
business expense, if not paid for by another
party;

• Permit acceptance of loans from other branches
or financial institutions on customary terms to
finance proper and usual activities of branch
officials, such as home mortgage loans, except
where prohibited by law;

• Permit acceptance of advertising or promo-
tional material of reasonable value, such as
pens, pencils, note pads, key chains, calen-
dars, and similar items;

• Permit acceptance of discounts or rebates on
merchandise or services that do not exceed
those available to other customers;

• Permit acceptance of gifts of reasonable value
that are related to commonly recognized events
or occasions, such as a promotion, new job,
wedding, retirement, Christmas, or bar or bat
mitzvah;

• Permit the acceptance of civic, charitable,
educational, or religious organizational awards
for recognition of service and accomplishment.

A serious threat to the branch’s integrity
occurs when its officials become involved in
outside business interests or employment that
give rise to a conflict of interest. Such conflicts
of interest may evolve into corrupt transactions
that are covered under this Act. Accordingly, the
branch is encouraged to prohibit in its code/
policy, branch officials from self-dealing or
otherwise trading on their positions with the
branch or accepting a business opportunity from
someone doing or seeking to do business with
the branch, which is not available to other
persons or which is made available to the branch

official because of such person’s position with
the branch.

If the value of the item or benefit offered or
received exceeds $100, the offense is a felony
punishable by up to thirty years imprisonment
and a fine of up to $1,000,000 or three times the
value of the bribe or gratuity, whichever is
greater. If value does not exceed $100, the
offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to
one year imprisonment and a maximum fine of
$1,000.

Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The function of the Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury is to promulgate and administer regu-
lations dealing with the economic sanctions that
the U.S. government imposes against certain
foreign countries, against the nationals of those
countries, and against the specially designated
nationals of those countries. Under the Interna-
tional Emergency Economic Powers Act, the
President can impose sanctions such as trade
embargoes, freezing of assets, import sur-
charges, etc. These sanctions usually entail the
freezing of a country’s assets and are politically
motivated. Branches must block funds transfers
that (1) are remitted by or on behalf of a blocked
individual or entity; (2) are remitted to or
through a blocked entity; or (3)are remitted in
connection with a transaction in which a blocked
individual or entity has an interest. If a branch in
the U.S. receives instructions to make a payment
that falls into one of these categories, it is
required to execute the payment order and place
the funds into a blocked account. A payment
order cannot be canceled or amended after the
U.S. branch has received it. Once assets or funds
are blocked, they may be released only by
specific authorization from the U.S. Treasury.

A ‘‘specially designated national’’ is a person
or entity who acts on behalf of one of those
countries under economic sanction by the U.S.
The designation is done by the U.S. Secretary of
State. Dealing with such nationals is prohibited.
Moreover, their assets or accounts in the U.S. are
frozen. In certain cases, however, the Treasury
Department can issue a license to a designated
national. This license can then be presented by
the customer to the institution, allowing the
institution to debit his/her account. The license
can be either general or specific. The general
