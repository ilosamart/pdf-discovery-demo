agreements often impose specific requirements rather than simply facilitating structured data 

feeds.  These banks negotiate for greater control over their systems by limiting who is accessing 

their data--often to a specific third party’s suite of products.  Likewise, many banks use these 

agreements to limit what types of data will be shared.  For instance, banks may share information 

about the balances in consumers’ accounts but decline to share information about fees or other 

pricing.  While recognizing the legitimate need for vetting of third parties for purposes of the 

banks fulfilling their responsibilities, including for data privacy and security, some consumer 

groups have suggested that the standards for vetting should be commonly agreed to and 

transparent to ensure that banks do not restrict access for competitive reasons and that consumers 

should be able to decide what data to make available to third-party fintech applications.20  

A third set of banks may be unable or unwilling to provide permissioned access, for 

reasons ranging from fears about increased competition to concerns about the cost and 

complexity of ensuring compliance with underlying laws and regulations.  At the very least, 

banks may have reasonable concerns about being able to see, if not control, which third-party 

developers will have access to the banking data that is provided by the data aggregators.  

Accordingly, even banks that have previously provided structured data feeds to data aggregators 

may decide to limit or block access.21  In such cases, however, data aggregators can still move
