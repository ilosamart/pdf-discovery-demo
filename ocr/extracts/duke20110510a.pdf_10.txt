believe that conditions are improving for small businesses.  Although no definitive data 

source exists, the combination of a variety of recent survey results paints a picture of 

increasing optimism about future sales and business conditions and a corresponding 

easing of credit availability for small businesses.10  While this upward trend is 

encouraging, the Fed is continuing to look for ideas that will help small businesses as 

they work through some of the more subtle issues constraining their overall growth.   

Going forward, we will coordinate a series of regional forums for financial 

institutions and CDFIs on the use and deployment of small business programs authorized 

in the Small Business Jobs Act and on sharing information about issues and successful 

practices at a national level.  The forums are being organized with participation from the 

Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), the trade organization for CDFIs; the SBA; the 

Treasury; the CDFI Fund; and our partner regulatory agencies.  In addition to providing 

information to regional forum participants, we will seek to use these forums to gather 

information on best practices, trends, and any barriers to the successful implementation of 

these federal programs.  This year’s work will culminate with a November conference at 

the Board of Governors, in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, to
