the Phillips curve” scenario.16  As I mentioned, the FOMC carefully monitors a wide 

array of early indicators of inflation pressure to evaluate this risk.  Wages and 

compensation data are one important source of information.  These measures have picked 

up some recently, but in a way that is quite welcome.  Specifically, the rise in wages is 

broadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth 

and therefore does not point to an overheating labor market.  Further, higher wage growth 

alone need not be inflationary.  The late 1990s episode of low unemployment saw wages 

rise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation.  

Despite what shows up in the aggregate wage and compensation data, however, I 

am sure that, like us, many of you are hearing widespread anecdotes about labor 

shortages and increasing bottlenecks in production.  For example, as shown in figure 7, 

the words “shortage” and “bottleneck” are increasingly appearing in the Beige Book, the 

Federal Reserve’s report summarizing discussions with our business contacts around the 

country.17  The message we are hearing in our conversations is supported by a wide range 

of more conventional measures.  For example, the survey of members of the National 

Federation of Independent Business finds firms increasingly reporting that job openings 

are hard to fill (figure 8).  Further, these businesses now list “quality of labor” as their 

most important problem, as opposed to the more typical report of “poor sales.”   

We review a wide variety of measures of this type, and these indicators show 

what I think most business people see:  an economy operating with limited slack.  Notice, 

                                                 
16 Gordon (2018) presents one version of the revenge hypothesis. 
17 The length of the Beige Book has varied somewhat over time; for example, the Beige Book was 
redesigned in 2017, with the number of words reduced about 10 percent.  It is unclear whether the number 
of important words like “shortage” would have been affected by that redesign, but if so, it would go in the 
direction of holding down the observed recent increase.
