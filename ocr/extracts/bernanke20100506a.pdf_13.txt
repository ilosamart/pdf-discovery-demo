emphasis placed on stress testing by the international Senior Supervisors Group.4  I noted 

then that stress tests are a good way to augment models and other standard quantitative 

techniques for risk management.  And they force bankers to think through the 

implications of scenarios that may seem relatively unlikely but could pose serious risks if 

those scenarios materialized.  Stress tests must be an integral part of firms’ processes for 

ensuring their capital is adequate.  Importantly, to conduct effective stress tests, banks 

need to have systems that can quickly and accurately assess their risks under alternative 

scenarios.  During the SCAP, we found considerable differences last year across firms in 

their ability to do that.  It is essential that every complex firm be able to evaluate its 

firmwide exposures in a timely way.  One of the benefits of the stress testing 

methodology is that it provides a check on the quality of firms’ information systems.   

As I discussed, one reason for the success of the stress tests was the public 

disclosure of the results.  We are evaluating the lessons of the experience for our 

disclosure policies.  The traditional supervisory view has been that confidentiality 

enhances the willingness of institutions to cooperate with supervisors and reduces the risk 

that a limited set of adverse findings might be over-interpreted by market participants.  

Nevertheless, in proper context, more information about the status of both individual 

banks and of the banking system as a whole should be confidence-enhancing.  We will 

continue to examine options for increasing the information that supervisors make public. 

Conclusion 

Last year’s stress assessment was a watershed event--unprecedented in scale and 

scope, as well as in the range of information we made public on the projected losses and
