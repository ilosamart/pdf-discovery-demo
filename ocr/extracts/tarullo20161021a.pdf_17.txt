law course was provided by the famous Corrigan/Aspinwall debate on whether banks were 

“special.”9  One could note, for example, that Aspinwall’s observation that banks were becoming 

less special might have suggested that other forms of intermediaries should be more regulated, 

rather than the implication that banks should be less regulated.  Indeed, my rereading of the 

companion pieces suggests that despite--or maybe because of--the fact that the debate is now 

more than 30 years old, it might profitably introduce a course that ventures well beyond 

traditional banking regulation, by its invitation to consider why we regulate in the first place. 

Conclusion 

I began teaching in this area just as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was culminating three 

decades of bank deregulation.  At the time, I suggested to students that the regulation of banking 

organizations was in an unstable equilibrium.  While I initially meant the adjective mostly to 

refer to doctrine, it became progressively more applicable to the financial system itself.  The 

implementation of the regulatory aims established after the crisis, along with the inevitable 

refinements of what has already been done, will continue to play out for some time.  The upshot, 

I think, is both an unusually important time to be researching and writing in this area and an 

unusually challenging time to be teaching it.  This conference has been an excellent occasion for 

helping to shape both a research agenda and a new pedagogy.
