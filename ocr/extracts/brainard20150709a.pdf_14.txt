percent of total assets in 2009. And while some of the U.S. systemic banking institutions have 

reduced their capital markets activity, they remain the largest dealers in those markets.  

To be fair, we are entering an important period when the more stringent standards that we 

are putting in place to reduce expected losses to the system should inform the cost-benefit 

analysis of these institutionsâ€™ size and structure. As standards for systemically important firms 

tighten, some institutions may determine that it is in the best interest of their stakeholders to 

reduce their systemic footprint. Indeed, there already have been some notable structural changes 

at a few of the largest institutions over the past few years that are not readily apparent from 

looking at the aggregate assets across the systemic institutions.   But it is also possible that some 

may judge that the economies of scale and scope are such that it makes sense to maintain their 

systemic footprint, even at the expense of the greater regulatory burdens necessary to protect the 

system relative to those faced by their non-systemic competitors.  

One thing we can all agree is that we have a more resilient and dynamic financial system 

as a result of having a very large number of banking organizations, in different size classes, 

pursuing different business models. Indeed, that diversity is one of the hallmarks of the U.S. 

system, which distinguishes it from many other advanced economies. Accordingly, we want to 

make sure that our regulatory framework supports banks in the middle of the size spectrum, as 

well as community banks, and the customers they serve.  Thus, by the same rationale that argues 

for the greater stringency of the standards associated with greater systemic risk at the top end of 

the scale and complexity spectrum, we will carefully examine opportunities to ease burdens at 

the lower end of the spectrum. And we will want to continue to refine our regulatory standards, 

using the authorities under Dodd-Frank to make sure they are tailored to be commensurate with 

the risk to the system.
