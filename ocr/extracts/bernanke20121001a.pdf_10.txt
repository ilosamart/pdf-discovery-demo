Administration will soon have to address the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of 

sharply higher taxes and reduced spending that is set to happen at the beginning of the 

year.  According to the Congressional Budget Office and virtually all other experts, if that 

were allowed to occur, it would likely throw the economy back into recession.  The 

Congress and the Administration will also have to raise the debt ceiling to prevent the 

Treasury from defaulting on its obligations, an outcome that would have extremely 

negative consequences for the country for years to come.  Achieving these fiscal goals 

would be even more difficult if monetary policy were not helping support the economic 

recovery. 

What Is the Risk that the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Will Lead to 
Inflation? 
 
 A third question, and an important one, is whether the Federal Reserve’s 

monetary policy will lead to higher inflation down the road.  In response, I will start by 

pointing out that the Federal Reserve’s price stability record is excellent, and we are fully 

committed to maintaining it.  Inflation has averaged close to 2 percent per year for 

several decades, and that’s about where it is today.  In particular, the low interest rate 

policies the Fed has been following for about five years now have not led to increased 

inflation.  Moreover, according to a variety of measures, the public’s expectations of 

inflation over the long run remain quite stable within the range that they have been for 

many years.  

With monetary policy being so accommodative now, though, it is not 

unreasonable to ask whether we are sowing the seeds of future inflation.  A related 

question I sometimes hear--which bears also on the relationship between monetary and 

fiscal policy, is this:  By buying securities, are you “monetizing the debt”--printing
