workers are scarce, and so are welcome developments from the perspective of job 

creation and retention.  All of our Fed Listens events are being conducted with a high 

degree of transparency.  (You can view videos of the events or read the summaries on our 

website.) 

In coming regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, we will begin our own 

assessment of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, 

informed by what we heard at the conference and during our listening sessions in the 

Federal Reserve Districts and by the work of our staff.  When the Committee tackles 

important issues, we take the time for wide-ranging and candid discussions, and so I 

expect our deliberations will continue over several meetings for the remainder of this 

year.  We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review, 

likely during the first half of next year. 

Concluding Thoughts 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict 

our ultimate finding.  What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to 

our framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to 

achieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
