  I want to thank you all for coming today, and I also want to thank the Alternative 

Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) for all its work in developing its interim report.  This report 

marks a new stage in reference rate reform.1  Reference benchmarks are a key part of the 

financial infrastructure.  About $300 trillion dollars in contracts reference LIBOR alone.  But 

benchmarks were not given much consideration prior to the recent scandals involving attempts to 

manipulate them.  Since then, the official sector has thought seriously about financial 

benchmarks, conducting a number of investigations into charges of manipulation, publishing the 

International Organization of Securities Commission’s (IOSCO) Principles for Financial 

Benchmarks and, through the Financial Stability Board (FSB), sponsoring major reform efforts 

of both interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks.2  The institutions represented on the 

ARRC have also had to think seriously about these issues as they have developed this interim 

report.  Now, we need end users to begin to think more seriously about how they use benchmarks 

and the risks they are taking on by relying so heavily on a reference rate--in this case U.S. dollar 

LIBOR--that is less resilient than it needs to be.   

In saying this, I want to make it clear that LIBOR has been significantly improved.  ICE 

Benchmark Administration is in the process of making important changes to its methodology, 

and submissions to LIBOR are now regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 

Authority.  However, the term money market borrowing by banks that underlies U.S. dollar 

LIBOR has experienced a secular decline.  As a result, the majority of U.S. dollar LIBOR 

submissions must still rely on expert judgement, and even those submissions that are transaction-
