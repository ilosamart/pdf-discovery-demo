On behalf of my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System, I want to 

thank you for joining us today.  As educators, your work is critical to our economy and 

our nation.  Well-prepared students make for a productive and innovative workforce and 

a well-functioning democracy.  

The economist Alfred Marshall said that economics is the study of people in the 

ordinary business of life.1  What could be more fundamental?  Learning about economics 

helps students understand how the decisions of millions of people about what to produce 

and consume determine what Adam Smith called “the wealth of nations”--our living 

standards.2

I am sure that your students have been eager to understand the economic and 

financial events of the past few years.  The recent financial crisis was among the most 

profound challenges to economic and financial stability since the Great Depression, and 

its causes and its ultimate remedies have been, and will continue to be, widely debated.  

The study of economics will allow your students to join the debate in a responsible and 

informed way.  

  In particular, economics helps students understand both the strengths and the 

shortcomings of our market-based economic system.  

One of the key lessons of the recent financial crisis is the importance of personal 

financial literacy.  Many of you teach your students the skills necessary to make good 

financial decisions.  Your efforts are of paramount importance in helping students 

understand how to save for the future and how to invest their money to make it grow.  In 

retrospect, some of the people who were hurt the most during the crisis borrowed money 

that they should not have borrowed and signed financial contracts they should not have

signed.  Today, students need a solid understanding of the benefits and risks of borrowing 

money to buy a car or a home, and of the effect that too much credit card debt can have 

on their finances.  Besides improving their personal financial decisionmaking, teaching 

your students economic principles will help them as citizens understand and make 

choices about many of the critical issues confronting our nation.  

The Federal Reserve works hard to advance financial literacy and economic 

education--both through our own programs and by working with other organizations.3  

Our financial education website provides easy access to free educational materials, a 

resource search engine for teachers, and games for students of various ages and 

knowledge levels.4

Thank you for accepting the invitation to join us in this conversation.  I appreciate 

the time you are spending away from personal and professional commitments to be with 

us.  And, as a central banker, economist, educator, and parent, I thank you for your work.  

I also applaud the ongoing partnerships between regional Reserve Banks and educators, 

  Some Reserve Banks offer economic and financial education 

workshops for teachers, and several Reserve Banks periodically provide lessons in 

personal finance to middle school and high school students.  A number of the Reserve 

Banks also run academic competitions for middle school, high school, and college 

students, such as the Fed Challenge, Econ Bowl, and essay contests.  And some Reserve 

Banks have opened learning centers or museums in their lobbies that feature interactive 

exhibits and related educational programs.  Teachers tell us that visits to these centers 

have provided their students with valuable learning experiences. 

                                                           
3 Our partners include groups such as JumpStart, Junior Achievement, the Council for Economic 
Education, the National Endowment for Financial Education, and the American Savings Education 
Council.

and I would like to express my appreciation to the Federal Reserve staff for their work in 

coordinating our discussion today.   

I look forward to your questions.
