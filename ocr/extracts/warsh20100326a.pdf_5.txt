Fed’s longevity should not allow our memories to fail us on its origin and the scope of its remit.  

Let me explain.   

The grant of authority to the central bank is a considered judgment of the nation’s elected 

representatives.  Central bankers are entrusted with a revocable privilege.  So, declarations of 

independence by Fed policymakers are heartening.  But independence is ours to demonstrate, not 

principally to declare.  And central bankers err if they presume that independence is some 

inalienable right, some entitlement.   

A misconception on the nature of the central bank’s authority gives succor to Fed critics.  

The Fed is not independent from government.  It is independent within government.  And elected 

representatives have every right to redraw the central bank’s authority, even if a fuller reading of 

economic history considers it unwise. 

The Federal Reserve’s defenders also err if they seek to extend the Fed’s vaunted 

independence to the full range of its activities.  My reading has it that the Congress granted the 

Fed independence in the conduct of monetary policy.  In my view, no particular deference is 

owed--no promise of non-intervention due--in the conduct of regulatory policy, consumer 

protection, or other responsibilities granted to the Federal Reserve.  This sharp distinction should 

be sustained as the Congress considers revisions to the Federal Reserve’s charter.  

So, delineating that which constitutes the conduct of monetary policy--as distinct from 

these other activities--is critical.  In normal times, there is less confusion.  The Fed establishes 

short-term, risk-free interest rates across the economy.  And it does its level best to signal the 

appropriate path of policy to ensure low and stable prices and maximum employment over the 

horizon.  The Fed’s lender of last resort authority manifests itself--usually only sparingly--in the 

operation of the discount window, lending against good collateral at a penalty rate.
