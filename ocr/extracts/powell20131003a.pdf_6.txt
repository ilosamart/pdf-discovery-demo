relationships between small businesses and their lenders.  Kandrac’s finding of no conflict is 

reassuring for those of us charged with both encouraging economic growth and enforcing 

antitrust statutes. 

The Kelly, Khayum, and Price paper notes that there has been more emphasis in recent 

years on the challenges facing community banks than on the opportunities available to them.  

Given the success that community banks have enjoyed in lending to small businesses, this paper 

explores the possibility that these institutions could expand their involvement in business 

equipment leasing, a potential growth area that community banks might want to investigate.  The 

authors find that community banks that are actively involved in lease financing are more 

profitable and efficient than other community banks. 

This morning’s first session on community bank performance highlighted the 

heterogeneity of community banks.  The Shen and Hartarska paper notes that while use of 

financial derivatives by community banks has increased rapidly in recent years, only about one 

in six community banks were active users of derivatives markets in 2012.  Shen and Hartarska 

estimate that community banks could improve their profitability and reduce their risk of default 

through increased use of derivatives.  They also point out that implementation of the Dodd-Frank 

Act--in particular the Volcker rule--could prevent the realization of these gains, although I 

should note that the Volcker rule includes an exception for hedging activities that is intended to 

allow banking organizations of all sizes to appropriately manage their risks.  This is an important 

point to bear in mind.  I believe we are doing so in drafting the regulation and that 

implementation of the Volcker Rule should not prevent community banks from using derivatives 

to manage their risks in a safe and sound manner.
