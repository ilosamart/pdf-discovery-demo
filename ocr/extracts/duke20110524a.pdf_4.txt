that in 2009 and 2010, the proportions of men and women claiming social security 

benefits at age 62 began to rise again after several years of decline.  Workers have either 

chosen to leave the work force early in the last few years or, more likely, have applied for 

social security benefits as early as possible because of the weak job market.1  Opting to 

receive a smaller social security annuity earlier in life is just one of many hard decisions 

Americans have had to make in order to balance their short-term and long-term financial 

needs.   

The recession has clearly disrupted the future expectations and financial plans of 

millions of Americans, but even in the best of circumstances, effectively managing oneâ€™s 

longevity risk requires a level of financial knowledge well beyond that required of any

percentages dropped to 42 percent for men and 48 percent for women (i.e., both men and women were 
staying in the labor force longer) through 2008; in 2009 and 2010, these proportions rose again, to 43.6 
percent and 49.0 percent respectively. Social Security Administration Annual Statistical Supplement, 2007
