stable prices.  The exceptionally low rates help offset the lingering restraining effects on 

economic activity and prices discussed earlier. 

In due course, as these restraints abate and the expansion matures, we will need to 

withdraw monetary stimulus to prevent the development of inflationary pressures.  As in past 

cycles, our decision to begin tightening will be based not on a particular indicator or small set of 

indicators, but rather on forecasts of economic activity and inflation that take account of all 

available information.  We will want to make sure the economy has enough forward momentum 

to continue absorbing the unused resources and to limit disinflationary pressure.  But we will 

also want to be sure that we haven’t left highly accommodative policy in place so long that 

economic and financial conditions become conducive to future inflation.  Given the lags in the 

effects of monetary policy, that means we will not be able to wait until the unemployment rate is 

down close to its long-term level.   

We will be watching inflation and inflation expectations carefully.   Inflation 

expectations have been stable, and I expect them to remain so.  Still, one risk is that, in line with 

past behavior, expectations could follow actual inflation down, imparting additional downward 

momentum to actual inflation.  However, another risk is that expectations could increase, 

perhaps reflecting concerns about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet or the federal budget 

deficit.  For the moment, the public seems confident that the Fed will keep inflation stable over 

time.  We do not take that trust for granted:  We monitor inflationary developments closely and 

stand ready to respond quickly and vigorously should the need arise. 

Although the framework for deciding when and how fast to tighten monetary policy will 

not differ conceptually from the framework used in the past, our decision this time has some 

added complexities.  In particular, our assets and the corresponding bank reserves are far larger
