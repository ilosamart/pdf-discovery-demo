instability can emerge when inflation is under control.  Some have argued for inclusion of 

a financial stability term into policy rules, but the issue is far from settled.31 

To conclude, I think it’s fair to say that simple policy rules are widely thought to 

be both interesting and useful, but to represent only a small part of the analysis needed to 

assess the appropriate path for policy.  I am unable to think of any critical, complex 

human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation.  In particular, 

no major central bank uses policy rules in a prescriptive way, and it is hard to predict the 

consequences of requiring the FOMC to do so, as some have proposed.  Policy should be 

systematic, but not automatic.
