Although its founding statute makes no explicit mention of financial stability, the 

Federal Reserve was created in response to a severe financial panic, and safeguarding 

financial stability is deeply ingrained in the mission and culture of the Federal Reserve 

Board. Today, financial stability is more important than ever to the work of the Federal

strengthening our financial stability capabilities.1   

In carrying out the work of financial stability, the Federal Reserve is seen as the 

agency with the broadest sight lines across the economy and one that has some important 

stability tools, as well as a critical first responder when a crisis hits.  But the Federal

supervisor of banks and bank holding companies2 in a system with large capital markets, 

several independent agencies have responsibilities for regulation of nonbank financial 

intermediaries and markets, and no U.S. agency yet has access to complete data regarding 

bank and nonbank financial activities.

tools under its authority, which means placing a strong emphasis on structural resilience 

in the largest and most complex institutions, while strengthening less tested time-varying 

tools to lean against the buildup of risks and, in some circumstances, looking to the

cooperate closely with other regulators to develop well-rehearsed working protocols and
