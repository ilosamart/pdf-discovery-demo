States, we will have the benefit of experience for this tool from other countries.  Over the 

past year, the Norges Bank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the Financial Policy 

Committee at the Bank of England have all finalized general statements on how this 

policy lever will operate in their jurisdictions, with implementation in each case 

proceeding in advance of when the policy will come into effect under Basel III.12  

Moreover, in December, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance accepted the advice of the 

Norges Bank to activate a countercyclical capital buffer in the face of rising financial 

imbalances.  The level of the buffer will be set at 1 percent of risk-weighted assets, 

starting July 1, 2015.13 

 The foregoing discussion has considered the ways in which existing supervisory 

authority and new forms of macroprudential authority may allow monetary policymakers 

to avoid, or at least defer, raising interest rates to contain growing systemic risks under 

circumstances in which policy is falling well short of achieving one or both elements of 

the dual mandate.  However, as has doubtless been apparent, I believe these alternative 

policy instruments have real limitations.  As I noted earlier, I do not think that at present 

we are confronted with a situation that would warrant a change in the monetary policy we 

have been pursuing.  But for that very reason, now is a good time to consider these issues 

more actively.  One useful step would be development of a framework that would allow 

us to make a more analytic, less instinctual judgment on the potential tradeoffs between
