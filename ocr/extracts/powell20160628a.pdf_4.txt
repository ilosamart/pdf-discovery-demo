factors, including the age structure of the population and individuals’ perceptions of the 

availability of jobs. 

Participation rose steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s as increasing 

numbers of women entered the formal workforce.  That process ran its course, and, 

around the year 2000, participation began a gradual decline because of population aging 

and the continuation of other long-term trends, particularly the decline in participation 

among prime age males.  From 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3 

percentage points, but has remained about flat, on net, since late 2013 in a context of 

strong job growth and declining unemployment.  Economists estimate that, as the 

population ages, participation will naturally tend to decline at a trend rate of about 0.2 

percentage point per year, so this period of flat participation actually represents an 

improvement against the post-crisis cyclical drop.  Today, participation is near its longer-

run trend as estimated by a group of Fed economists whose work is widely cited on these 

issues.2  Some other estimates suggest that there is still a shortfall in participation, and, of 

course, estimates of the trend participation rate are surrounded by fairly wide bands of 

uncertainty.  I am inclined to believe that there are potential workers at the margins of the 

labor market who will return as the recovery continues, the labor market tightens further 

and wages increase.  The U.S. participation rate for workers in the 25-54 age group is 

now below those of most other advanced economies, including the U.K., France and 

Germany, for example.
