for growth in the labor force.  Moreover, we cannot yet be sure that the recent pace of 

improvement in the labor market will be sustained.  Notably, an examination of recent 

deviations from Okunâ€™s law suggests that the recent decline in the unemployment rate 

may reflect, at least in part, a reversal of the unusually large layoffs that occurred during 

late 2008 and over 2009.  To the extent that this reversal has been completed, further 

significant improvements in the unemployment rate will likely require a more-rapid 

expansion of production and demand from consumers and businesses, a process that can 

be supported by continued accommodative policies. 

I also discussed long-term unemployment today, arguing that cyclical rather than 

structural factors are likely the primary source of its substantial increase during the 

recession.  If this assessment is correct, then accommodative policies to support the 

economic recovery will help address this problem as well.  We must watch long-term 

unemployment especially carefully, however.  Even if the primary cause of high long-

term unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand, if progress in reducing 

unemployment is too slow, the long-term unemployed will see their skills and labor force 

attachment atrophy further, possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one. 

If this hypothesis is wrong and structural factors are in fact explaining much of 

the increase in long-term unemployment, then the scope for countercyclical policies to 

address this problem will be more limited.  Even if that proves to be the case, however, 

we should not conclude that nothing can be done.  If structural factors are the 

predominant explanation for the increase in long-term unemployment, it will become 

even more important to take the steps needed to ensure that workers are able to obtain the 

skills needed to meet the demands of our rapidly changing economy.
