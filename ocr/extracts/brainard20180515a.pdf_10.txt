organization in the financial markets.  Although the governance arrangements may need to 

evolve over time, one thing that is clear is that strong governance arrangements will be required 

to provide the coordinated operational and financial risk management for the critical clearing and 

settlement operations that underpin our financial markets.          

In addition, the industry continues to make progress on the ability of distributed ledger 

technology to handle the very large volumes of transactions that take place both in financial 

markets and in retail payments every day.  As I highlighted in 2016, this technical challenge of 

achieving the necessary scale and through put is an important hurdle.9  Much of this challenge 

has been tied to the time it takes to achieve “consensus” on a distributed ledger.  Consensus is 

the process by which new transactions are broadcast to all the participants, or nodes, in the 

network and each node accepts those new transactions as valid additions to the ledger.  The 

initial consensus method used by Bitcoin, called “proof of work,” is designed to deal with the 

lack of information and trust among the users of the network by providing tools and incentives to 

overcome this problem. But it is a highly resource-intensive process that limits the number of 

transactions that can be processed each second.  The proof of work consensus model represents a 

tradeoff between operational efficiency and scalability, on the one hand, and the ability to 

operate without sufficient trust or information about the entities in the network, on the other 

hand. 

Fundamentally, however, the financial industry does not operate as a trustless network.  

Rather, the industry has long specialized in the collection and analysis of information about
