She reported that her main reason for participating in the gig economy is to be home with 

her daughter.   

Many others find themselves in highly variable work arrangements not by 

preference but because of the requirements of their employers.  As employers have 

outsourced noncore tasks to contract firms and moved to technologically enabled “just-

in-time” scheduling of employees, contract workers and on-call workers have had to 

adjust to variable and sometimes unpredictable hours.  

As these stories indicate, there are a variety of reasons workers engage in 

alternative and nonstandard work arrangements.  Many individuals use the flexibility and 

enhanced connectivity of new technology-enabled platforms to pursue expanded 

opportunities.  While some supplement their traditional job, using their free time to earn 

extra income, others cobble together contingent work arrangements or gigs to generate 

necessary income in the absence of traditional work opportunities.  Still others move into 

contingent work arrangements due to their employers’ work requirements.  While some 

workers seem to appreciate the greater opportunities contingent work arrangements 

provide, others engage in this work out of necessity because they appear unable to obtain 

a full-time traditional work arrangement that meets their needs.  Overall, the Upwork 

study finds that 63 percent of freelancers say they are pursuing this type of work by 

choice, while 37 percent do it out of necessity.  It is unclear whether this outcome would 

hold true of the more tightly defined population in the Katz and Krueger survey.
