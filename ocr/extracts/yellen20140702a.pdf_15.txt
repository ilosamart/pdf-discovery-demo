Second, policymakers must carefully monitor evolving risks to the financial 

system and be realistic about the ability of macroprudential tools to influence these 

developments.  The limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks 

to emerge outside sectors subject to regulation, the potential for supervision and 

regulation to miss emerging risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools 

such as a countercyclical capital buffer, and the potential for such policy steps to be 

delayed or to lack public support.14  Given such limitations, adjustments in monetary 

policy may, at times, be needed to curb risks to financial stability.15 

These first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial 

stability risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are weighing 

such risks in the setting of monetary policy.  Because these issues are both new and 

complex, there is no simple rule that can prescribe, even in a general sense, how 

monetary policy should adjust in response to shifts in the outlook for financial stability.  

As a result, policymakers should clearly and consistently communicate their views on the 

stability of the financial system and how those views are influencing the stance of 

monetary policy.  

To that end, I will briefly lay out my current assessment of financial stability risks 

and their relevance, at this time, to the stance of monetary policy in the United States.  In 

recent years, accommodative monetary policy has contributed to low interest rates, a flat

housing prices experience swings for reasons not driven by “fundamentals.”  In this context, adjustments in 
monetary policy in response to house price booms--even if such adjustments lead to undesirable inflation or 
employment outcomes--are a component of optimal monetary policy.  See Klaus Adam and Michael
