Institutional Considerations 

 While the analytics of shadow banking, or nonbank intermediation more generally, lean 

toward a case-by-case balancing of risks and economic benefits, significant institutional issues 

also need to be addressed.  Today I will mention only two.  

First is the issue of what form of regulation is appropriate once analysis suggests that a 

response is needed.  By authorizing the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to 

designate nonbanks as systemically important institutions, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 

and Consumer Protection Act fills the gap that existed in the pre-crisis period, when firms like 

Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG largely escaped the perimeter of prudential regulation.  

Designation by FSOC places firms under the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve 

Board.  While the Board can shape the particulars of its oversight to the nature of each 

designated firm, the statute requires liquidity standards, risk management standards, resolution 

plans, and concentration limits, with the additional strong presumption of capital standards. 

 As important as the designation authority is to preclude the Lehmans or AIGs of the 

future, it is almost surely not the optimal regulatory approach for most activities that can be 

characterized as shadow banking or that are conducted by nonbank intermediaries so as to raise 

financial stability concerns.  The vast majority of firms engaged in such activities will not satisfy 

the statutory test for designation.  In any case, it is unclear that all of the statutory prudential 

requirements for designated firms would be necessary or appropriate in dealing with the risks to 

financial stability posed by the activities of these firms.  In many instances, and especially where 

funding vulnerabilities are at the heart of a business model, it is the activity itself that needs to be 

regulated in some way, whether there are a few large firms involved or many smaller ones.
