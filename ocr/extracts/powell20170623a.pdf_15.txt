balances at the Federal Reserve helps them avoid some of the risk involved in holding balances 

with their clearing members.  Doing so also provides CCPs with a flexible way to hold balances 

on days when margin payments unexpectedly spike and it is difficult to find banks that are 

willing to accept an unexpected influx in deposits.  In such a case, it may also be too late in the 

day to rely on the repo market.  The availability of Fed accounts could help avoid potential 

market disruptions in those types of circumstances. 


Cross-Border Cooperation 

The lessons from Brexit also point to the need for cross-border cooperation.  Brexit 

triggered payments flows to CCPs across many jurisdictions.  As far as liquidity risks are 

concerned, it is immaterial whether a CCP is based in the United States or abroad so long as it 

clears U.S. dollar denominated assets and must make and receive U.S. dollar payments.   There 

are different possible approaches to such cross-border issues.  Efforts to address these liquidity 

risks should carefully take into consideration the effect that they would have on the broader 

financial system.  For example, splintering central clearing by currency area would fragment 

liquidity and reduce netting opportunities, which in the case of events like Brexit could actually 

trigger even greater liquidity risk.  In my opinion, we should be searching for cooperative 

solutions to these issues. 


Conclusion 

In the years following the financial crisis, one of the primary lessons for market 

participants and their regulators was the criticality of liquidity risk management.  Financial firms
