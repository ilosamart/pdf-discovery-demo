credit growth could depress employment and potentially trigger a sharp correction in 

financial markets.   

These limitations should lead us to be circumspect regarding the use of monetary 

policy as a tool to address financial stability risks, perhaps viewing it as a second line of 

defense.  But it is equally important to acknowledge the potential utility of monetary 

policy for addressing risks to financial stability and to the broader economy and to 

continue expanding our work on the appropriate role of financial stability in our 

monetary policy framework. 

Conclusion 

In sum, while the Federal Reserve has an inherent responsibility for financial 

stability, it has an incomplete set of authorities and a limited regulatory perimeter in a 

financial system that has large capital markets and a fragmented regulatory structure.  It 

is therefore important that we actively utilize the tools under our authorityâ€”which place 

particular emphasis on building structural resilience at the largest, most complicated 

institutions through tougher through-the-cycle standards, along with broad 

countercyclical measures to limit the buildup, and potential consequences, of risks to 

financial stability, while exploring the design of time-varying sector-specific tools, and, 

at times, looking to monetary policy as a powerful tool that unlike any other operates 

across the entire financial system.
