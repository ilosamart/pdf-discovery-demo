I’d like to talk today about one important element of the international regulatory 

reform agenda--namely, liquidity regulation.1  Liquidity regulation is a relatively new, 

post-crisis addition to the financial stability toolkit.  Key elements include the Liquidity 

Coverage Ratio (LCR), which was recently finalized by the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision, and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, which is still a work in progress.  In what 

follows, I will focus on the LCR. 

The stated goal of the LCR is straightforward, even if some aspects of its design 

are less so.  In the words of the Basel Committee, “The objective of the LCR is to 

promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks.  It does this by 

ensuring that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets 

(HQLA) that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to 

meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario.”2  In other 

words, each bank is required to model its total outflows over 30 days in a liquidity stress 

event and then to hold HQLA sufficient to accommodate those outflows.  This 

requirement is implemented with a ratio test, where modeled outflows go in the 

denominator and the stock of HQLA goes in the numerator; when the ratio equals or 

exceeds 100 percent, the requirement is satisfied. 

The Basel Committee issued the first version of the LCR in December 2010.  In 

January of this year, the committee issued a revised final version of the LCR, following 

an endorsement by its governing body, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision

conversations and suggestions.
