The step-up in our monitoring is motivated importantly by a shift in financial 

regulation and supervision toward a more macroprudential, or systemic, approach, 

supplementing our traditional microprudential perspective focused primarily on the 

health of individual institutions and markets.  In the spirit of this more systemic approach 

to oversight, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

(FSOC), which is comprised of the heads of a number of federal and state regulatory 

agencies.  The FSOC has fostered greater interaction among financial regulatory agencies 

as well as a sense of common responsibility for overall financial stability.  Council 

members regularly discuss risks to financial stability and produce an annual report, which 

reviews potential risks and recommends ways to mitigate them.

  The Federal Reserve’s 

broad-based monitoring efforts have been essential for promoting a close and well-

informed collaboration with other FSOC members. 

A Focus on Vulnerabilities 

Ongoing monitoring of the financial system is vital to the macroprudential 

approach to regulation.  Systemic risks can only be defused if they are first identified.  

That said, it is reasonable to ask whether systemic risks can in fact be reliably identified 

in advance; after all, neither the Federal Reserve nor economists in general predicted the 

past crisis.  To respond to this point, I will distinguish, as I have elsewhere, between 

triggers and vulnerabilities.

  The triggers of any crisis are the particular events that touch
