security of our payment system.  We hear all the time that the Federal Reserve should do 

something about this.  But, despite our multiple roles, the Federal Reserve does not have 

broad authority to simply restructure or redesign the payment system.  So, two years ago, 

the Fed published a consultation paper that sought public input on ways to make the U.S. 

payment system safer, more accessible, faster, and more efficient from end-to-end.2  As 

we evaluated the substantial volume of public comment in response to the paper, the Fed 

also conducted research; met with a wide set of stakeholders, including banks, merchants, 

technology companies, consumer organizations, and others; and worked to enhance our 

own payment services. 

Building on this work, we released a second paper earlier this year, entitled 

“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”3 This paper synthesizes a range of 

views and presents a multifaceted plan for collaborating with payment system 

stakeholders to enhance the speed, safety, and efficiency of the U.S. payment system.  

The paper emphasizes the need for a secure payment system that has the public’s 

confidence and that keeps pace with the rapidly evolving and expanding threat 

environment. 

To facilitate cooperation among the many stakeholders, under the leadership of 

Esther George, we have established two task forces:  one for faster payments and one for 

payment security. These task forces will work both independently and in concert.  The 

security experts on the secure payments task force will advise members of the faster
