the next few years (and not merely holds steady), then it could indirectly hold down the 

growth of domestic wages and prices in ways not captured by conventional models.   

More speculatively, changes in the structure of the domestic economy may also 

be altering inflation dynamics in ways not captured by conventional models.  The 

growing importance of online shopping, by increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. 

retail sector, may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise 

prices in response to rising demand.25  That said, the economy overall appears to have 

become more concentrated and less dynamic in recent years, which may tend to increase 

firmsâ€™ pricing power.26  Because these changes occur slowly, determining their complex 

effects on the economy will, as a practical matter, require studying data over a 

considerable time.   

Finally, I would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in 

response to robust labor market conditions than anticipated.  The influence of labor 

utilization on inflation has become quite modest over the past 20 years, implying that the 

inflationary consequences of misjudging the sustainable rate of unemployment are low.  

But we cannot be sure that this modest sensitivity will persist in the face of strong labor 

market conditions, given that we do not fully understand how it came to be so modest in 

the first place.  Although the evidence is weak that inflation responds in a nonlinear 

manner to resource utilization, this risk is one that we cannot entirely dismiss.
