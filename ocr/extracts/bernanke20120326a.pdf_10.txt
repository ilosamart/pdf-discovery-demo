three years or so is especially concerning.  In this episode, both the median and average 

durations of unemployment have reached levels far outside the range of experience since 

World War II (figure 11).  And the share of unemployment that represents spells lasting 

more than six months has been higher than 40 percent since December 2009 (figure 12).  

By way of comparison, the share of unemployment that was long term in nature never 

exceeded 25 percent or so in the severe 1981-82 recession.   

 
Those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates, and 

a growing academic literature documents some dimensions of those burdens.  For 

example, research has shown that workers who lose previously stable jobs experience 

sharp declines in earnings that may last for many years, even after they find new work.

unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from 

savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses, one-half borrowed money from 

family and friends, and one-third struggled to meet housing expenses.

from a higher incidence of stress‐related health problems such as depression, stroke, and 

heart disease, and they may have a lower life expectancy.
