The Basic Model

𝑥𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 𝑥𝑡+1 − 𝜎  𝑖𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1 −  𝑟𝑡
𝑛 (1)  

𝜋𝑡 = 𝜅𝑥𝑡 + 𝛽𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1 (2)

 𝑖𝑡 =  𝑖𝑡 + 𝜙𝜋 𝜋𝑡 −  𝜋 + 𝜙𝑥(𝑥𝑡 −  𝑥)/4 (3)

where

𝑥𝑡 is the output gap,  𝑦𝑡 −  𝑦𝑡
𝑛;

 𝑦𝑡
𝑛 is an exogenous variable, representing variations in the natural rate of output;

𝜋𝑡 is the rate of inflation;

 𝑖𝑡 is the interest rate;

 𝑖𝑡 is an exogenous, possibly time-varying, intercept of the Taylor Rule.
