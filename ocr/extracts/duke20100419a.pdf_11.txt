promote strategies that address barriers to work and connect adults to employment 

opportunities.6  

Among the successful strategies identified in the concentrated poverty case studies, the 

report noted that community colleges have effectively filled educational gaps in communities 

where limited educational attainment among residents and insufficient job readiness were 

particularly pronounced.  In Cleveland, for example, residents who once worked in 

manufacturing lacked the necessary skills to obtain other available jobs, particularly in the 

growing health care sector.  To address this problem, the Cuyahoga County Community College 

designed an innovative program to help individuals with limited formal education enter health 

care through a nursing assistant training program. The program offers both immediate 

employment opportunities and the potential for additional credentials necessary to advance to 

other jobs along the occupational ladder.   

In El Paso, Texas, the community developed Project ARRIBA, a labor market 

intermediary that provides clients with training through El Paso Community College.  The 

training focuses on the skills necessary for local job demands in fields such as health care, 

education, and information technology.   

More recently, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis conducted a study of 

the effectiveness of community colleges in advancing the economic well-being of students and 

found that students who attend a community college gain economic advantages in the job 

market, even without completing a degree.  A review of research on using community colleges 

for retraining older displaced workers found that one year at a community college increases the 

long-term earnings of those workers by about 9 percent for men and about 13 percent for
