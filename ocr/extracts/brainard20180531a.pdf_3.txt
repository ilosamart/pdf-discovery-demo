I expect real GDP growth to pick up in the next few quarters.  In particular, the 

fundamentals for consumer spending are favorable:  Income gains have been strong, 

consumer confidence remains solid, and employment prospects remain bright.  And 

business investment should remain solid, with drilling and mining bolstered by increased 

oil prices. 

Moreover, the sizable fiscal stimulus that is in train is likely to provide a tailwind 

to growth in the second half of the year and beyond.2  From a position of full 

employment, the economy will likely receive a substantial boost from $1.5 trillion in 

personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in federal spending, with 

estimates suggesting a boost to the growth rate of real GDP of about 3/4 percent this year 

and next.3   

Risks and Uncertainties 

In short, with a tightening labor market and inflation near target, fiscal stimulus in 

the pipeline suggests some risk to the upside.  By contrast, recent developments abroad 

suggest some risk to the downside. 

Global growth has been synchronized over the past year, but recent developments 

pose some risk.  Political developments in Italy have reintroduced some risk, and 

financial conditions in the euro area have worsened somewhat in response.  With some 

uptick in political uncertainty, and inflation still below target in the euro area and Japan, 

monetary policies among the advanced economies look likely to be divergent for some 

time.  In addition, some emerging markets may find conditions more challenging.  An

3 For example, the International Monetary Fund (2018) estimates that the tax cut legislation will raise the 
level of U.S. GDP 1-1/4 percent by 2020, and the Congressional Budget Office (2018, p. 13) estimates that 
increased spending caps will boost the level of real GDP by 0.6 percent in 2019.
