done?   

It was in this context that the Federal Reserve, with the full support of the 

Treasury, made a loan to AIG to prevent its failure.  The loan imposed tough terms, 

senior management was replaced, and shareholders lost almost all of their investments.   

If I had to cast that vote again, even knowing all that followed, including the 

criticism that we have received, I wouldnâ€™t change it.  I still believe that the consequences 

would have been far worse for all businesses and consumers if we had let AIG fail.  

Despite the claims by some that healthier Wall Street firms or even the small businesses 

and consumers on Main Street did not benefit from assistance to AIG, I would argue that 

no business or individual was immune to the effects of a sequential collapse of key 

financial intermediaries.  As it was, we still had frozen credit markets that necessitated 

the facilities I discussed earlier.  In the wake of the Lehman failure and the near failure of 

AIG, it was as if someone turned off a switch on business activity.  Almost overnight, 

businesses went into full protection mode, halting all capital expenditures, shedding 

inventory, and slashing expenses.  In the face of massive unemployment caused by 

layoffs and business failures, consumers stopped spending.   

This first became clear to me during the October 2008 board of directors meeting

Reserve Banks, each with a board of directors representing the economy of the district.  

We rely upon these board members for real-time insight into conditions in the real 

economy.  Usually, as they go around the room reporting on conditions in their industry 

or part of the region, you hear the full spectrum of emotion from gloom to caution to
