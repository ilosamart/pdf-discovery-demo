Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually scale back our reinvestments of 

proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency 

securities.  As a result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.2  By 

limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce 

our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other 

potential market strains. 

Changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of 

adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active 

tool for monetary policy in normal times.  We therefore do not plan on making 

adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program.  But, of course, as we stated in 

June, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material 

deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal 

funds rate.     

 Also at our September meeting, the Committee decided to maintain its target for 

the federal funds rate.  We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy 

will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize 

inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.  That expectation is based on our 

view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the 

level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on 

an even keel.  The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, 

                                                 
2 For October through December of this year, the decline in the Federal Reserveâ€™s securities holdings will 
be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasury securities and $4 billion per month for agency securities.  
These caps will gradually rise over the course of the following year to maximums of $30 billion per month 
for Treasury securities and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the 
process of normalizing the size of our balance sheet.
