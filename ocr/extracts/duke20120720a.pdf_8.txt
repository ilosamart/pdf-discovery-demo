a capital conservation buffer, and introducing an international leverage ratio requirement.  

The Federal Reserve has also supported the Basel Committeeâ€™s work on quantitative 

liquidity requirements and its work on capital surcharges for banks of global systemic 

importance.  

 Another example of international cooperation on the regulatory front is the 

Financial Stability Board (FSB), which consists of key financial regulators around the 

world, including the Federal Reserve.  The FSB has identified a number of challenges 

that international cooperation among central banks and financial regulators are helping to 

address.  One such challenge regards over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.  To reduce the 

systemic risk of OTC derivatives, the G-20 leaders have agreed to require that 

standardized OTC derivatives be cleared through a central counterparty.  Another 

challenge is that of cross-border resolutions, and the FSB has undertaken analytic work 

on how to improve the resolvability of financial firms that have a substantial international 

presence.  The FSB has also identified and spurred cooperative work on gaps in financial 

data and on the so-called shadow banking system.  

 As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has cooperated with foreign bank 

supervisors (including other central banks) through participation in supervisory colleges, 

which are multilateral standing working groups of supervisors formed for the purpose of 

enhancing effective consolidated supervision of an international banking organization.  

Supervisory colleges enhance the information exchange and cooperation of home and 

host supervisors to help them develop a better understanding of the risk profile of a 

banking organization.
