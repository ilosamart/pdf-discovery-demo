on the policy prescriptions obtained from these methods, so I simultaneously consider 

other approaches for gauging the appropriate stance of monetary policy. 

Alternative Benchmarks for Monetary Policy:  Simple Rules 

An alternative approach that I find helpful in evaluating the stance of policy is to 

consult prescriptions from simple policy rules.  Research suggests that these rules 

perform well in a variety of models and tend to be more robust than the optimal control 

policy derived from any single macroeconomic model.

  Of course, a wide variety of 

simple rules have been proposed in the academic literature, and their policy implications 

can differ significantly depending on the particular specification.  Moreover, given our 

statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability, it seems reasonable to 

focus on rules that mirror these two objectives by prescribing how the federal funds rate 

should be adjusted in response to two gaps:  the deviation of inflation from its longer-run 

goal and the deviation of unemployment from my estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  

In my view, rules specified along these lines can serve as useful benchmarks for gauging 

the stance of policy and for communicating with the public about the rationale for our 

policy decisions. 

Indeed, in the statement on longer-run goals and policy strategy that the FOMC 

issued in January, we underscored our commitment to following a “balanced approach” 

in promoting our dual objectives.  The commitment to a balanced approach has crucial 

implications when it comes to choosing sensible benchmarks from among the many 

alternative policy rules.  In particular, any benchmark rule should conform to the so-
