asked, among other things, whether the proposed requirement should vary more 

depending on the resolution strategy of the parent foreign bank.  We are currently 

carefully reviewing these comments.  One thing is clear: the long-term debt requirement 

is a critical component in ending too big to fail. 

The long-term debt requirement together with rigorous resolution plans and 

operational preparedness, the capital surcharges along with the capital stress tests, and the 

availability of sufficient amounts of high-quality liquidity where it is most likely to be 

needed will all substantially decrease the risk that a large financial institutionâ€™s distress 

could pose to the broader financial system and help ensure that no banking institution is 

too large and too complex to fail.  They will move us closer to our goal of a safer, more 

responsible, and more resilient financial system.
