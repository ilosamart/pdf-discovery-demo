We are also looking to engage industry more frequently and openly so that we understand 

how they are weighing questions relating to innovation and how bank regulators may or may not 

impact those considerations. Along those lines, we continue to look for new ways for regulated 

institutions to interact with the Federal Reserve System outside of the examination process. In 

particular, supervised institutions, vendors, or consumer advocates are encouraged to contact 

their local Reserve Bank; talk with us about the issues they face; and, in some cases, ask 

clarifying questions about relevant legal frameworks and supervisory expectations.  

Conclusion 

As regulators and banks adjust to this post-crisis age of innovation, it is important for us 

to understand the pain points for community banks. As a regulator, my priority will always be 

facilitating a banking system that is safe and sound and in which consumers are treated fairly. 

But regulators also have to ask: How can our approach to supervision be modernized so that it 

supports responsible innovation by our supervised institutions?  

The efforts I described today are hopefully just a start. I am looking forward to personally 

engaging with community bankers, vendors, and consumer advocates to hear their perspectives 

on the most productive ways for the Federal Reserve Board to help community banks thrive in 

this age of innovation.
