positions of banks promptly and significantly following the crisis, beginning with the 

2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending 

growth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers. 

While material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending 

are not readily apparent, credit may be less available to some borrowers, especially 

homebuyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and, perhaps, small businesses.  In 

retrospect, mortgage borrowing was clearly too easy for some households in the mid-

2000s, resulting in debt burdens that were unsustainable and ultimately damaging to the 

financial system.  Currently, many factors are likely affecting mortgage lending, 

including changes in market perceptions of the risk associated with mortgage lending; 

changes in practices at the government-sponsored enterprises and the Federal Housing 

Administration; changes in technology that may be contributing to entry by nonbank 

lenders; changes in consumer protection regulations; and, perhaps to a limited degree, 

changes in capital and liquidity regulations within the banking sector.  These issues are 

complex and interact with a broader set of challenges related to the domestic housing 

finance system.

Model with Three Layers of Default,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 11 (June), pages 9-63; 

and Juliane Begenau (2016), “Capital Requirements, Risk Choice, and Liquidity Provision in a Business 

Cycle Model,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School, September.  Subsequent analyses, albeit ones 

that follow similar approaches, also suggest that there are net benefits to higher capital standards.  One 

example is the analysis by Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment,” in 

note 17.  Another is Ingo Fender and Ulf Lewrick (2016), “Adding It All Up:  The Macroeconomic Impact 

of Basel III and Outstanding Reform Issues,” BIS Working Papers 591 (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for 

International Settlements, November), www.bis.org/publ/work591.pdf.  Indeed, this research points to 

benefits from capital requirements in excess of those adopted, a conclusion also reached in Wayne 

Passmore and Alexander H. von Hafften (2017), “Are Basel’s Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically 

Important Banks Too Small?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-021 (Washington:  Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),
