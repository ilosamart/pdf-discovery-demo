“missing effects” of a 2 percentage point decrease in the financial cost of capital would 

have lowered the equilibrium real funds rate by 63 basis points. 

Slower foreign growth.  Here, we assume that foreign trend GDP growth has 

fallen as much as U.S. trend GDP growth and thus has had a similar effect on interest 

rates--namely, 115 basis points.  That assumption would imply a reduction in the (U.S.) 

equilibrium federal funds rate of negative 1.15 x 0.27, or negative 30 basis points.    

Figure 2:  Long-run effects of animal spirits and fiscal policy on interest rates 

This figure shows the effects of shocks that lead to 1 percentage point shifts in 

each of the variables indicated.  These simulations can be found directly in table A.1.  

Thus, the animal spirits shock in figure 2 corresponds to the investment shock shown in 

line 3 of table A.1.  And the government spending and tax cut simulations shown in 

figure 2 line up with the simulations shown in lines 6 and 7 of table A.1.
