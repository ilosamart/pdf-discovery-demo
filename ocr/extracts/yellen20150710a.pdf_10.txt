first time in recent years that real GDP has been reported to decline, or grow unusually 

slowly, in the first quarter of the year.  There is a healthy debate among economists--

many within the Federal Reserve System--about some of the technical factors that may 

lie behind this pattern.4  Nevertheless, at least a couple of other more persistent factors 

also likely weighed on economic output and industrial production in the first quarter.  In 

particular, the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar that I mentioned, as well as 

weak growth in some foreign economies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports.  

Moreover, lower crude oil prices have significantly depressed business investment in the 

domestic energy sector.  Indeed, industrial production continued to decline somewhat in 

April and May.  We expect the drag on domestic economic activity from these factors to 

ease over the course of this year, as the value of the dollar and crude oil prices stabilize, 

and I anticipate moderate economic growth, on balance, for this year as a whole.  As 

always, however, the economic outlook is uncertain.  Notably, although the economic 

recovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece 

remains unresolved. 

Looking further ahead, I think that many of the fundamental factors underlying 

U.S. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic
