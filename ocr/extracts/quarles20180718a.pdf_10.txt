could be exempted from requirements to calculate risk-weighted assets under the models-

based advanced approaches to capital. 

I continue to strongly believe that liquidity regulation should be a primary 

component of supervision and regulation of large banks.  We all saw the central role that 

liquidity risk played in the recent financial crisis.  Minimum standardized liquidity 

measures and internal liquidity stress tests remain critical at firms with more than $100 

billion in total assets.  However, for less complex and less interconnected firms with 

assets greater than $100 billion, there may be opportunities to modify aspects of the 

standardized liquidity requirements as well as expectations around internal liquidity stress 

tests and liquidity risk management.  Similarly, banks with more than $250 billion in 

assets that are not G-SIBs currently face largely the same liquidity regulation as G-SIBs.  

As Iâ€™ve said previously, I believe it would make sense to calibrate the liquidity 

requirements differently for these firms relative to their G-SIB counterparts.  

Resolution planning is especially critical to ensure that the largest banking firms 

structure their operations in ways that make it more possible for them to be resolved upon 

failure without causing systemic risks for the broader economy.  But most firms with 

total assets between $100 billion and $250 billion do not pose a high degree of 

resolvability risk, especially if they are less complex and less interconnected.  Therefore, 

we should consider scaling back or removing entirely resolution planning requirements 

for most of the firms in that asset range.  Further, we should consider limiting the scope 

of application of resolution planning requirements to only the largest, most complex, and 

most interconnected banking firms because their failure poses the greatest spillover risks 

to the broader economy.  For firms that would still be subject to resolution planning
