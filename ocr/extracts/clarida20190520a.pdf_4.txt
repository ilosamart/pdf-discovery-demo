conditions.6  However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, 

of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, it is all the 

more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels 

consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 

Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the 

challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of 

the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent 

in April, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is 

currently operating beyond full employment.  However, the level of the unemployment 

rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be 

estimated.  The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current 

level of the unemployment rate.  For example, in the March Blue Chip economic outlook 

survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10 

                                                 
6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary 
policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such 
a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and 
Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a 
central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the 
adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary 
policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to 
shocks. 
7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others 
(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the 
precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the 
level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in 
these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low 
and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in 
determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.
