issues that are at the center of our economic recovery.  It is gratifying to have such an 

opportunity and to work in this unique institution. 

The culture of the Federal Reserve is an interesting blend of government, 

academia, and business.  Differences of opinion regularly occur, but they are a source of 

strength rather than conflict within the institution.  They add liveliness to the debate and 

richness to the decisionmaking process.  The System is a treasure-trove of data, research, 

and institutional memory about the economy and the financial system.  It is stimulating, 

and occasionally exhausting, to be surrounded by so much brainpower and intellectual 

curiosity.  But everyone approaches the work with a serious sense of purpose and 

collegiality.  It is difficult for me to describe what it is like to work there, but if you ever 

get the chance to do so, I would highly recommend it. 

Lessons Learned 

 Now I’d like to turn to my final task--to offer some career advice to those of you 

just preparing to enter the business world.  As someone who has spent more years than I 

care to count in that world, let me begin where I began.  I needed a job, just as many of 

you will soon.  In searching for that first job or even some of the ones that come later, 

don’t be afraid to take one at an entry level, as I did when I started as a teller, or one that 

seems quite daunting, regardless of your qualifications, as I faced when I joined the 

Federal Reserve.  Look for a career that you enjoy and one that is well suited to your 

temperament and your talents.  Remember that what you think you want most in life 

might not be the thing that makes you truly happy.  I could have been miserable as a 

mediocre actress.  Instead, I happened upon a deeply rewarding profession that I loved.  

Indeed, I have found that life usually works out for the best--if you let it.
