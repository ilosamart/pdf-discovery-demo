important to note that most of these efforts were directed at the system as a whole and 

were made available to banks of all sizes.   

For example, in September 2008, when a prominent money market fund “broke

guarantees for money market funds would have on bank deposits, the Treasury adjusted 

the guarantee to cover only balances in place on the date the guarantee was issued.  That

they would not run out, but no guarantee was offered for new investments that might 

cause runs out of depository institutions and into the funds.  A few weeks later, the 

deposit insurance limit was temporarily increased to $250,000, an increase that had long 

been sought by community banks.   

In addition, under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made available unlimited insurance for 

demand deposits.  Later the program was modified to also cover Interest on Lawyers 

Trust Accounts (IOLTAs) and low-interest Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW)

the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) capital purchase program were, in fact,
