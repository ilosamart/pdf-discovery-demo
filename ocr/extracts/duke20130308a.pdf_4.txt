some areas, by reducing the desirability of a neighborhood as a place to live.6  This effect 

may be diminishing, as the foreclosure inventory has gradually started to decline.  The 

decline in REO sales has been partly offset by an increase in short sales, but these 

properties tend to transact at smaller discounts than REO properties.7 

Finally, investors have been attracted to the housing market because of the low 

prices on REO properties.  The properties tend to sell at lower prices because some are 

damaged and because lenders may be more motivated sellers than the typical 

homeowner.  The combination of a low purchase price, a possible steady stream of rental 

income, and the potential for significant capital gains has attracted considerable interest 

from large institutional investors as well as from the mom-and-pop investors who have 

historically dominated this market.  This increase in investor demand has supported 

house prices so far and may continue to provide a floor for them.  

What role will these forces play going forward?  I think house prices will continue 

to rise, as the supply of existing homes on the market will remain quite tight.  I do not 

believe that a flood of houses on the market from households that are currently 

underwater or from bank REO is likely to materialize or to be sufficient to outpace 

growing demand. 

As house price gains continue, more underwater homeowners will regain a 

position of positive equity in their homes.  House price increases of 10 percent or less 

would be sufficient for about 40 percent of underwater homeowners to regain positive 

equity; presumably, some subset of those homeowners will be interested in selling their
