exacerbated by the prevalence of short-term funding.  The use of short-term wholesale 

funding was hardly unknown among major financial firms in the 1990s, but broadened 

significantly thereafter, both within large firms and in sponsored entities such as the now 

infamous Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) used to fund asset-backed securities.  

This trend was a dramatic example of the ways in which traditional lending and capital 

market activities had become increasingly integrated and another example of how 

prudential regulation had not quickly enough adjusted to that trend.      

 Earlier this week, as we reached the five-year anniversary of Lehman Brothersâ€™ 

failure, numerous retrospectives on the crisis reminded us of its multiple causes.  But the 

practice of many firms, including all those with sizeable broker-dealers, of funding large 

amounts of assets with short-term wholesale funding was an accelerant of all the 

problems that had grown within the financial system.  When questions arose about the 

quality of some of the assets on which short-term funding had been provided, investors 

who had regarded short-term secured lending as essentially risk-free suddenly became 

unwilling to lend against a wide range of assets.  Then ensued the classic adverse 

feedback loop, as liquidity-strained institutions found themselves forced to sell positions, 

which placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, thereby accelerating margin 

calls on leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for all holders of the 

assets.                  

Although the amounts of short-term wholesale funding have come down from 

their pre-crisis peaks,

 this structural vulnerability remains, particularly in funding

 In 2006, just before the onset of the stresses that eventually led to the financial crisis, the largest U.S. 

financial firms relied on short-term wholesale funding for about half their total funding needs, and deposits 

for just over one-third.  Today (or, more precisely, as of the end of the second quarter of this year) those 

proportions are almost exactly reversed.  Some of the change is likely due to changes in risk assessment
