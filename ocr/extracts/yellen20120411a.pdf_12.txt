restrain growth in labor costs and prices.  And, given the stability of inflation 

expectations, I expect that the latest round of gasoline price increases will also have only 

a temporary effect on overall inflation.  Indeed, if crude oil prices were to follow the 

downward-sloping path implied by current futures contracts, energy costs would serve as 

a restraining influence on overall inflation over the next several years.  Figure 6 presents 

the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections of inflation at the time of our 

January meeting.  Most expected inflation to be at, or a bit below, our long-run objective 

of 2 percent through 2014; most private forecasters also appear to expect inflation by this 

measure to be close to 2 percent.

  As with unemployment, uncertainty around the 

inflation projection is substantial. 

Benchmarks for Assessing Monetary Policy:  Optimal Control  

 As I indicated at the outset of my remarks, I supported the Committee’s 

statements in January and March pertaining to the stance of monetary policy.  I will now 

explain the rationale for my judgments, and I will describe some of the tools that I use to 

make such assessments.  I consider it essential, in making judgments about the stance of 

policy, to recognize at the outset the limits of our understanding regarding the dynamics 

of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy.  Because I see no magic bullet 

for determining the “right” stance of policy, I commonly consider a number of different 

approaches. 

One approach I find helpful in judging an appropriate path for policy is based on 

optimal control techniques.  Optimal control can be used, under certain assumptions, to

 The Blue Chip survey reports inflation forecasts for the consumer price index (CPI), not the PCE price 

index.  However, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) provides forecasts for both inflation 

measures, and we use the projected spreads between the measures reported in the 2012Q1 release of the 

SPF (together with historical data) to convert the March Blue Chip CPI forecasts to a PCE basis.
