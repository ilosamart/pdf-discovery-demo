Mortgage Servicing and the Economy  

The economic downturn that began in late 2007 and worsened considerably in the 

autumn of that year resulted in the worst recession in many decades.  Although recovery 

from the recession officially began in the third quarter of 2009, the pace of recovery has 

been modest, resulting in an unemployment rate that has remained at or above 8.5 percent 

since mid-2009.  This sustained high unemployment rate--with all the attendant social

businesses.  The decline in house prices has also impeded families from benefiting from 

the historically low level of interest rates, as perhaps only half of homeowners who could
