The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be 

partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on 

aggregate demand.  These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and 

limited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce 

debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth 

abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor 

force growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12  As the restraint 

from these headwinds further abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will 

gradually move higher over time.  Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants 

projected that, in the long run, the nominal federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent, 

and that the actual federal funds rate would rise to that level fairly slowly.13   

Because the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and 

must be estimated based on our imperfect understanding of the economy and the 

available data, I would stress that considerable uncertainty attends our estimates of its 

current level and even more to its likely path going forward.14  That said, we will learn 

                                                   
12 For analyses of how a sudden tightening in access to credit can lead to household deleveraging, pushing 
down the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015). 
13 See figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 
2015 FOMC meeting.  See Board of Governors (2015b).  The longer-run normal level of the federal funds 
rate reported in the SEP presumably matches participants’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run.  Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC 
participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate declined 75 basis points, to 3.5 
percent.  When revising down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, participants have 
generally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate as a contributing 
factor. 
14 One source of uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so-called model uncertainty.  As 
shown in figure 1, a variety of models that provide plausible descriptions of the economy give somewhat 
different estimates of the neutral rate.  A second source of uncertainty is the limited sample size of relevant 
macroeconomic data:  Our estimates of the neutral federal funds rate represent inferences about a moving 
target.  As a result, although the data provide important signals about the neutral rate, our estimates are 
necessarily imprecise.  In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of 
the neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average.  Moreover, one-sided
