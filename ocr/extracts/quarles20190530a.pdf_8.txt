these incentives, we regularly monitor financial intermediation both inside and outside of 

the banking system.   

Summary 

To sum up, while there is evidence that financial vulnerabilities have the potential 

to translate into macroeconomic risks, a general consensus has emerged that monetary 

policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for unemployment and inflation and not 

by the state of financial vulnerabilities.  Financial system resilience, supported by strong 

through-the-cycle regulatory and supervisory policies, remains a key defense against 

financial system and macroeconomic shocks.   

There is a clear need for new theory and empirics to address the questions about 

monetary policy and financial stability I have posed today.  I encourage you to continue 

to contribute to these answers.  By engaging the help of the wider academic community, 

conferences such as this one provide an invaluable opportunity to make progress on 

issues of great importance for economic policy.
