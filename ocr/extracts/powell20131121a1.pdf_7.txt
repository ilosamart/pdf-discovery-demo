CCP maintain financial resources sufficient to cover its current and potential future 

exposures to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence.  CCPs must 

maintain additional resources to cover the failure of the clearing member with the largest 

exposure under extreme but plausible market conditions.  In the case of CCPs with more 

complex risk profiles or those that are systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, 

the CCP must have adequate resources to handle the failure of the two clearing members 

with the largest exposures.  Finally, the PFMIs require a CCP to identify scenarios that 

may potentially prevent it from being able to continue operations, including so-called 

end-of-default waterfall issues, and develop detailed plans for recovery or orderly wind-

down.  Regulators and industry groups are working to establish minimum expectations 

for CCP transparency of both qualitative and quantitative information that will allow key 

stakeholders to assess a CCP’s risk management.8   

This international strategy for strengthening CCPs has been complemented by 

several domestic initiatives to introduce regulatory frameworks for OTC derivatives and 

to enhance supervision of systemically important CCPs.  The two most notable 

developments are the passage of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and 

Dodd-Frank, notably titles VII and VIII.  Both laws establish a framework for reporting, 

regulating, and clearing OTC derivatives transactions; call for international coordination; 

and emphasize enhanced risk management standards for CCPs.  Differences of
