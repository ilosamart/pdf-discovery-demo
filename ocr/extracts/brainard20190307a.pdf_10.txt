At a time when the modal outlook appears to have softened a bit, and risks appear 

more weighted to the downside than the upside, the best way to safeguard the gains we 

have made on jobs and inflation is to navigate cautiously on rates.  Risk management in 

an environment of a low long-run neutral rate and an attenuated relationship between 

resource utilization and overall inflation supports this approach.  Watchful waiting will 

allow us to gather more information about domestic momentum and foreign growth as 

well as some of the policy risks weighing on sentiment.   

Balance Sheet Normalization 

Let me turn now to the second tool used by the Federal Reserve in recent years--

asset purchases.  Recall that, after reducing the federal funds rate to its effective lower 

bound of zero in the 2008-09 recession, the FOMC sought a mechanism for providing 

additional stimulus in order to achieve maximum employment and target inflation.13  The 

Federal Reserve purchased longer-term Treasury securities in an effort to push down 

longer-term interest rates to support economic activity, an approach sometimes referred 

to as quantitative easing.  It also purchased agency mortgage-backed securities for the 

same reason, as well as to provide support to the housing sector, which was at the heart of 

the crisis.  Although the empirical estimates vary, most conclude that the asset purchase 

programs were successful in supporting the recovery.14   

Once recoveries become well established, the Federal Reserve moves its policy 

settings to more normal levels.  Our current extended recovery is no exception:  The 

Federal Reserve first started moving the federal funds rate to more normal values once 

                                                 
13 Some foreign central banks have reduced their short-term policy rates below zero.  See Ball and others 
(2016) for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of such a policy.
