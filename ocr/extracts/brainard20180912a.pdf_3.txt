Focusing first on the “shorter-run” neutral rate, this does not stay fixed, but rather 

fluctuates along with important changes in economic conditions.  For instance, legislation 

that increases the budget deficit through tax cuts and spending increases can be expected 

to generate tailwinds to domestic demand and thus to push up the shorter-run neutral 

interest rate.  Heightened risk appetite among investors similarly can be expected to push 

up the shorter-run neutral rate.  Conversely, many of the forces that contributed to the 

financial crisis--such as fear and uncertainty on the part of businesses and households--

can be expected to lower the neutral rate of interest, as can declines in foreign demand for 

U.S. exports. 

In many circumstances, monetary policy can help keep the economy on its 

sustainable path at full employment by adjusting the policy rate to reflect movements in 

the shorter-run neutral rate.  In this context, the appropriate reference for assessing the 

stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal shorter-run 

neutral rate.   

So far, I have been focusing on the shorter-run neutral rate of interest that is 

responsive to headwinds or tailwinds to demand.  The longer-run equilibrium rate is a 

related concept.  The underlying concept of the “longer run” generally refers to the output 

growing at its longer-run trend, after transitory forces reflecting headwinds or tailwinds 

have played out, in an environment of full employment and inflation running at the 

FOMC objective.4   

                                                   
The natural rate and the neutral rate are closely related concepts whose technical differences matter for 
economic theory and estimation, but less for the intuitive discussion here.
