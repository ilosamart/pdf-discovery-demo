forecasters and market participants appear to have marked down their expectations for future 

short-term interest rates by more than they otherwise would have, thereby putting additional 

downward pressure on long-term interest rates, improving broader financial conditions, and 

lending support to aggregate demand.       

The FOMC has also provided further monetary accommodation over time by altering the 

size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, shown in figure 8.  The 

expansion in the volume of securities held by the Federal Reserve is shown in the left panel of 

the figure.  During 2009 and early 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased about $1.4 trillion in 

agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt securities and about $300 billion in longer-

term Treasury securities.  In November 2010, the Committee initiated an additional $600 billion 

in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, which were completed at the end of June of last 

year.  Last September, the FOMC decided to implement the “Maturity Extension Program,” 

which affected the maturity composition of our Treasury holdings as shown in the right panel.  

Through this program, the FOMC is extending the average maturity of its securities holdings by 

selling $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less and 

purchasing an equivalent amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 

years.  These transactions are currently scheduled to be completed at the end of this month.  

Research by Federal Reserve staff and others suggests that our balance sheet operations 

have had substantial effects on longer-term Treasury yields, principally by reducing term 

premiums on longer-dated Treasury securities.10  Figure 9 provides an estimate, based on Federal

holding this security in excess of the return from rolling over short-dated Treasury securities, such as three-month 
Treasury bills.  For estimates of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions on long-term interest rates, see Canlin
