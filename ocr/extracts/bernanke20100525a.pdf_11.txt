the Fed and Treasury.  It was only by the amendment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 

that the Fed’s current objectives of maximum employment and stable prices were 

specified by the Congress.10  A clear mandate of this kind is a key pillar of central bank 

independence. 

Over the years, a consensus developed among U.S. political leaders that the 

Federal Reserve’s independence in making monetary policy is critical to the nation’s 

prosperity and economic stability.  In 1978, the Congress formally recognized this 

principle by approving a provision that exempts monetary policy, discount window 

operations, and the Fed’s interactions with other central banks from Government 

Accountability Office policy reviews.  In 1979, President Carter appointed Paul Volcker 

chairman of the Federal Reserve with the expectation that Volcker would strengthen the 

central bank’s inflation-fighting credibility, even though those steps would likely involve 

short-term economic and political costs.  Subsequently, President Reagan’s support for 

Volcker’s politically unpopular disinflationary policies and for the principle of Federal 

Reserve independence proved crucial to the ultimate victory over inflation, a victory that 

set the stage for sustained growth.11  Presidents and other U.S. political leaders have since 

then regularly testified to the benefits of an independent Federal Reserve.  For instance, 

President Clinton said in 2000, “[O]ne of the hallmarks of our economic strategy has 

                                                            
10 The Employment Act of 1946 established the objectives of “maximum employment, production, and 
purchasing power” for all federal agencies, whereas the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act gave 
the Federal Reserve the specific mandate of promoting “maximum employment, stable prices, and 
moderate long-term interest rates.”  Price stability requires that the central bank not attempt to drive 
employment above its sustainable level, and so in practice the Federal Reserve has interpreted its mandate 
to include maximum sustainable employment.  The goal of moderate long-term interest rates is frequently 
dropped from statements of the Federal Reserve’s mandate not because the goal is unimportant, but 
because moderate long-term interest rates are generally the byproduct of price stability. 
11 For example, in February 1982, President Reagan stated: “This administration will always support the 
political independence of the Federal Reserve Board.”  See Reagan (1982).
