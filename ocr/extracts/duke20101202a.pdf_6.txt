Credit supply factors have also likely contributed to the decline in overall credit 

card outstanding balances.  Households may have charged less because they had less 

credit available.  In the SCF panel, about 44 percent of households with credit card debt 

in 2007 experienced a reduction in their credit limits by 2009.  Data from the national 

credit bureaus indicate that credit lines peaked in the third quarter of 2008 and continued 

to fall over the course of 2009 and 2010.  The average dollar value of combined credit 

lines available to cardholders fell from a high near $26,000 per cardholder in late 2008 to 

around $21,000 per cardholder by the third quarter of 2010, a decline of about 20 percent.  

Moreover, SCF data indicate that changes in credit limits are indeed related to credit card 

spending:  Among households whose credit limit declined, SCF data show that the 

median amount of monthly new charges fell from $200 in 2007 to $50 in 2009, while 

among households whose credit limit did not decline, the median amount of new charges 

rose from $150 to $200.  Although this relationship is not necessarily causal, credit line 

restrictions have likely played at least some role in the reduction in credit card borrowing. 

Looking further at the supply side of credit card debt, card lenders did report 

retrenching during the financial crisis.  According to the Federal Reserve Board’s 

quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), 

large fractions of banks tightened standards and terms on new and existing credit card 

accounts throughout 2008 and 2009.2  In recent months, however, some banks reported 

having eased standards somewhat.  In the most recent survey, published in October 2010, 

about two-thirds of banks thought that credit standards for prime borrowers on credit card 

loans and other consumer loans either were at their longer-run averages or would return
