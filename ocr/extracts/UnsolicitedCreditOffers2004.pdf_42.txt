opt-out law was a good approach and whether they thought the government should ban 
prescreened solicitations.28 

Responses to these questions exhibit a distinct preference among consumers for the 
presence of an opt-out law, even if most do not personally employ it, but also for the 
government not to decide whether they opt out. About 80 percent of respondents said it 
is a good idea that there is a federal law permitting opting out, with the proportion 
somewhat higher among card holders than others (table 6). But about 65 percent of 
respondents indicated that they do not prefer that the government prohibit prescreened 
solicitations, even after a majority indicated they do not open and peruse the prescreened 
solicitations they receive. Again, this proportion is higher among those with credit cards.

28 Specifically, the first question asked, “Do you think it is a good idea or a bad idea that there is a 
federal law that permits you to put your name on a list and then credit card companies cannot send you 
these offers?” This question was followed immediately by a related question, “Do you think the 
government should prohibit credit card companies from sending pre-approved offers for credit cards?”
