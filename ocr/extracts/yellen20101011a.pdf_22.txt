Second, the principle of central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy is 

widely accepted as vital to achieving maximum employment and price stability.   

Fortunately, it is perfectly possible to attain good outcomes even if monetary 

policy and macroprudential policy are carried out separately and independently, and the 

goals of each are pursued using entirely separate tool kits.  This conclusion is an 

application of the assignment problem made familiar by Robert Mundell and others who 

analyzed monetary and fiscal policy.19  A key insight from that literature is that 

satisfactory results can be attained without policy coordination, even though fully optimal 

policy generally calls for coordination when spillovers occur.  Of course, it is necessary 

for monetary policy to take into account any macroeconomic effects resulting from 

macroprudential policy and vice versa.  

This separate-assignments approach to formulating macroprudential and monetary 

policy has merit both in theory and practice.  But I want to be careful not to push the 

argument for separation too far.  I noted, for example, that situations may arise in which 

the Federal Reserve, in its conduct of monetary policy, might not be able to fully offset 

the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential interventions.  This scenario could happen 

because of the zero bound on interest rates or monetary policy lags.  In such 

circumstances, it makes sense for macroprudential policy to take macroeconomic effects 

into account.  By the same token, I would not want to argue that it is never appropriate 

for monetary policy to take into account its potential effect on financial stability.  

Regulation is imperfect.  Financial imbalances may emerge even if we strengthen 

macroprudential oversight and control.  Some day in the future, it is possible that
