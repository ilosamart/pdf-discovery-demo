regain positive equity. 

It is my view that understanding the long-run trends in income and wealth across 

different households is important in understanding the dynamics of the macroeconomy 

and thus also may be relevant for setting monetary policy to best reach our goals of 

maximum employment and price stability.  I believe that the accommodative policies of 

the FOMC and the concerted effort we have made to ease conditions in the mortgage 

markets will help the economy continue to gain traction.  And the resulting expansion in 

employment will likely improve income levels at the bottom of the distribution.  

However, given the long-standing trends toward greater income and wealth inequalities, 

it is unlikely that cyclical improvements in the labor markets will do much to reverse 

these trends.

It strikes me that macroeconomists are far from a comprehensive understanding of 

how wealth and income inequality may affect business cycle dynamics.  My remarks

explored.  I have said nothing about the social costs associated with such trends, nor have 

I provided much detail on what is occurring at the top end of the income and wealth 

distribution and the effects of those trends on the recovery.  Nonetheless, I believe that,
