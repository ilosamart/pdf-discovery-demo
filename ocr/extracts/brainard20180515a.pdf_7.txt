roadmap embraced by a variety of stakeholders for a fast, ubiquitous, and secure payments 

system to be in place in the United States in the next few years.7  In short, a multiplicity of 

mechanisms are likely to be available for American consumers to make payments electronically 

in real time.  As such, it is not obvious what additional value a Fed-issued digital currency would 

provide over and above these options.

It is important for the Fed and other central banks to continue to research these issues as
