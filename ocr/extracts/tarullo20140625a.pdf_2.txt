Born of necessity during the depths of the financial crisis as part of an effort to restore 

confidence in the U.S. financial system, supervisory stress testing has in the intervening five 

years become a cornerstone of a new approach to regulation and supervision of the nationâ€™s 

largest financial institutions.  First, of course, it is a means for assuring that large, complex 

financial institutions have sufficient capital to allow them to remain viable intermediaries even 

under highly stressful conditions.  More broadly, supervisory stress testing and the associated 

review of capital planning processes have provided a platform for building out a regulatory 

framework that is more dynamic, more macroprudential, and more data-driven than pre-crisis 

practice.   

 Each year we have refined elements of both the substance and process of the stress tests.  

These changes have been informed not only by our own experience, but also by critiques and 

suggestions offered by others.  This annual symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Boston has become an important channel for eliciting reactions and advice from outside experts 

and the banks subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  

Although the major elements of our approach have now been successfully established, I 

anticipate that we will continue to make enhancements.  If supervisory stress testing is to give 

regulators, banks, and the public a dynamic view of the capital positions of large financial firms, 

it must itself respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and risk-management 

capabilities. 

 This morning I will give a retrospective on the first five years of supervisory stress 

testing, highlighting some of the accomplishments and identifying some areas in which we may 

consider changes in the future.  Then I would like to turn to a topic that has gained increasing
