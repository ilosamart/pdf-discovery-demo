From this perspective, it made sense to create yet another regulatory body--the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council--which is dedicated to the goal of coordination. The 

FSOC calls for agency head and senior-level staff participation of relevant financial 

regulatory bodies, requires regular meetings and reports on emerging risks to financial 

stability, and designates systemically important financial institutions. 


Making Regulatory Tools Work to Manage Emerging Risk and Create Resiliency  

Indeed, the goal of coordination among regulators is to make the regulatory tools work 

across the entire financial system. This strikes me as an important goal and the ultimate 

challenge for policymakers. The challenge arises not only from the fact that the 

regulatory system is fragmented, but also from the fact that, in order to work--indeed, in 

order to instill trust in the resiliency of the financial system--regulations need to be 

complied with by financial system participants and enforced by supervisors. The recent 

attention being paid to capital regulation, in particular, shouldnâ€™t distract us from the 

broader context and importance of compliance with, and enforcement of, the various 

capital rules.  

From the perspective of the hammer, everything looks like a nail. Similarly, from 

the perspective of the financial regulator, everything might look like a problem of 

insufficient capital. Instead, capital might, in fact, be sufficient but appear insufficient 

because of circumvention of compliance, or because of absent or delayed enforcement. 

To make regulation--any financial regulation--work, there must be on-site 

opportunities for supervisors to look for risk factors that, if not addressed, can lead to 

failure. There must be strong governance that is practiced by smart management teams
