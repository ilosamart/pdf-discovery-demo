activity and inflation, the level of the neutral rate, and the balance of macroeconomic 

risks.  In recent quarters, the data have painted a consistent picture of a resilient and 

gently improving U.S. economy.  Following a year in which the unemployment rate 

remained stable while labor force participation increased, we have seen in the past quarter 

a further reduction in the unemployment rate.  Overall, I am pleased to see that full 

employment is within reach and could prove sustainable with the right policy mix.  

Payroll growth has remained sufficiently strong to continue eroding slack, increasingly 

along margins that had previously seemed stubbornly elevated--including the long-term 

unemployed, those on the margins of the labor force, and most recently those who are 

working part time but would prefer full-time work.  Moreover, wage growth appears to 

be picking up gradually in a further sign that slack continues to be taken up.  While the 

employment cost index was up only 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, 

still well below pre-crisis norms, average hourly earnings have accelerated more 

noticeably, increasing by 2.9 percent on a 12-month basis in December.  Even so, some 

slack may remain:  Relative to pre-crisis levels, the prime-age employment-to-population 

ratio remains low and the share of employees working part time for economic reasons 

remains elevated.   

Following a long period of stubbornly below-target inflation, I have been 

encouraged by recent signs of gradual progress toward our inflation target, as the effects 

of earlier dollar appreciation and oil price declines appear to be waning.  Over the 

12-month period ending in November, core personal consumption expenditures prices 

increased 1.6 percent.  This rate is still noticeably below 2 percent, but it is up
