Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the Institute of International 

Finance’s Washington Policy Summit.  Before we begin our conversation, I want to share 

a few thoughts about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.1 

Current Economic Situation and Outlook 

The U.S. economy is in a good place and operating close to both of the Federal 

Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Real 

gross domestic product (GDP) rose about 3 percent last year, and in July, just a few 

months from now, the current economic expansion almost certainly will become the 

longest on record.  The unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years, 

and average monthly job gains have continued to outpace the increases needed over the 

longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.  Average hourly earnings 

are showing a welcome increase consistent with a healthy labor market, yet inflation 

remains near our 2 percent objective.  

All that said, the incoming data have revealed signs that U.S. economic growth is 

slowing somewhat from 2018’s robust pace.  Prospects for foreign economic growth have 

been marked down, and important international risks, such as Brexit, remain.  U.S. 

inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, 

which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better gauge of underlying 

inflation pressures, has been muted.  And some indicators of longer-term inflation 

expectations remain at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our price-

stability mandate.
