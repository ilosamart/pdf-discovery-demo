about $1.4 trillion--allows securities dealers access to their securities (for example, the 

tranches of loan securitizations mentioned earlier) during trading hours. 

 Because of these and other connections, panics and other stresses in shadow 

banking can spill over into traditional banking.  Indeed, the markets and institutions I 

mentioned--the repo market, the ABCP market, and money market funds--all suffered 

panics to some degree during the financial crisis.  As a result, many traditional financial 

institutions lost important funding channels for their assets; in addition, for reputational 

and contractual reasons, many banks supported their affiliated funds and conduits, 

compounding their own mounting liquidity pressures.   

Status of Shadow Banking Reform Efforts 

 Given the substantial stakes, I am encouraged that both regulators and the private 

sector have begun to take actions to prevent future panics and other disruptions in shadow 

banking.  However, in many key areas these efforts are still at early stages. 

A first set of reforms relate to the accounting and regulatory capital treatment of 

shadow banking entities sponsored by traditional banks.  The Financial Accounting 

Standards Board finalized a rule in 2009 that requires securitizations and other structured 

finance vehicles, in certain situations, to be consolidated onto the sponsoring bankâ€™s 

balance sheet.  In the context of regulatory capital, Basel 2.5 and Basel III addressed 

interconnectedness and other sources of systemic risk frequently associated with shadow 

banking by raising capital requirements for exposures to unregulated financial 

institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and credit insurers, and by 

strengthening the capital treatment of liquidity lines to off-balance-sheet structures.
