investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the 

year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales.   

We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate.  In July, the 

12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still 

noticeably below our 2 percent target.  The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices 

should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters.  Non-oil import 

prices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year, 

edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise 

going forward.  Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations 

remaining well anchored and not drifting lower.  The evidence here is mixed, as I noted 

earlier.   

Policy Implications  

The five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean 

roughly in the same direction:  In todayâ€™s new normal, the costs to the economy of 

greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of 

significant unexpected weakness.  In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried 

and tested tools and ample policy space in which to react.  Moreover, because of Phillips 

curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial 

response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, 

and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of 

inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a 

correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the 

economy.  In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is
