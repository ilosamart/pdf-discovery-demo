Qualitative Objection 

Before I close, I would like to say a few words about the role of the qualitative 

objection in our new chapter of stress testing.  As originally conceived, CCAR had both a 

quantitative component--based on the supervisory stress test--and a qualitative 

component--based on the Federal Reserve’s assessment of a firm’s stress testing 

practices.  In 2017, the Federal Reserve eliminated the qualitative objection as part of 

CCAR for large and noncomplex firms, in part because of improvements in risk 

management at these firms.3  By incorporating supervisory stress testing into the 

regulatory capital regime and introducing an automatic penalty if a firm falls below its 

SCB-derived capital requirement, the SCB proposal will eliminate the quantitative 

objection from CCAR.  The natural next question is: has the CCAR qualitative objection 

for the largest firms also run its course? 

In my view, the time has come to normalize the CCAR qualitative assessment by 

removing the public objection tool, and continuing to evaluate firms’ stress testing 

practices through normal supervision.  In such an environment, firms would remain 

subject to the same supervisory expectations, and examiners would continue to conduct 

rigorous horizontal and firm-specific assessments of a firm’s capital positions and capital 

planning, tailored to the risk profile of the firm.  While much of the examination work 

would center on a firm’s capital plan submissions, examination work would continue on a 

year-round basis, taking into account the firm’s management of other financial risks.  The 

evaluation of the firm’s capital position and capital planning would culminate in a rating 

of the firm’s capital position and planning.  Firms with deficient practices would receive 

supervisory findings through the examination process, and would be at risk of a ratings 

downgrade or enforcement action if those deficiencies were sufficiently material. 

Conclusion 

As we begin the next chapter in stress testing, my objective is to ensure the 

continued credibility of the program by increasing its transparency, simplicity, and 

stability while maintaining the strength of the supervisory and internal stress testing 

elements that are central to the program today.  These adjustments will be coupled with 

                                                 
3 The capital planning evaluation remains as part of the normal supervisory process for these firms.
