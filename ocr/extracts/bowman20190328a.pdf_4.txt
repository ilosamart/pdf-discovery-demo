Farm incomes are expected to remain relatively low this year after declining 

sharply from the 2013 peak.  The price of major agricultural commodities has also 

remained low in early 2019.  For example, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent 

lower than it was from 2010 to 2013.  Dairy producing states like New Mexico are well 

aware that average milk prices were about 15 percent lower in 2018 than from 2010 to 

2013, and well below the highs of 2014.  As noted in recent Federal Reserve System 

Beige Books, higher tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. exports and continued uncertainty 

over trade policy represent headwinds for American producers.    

Here in New Mexico, agricultural production rose 5 percent to $3.4 billion in 

2017, with strong gains in milk production and livestock.  Coming from a ranching 

family, I’m well aware of the challenges facing livestock producers.  New Mexico is also 

the nation’s second largest producer of pecans, producing a record 92 million pounds 

worth $220 million in 2017.  I’m also looking forward to touring a farm later today to 

learn more about a crop we don’t grow a lot of in Kansas--chili peppers.  The demand for 

chili peppers and pecans grown in New Mexico is a good example of the kinds of 

regional variations we see in agriculture and many other industries.  

While it is important to understand regional trends, I would like to focus this 

morning on some overarching themes that have emerged in recent years.  Recently, a 

great deal of attention understandably has been paid to an increase in the number of U.S. 

farm bankruptcies.  While this is, of course, an important indicator to watch, it’s equally 

important to note that the rise over the past few years has been fairly modest.  

Specifically, Chapter 12 filings increased from 360 in 2014 to about 500 in 2018.  The
