real—for example, in the case of Countrywide’s broker-dealer affiliate in August 2007 and Bear 

Stearns in March 2008—did the lenders appear to see these risks clearly.  In addition, the 

presumed stabilizing function of collateral was weakened, since a default by a dealer or clearing 

bank could leave lenders with securities posted as collateral that they had no desire, operational 

capacity, or even, in some cases, legal authority to hold, or at least liquidate in an orderly way. 

The response at that point was to flee, ignoring the protection putatively afforded by collateral. 

Only because of unprecedented official-sector action did the triparty repo market not 

suffer the same kind of disastrous run as did money market funds.  A broad run on triparty repos 

would have severely impacted all major broker-dealers and thus the U.S. securities industry as a 

whole.  The Primary Dealer Credit Facility—instituted on an emergency basis immediately after 

the failure of Bear Stearns—provided emergency lending to dealers, injected liquidity into the 

system, and provided a backstop that reassured markets.  This public-sector support prevailed 

where implicit private-sector support had come into question, and helped stabilize the triparty 

repo market.  

My third example of a funding channel characterized by tacit credit support is the 

securities lending market, which is driven in large part by demand for securities by financial 

institutions wanting to establish short positions or needing collateral to support other 

transactions.  Securities lenders in this market are typically owners of large pools of securities 

such as pension plans, endowments, and insurance companies.  The securities borrower posts 

collateral, usually cash in the United States, which a custodian bank then typically invests on 

behalf of the securities lender in supposedly safe and liquid investments, including money 

market funds, triparty repos, and other short-term instruments.  The gains from these
