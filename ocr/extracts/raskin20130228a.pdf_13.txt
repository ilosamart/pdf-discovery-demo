Here I am not just talking about the mixed miracle of mobile banking and mobile 

payments or being able to take a picture of a check with a smart phone and it appearing in my 

checking account.  That’s a topic that is amazing in its own right and worthy of a separate 

speech.  I am talking about encouraging banks to pay attention to the banking experiences of 

their customers and finding process improvements or service elements that may lead to 

something seemingly mundane but valuable nonetheless. 

Some innovators see reputation itself as not just something to be managed, but as a 

product in and of itself.  With buyers and sellers repeatedly and constantly interacting on the 

Internet, there are “reputation trails” that are being created that, when compiled, give an 

alternative set of markers about how trustworthy a particular buyer or seller may be.  These 

reputation trails--gathered when you evaluate a product you’ve bought online or when you 

deliver the product that you’ve promised--create a picture of trust that some have argued has 

value that can be shaped.

Reputational Risks and Cybersecurity 


Perhaps reputation will one day transform commerce.  But in the meantime, I would like 

to mention one set of reputational issues that the banking industry is confronting as we speak.  

As is the case for reputation trails, it too involves the Internet, but this use of the Internet is not 

being done in the spirit of cooperation and enhancement of public trust.  This set of reputational 

issues comes in response to the recent substantial increase in cyberattacks, all of which have the 

potential to undermine the fundamental trust that the public puts into financial institutions.   

Cyberattacks on banks are occurring with increasing frequency, and concerted 

cooperative work between government and financial institutions is underway.  Customers are
