sudden increase in intraday margin calls and their own internal demands for more liquid 

resources.9  These are risks that we should seek to understand better.   


Policy Implications 

 The Federal Reserve is the primary supervisory authority for two designated financial 

market utilities (or DFMUs), and plays a secondary role relative to the six other DFMUs.  As a 

central bank, we are particularly concerned with liquidity issues.10  I will address four policy 

issues that need careful consideration as the public sector and market participants continue to 

address liquidity risks in central clearing.  


Stress Testing 

The 1987 stock market crash showed that we need to look at liquidity risks from a 

systemwide perspective.  That event involved multiple CCPs and also involved multiple links in 

the payments chains between banks and CCPs.  Conducting supervisory stress tests on CCPs that 

take liquidity risks into account would help authorities better assess the resilience of the financial 

system.  A stress test focused on cross-CCP liquidity risks could help to identify assumptions 

                                                           
9 Regulatory changes since the financial crisis have encouraged banks to hold much greater amounts of high-quality 
liquid assets, which would help them in meeting such liquidity demands. 
10 Section 804 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate those financial 
market utilities that the council determines are, or are likely to become, systemically important.  Eight utilities have 
been designated:  The Clearing House Payments Company, L.L.C.; CLS Bank International; Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, Inc.; The Depository Trust Company; Fixed Income Clearing Corporation; ICE Clear Credit L.L.C.; 
National Securities Clearing Corporation; and The Options Clearing Corporation.
