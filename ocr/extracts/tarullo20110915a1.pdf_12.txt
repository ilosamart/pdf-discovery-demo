correlated, creating significant common risk exposures.

  In such instances, a common shock to a 

class of assets held by the large firms could be expected to have systemic effects through some 

combination of domino and fire-sale effects.

  There would be considerable value in further 

research that explored the potential tradeoffs between industry structures in which relatively 

smaller, less diversified firms are more prone to idiosyncratic failure versus industry structures in 

which very large, diversified firms are individually less vulnerable to idiosyncratic failure but 

collectively more likely to create systemic risk because of their common exposures. 

One can imagine other strands of IO literature providing insights when applied to the 

financial sector.  Let me suggest a couple of possibilities.  First is the subject of financial 

innovation.  This audience hardly needs reminding that certain forms of financial engineering lay 

at the heart of the recent financial crisis.  Indeed, analysis of these practices has yielded some of 

the most important finance work of the last few years.  The observation that some forms of 

financial innovation were profit-maximizing for the individual firms that pursued them, while 

simultaneously increasing systemic risk, has a parallel in IO research.  Work in this area shows 

how the competitive structure of an industry can create incentives for socially suboptimal 

behavior through, for example, inefficiently low levels of information acquisition or excessive 

product variety.  In thinking about this issue, I was also reminded of the older work on how 

product differentiation may substitute for price competition in concentrated industries.

We are unlikely to see renewed use of the specific financial products that precipitated or 

amplified the financial crisis.  But financial regulation faces an ongoing challenge in trying to
