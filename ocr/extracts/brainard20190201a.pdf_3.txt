At our most recent meeting with our Community Advisory Council, we asked for their 

recommendations for reform.3 

Even though we decided not to join the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the 

publication of its August 2018 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning revisions to 

the CRA regulations, we have been reviewing the approximately 1,500 comment letters 

submitted by academics, banks and banking trade associations, community and consumer 

groups, and citizens. 

So what have we learned so far from the comment letters we have reviewed and the 

roundtables we have held?  If there is one common thread, it is that support for the Community 

Reinvestment Act is broad and deep.  Commenters across the board applauded the significant 

volume of CRA loans and investments that have supported LMI households and communities, as 

well as the benefits households and communities have realized from the CRA’s focus on local 

retail financial services, small business lending, and community development lending, 

investments, and services.  And they asked that the three banking agencies work together toward 

a joint rulemaking proposal so that CRA policies can be clearly and consistently applied across 

agencies.   

Second, there are some good ideas about how to modernize the procedures for setting the 

area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA activities while retaining the core focus on 

place.  This is not a simple challenge, and this morning’s panel identified some promising 

solutions to the challenge of modernizing the definition of assessment areas to keep up with 

changes in banks’ business models.  I appreciated the panelists’ insights on how to balance the
