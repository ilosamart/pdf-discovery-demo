Then as now, the financial and economic crisis was global, underscoring the third 

lesson:  International crises require an international response.  Contemporary Americans’ 

impressions of the Depression have been shaped by iconic photos of bread lines, hungry 

Dust Bowl migrants, and the milling crowds on Wall Street on Black Monday.  We think 

of it as an American episode.  We forget it was a truly global event.  But the depth of the 

Depression in Germany exceeded that even of the United States, and the failure in 1931 

of a large Austrian bank, Credit Anstalt, was an important trigger of a wave of bank 

failures that affected many countries, including the United States.  Unfortunately, 

authorities then were ill-positioned to coordinate an effective international response, as

In the recent episode, policymakers, bankers, and business people recognized that 

the world’s economies and financial systems would sink or swim together.  I recall 

talking with bankers and business people while attending an international meeting in 

Brazil.  They told me that, in September 2008, what had been a healthy pace of business

unprecedented display of coordination, six central banks--the Federal Reserve, European 

Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada, and the central 

bank of Sweden--acted together to cut short-term interest rates.  A few days later, after
