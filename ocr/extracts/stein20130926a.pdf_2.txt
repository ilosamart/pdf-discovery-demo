Let me start by thanking the organizers for including me in this event.  It’s a great 

pleasure to be here with other old friends and colleagues to pay tribute to Raghu, and to 

congratulate him not only on winning the Deutsche Bank prize for Financial Economics, 

but also on his new job as governor of the Reserve Bank of India.  It’s an understatement 

to say that Raghu has a few challenges on his hands in this new role, but having known 

him for more than 20 years, I can’t imagine anybody being better equipped--in terms of 

intellect, judgment, and strength of character--to handle these challenges.   

I would like to talk briefly about some recent research of mine, done jointly with 

Sam Hanson of Harvard Business School, on the monetary transmission mechanism.

  As 

will become clear, our work is heavily influenced by some of Raghu’s earlier writing, and 

in particular his famous 2005 Jackson Hole paper.

  After describing what we find, I will 

try to draw some connections to the current monetary policy environment as well as some 

lessons about the interplay of monetary policy and financial stability.  As always, I am 

speaking for myself, and my views are not necessarily shared by other members of the 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

In our paper, Sam and I begin by documenting the following fact about the 

working of conventional monetary policy:  Changes in the stance of policy have 

surprisingly strong effects on very distant forward real interest rates.  Concretely, over a 

sample period from 1999 to 2012, a 100 basis point increase in the 2-year nominal yield 

on FOMC announcement day--which we take as a proxy for a change in the expected
