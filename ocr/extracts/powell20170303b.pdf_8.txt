Distributed Ledger Technologies 

 Letâ€™s turn to another type of new technology that may have important 

implications for the payments and financial systems: distributed ledger technology, 

or DLT.  Bitcoin helped bring this technology to public attention.  Using 

blockchain technology--which employs a form of DLT--and an open architecture, 

Bitcoin allows for the transfer of value (bitcoins) between participants connected to 

its ecosystem without reliance on banks or other trusted intermediaries.  This 

feature has led some to predict that DLT will in the long run render parts of the 

banking and payments system obsolete, as the intermediation of funds through the 

banking system will become unnecessary.   

Faced with these dramatic predictions, we have seen banks and market 

infrastructures collaborate with technology firms to explore the use and further 

development of DLT.  In 2016, there was widespread experimentation.  Efforts by 

financial institutions often focused on evaluating the technology, identifying 

potential uses, and conducting proofs of concept.  Prominent examples included 

the use of distributed ledgers to store transactional data and records in tamper-

proof ways, as well as the use of the technology as a primary means to hold and 

transfer money or assets.  By the end of 2016, a few major U.S. clearing
