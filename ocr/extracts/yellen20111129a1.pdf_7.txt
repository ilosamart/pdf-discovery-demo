higher in coming decades.  The dashed line in exhibit 2 shows the Congressional Budget 

Office’s long-term projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio through 2035 under current policy 

settings, including the effects of the Budget Control Act.   

It is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and 

we should not postpone charting that course.  A failure to put in place a credible plan to 

address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious 

economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner.  Timely enactment of a 

plan to put the federal budget onto a sustainable trajectory will make it easier for 

individuals and businesses to prepare for these adjustments.  In addition, the sooner our 

longer-term budget problems are addressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have 

to be and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international 

creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.   

At the same time, too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm the 

economic recovery.  Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large 

increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when 

aggregate demand is already weak.  Indeed, under current law, federal fiscal policy is 

slated to impose considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate demand next year.  We 

need, and I believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a 

well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium 

and long terms while also addressing the economy’s short-term needs.  I do not 

underestimate the difficulty of crafting a strategy that appropriately balances short-run 

needs with long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the 

U.S. economy.
