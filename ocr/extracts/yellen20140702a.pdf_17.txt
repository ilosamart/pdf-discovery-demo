measures of credit outstanding do not suggest that nonfinancial borrowers, in the 

aggregate, are taking on excessive debt and the improved capital and liquidity positions at 

lending institutions should ensure resilience against potential losses due to their 

exposures.  But we are mindful of the possibility that credit provision could accelerate, 

borrower losses could rise unexpectedly sharply, and that leverage and liquidity in the 

financial system could deteriorate.  It is therefore important that we monitor the degree to 

which the macroprudential steps we have taken have built sufficient resilience, and that 

we consider the deployment of other tools, including adjustments to the stance of 

monetary policy, as conditions change in potentially unexpected ways. 

Conclusion 

In closing, the policy approach to promoting financial stability has changed 

dramatically in the wake of the global financial crisis.  We have made considerable 

progress in implementing a macroprudential approach in the United States, and these 

changes have also had a significant effect on our monetary policy discussions.  An 

important contributor to the progress made in the United States has been the lessons we 

learned from the experience gained by central banks and regulatory authorities all around 

the world.  The IMF plays an important role in this evolving process as a forum for 

representatives from the worldâ€™s economies and as an institution charged with promoting 

financial and economic stability globally.  I expect to both contribute to and learn from 

ongoing discussions on these issues.
