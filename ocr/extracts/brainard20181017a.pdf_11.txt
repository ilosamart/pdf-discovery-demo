from financial shocks at least six months afterward.28  And the Federal Reserve SHED 

finds that 40 percent of adults report they would have difficulty covering an unexpected 

expense of $400.29

credit card self-reported that they had experienced hardship from income volatility over the past year, as 
compared to only 6 percent of those who were confident in their credit availability.
