 Turning to inflation, after a surge early last year, the price index for personal

growth, household income may not be strong enough to support sustained increases in 

consumer spending.  Government spending will likely continue to be a drag on 

economic growth going forward.  Under current federal law and most projected 

outcomes of congressional budget negotiations, some ongoing fiscal restraint seems
