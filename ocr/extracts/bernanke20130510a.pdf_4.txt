off the crisis--the proximate causes, if you will.  For the 2007-09 crisis, a prominent 

trigger was the losses suffered by holders of subprime mortgages.  In contrast, the 

vulnerabilities associated with a crisis are preexisting features of the financial system that 

amplify and propagate the initial shocks.  Examples of vulnerabilities include high levels 

of leverage, maturity transformation, interconnectedness, and complexity, all of which 

have the potential to magnify shocks to the financial system.  Absent vulnerabilities, 

triggers might produce sizable losses to certain firms, investors, or asset classes but 

would generally not lead to full-blown financial crises; the collapse of the relatively small 

market for subprime mortgages, for example, would not have been nearly as 

consequential without preexisting fragilities in securitization practices and short-term 

funding markets which greatly increased its impact.  Of course, monitoring can and does 

attempt to identify potential triggers--indications of an asset bubble, for example--but 

shocks of one kind or another are inevitable, so identifying and addressing vulnerabilities 

is key to ensuring that the financial system overall is robust.  Moreover, attempts to 

address specific vulnerabilities can be supplemented by broader measures--such as 

requiring banks to hold more capital and liquidity--that make the system more resilient to 

a range of shocks. 

Two other related points motivate our increased monitoring.  The first is that the 

financial system is dynamic and evolving not only because of innovation and the 

changing needs of the economy, but also because financial activities tend to migrate from 

more-regulated to less-regulated sectors.  An innovative feature of the Dodd-Frank Act is 

that it includes mechanisms to permit the regulatory system, at least in some 

circumstances, to adapt to such changes.  For example, the act gives the FSOC powers to
