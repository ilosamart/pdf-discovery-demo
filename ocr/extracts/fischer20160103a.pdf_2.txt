Thank you.  It is a great pleasure to be here today and to participate in this panel 

together with such a distinguished group.  

Much has happened in the world of central banking in the past 10 years.  The list 

of challenges we face is long and includes fundamental issues such as lender-of-last-

resort policies in the modern financial system, the role of central banks in the supervision 

of the financial sector, and the appropriate role of forward guidance in monetary policy 

communications.  Those are the topics I will not discuss today.

Rather, I will focus primarily on three related issues associated with the zero 

lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates and the nexus between monetary policy and 

financial stability: first, whether we are moving toward a permanently lower long-run 

equilibrium real interest rate; second, what steps can be taken to mitigate the constraints 

imposed by the ZLB on the short-term interest rate; and, third, whether and how central 

banks should incorporate financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary 

policy.1

Are We Moving Toward a World With a Permanently Lower Long-Run 

Equilibrium Real Interest Rate?

We start with a key question of the day: Are we moving toward a world with a 

permanently lower long-run equilibrium real interest rate?  The equilibrium real interest 

rate--more conveniently known as r*--is the level of the short-term real rate that is 

consistent with full utilization of resources.  It is often measured as the hypothetical real
