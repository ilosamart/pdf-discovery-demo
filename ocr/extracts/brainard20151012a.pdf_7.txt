suggest that householdsâ€™ longer-run inflation expectations have remained in a narrow 

range throughout the crisis and the recovery, although they have stayed in the lower end 

of that range over the past year.  In contrast, market-based measures of inflation 

compensation, such as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-

indexed Treasury bond yields, have declined noticeably over the past year and a half at 

longer-term horizons.  Of course, factors other than inflation expectations, such as 

changes in liquidity premiums and inflation risk premiums, may be at play.   

Although the balance of evidence thus suggests that long-term inflation 

expectations are likely to have remained fairly steady, the risks to the near-term outlook 

for inflation appear to be tilted to the downside, given the persistently low level of core 

inflation and the recent decline in longer-run inflation compensation, as well as the 

deflationary cross currents emanating from abroad--a subject to which I now turn.   

Over the past 15 months, U.S. monetary policy deliberations have been taking 

place against a backdrop of progressively gloomier projections of global demand.  The 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) has marked down 2015 emerging market and world 

growth repeatedly since April 2014.    

In the second half of 2014, persistently weak aggregate demand in Japan and the 

Euro Area led to heightened deflationary pressures.  The policy response to these 

pressures and the anticipated divergence between the policy trajectory in these economies 

and the United States contributed to a 10 percent appreciation in the dollar in inflation-

adjusted terms through the spring of this year, pushing down net exports and restraining 

activity in the United States.  Net exports subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from the
