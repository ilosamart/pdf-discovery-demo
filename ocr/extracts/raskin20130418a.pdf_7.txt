concentrated in housing.  For families in the top quintile of income, the value of 

residential properties accounted for about 15 percent of total wealth in 2010.  For families 

in the middle and lower half of the income distribution, the ratio of their home values to 

total net worth was near 70 percent.  In contrast, stock market wealth (and the value of 

other securities) constitutes a very small share of wealth for low- and middle-income 

families.   

Because the wealth of people at the lower end of the distribution is concentrated 

in housing, these households are disproportionately exposed to swings in house prices.  

This compositional effect was intensified during the housing boom, as the share of wealth 

accounted for by housing grew even faster for low- and middle-income families than for 

high-income families.  That said, the increases in homeownership and house values 

during the boom were largely financed by rising mortgage debt.  Thus, the direct positive 

effect of rising house prices on most householdsâ€™ net worth was largely offset by the 

negative effect of increased debt that households took on.  On net, mortgage debt and 

home values moved up together.  But when house prices began falling, the mortgage debt 

and repayment obligations remained.   

To be sure, the increase in mortgage debt prior to the recession occurred across all 

types of households.  But it was families with modest incomes and wealth largely in their 

homes that were the most vulnerable to subsequent drops in home values.   

The question then arises as to why households with poor income prospects sought 

out levels of mortgage debt that would ultimately prove so problematic.  Putting aside the 

practice, in the run-up to the crisis, of lenders steering households to mortgage debt 

products that were more costly than what such households may have otherwise qualified
