Implementation of the new framework will present some real-world challenges.  

National rules still need to be written, including rules for margin requirements on 

noncentrally cleared derivatives.  These national rules will need to deal with local legal 

regimes and markets, yet also be internationally consistent to ensure a level playing field.  

More broadly, international cooperation will be needed to ensure that the new framework 

works in practice.
