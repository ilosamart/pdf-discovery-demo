Meeting the Challenge of Scaling Back Accommodation 

By 2014, the U.S. economy was making notable progress toward the FOMC’s 

goals of maximum employment and price stability.  The unemployment rate had dropped 

to 6 percent by midyear--well below its Great Recession peak of 10 percent--and other 

measures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement.  In 

addition, inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures, had reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering 

around 1 percent in the fall of 2013.  Reflecting that progress, the Federal Reserve’s 

focus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling 

it back.7  A key question for the FOMC then was how to reduce the degree of 

accommodation in the context of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.   

One possible approach was to start by reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities 

holdings while short-term interest rates remained at the lower bound.  We could allow 

securities to roll off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and even sell securities, thereby 

putting upward pressure on long-term rates while calibrating the pace and configuration 

of the reduction in our holdings as warranted by our maximum employment and price 

stability objectives.  Eventually, once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently, the 

FOMC could start nudging up its short-term interest rate target. 

One problem of this “last in, first out” approach was that the FOMC does not have 

any experience in calibrating the pace and composition of asset redemptions and sales to 

actual and prospective economic conditions.  Indeed, as the so-called taper tantrum of
