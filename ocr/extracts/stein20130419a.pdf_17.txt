LOLR while at the same time allowing for a safety valve in a period of stress.  The limit 

case of this approach is one where the CLF counts toward the LCR only in a crisis. 

Conclusion 

By way of conclusion, let me just restate that liquidity regulation has a key role to 

play in improving financial stability.  However, we should avoid thinking about it in 

isolation; rather, we can best understand it as part of a larger toolkit that also includes 

capital regulation and, importantly, the central bankâ€™s LOLR function.  Therefore, proper 

design and implementation of liquidity regulations such as the LCR should take account 

of these interdependencies.  In particular, policymakers should aim to strike a balance 

between reducing reliance on the LOLR on the one hand and moderating the costs 

created by liquidity shortages on the other hand--especially those shortages that crop up 

in times of severe market strain.  And, as always, we should be prepared to learn from 

experience as we go.
