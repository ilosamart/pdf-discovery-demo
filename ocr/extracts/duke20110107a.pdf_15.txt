us to drain reserves if necessary.  In particular, we can drain large volumes of reserves by 

replacing them with repurchase agreements and term deposits.  Finally, we can always 

sell the securities we purchased.  Such sales would not only drain reserves but would also 

put direct upward pressure on longer-term rates. 

Conclusion 

Overall, the recovery in economic activity to date has been uneven and has not 

been sufficient to reduce unemployment noticeably.  But I am encouraged by signs that 

the recovery may have gained traction recently.  And I believe that sustained gains in 

consumer spending and business investment and a further easing of credit conditions will 

reinforce each other, leading to greater confidence and improving the prospects for an 

extended expansion that, over time, will reduce unemployment to a level consistent with 

full employment.  At the same time, I anticipate that inflation will remain subdued.  

Finally, I believe that the actions taken by the FOMC to support the economic recovery 

are appropriate, and I am confident in our commitment to monitor economic conditions 

and take action as needed.
