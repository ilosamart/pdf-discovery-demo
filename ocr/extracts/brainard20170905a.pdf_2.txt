Overall, the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, against the backdrop of the 

first synchronized global economic growth we have seen in many years and 

accommodative financial conditions.  This benign outlook is clouded somewhat by 

uncertainty about government funding and the fiscal outlook, and geostrategic risk has 

risen.  While the heartbreaking human toll exacted by Hurricane Harvey is already all too 

clear, it will take some time to assess the macroeconomic impact.   

The labor market continues to bring more Americans off the sidelines and into 

productive employment, which is a very welcome development.  Nonetheless, there is a 

notable disconnect between signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full 

employment and a string of lower-than-projected inflation readings, especially since 

inflation has come in stubbornly below target for five years.  With normalization of the 

federal funds rate under way and the start of gradual balance sheet normalization widely 

anticipated, I will want to take some time to assess the path of the federal funds rate that 

will best support a sustainable move in inflation to our 2 percent goal.1  Sustainably 

achieving our inflation objective is especially important, given the apparent persistently 

low level of the neutral rate and the resulting limited room for maneuver above the 

effective lower bound.

pickup in business investment this year compared with last year.  Investment in the 

equipment and intellectual property category has risen at an annual rate of 6 percent so
