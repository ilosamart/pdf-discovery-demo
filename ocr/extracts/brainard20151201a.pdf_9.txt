neutral rate.  To the extent that investors or firms are more attuned to the risks associated 

with capital investments than before the financial crisis, it increases the premium for 

risky investments, or the difference in return between a risk-free investment, such as 

overnight reserves, and somewhat riskier investment opportunities.  A higher risk 

premium necessitates a lower risk-free rate to encourage the same amount of riskier 

investments as previously.  Consistent with this explanation, there is evidence that the 

gap between the return to capital investment and the risk free rate has risen.  For example, 

according to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models estimated by the Federal 

Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the natural rate of interest 

has been held down during the recovery by shocks that increase the difference between 

the marginal product of capital and the risk free rate, pushing down investment and 

reducing the level of capital.14  In addition, a simple measure of the marginal product of 

capital suggests that the return to capital investment has not changed very much, or 

perhaps has even increased, over the past decade despite the decline in risk free rates.15 

Implications for the Path of Monetary Policy 

Before addressing what a persistently low neutral interest rate might mean for the 

normalization of monetary policy, it is helpful to review inflation developments.  Because 

the federal funds rate is the real rate plus the expected rate of inflation and because it is 

the real rate that influences economic activity, the amount of monetary accommodation 

represented by a given nominal level of the federal funds rate decreases as expected 

inflation declines.  In a low neutral rate environment, it is especially important to guard 

                                                 
14 See Del Negro and others (2015).  In these models, the natural rate of interest is defined as the “rate of 
interest that would obtain if all prices and wages had adjusted so as to bring the level of economic activity 
to its full-employment rate.”
