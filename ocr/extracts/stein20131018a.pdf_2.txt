Thank you.  The theme of this conference is, “Lessons from the Financial Crisis 

for Monetary Policy.”  Given the opportunity to speak about this topic, my first thought 

was that I should organize my remarks around the familiar “lean versus clean” debate.1  

The traditional, pre-crisis framing of the question went something like this: Should 

policymakers rely on ex ante measures to lean against potential financial imbalances as 

they build up, and thereby lower the probability of a bad event ever happening, or should 

they do most of their work ex post, focusing on the clean-up? 

 Post-crisis, the emphasis in the debate has shifted.  I think it’s safe to assume that 

nobody in this room would now argue that we should be putting all our eggs in the 

“clean” basket.  Discussion these days tends to focus instead on which ex ante measures 

are best suited to safeguard financial stability.  Among these, there seems to be 

widespread support for unconditional, (i.e., time-invariant) tools that increase the overall 

resiliency of the financial system to shocks.  These tools include more robust capital and 

liquidity requirements, as well as an enhanced capability to resolve a large financial 

institution that finds itself on the brink of failure.  They might also include universal 

margin requirements on securities financing transactions, as a way of mitigating fire-sales 

risks.  We might argue about various aspects of calibration and implementation, but I 

don’t think there is too much controversy about the basic proposition that strong, 

comprehensive regulation aimed at enhancing resiliency is essential. 

 There is considerably less agreement about the desirability and effectiveness of ex 

ante measures that seek to lean against the wind in an explicitly time-varying fashion—

Open Market Committee.  I am grateful to Tim Clark, Andreas Lehnert, Nellie Liang, Ben McDonough, 
and Lisa Ryu for their input.
