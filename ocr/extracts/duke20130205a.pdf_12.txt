 Lending is the primary source of income for most community banks and also the greatest 

source of risk.  As you develop your business plans, some of the most important decisions you 

will make relate to lending.  In the planning process, banks should define the portion of the 

lending portfolio they plan to allocate to different loan categories, the investments they are 

willing to make to develop expertise and to manage credit and compliance risk, and the levels of 

credit and interest rate risk they are willing to assume.  So I thought it might be helpful to review

to have engaged in many of the more problematic practices that led to the crisis.  And their rate 

of seriously delinquent residential mortgage loans is significantly lower than the overall rate of
