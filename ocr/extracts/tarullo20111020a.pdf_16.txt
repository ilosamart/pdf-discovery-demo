everyone has toned down their expectations.  I think the better metaphor is of an 

economy slogging through the mud and occasionally hitting stretches of dry pavement, 

which may well have been associated with the peak effects of fiscal and monetary policy 

initiatives.  The economyâ€™s difficulty in gaining traction is, of course, due in no small part 

to the continued high levels of unemployment and underemployment, which constrain 

demand through both direct effects on household income and indirect effects in sapping 

consumer confidence.   

Yet it seems quite likely that there is something at work beyond an adverse 

feedback loop involving personal consumption expenditures, investment, and 

employment.  The obvious candidate for that additional factor is the high amount of  

debt--particularly household debt--that accumulated before the financial crisis.  With the 

bursting of the housing bubble, debt levels that may have looked manageable to 

consumers who believed their homes were appreciating suddenly appeared burdensome 

as house prices declined.  In some parts of the country, this decline was dizzyingly rapid.  

There has been some progress in working off or writing down some forms of debt, such 

as credit card balances.  But housing continues to hang like an albatross around the necks 

of homeowners and the economy as a whole, with millions of underwater mortgages, a 

staggering inventory of foreclosed homes, and depressed levels of sales.

first be said that neither monetary nor fiscal policy will be able to fill the whole aggregate 

demand shortfall quickly.  But appropriate policies could surely boost output and 

employment.  There have also been suggestions that attempts to boost aggregate demand 

will be unsuccessful when the amount of debt overhang is significant.  I agree that
