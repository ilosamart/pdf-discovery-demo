ongoing basis until banks are satisfied holding the aggregate quantity of reserves that is 

available.   

Recent research by the Board staff shows that banks currently display a 

significant degree of heterogeneity in their approaches to meeting their LCR 

requirements, including in their chosen volumes of reserve balances.11  Figure 2 shows a 

subset of this research to illustrate this point.  The top and bottom panels represent 

estimates of how two large banks have been meeting their HQLA requirements over time.  

In each panel, the blue portions of the bars denote the share of HQLA met by reserve 

balances, while the red, yellow, and brown slices of the bars represent the share met by 

Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and other HQLA-eligible assets, 

respectively.  Despite holding roughly similarly amounts of HQLA, the two banks exhibit 

very different HQLA compositions, with the bank depicted in the top panel consistently 

holding a much larger share of HQLA in the form of reserve balances than the bank 

shown in the bottom panel.  This finding suggests that there likely is no single 

“representative bank” behavioral model that can capture all we might want to know about 

banks’ demand for central bank reserve balances.   

Some of the differences we see in bank behavior likely relate to banks’ individual 

liquidity needs and preferences.  Indeed, banks manage their balance sheets in part by 

taking into account their internal liquidity targets, which are determined by the 

interaction between the specific needs of their various business lines and bank 

management’s preferences.  In any case, this picture illustrates the complexities that are
