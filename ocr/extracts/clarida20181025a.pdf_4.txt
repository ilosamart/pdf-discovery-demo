that lower the cost of capital as well as by continued strong profitability of U.S. 

companies.  While capital investment is one important source of productivity growth and 

recent data on this front are encouraging, predicting future--or even identifying 

past--inflection points in productivity growth is notoriously difficult.  Although it may be 

tempting simply to extrapolate a decade of disappointing productivity data into a distant 

future, a pickup in trend productivity growth is a possibility that deserves close 

monitoring.2   

Let me now turn to the job market and inflation outlook.  Average monthly job 

gains continue to outpace the increase needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the 

labor force over the longer run.  At 3.7 percent in September, the unemployment rate has 

not been this low since 1969.  In addition, after remaining stubbornly sluggish throughout 

much of the expansion, wage growth is picking up.  A sustained rise in inflation-adjusted, 

or “real,” wages at or above the pace of productivity growth is typical in an economy 

operating in the vicinity of full employment, and we are starting to see some evidence of 

this.  I certainly hope it continues.  Now, some might see a rise in wages as leading to 

upside inflationary pressures, but here, again, the experience of earlier cycles is 

instructive.  In the past two U.S. expansions, gains in real wages in excess of productivity 

growth were not accompanied by a material rise in price inflation.  

Of course, this time may be different, and as with growth, the job market could 

perform better or worse than the baseline outlook.  However, for now, the increase in 

wages has been broadly consistent with the pickup in productivity growth that I have just
