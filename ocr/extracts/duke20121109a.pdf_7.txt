In evaluating the effect of regulation on community banks, I divide the potential burden 

into three categories: (1) additional operational costs associated with compliance; (2) restrictions 

on fees, interest rates, or other forms of revenue; and (3) unintentional barriers to offering a 

service that are a result of regulatory complexity.  Each of these effects is of some concern, but 

to me the most disturbing is the third category.  If the effect of a regulation is to make a 

traditional banking service so complicated or expensive that significant numbers of community 

banks believe they can no longer offer that service, it should raise red flags and spur 

policymakers to reassess whether the potential benefits of the regulation outweigh the potential 

loss of community banksâ€™ participation in that part of the market.  Unfortunately, my discussions 

with community bankers lead me to believe that we might be approaching that point with 

residential mortgage lending regulation.  

I have thought a lot about how we have come to this point.  I think it is because both the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and its 

implementing regulations attempt to avoid a repeat of the lending abuses that were identified in 

the crisis by using characteristics that were common in subprime lending as proxies for 

identification of problematic loans.  While this is an understandable approach given the abuses in 

subprime lending, it fails to recognize that many of these same characteristics, such as higher 

interest rates or balloon payments, also are key aspects of traditional community bank portfolio 

lending.  But, as I will discuss later, these features in community bank lending do not appear to 

have resulted in nearly the level of borrower stress that was prevalent in subprime loans. 

Community banks have long been a source of loans that, for a variety of reasons, do not 

fit the parameters of conforming government-sponsored enterprise loans or eligibility for 

government-guaranteed programs.  Community banks typically hold these loans on their own
