lending practices that led to the crisis.  Even so, the changes are so sweeping that many industry 

analysts have questioned whether the overall weight of regulation poses a threat to the future of 

the community bank model. 

 I do believe in the community bank model and its future.  Indeed, I believe there is a real 

place for the customization and flexibility that community banks can exercise to meet the needs 

of local communities and small business customers.  Still, the disproportionate cost of regulatory 

compliance for smaller institutions is real.  Financial supervisors must be vigilant in efforts to 

maintain financial system stability and ensure that consumers are able to understand their 

financial product choices, no matter where they choose to bank.  However, as we and other 

agencies craft regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and adjust supervisory practices to meet these priorities, I think 

we must avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to supervision. 

 To this end, the Federal Reserve last year formed a subcommittee of the Board to oversee 

the supervision of community and small regional banking organizations.  I chair the 

subcommittee and am joined in this effort by Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, who complements 

my community banking background with her experience as a banking lawyer and a state bank 

supervisor.  In addition, in 2010 the Federal Reserve formed the Community Depository 

Institution Advisory Council (CDIAC) with membership drawn from smaller banks, thrifts, and 

credit unions.  Council members meet with the Federal Reserve Board twice a year to share their 

perspectives on the lending environment, regulatory issues, and the economy.1

provides a regional perspective to Reserve Bank management.  See
