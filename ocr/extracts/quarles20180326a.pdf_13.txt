study these shifts, and share the common goal of improving the current supervisory and 

regulatory framework for CRA to further the statute’s core objective of promoting access to 

credit and financial inclusion.   

Conclusion 

Finally, I’ll note that we will continue to learn about issues concerning financial inclusion 

through our research, such as by collecting new data in our Survey of Household Economics and 

Decisionmaking and Survey of Consumer Finances that I mentioned earlier.  The information we 

gather helps us better understand factors affecting consumers and households, including low- and 

moderate-income and historically underserved populations.  We also continue to convene experts 

and practitioners from industry, academia, and community-based organizations to help provide 

context on what we are seeing in the data, to identify emerging issues, and to consider where 

there may be data gaps and opportunities for additional research.  In addition to yielding 

important insights that inform our policymaking, we hope these efforts can support the 

conversations you are having at conferences like this one.   

Thank you, again, for inviting me to speak at your conference as we mark the notable 

anniversaries that this year brings.  Together, our work clearly has a great deal of synergy, and I 

thank you for your efforts.  Making the economy work for the benefit of all Americans, including 

lower-income communities, is of the utmost importance.
