financial stability and the benefits of international banking.  The degree to which we or, I 

presume, other jurisdictions will remain comfortable with this balance will depend on two 

factors.  The first factor is the degree to which local branches are used by foreign banks as 

significant sources of unstable funding or for other risky purposes.  While this has been a 

significant issue in the United States, it is less clear that other jurisdictions face similar risks.  

The second is the confidence host jurisdiction regulators have that the parent banks are subject to 

effective regulatory and supervisory oversight. 

Developments since the Crisis 

The profound shift in political and policy environments as a result of the financial crisis 

has led to considerable strengthening of minimum international standards for internationally 

active banks, at both national and international levels.  Basel III enhanced the quantity and 

quality of capital requirements and introduced, for the first time, quantitative liquidity standards.  

Following completion of Basel III, the Basel Committee developed a structure of slightly 

misleadingly named capital “surcharges,” which requires global systemically important banks 

(GSIBs) to maintain higher capital levels.6   

The Federal Reserve supported all these measures but was a particularly strong advocate 

of the capital surcharges, which established the new principle that some international prudential 

standards should be progressively more stringent as the systemic importance of a bank increases.  

In meeting its responsibility to promote domestic financial stability, the Federal Reserve last year 

followed the lead set by the European Union some years previously and adopted a regulation 

requiring subsidiaries of GSIBs engaged in traditional banking as well as those engaged in 

                                                 
6 I say “misleadingly” called capital surcharges because that term implies the banks are faced with a “charge” that 
has to be paid to someone.  In fact, of course, the requirement is that the bank retain higher capital buffers in order to 
increase its resiliency.
