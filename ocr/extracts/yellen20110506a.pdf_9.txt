capital inflows during the 1990s are often cited as an example of an approach that other 

countries might use.  But studies of these controls, including by staff members at the 

Central Bank of Chile itself, suggest that the success of the Chilean controls was mixed.  

The controls did shift the composition of flows away from assets with shorter maturities, 

but the effects on the volume of flows and the exchange rate--two key goals of the 

controls--are less clear.8  Some evidence also suggests that the controls harmed small 

firms in Chile by reducing the availability of financing and raising interest rates.9 

 In addition, the incentives to circumvent capital controls are powerful when the 

returns that these flows might reap are large.  In the extreme, controls can lead to rent-

seeking behavior or, worse, result in corruption among public officials.10  Controls can 

also result in unintended distortions in prices in other financial markets or in goods prices 

as investors use those markets to try to move funds into or out of a country.  Moreover, 

global capital flows have increased dramatically in recent decades.  Although these 

substantial flows are the very reason that many countries wish to impose capital controls, 

the size of the flows--as well as the sophistication of investors who might seek to 

circumvent controls--means that countries that avoid opening up may face higher and 

higher costs in trying to control them.   

 Finally, capital controls have global implications, as restricting financial openness 

can impede current account adjustment and thus hinder the world economy from reaching 

a more balanced equilibrium.  Indeed, as I have noted in an earlier speech, the current 

international monetary system is a mixture of economies, some with open capital 

accounts and flexible exchange rates, and others with managed exchange rates, more-
