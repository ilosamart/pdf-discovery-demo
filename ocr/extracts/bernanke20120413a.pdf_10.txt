The gaps in statutory authority had the additional effect of limiting the 

information available to regulators and, consequently, may have made it more difficult to 

recognize the underlying vulnerabilities and complex linkages in the overall financial 

system.  Shadow banking institutions that were unregulated or lightly regulated were 

typically not required to report data that would have adequately revealed their risk 

positions or practices.  Moreover, the lack of preexisting reporting and supervisory 

relationships hindered systematic gathering of information that might have helped 

policymakers in the early days of the crisis. 

A broader failing was that regulatory agencies and supervisory practices were 

focused on the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions or markets--what 

we now refer to as microprudential supervision.  In the United States and most other 

advanced economies, no governmental entity had either a mandate or sufficient 

authority--now often called macroprudential authority--to take actions to limit systemic 

risks that could result from the collective behavior of financial institutions and markets.  

Gaps in the statutory framework were an important reason for the buildup of risk 

in certain parts of the system and for the inadequate response of the public sector to that 

buildup.  But even when the relevant statutory authorities did exist, they were not always 

used forcefully or effectively enough by regulators and supervisors, including the Federal 

Reserve.  Notably, bank regulators did not do enough to force large financial institutions 

to strengthen their internal risk-management systems or to curtail risky practices.  The 

Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, undertaken in the spring of 

2009 and popularly known as the “stress tests,” played a critical role in restoring 

confidence in the U.S. banking system, but it also demonstrated that many institutions’
