loans.  I have spoken to many small business owners in Hampton Roads and across the 

country who say that without such low interest rates, they might not have survived the 

severe economic downturn.  In addition, in response to the Fed’s moves, the nationwide 

average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped from 6-1/2 percent to below 

5 percent, the lowest level since the 1940s, and rates remain near historic lows.  The low 

rates have helped some people buy a home for the first time and others to refinance.  In 

2009, millions of households refinanced their mortgages, thus reducing their monthly 

payments and giving them more money to spend, reduce debt, or save.  For example, on a 

$200,000 30-year mortgage, refinancing from a 6.5 percent mortgage into one with a 

5 percent rate saves the homeowner $190 a month, or nearly $2,300 a year--a significant 

difference. 

 But, as we all know, lower interest rates only help if you can actually get a loan.  

And as the financial crisis unfolded, credit began to shut down for even the best 

borrowers.  So while lowering interest rates helped, we knew we had to do more. 

Providing Liquidity 

I don’t want to give you a full laundry list of all the actions we have taken to help 

restore the flow of credit--it’s been tough keeping track of all the acronyms for the 

programs we have set up in response to the crisis--but I’ll mention a few of the most 

important.   

For centuries, central banks have calmed financial crises by lending to financial 

institutions against good collateral.  Because central banks step in when other sources of 

funds retreat, central banks acting in this capacity are known as lenders of last resort.  

Banks rely on short-term funding such as overnight interbank loans or customer deposits
