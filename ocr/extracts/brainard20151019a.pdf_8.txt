Stress Tests for Regional Banks 

One additional item that I would consider worthy of congressional consideration 

in the EGRPRA context would be the stress tests currently performed by smaller, 

regional lenders, or those above $10 billion in assets but less than $50 billion in assets.  It 

might be worthwhile to examine the prudential benefits--the additional insights gained by 

us as supervisors as well as by the banksâ€™ senior managers from the stress tests--against 

the opportunity costs in terms of compliance measures and the allocation of management 

and examination resources for both supervisors and those banks.  And I look forward to 

discussing this in the coming months.   

In considering these issues, it is also important to underscore that we are already 

tailoring our expectations for the stress tests to the lower risk profile of smaller banking 

institutions, and the stress tests currently performed by these institutions should in no way 

be designed to mimic the more comprehensive and extensive stress testing program for 

larger and more complex institutions, particularly the Comprehensive Capital and 

Analysis Review (CCAR) program. 

Examination Cycle 

We are also examining whether there may be scope to extend examination cycles 

for community banks with lower risk profiles and in some areas have already taken 

action.  For example, the Federal Reserve recently revised our consumer compliance 

examination frequency policy to lengthen the time frame between on-site consumer 

compliance and CRA examinations for lower-risk community banks with less than $1

increasing the number of healthy, well-managed community institutions that could
