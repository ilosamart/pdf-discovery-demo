“Asia’s Role in the Post-Crisis Global Economy” 


Asia Economic Policy Conference Sponsored by

November 29, 2011 





Good morning.  I’m delighted to return “home” to the Federal Reserve Bank of 

San Francisco and honored to kick off the Bank’s second Asia Economic Policy 

Conference.  

In my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened 

international policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the 

global economy--a theme that received emphasis at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Leaders’ 

Summit in Cannes earlier this month.  The global economy is facing critical challenges.  

The recovery in the United States and other advanced economies has been proceeding too 

slowly to provide jobs for millions of unemployed people.  There have also been clear 

signs of slowing growth in emerging market economies over the past year.  In effect, we 

face a dearth of aggregate demand, not just among the advanced economies, but also for 

the global economy as a whole.

In ordinary times, policymakers in the advanced countries would address such a 

demand shortfall with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.  But these are no 

ordinary times.  Central banks in a number of advanced economies, including the United 

States, have brought short-term interest rates close to zero, so that further monetary 

accommodation can be provided only through unconventional tools, such as securities 

purchases and forward policy guidance.  Meanwhile, the scope for fiscal stimulus is 

limited by concerns about sizable budget deficits and longer-term sustainability.   

At the G-20 summit earlier this month in Cannes, the United States and other 

advanced economies--including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United 

                                                 
1 I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff members Shaghil Ahmed, Eric Engen, William English, 

Joseph Gruber, Steven Kamin, Michael Leahy, Andrew Levin, Trevor Reeve, and David Wilcox for their 

assistance in preparing these remarks.

Kingdom--agreed to pursue fiscal consolidation plans to place public finances on a 

sustainable course over the medium term while sustaining the near-term recovery.  

Indeed, in the current environment of weak demand, near-term fiscal consolidation could 

threaten the economic recovery, which in turn may undermine the success of the fiscal 

strategy.  In such circumstances, economies with the capacity to stimulate global 

growth--namely, countries with large current account surpluses and the potential to 

expand domestic demand--must take a leading role in adopting policies to rebalance and 

sustain the global economy.  This commitment was made by all of the G-20 leaders, 

including those from China, Indonesia, South Korea, and other emerging markets.   

In the remainder of my remarks, I will point out some key factors that have been 

restraining the pace of U.S. economic growth, and I will discuss the need for fiscal 

adjustments to place our federal budget on a sustainable path over the medium term 

without impairing the economic recovery.  I will then turn to a consideration of the 

crucial role of the Asian economies in fostering a stronger global recovery.  Of course, 

these remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the 

Federal Reserve System. 

U.S. Economic Growth 


Since the middle of 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the most 

severe recession and financial crisis to afflict our country since the Great Depression.  

However, the pace of the economic recovery has been less vigorous than desired or 

expected, and the unemployment rate has declined only about 1 percentage point over the 

past two years.  Indeed, the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 

million below the peak level reached in early 2008--a distressing development made all 




- 3 - 

the worse by the fact that new entrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor 

force in recent years.  The fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for 

six months or more stands at a very high level.  In addition to those officially 

unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out 

of the labor force entirely.   

The pace of economic growth in the second half of this year has been somewhat 

faster than in the first half, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had 

weighed on growth earlier in the year.  Nonetheless, a range of more-persistent factors 

also appear to be restraining the recovery.  In recognition of these drags, the consensus of 

professional forecasters in the survey released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Philadelphia was that unemployment would decline only slightly in the next few 

years, to an average rate of 8.4 percent in 2013.  Moreover, financial market conditions 

have deteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the 

economy. 

At the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending contracted sharply and the 

personal saving rate began a steep ascent.  Exhibit 1 shows that the saving rate rose from 

around 2-1/2 percent in 2006 to about 5 percent in the first half of this year.  It now 

appears that consumer spending is advancing at a moderate pace.  In the pre-crisis years, 

consumer spending grew rapidly, providing considerable impetus to the expansion.  In 

contrast, over the next few years, consumer spending seems unlikely to serve as one of 

the main engines of growth.  The ratio of household debt-to-income remains 

exceptionally high, even though over the past few years it has declined slightly from the 

post-World War II peak reached prior to the crisis.  Although households appear to have 




- 4 - 

made some progress in deleveraging, many still face elevated debt burdens and reduced 

access to credit.  Moreover, high levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow 

gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have 

weighed on household spending and diminished the ability of households to tap home 

equity in emergencies or for other purposes.  Consumer sentiment dropped markedly over 

the summer and remains quite depressed, apparently reflecting households’ concerns 

about the broader economy as well as their own financial situations.  

A sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the previous recession, and this 

sector continues to weigh on the recovery.  Robust increases in housing activity have 

helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions since World War II.  This time, in 

contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed 

and distressed properties either currently available for purchase or probably soon to 

become so, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, and concerns 

about the possibility of further declines in home prices.  As a result, new home 

construction currently is at only about one-third of its average pace in recent decades.  In 

addition, homeowners with insufficient equity in their homes have found it difficult to 

take advantage of today’s low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages.  Recently 

announced changes to the federal government’s Home Affordable Refinance Program, or 

HARP, are designed to improve the opportunity for homeowners to refinance and I’m 

hopeful this program will succeed in reducing household debt service burdens and the 

flow of foreclosures.  More generally, I see a strong case for additional policies to foster 

more-rapid recovery in the housing sector.  Indeed, to provide greater support for 




- 5 - 

mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve recently adjusted its program for reinvesting its 

securities holdings.   

The Federal Reserve continues to provide highly accommodative monetary 

conditions to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.   

Moreover, the scope remains to provide additional accommodation through enhanced 

guidance on the path of the federal funds rate or through additional purchases of longer-

term financial assets.   

Challenges for U.S. Fiscal Policy 

Turning now to U.S. fiscal policy, with the onset of the recent recession and 

financial crisis, the federal budget deficit widened significantly and has remained wide.  

Exhibit 2 shows that, as a result, federal debt held by the public has increased relative to 

our national income to a level not seen in the past half-century.  These budget 

developments have reflected both the weak economy, which has depressed revenues and 

pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the 

recession and support the recovery.  So long as the economy continues to recover, the 

deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues 

and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus 

continue to wind down.  Even so, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) will 

continue to edge higher over the next decade unless the Congress and the Administration 

are able to agree on a program of deficit reduction that is more ambitious than the targets 

incorporated in last summer’s Budget Control Act.  Looking yet further out, it is apparent 

that, absent significant policy shifts, budget pressures resulting from the aging of the U.S. 

population and fast-rising health-care costs will continue to push the federal debt ratio 




- 6 - 

higher in coming decades.  The dashed line in exhibit 2 shows the Congressional Budget 

Office’s long-term projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio through 2035 under current policy 

settings, including the effects of the Budget Control Act.   

It is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and 

we should not postpone charting that course.  A failure to put in place a credible plan to 

address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious 

economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner.  Timely enactment of a 

plan to put the federal budget onto a sustainable trajectory will make it easier for 

individuals and businesses to prepare for these adjustments.  In addition, the sooner our 

longer-term budget problems are addressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have 

to be and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international 

creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.   

At the same time, too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm the 

economic recovery.  Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large 

increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when 

aggregate demand is already weak.  Indeed, under current law, federal fiscal policy is 

slated to impose considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate demand next year.  We 

need, and I believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a 

well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium 

and long terms while also addressing the economy’s short-term needs.  I do not 

underestimate the difficulty of crafting a strategy that appropriately balances short-run 

needs with long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the 

U.S. economy.

The Key Role of the Emerging Asian Economies 

In light of the various factors weighing on aggregate demand in the United States 

and other advanced economies, I believe it is crucial for emerging market economies, 

particularly in Asia, to take further steps to boost domestic demand, providing support for 

their own growth and that of the global economy.  Indeed, such policies are a core 

component of the G-20 nations’ commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. 

Of course, emerging Asia has already made an important contribution to 

bolstering the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis.  The top panel of 

exhibit 3 shows that even though the emerging Asian economies were hit quite hard by 

the global downturn, they recovered much more quickly than did other parts of the world.  

The full extent of the Asian bounceback can perhaps best be appreciated by comparing 

the level of output in Asia, shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, with those in 

advanced economies and other emerging market economies.  Asia’s output level--the 

solid line--has increased substantially from its barely perceptible trough.  Output in other 

emerging market economies--the dashed line--has also increased significantly.  In 

comparison, output in the advanced economies--the dotted line--has not yet attained its 

pre-crisis peak.     

A key factor contributing to the relatively rapid recovery of the Asian emerging 

market economies was that, in contrast to many previous episodes of severe stress, these 

economies were well-positioned to permit the use of countercyclical fiscal and monetary 

policies.  Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances in emerging Asian economies fell noticeably 

in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a more expansionary fiscal stance; fiscal stimulus was 




- 8 - 

particularly large in China, India, and Singapore.  Monetary policy was also eased 

substantially throughout emerging Asia.  

Partly as a result of those policy measures, the growth of the emerging Asian 

economies over the past several years appears to have relied less on external demand 

from the advanced economies.  The top panel of exhibit 4 shows that the shares of 

exports in nominal GDP in the Asian economies have trended downwards since 2006 

following a decade of solid increases.  However, trade balances in the region (shown in 

the bottom panel of the exhibit) generally remain in surplus, notwithstanding some recent 

narrowing in several countries.  These surpluses suggest that, on balance, the Asian 

economies continue to add more to global supply than to global demand.   

Crucially, private consumption as a share of output still remains quite low in 

several emerging Asian economies.  Exhibit 5 shows that China’s consumption share--the 

solid line--which was already well below that of other major economies in 2000, has 

fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of its GDP.
2
  Private consumption 

shares in other emerging Asian economies--the dashed line--are also significantly below 

those in the advanced economies--the dotted line--and have not moved up in the wake of 

the global financial crisis.   

Measures to boost private consumption would appear to benefit not only the 

global economy, but also the emerging Asian economies themselves.  China and other 

emerging market economies have already taken some steps to promote household 

consumption, but the progress on this front has been slow and further measures are 

warranted.  Indeed, at the G-20 Cannes summit, China pledged to rebalance its demand

toward domestic spending through policies to bolster household income and strengthen 

social safety nets, and Indonesia and Korea each made similar commitments to facilitate 

the process of global rebalancing.   

What are some specific policy measures that could be helpful?  First, increased 

public spending on social services, such as education, health care, and retirement 

benefits, could spur consumption by reducing the need for precautionary household 

saving.  In China, some redistribution of the profits of state-owned enterprises to the 

central government through larger dividend payments could provide revenue to support 

such spending.  Second, government support could be shifted away from manufacturing 

toward encouraging service-sector development, which has typically lagged behind in 

these economies.  Services tend to have a higher non-traded component, so faster growth 

of this sector would help rebalance growth toward domestic demand.  Third, additional 

development spending could be directed toward these countries’ poorest regions; for 

example, China has recently strengthened its efforts in this area.   

The case for boosting investment rates in Asian emerging economies to support 

global demand is less clear-cut.  At about 45 percent of GDP, Chinese investment rates 

are now so high that the return on new investment may already be quite low in some 

sectors.  In a number of other countries, however, investment rates are only at about the 

average of those in the advanced economies.  It seems plausible that, with their lower 

capital-to-labor ratios, investment rates should be higher in some emerging Asian 

economies.  Indeed, some have argued that infrastructure needs remain extremely 

pronounced in many emerging market economies, and that a wave of investment may be 




- 10 - 

in the offing for the world’s developing economies.
3
  With low interest rates throughout 

the world, this would certainly seem to be a propitious time for countries to pursue 

productive capital investment. 

Finally, exchange rate adjustments will play a crucial role in boosting emerging 

Asia’s contribution to global demand.  Indeed, the G-20 leaders welcomed China’s 

determination to increase exchange rate flexibility and to carry out its plans to increase 

convertibility of the renminbi capital account.  Such flexibility is crucial if Asian 

domestic demand is to be expanded without exacerbating inflationary pressures.  

Exchange rate appreciation channels demand toward foreign products, thereby creating 

the scope for policies to expand domestic demand without exacerbating inflationary 

pressures.  More generally, exchange rate flexibility makes it easier for monetary policy 

to respond to domestic considerations and to achieve price stability.  Perhaps most 

important, since the ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve standards of living, 

allowing the currency to appreciate can help ensure that a greater proportion of output is 

devoted to household consumption, enabling social welfare to improve at a faster pace.    

Conclusion 

 To sum up, growth in advanced nations, including the United States, faces serious 

headwinds.  Households are still deleveraging, corporations are reluctant to invest, and 

fiscal consolidation is needed over time to place public finances on a sustainable course.  

Despite some pickup in growth in the United States during the second half of the year, 

the outlook is for unemployment to diminish only slowly, remaining painfully high for

many years to come.  These developments have also affected emerging market 

economies, where there are now clear signs of slowing growth.  In addition, downside 

risks to global growth have increased significantly because of rising financial market 

pressures, reflecting an intensification of stress in European banking and sovereign debt 

markets as well as broader concerns about the outlook.   

These circumstances call for concerted domestic policy actions to boost growth 

and create jobs.  Indeed, as I already noted, we at the Federal Reserve are moving 

vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery.  However, monetary policy is not a 

panacea, and it is essential for other policymakers to also do their part.  In particular, 

there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing 

market.  Stronger housing demand has the potential to boost recovery.  The Congress and 

the Administration also can support the recovery in the near term while simultaneously 

putting fiscal policy on a sustainable trajectory in the long term.   

As I have emphasized in this talk, there is also an urgent need for policy action 

from a number of countries.  In Europe, forceful action is essential to address the region's 

fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only to growth but also to global 

financial stability.  In addition, many emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, 

have the scope to bolster domestic demand.  Such policies would support stronger, more 

balanced, and more sustainable global economic growth; they would enhance social 

welfare at home as well.  The most profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past 

several decades has been to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.  Further 

actions to boost aggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained.
