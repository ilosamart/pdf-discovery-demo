Let me begin by thanking President Lockhart and the organizers of the Financial 

Markets Conference for inviting me to speak here again this year.  I have participated 

regularly in this conference and have always found it stimulating. 

Four years ago, in remarks at this very conference, I described the 2009 

Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, popularly known as the bank stress 

tests.

  The SCAP marked the first time the U.S. bank regulatory agencies had conducted 

a supervisory stress test simultaneously across the largest banking firms.

  At the time of 

my 2009 speech, we had just published the results of the SCAP and were still evaluating 

its effects.  In retrospect, the SCAP stands out for me as one of the critical turning points 

in the financial crisis.  It provided anxious investors with something they craved:  

credible information about prospective losses at banks.  Supervisors’ public disclosure of 

the stress test results helped restore confidence in the banking system and enabled its 

successful recapitalization.  The resilience of the U.S. banking system has greatly 

improved since then, and the more intensive use and greater sophistication of supervisory 

stress testing, as well as supervisors’ increased emphasis on the effectiveness of banks’ 

own capital planning processes, deserve some credit for that improvement.  

 I will begin today with a brief discussion of the state of U.S. banking.  I will then 

turn to the subject of what we have learned about stress testing in the four years since the 

SCAP, with a focus on the increasingly central role it is playing in bank supervision in 

the United States.  Importantly, as I will elaborate, stress testing adds a macroprudential
