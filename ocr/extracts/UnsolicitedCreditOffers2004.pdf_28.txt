the credit limits established for a revolving account when they report account information 
to CRAs (although not always, particularly in the past). Summing the reported credit 
limits on each revolving account available to an individual gives an estimate of the 
aggregate credit limit on accounts of this type for each individual. In those cases in 
which creditors fail to report the credit limit on the account to the CRA, the typical 
industry practice is to assume that the highest balance ever reported as owed on the 
account is the limit, and that approach is employed here. 

Sorting the opt-out list according to credit limit on revolving accounts shows that about 
13 percent of the individuals in the top quintile of credit-line holders have opted out of 
receiving additional prescreened solicitations. Only 4 percent of individuals with a total 
revolving credit line in the bottom quintile have opted out. 

Total Balances and Utilization Rate on Revolving Accounts 

Another measure of credit availability and use is the amount actually owed on revolving 
credit accounts. In this case, the sample of credit records shows that those in the highest 
quintile of individuals arrayed by balances owed are more likely to opt out of further 
prescreened solicitations than individuals in the lower quintiles. The ratio of balance 
outstanding to the total credit limit for each individual permits construction of an overall 
credit “utilization rate.” When evaluating the credit risk posed by a prospective borrower, 
creditors often consider such a ratio. In this case, the sample data indicate that those 
individuals with utilization ratios in the middle range are about twice as likely to opt out 
as those with ratios at the extremes. Individuals with credit utilization rates in the lowest 
and highest quintiles may desire additional credit opportunities and so they may be less 
likely to opt out. 

Number of Mortgage Accounts 

Credit records also include information on mortgages. The sample data indicate that 
about one-fourth of the individuals represented had a mortgage loan outstanding. About 
11 percent of the individuals with a mortgage in good standing have placed their names 
on the opt-out list, compared with 5 percent among those who do not have such a 
mortgage. 

Credit Score 

Most individuals have good credit histories, as reflected in the distribution of credit 
scores across the population of individuals with credit records (table 3 and figure 2). 
Assuming they satisfy other underwriting requirements, such individuals pose relatively 
little credit risk to prospective lenders. Creditors vary somewhat in the thresholds they 
use to identify individuals who pose relatively little credit risk, but in general those with
