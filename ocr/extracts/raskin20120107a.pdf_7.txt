residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing.2  The OCC and the Office 

of Thrift Supervision simultaneously issued actions against mortgage servicers, resulting 

in enforcement actions against 14 banking institutions with mortgage servicing 

operations.   

The enforcement actions are cease and desist orders and are legally enforceable in 

federal court.  The enforcement orders require, among other things, the mortgage 

servicers to submit corrective action plans addressing the errors discovered during the 

targeted reviews and to implement practices designed to prevent future abuses in the loan 

modification and foreclosure process.  The plans must be acceptable to the Federal 

Reserve.  And to be acceptable, for example, the plans must detail ways the mortgage 

servicer will increase and enhance the staffing and other resources allocated to the 

mortgage servicer’s loan modification and foreclosure departments.  Such requirements 

relate to the failure of mortgage servicers to provide adequate staffing to carry out 

residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation, and foreclosure activities.  The 

increased resources required by the enforcement orders are meant to improve a 

homeowner’s ability to readily obtain information and assistance from the mortgage 

servicer and to decrease errors made by mortgage servicers when modifying loans or 

pursuing foreclosures.  The corrective action plans also must address other significant 

mortgage servicing and foreclosure-governance shortfalls and must be designed to ensure 

compliance with state and federal mortgage servicing and foreclosure laws.  They must 

also improve foreclosure management information systems; establish robust controls and
