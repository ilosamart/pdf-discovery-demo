 The stresses in financial markets and liquidity shortages were severe.  So, in 

addition to cutting policy rates, the Federal Reserve took measures designed to provide 

liquidity first to banks and later to other financial institutions.  A third set of measures 

involved the provision of liquidity to address pressures in commercial paper markets and 

at money market funds.  These liquidity programs were largely unwound when financial 

markets improved.   

 As the Federal Reserve and other central banks worked to address liquidity 

shortages in their own markets, it became clear that, as a result of globalization, firms 

were experiencing funding shortages not only in domestic currencies, but in foreign 

currencies as well.  In particular, dollar funding shortages appeared not just in the United 

States but in countries around the world, which, in turn, exacerbated pressures in U.S. 

funding markets.  The Federal Reserve already was providing liquidity to foreign 

financial firms operating in the United States through its discount window and other 

facilities.  To further address pressures in dollar funding markets and support the flow of 

credit to U.S. families and businesses, the Federal Reserve ultimately approved bilateral 

currency swap arrangements with 14 foreign central banks, including two Latin American 

central banks.2  Under these swap arrangements, in exchange for their own currencies, 

foreign central banks obtained dollars from the Federal Reserve to lend to financial 

institutions in their jurisdictions.  These swap arrangements pose essentially no risk to the 

Federal Reserve:  They are unwound (with a fee paid by the central bank drawing on the 

swap arrangement to the Federal Reserve) at the exact same exchange rate that applied to 

the original transaction, they are conducted with major central banks with track records of 

                                                 
2 The 14 central banks were those in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the euro area, South Korea, 
Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
