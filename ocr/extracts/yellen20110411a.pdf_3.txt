leads to the conclusion that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should move 

promptly toward firmer monetary conditions.  Indeed, some have even raised the specter 

of a return to the high inflation of the 1970s in arguing for the urgency of monetary 

policy tightening. 

 Increases in energy and food prices are, without doubt, creating significant 

hardships for many people, both here in the United States and abroad.  However, the 

implications of these increases for how the Federal Reserve should respond in terms of 

monetary policy must be considered very carefully.  In my remarks today, I will make the 

case that recent developments in commodity prices can be explained largely by rising 

global demand and disruptions to global supply rather than by Federal Reserve policy.   

Moreover, empirical analysis suggests that these developments, at least thus far, are 

unlikely to have persistent effects on consumer inflation or to derail the recovery.  

Critically, so long as longer-run inflation expectations remain stable, the increases seen 

thus far in commodity prices and headline consumer inflation are not likely, in my view, 

to become embedded in the wage and price setting process and therefore are not likely to 

warrant any substantial shift in the stance of monetary policy.  An accommodative 

monetary policy continues to be appropriate because unemployment remains elevated, 

and, even now, measures of underlying inflation are somewhat below the levels that 

FOMC participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with our statutory 

mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.   

 While I continue to anticipate a gradual economic recovery in the context of price 

stability, I do recognize that further large and persistent increases in commodity prices 

could pose significant risks to both inflation and real activity that could necessitate a
