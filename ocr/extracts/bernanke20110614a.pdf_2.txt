I am pleased to speak to a group that has such a distinguished record of 

identifying crucial issues related to the federal budget and working toward bipartisan 

solutions to our nationâ€™s fiscal problems.  Today I will briefly discuss the fiscal 

challenges the nation faces and the importance of meeting those challenges for our 

collective economic future.  I will then conclude with some thoughts on the way forward. 

Fiscal Policy Challenges 

At about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the federal budget deficit 

has widened appreciably since the onset of the recent recession in December 2007.  The 

exceptional increase in the deficit has mostly reflected the automatic cyclical response of 

revenues and spending to a weak economy as well as the fiscal actions taken to ease the 

recession and aid the recovery.  As the economy continues to expand and stimulus 

policies are phased out, the budget deficit should narrow over the next few years.   

Unfortunately, even after economic conditions have returned to normal, the nation 

faces a sizable structural budget gap.  Both the Congressional Budget Office and the 

Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget project that the budget deficit will be 

almost 5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2015, assuming that current budget policies are 

extended and the economy is then close to full employment.1  Of even greater concern is 

that longer-run projections that extrapolate current policies and make plausible 

assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show the structural budget gap 

increasing significantly further over time.  For example, under the alternative fiscal 

scenario developed by the Congressional Budget Office, which assumes most current 

policies are extended, the deficit is projected to be about 6-1/2 percent of GDP in 2020 

and almost 13 percent of GDP in 2030.  The ratio of outstanding federal debt to GDP,
