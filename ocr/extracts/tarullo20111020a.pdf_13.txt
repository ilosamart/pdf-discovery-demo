factor, as sharp increases in layoffs overwhelm the matching process.  It may also be that 

during serious downturns, more workers who would have given up looking for a job 

continue to look in order to qualify for  extended and emergency unemployment benefits, 

or that employers take longer to fill vacancies when the labor market is weak.9   

An analysis by Federal Reserve Board economists that decomposes the shift in the 

Beveridge curve into its various components does point to some increase in structural 

unemployment related to a reduction in the efficiency with which unemployed workers 

are matched to vacant jobs--that is, mismatch.10  However, the estimated increase is fairly 

modest--on the order of 1 percentage point--relative to the total increase in the 

unemployment rate experienced in recent years.  The remainder appears mainly related to 

the delays in filling open positions that I mentioned a moment ago. 

Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducted a broader study 

of the mismatch issue.  By examining imbalances between the occupations, industries, 

and geographic locations in which vacancies are concentrated and those in which 

unemployment is concentrated, they constructed an index of potential mismatch.  They, 

too, concluded that mismatches accounted for only a small amount of the increase in the 

unemployment rate during the recession--on the order of ¾ to 1½ percentage points.11
