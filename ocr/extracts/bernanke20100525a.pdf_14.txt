Conclusion 

 As a result of the crisis, countries around the world are implementing significant 

financial and regulatory reforms.  Such reforms that reduce the chance of a future crisis 

and that mitigate the effects of any crisis that does occur are worthy of our full support.  

As we move along the path of reform, however, it is crucial that we maintain the ability 

of central banks to make monetary policy independently of short-term political influence.  

In exchange for this independence, central banks must meet their responsibilities for 

transparency and accountability.  At the Federal Reserve, we will continue to work to 

facilitate public understanding of both our monetary policy decisions and our actions to 

ensure the soundness of the financial system.
