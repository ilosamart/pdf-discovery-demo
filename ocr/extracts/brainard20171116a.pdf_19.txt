secure and leaves consumers in the driver’s seat.48  In many cases, banks themselves were often 

the original customers of data aggregators, and many continue to use these services.  According 

to public filings, more than half of the 20 largest banks are customers of data aggregators.49  The 

banks have an opportunity as customers of data aggregation services to ensure that the terms of 

data provision protect consumers’ data and handle it appropriately.  

Regulators also recognize that there may be opportunities to provide more clarity about 

how the expectations about third-party risk management would work in this sector, as well as 

other areas experiencing significant technological change.  Through external outreach and 

internal analysis, we are working to determine how best to encourage socially beneficial 

innovation in the marketplace, while ensuring that consumers’ interests are protected.  We 

recognize the importance of working together and the potential to draw upon existing policies, 

norms, and principles from other spaces. Consumers may not fully understand the differences in 

regulations across financial products or types of financial institutions, or whether the rules 

change when they move from familiar search and e-commerce platforms to the fintech stack. 

Consumers, as well as the market as a whole, will benefit if regulators coordinate to provide 

more unified messages and support the development of standards that serve as a natural 

extension of the common-sense norms that consumers have come to expect in other areas of the 

commercial internet.
