Discussion 

The large size and unique structure of the FOMC have important implications for 

our communications.  The Committee has seats for up to 19 participants, up to 12 of 

whom hold votes at any given time.  Governors are appointed by the President and 

confirmed by the Senate.  Reserve Bank Presidents are appointed by the Banks’ private-

sector board members who are not affiliated with commercial banks, subject to approval 

by the Board of Governors.  This unique federated structure was designed to ensure a 

diversity of views, among other purposes.  My strong view is that this institutionalized 

diversity of thinking is a strength of our System.  My own experience is that the best 

outcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and strongly presented 

before decisions are made.  The Committee’s diversity shows through most clearly at 

times such as these, when economic conditions have been particularly challenging and 

when there have been significant policy disagreements. 

Our communications are intended to enable the public to better understand how 

the Committee sees the economic situation and outlook, as well as what the Committee is 

likely to do if incoming data differ from that outlook--the Committee’s “reaction 

function.”  My sense is that market participants and other members of the public focus 

instead mainly on the timing of the next policy change or on how many policy moves will 

occur in a given year.  It also seems that the public may not fully appreciate the 

uncertainty that surrounds the outlook.  In addition, market participants often say that 

there are too many voices saying too many different things about policy--the cacophony
