innovations of the first and second Industrial Revolutions.  But now, despite continued 

technological advances, a return to that pace of performance is thought unlikely.  In 

particular, these authors argue that the information technology revolution of the past 

several decades--including the diffusion of computers, the development of the Internet, 

and improvements in telecommunications--is unlikely to generate the productivity gains 

prompted by earlier innovations such as electrification and mass production.   

This somewhat pessimistic perspective is far from being conventional wisdom.  

While productivity has increased less rapidly in recent years than during the first three-

fourths of the 20th century, per capita income (a statistic available over a longer time 

span) is still rising more quickly than it was even during the second Industrial 

Revolution.  Indeed, some have argued that the problem with new technology is not with 

productivity growth but with our ability to capture the productivity in our statistics.  

Moreover, many economists and technophiles remain optimistic that we have yet to fully 

realize the potential of the information revolution, and that technological change will 

continue to bring inventions and productivity enhancements that we cannot imagine 

today.3  This view holds that there is no reason productivity could not continue to rise in 

line with its long-term historical average.4
