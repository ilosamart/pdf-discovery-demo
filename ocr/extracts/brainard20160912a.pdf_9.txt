amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now 

much lower than before the crisis.   

In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical 

headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the 

neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent.  But seven 

years into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the 

low neutral rate looks likely to persist.  Indeed, developments over the past year confirm 

that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12  Foreign consumption and 

investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated 

demand for safe assets.  Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate 

of nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average 

over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor 

force.   

Recognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps 

the most consequential change in the SEP forecasts.  In the four years between June 2012 

and June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from 

4.25 percent to 3.0 percent--nearly one-third.  Over one-third of that adjustment has 

occurred between December 2015 and June 2016.  It is notable that this recent step-down 

in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a 

stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes 

in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function.
