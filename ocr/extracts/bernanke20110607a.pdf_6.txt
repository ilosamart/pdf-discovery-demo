consumer prices for gasoline and other energy products and, to a somewhat lesser extent, 

for food.  Overall inflation measures reflect these price increases:  For example, over the 

six months through April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures has 

risen at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent, compared with an average of less than 1 

percent over the preceding two years. 

Although the recent increase in inflation is a concern, the appropriate diagnosis 

and policy response depend on whether the rise in inflation is likely to persist.  So far at 

least, there is not much evidence that inflation is becoming broad-based or ingrained in 

our economy; indeed, increases in the price of a single product--gasoline--account for the 

bulk of the recent increase in consumer price inflation.1  Of course, gasoline prices are 

exceptionally important for both family finances and the broader economy; but the fact 

that gasoline price increases alone account for so much of the overall increase in inflation 

suggests that developments in the global market for crude oil and related products, as 

well as in other commodities markets, are the principal factors behind the recent 

movements in inflation, rather than factors specific to the U.S. economy.  An important 

implication is that if the prices of energy and other commodities stabilize in ranges near 

current levels, as futures markets and many forecasters predict, the upward impetus to 

overall price inflation will wane and the recent increase in inflation will prove transitory.  

Indeed, the declines in many commodity prices seen over the past few weeks may be an 

indication that such moderation is occurring.  I will discuss commodity prices further 

momentarily. 

                                                 
1 Through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation over the previous six months was 
3.6 percent at an annual rate; excluding gasoline, inflation over that period was 2 percent.  Over a 12-month 
span, inflation through April was 2.2 percent; excluding gasoline, it was 1.2 percent.
