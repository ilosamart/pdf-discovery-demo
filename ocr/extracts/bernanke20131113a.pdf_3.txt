quickly came to understand that students are most motivated to learn when they can see 

the connection of the lesson to their own lives.  The Fed and its activities, and economics 

in general, can seem remote from daily concerns.  But as teachers, you can show students 

how the Federal Reserve’s decisions concretely affect them and their families.  The Fed’s 

actions influence the overall strength and stability of the economy, as you know, but they

like to know more about the lives of ordinary people at those times, not just about kings 

and queens and presidents.  In college and graduate school, I studied economic history 

and found what I was looking for.  For me, economic history added critical context by 

zooming in on the conditions of ordinary life--how people earned their livings, what their 

wages would buy, the extent to which they felt economically secure, the pace of

and elections--as well.   

By the same token, understanding history also requires an appreciation of the role 

of key economic institutions, including central banks like the Federal Reserve.  When I 

was in graduate school, my teacher, Stanley Fischer, introduced me to the work of Milton 

Friedman and Anna Schwartz, which demonstrated that monetary policy can have
