• Although the BCBS and the FSB reached impressively rapid agreement on 

needed changes in regulation and supervision, progress in agreeing on the 

resolution of G-SIFIs and some other aspects of international coordination has 

been slow.   

• Regulators almost everywhere need to do more research on the effectiveness of 

microprudential and other tools that could be used to deal with macroprudential 

problems.   

• It will be important to ensure that coordination among different regulators of the 

financial system is effective and, in particular, will be effective in the event of a 

crisis.   

• A great deal of progress has been made in dealing with the TBTF problem.  

While we must continue to work toward ending TBTF or the need for 

government financial intervention in crises, we should never allow ourselves the 

complacency to believe that we have put an end to TBTF.   

• We should recognize that despite some imperfections, the Dodd-Frank Act is a 

major achievement.   

• At the same time, we need always be aware that the next crisis--and there will be 

one--will not be identical to the last one, and that we need to be vigilant in both 

trying to foresee it and seeking to prevent it. 


And if, despite all our efforts, a crisis happens, we need to be willing and prepared 

to deal with it.
