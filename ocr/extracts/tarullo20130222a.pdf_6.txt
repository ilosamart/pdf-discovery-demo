 Macroprudential Regulation.  A second challenge for central banks is that the crisis 

revealed the need for a much more active set of macroprudential monitoring and regulatory 

policies--that is, a reorientation toward safeguarding financial stability through the containment 

of systemic risk.  The failure to attend to, or even recognize, financial stability risks was perhaps 

the most glaring public sector deficiency in the pre-crisis period.  This was a fault by no means 

limited to central banks.  On the contrary, systemic risk had also come to seem more theoretical 

than real to many academics and financial market participants.  Even most of those inside and 

outside the official sector who argued for stronger capital or other prudential standards did not 

appreciate the degree to which the secondary mortgage market had turned into a house of cards.  

Still, regardless of formal mandates, central banks are better positioned than most other 

government agencies to see and evaluate the emergence of asset bubbles, excessive leverage, and 

other signs of potential systemic vulnerability.   

 In some respects this second challenge is an extension of the first, since the safety and 

soundness of large institutions must take account of the relative correlation of their asset 

holdings, interconnectedness, common liquidity constraints, and other characteristics of large 

banking organizations as a group.  Similarly, systemic risks and too-big-to-fail problems can 

increase if large, highly leveraged firms may operate outside the perimeter of statutory 

microprudential oversight, as was the case prior to 2008 with the large, free-standing investment 

banks in the United States.  And market discipline will be badly compromised if financial market 

participants believe that an insolvent counterparty cannot be resolved in an orderly fashion and 

thus is likely to receive government assistance under stress. 

 Here again, domestic and international efforts have already produced significant reform 

programs, though implementation of some of these programs is less advanced than Basel 2.5 and
