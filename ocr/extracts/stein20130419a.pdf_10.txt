A more complicated case is when the regulator does not know ahead of time what 

the costs of building and installing scrubbers will be.  Here, mandating the use of a fixed 

number of scrubbers is potentially problematic:  If the scrubbers turn out to be very 

expensive, the regulation will end up being more aggressive than socially desirable, 

leading to overinvestment in scrubbers and large cost increases for consumers; however, 

if the scrubbers turn out to be cheaper than expected, the regulation will have been too 

soft.  In other words, when the cost of the mitigation technology is significantly 

uncertain, a regulatory approach that fixes the quantity of mitigation is equivalent to one 

where the implicit tax rate bounces around a lot. 

By contrast, a regulatory approach that fixes the price of pollution instead of the 

quantity--say, by imposing a predetermined proportional tax rate directly on the amount 

of pollution emitted by the plant--is more forgiving in the face of this kind of uncertainty.  

This approach leaves the scrubber-installation decision to the manager of the plant, who 

can figure out what the scrubbers cost before deciding how to proceed.  For example, if 

the scrubbers turn out to be unexpectedly expensive, the plant manager can install fewer 

of them.  This flexibility translates into less variability in the effective regulatory burden 

and hence less variability in the price of energy to consumers.12 

Scrubbers and High-Quality Liquid Assets 

What does all this imply for the design of the LCR?  Let’s work through the 

analogy in detail.  The analog to the power plant’s energy output is the gross amount of 

                                                 
12 On the flip side, however, the same flexibility means that there will be more variability in the total 
amount of pollution generated by the plant--because when costs of mitigation are high, less mitigation will 
be done.  So in the face of uncertainty, one cannot conclude that a price-based tax regime is necessarily 
superior to a quantity-based mitigation regime.  This reasoning follows the classic analysis of Weitzman;
