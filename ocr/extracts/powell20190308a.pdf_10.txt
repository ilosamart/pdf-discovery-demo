Among other initiatives, my colleagues and I on the FOMC are undertaking a 

year-long review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices.  The review will involve a series of “Fed Listens” events 

around the country.  These will include town-hall-style meetings and a conference where 

academic and nonacademic experts will share their views.  These events will inform staff 

work and FOMC discussions as we plan for the future.  While this is the first time the 

Fed has opened itself up in this way, many central banks around the world have 

conducted similar reviews, and our approach builds on their experiences. 

We believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has 

generally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes.  

Consistent with the experience of other central banks with these reviews, the process is 

more likely to produce evolution rather than revolution.  We seek no changes in law and 

we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the Fed, or in the 2 

percent inflation objective.  While there is a high bar for adopting fundamental change, it 

simply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public as part of 

a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability. 

Without ruling out other topics, we have highlighted three questions that seem 

particularly important at present (figure 4):   

1.  Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its 

existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to 

reverse past misses of the inflation objective?
