Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, it is great to be back in New 

York.  The Citizens Budget Commission has played an important role over the years as a 

forum to discuss issues of interest to New Yorkers that are often also of national and even 

global importance.  Given New York’s preeminence as a center of global finance, I 

thought it would be appropriate to discuss just such a topic, which is how the Federal 

Reserve oversees the largest financial institutions, many of which are headquartered or 

have a major presence here, and how that oversight has strengthened since the financial 

crisis.1   

The Financial Crisis and Large Financial Institutions 

The crisis had many causes, including the numerous factors that drove a lengthy 

housing boom and the expansion of a largely unregulated “shadow banking system” 

rivaling the traditional banking sector in size.  A self-reinforcing financial panic 

magnified the damage from risks that had built up over many years throughout the 

country and across the financial system.   

But to a considerable extent, large and complex financial institutions were the 

epicenter of the crisis.  These institutions, some of which were not subject to Federal 

Reserve oversight at the time, were the locus for much of the excessive risk-taking that 

led to the crisis.  Due to their primacy and interconnections with the rest of the financial 

system, these large institutions were also the means by which the crisis spread quickly 

and with devastating effect through the economy.   

1 Although the Federal Reserve supervises entities with a range of legal forms, including depository 
institutions and holding companies, for the purposes of my remarks today, “financial institutions,” “firms,” 
“banks,” and “banking organizations” are used interchangeably unless indicated otherwise.
