Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak this evening.  I would like to 

discuss ongoing efforts to reform the current structure and uses of the London Interbank 

Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR.  These reforms affect not only the 

financial industry, but also a large number of U.S. households and corporations.   

LIBOR is a reference rate.  When two parties enter a financial contract in which 

interest payments are to be exchanged, they frequently choose to base those payments on 

LIBOR.  LIBOR is currently referenced in roughly $300 trillion worth of contracts 

globally, which means that it is part of the global financial system’s critical 

infrastructure.1  But LIBOR’s credibility was badly undermined by the scandal that 

erupted when some of the banks that help produce the rate attempted to manipulate it by 

contributing inaccurate estimates of their borrowing costs.  These illegal actions helped 

damage the public’s trust not just in LIBOR, but also in financial markets and institutions 

more broadly.   

In response, a number of global efforts to reform reference rates have been 

undertaken.  LIBOR is produced and administered in London.  As a result of the steps 

taken by the government of the United Kingdom, LIBOR is now regulated and 

supervised by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The International 

Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) developed a broad set of 19 principles 

that reference rates and other financial benchmarks are now expected to meet.2  Building 

on this work, in July, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) released a report outlining a
