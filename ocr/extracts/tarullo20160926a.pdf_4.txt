considerations are to effective risk management and the soundness of these firms, we are 

progressively integrating the qualitative elements of CCAR into our year-round supervisory 

program for the largest banking organizations.  

Under CCAR, the Federal Reserve may object to a firm’s capital plan on either 

quantitative or qualitative grounds.  A quantitative objection is made when the stress test reveals 

that a firm would not be able to maintain its post-stress capital ratios above the regulatory 

minimum levels over the planning horizon, taking into account its planned capital distributions.  

We have taken planned distributions into account because, as the run-up to the financial crisis 

revealed, firms may be reluctant to cut their distributions--particularly dividends--even in a 

period of growing stress.  Thus, CCAR included what has been called a “pre-funding” 

requirement. 

The Federal Reserve may object on qualitative grounds if it finds that the firm’s capital 

planning processes are not sufficiently reliable.  The qualitative assessment includes the 

assumptions and analyses underlying each firm’s capital plan, its controls and governance 

processes, and whether previously identified weaknesses in management and operations have 

been corrected.  If the Federal Reserve objects on quantitative or qualitative grounds, the firm 

may not make any capital distributions without our permission.  In practice, in the case of a 

qualitative objection, we have generally permitted distributions at the previous year’s level but 

no increases.  This practice, however, has been in the context of distributions rising from 

generally low levels coming out of the crisis; there has been no guarantee that a similar practice 

would prevail as distributions continue rising. 

 The quantitative component of CCAR, based as it is on the DFAST stress tests, has 

contributed to the continued strengthening of the capital levels of the largest financial institutions
