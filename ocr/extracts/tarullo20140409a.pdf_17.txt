strong investment agenda would not be a complete response to the economic challenges I 

have discussed.  But, like monetary policy, it could play a useful role. 

Conclusion 

The longer-term challenges to the American economy that I have identified this 

evening are real.  But I certainly do not regard a continuation of these trends as 

inevitable.  On the contrary, the American economy is still possessed of great advantages 

and potential that, while always and necessarily evolving, have served us well over the 

years.20  My principal aims this evening have been, first, to echo those who have been 

drawing attention to these challenges in recent years and, second, to encourage more 

discussion and debate of the specific policies that can best help us meet these challenges.  

As should be apparent in my remarks on monetary policy and an investment agenda, I 

believe that there are policies already developed and available to us that can contribute to 

this effort.  My hope is that such policies will be pursued and that others, perhaps yet to 

be developed, will follow. 

                                                 
20 These advantages--such as the country’s substantial natural resources, a stable but adaptive legal 
framework for economic activity, a dynamic labor market, and a fostering of entrepreneurship--have 
contributed to productivity growth that is estimated to have averaged about 2-1/4 percent over the past 
140 years.  See David M. Bryne, Stephen D. Oliner, and Daniel E. Sichel (2013), “Is the Information 
Technology Revolution Over?” International Productivity Monitor, No. 25 (Spring), pp. 20-36.
