We have heard the request to achieve a meaningful reduction in the burden 

associated with regulatory reporting, and we are taking action.  In early September, the 

Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) detailed steps regulators are 

taking to streamline and simplify regulatory reporting requirements for community banks 

and reduce their reporting burden.  As an initial step to streamline some reporting 

requirements, the federal banking agencies, under the auspices of the FFIEC, are seeking 

comment on proposals to, in part, eliminate or revise several Call Report data items.  

Additionally, the federal banking agencies are evaluating the feasibility and merits of 

creating a streamlined version of the quarterly Call Report for community banking 

organizations. 

The Federal Reserve Board is conducting a separate review of the FR series of 

reports for holding companies to identify unnecessary burden.  Of course, any changes to 

the bank Call Report forms will likely be reflected with corresponding changes to the 

Bank Holding Company FR Y-9 reports, but there are additional reports for holding 

companies that are included in our broader review.   

Small Bank Holding Company Policy Threshold 

The Federal Reserve Board has taken action to address burden concerns from 

community banks by expanding the universe of small bank holding companies covered 

by the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.  In December 2014, following 

congressional action, the Federal Reserve amended its regulation to raise the total asset 

threshold for the policy statementâ€™s applicability from $500 million to $1 billion in total 

consolidated assets.  As a result, more than 700 holding companies (that are not engaged 

in complex activities) are now exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements,
