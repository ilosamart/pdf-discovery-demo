alternatives to the use of credit ratings.8   

II. Risk-Based Capital Standards 

 In June 2009, the agencies, as part of the international Joint Forum Working 
Group on Risk Assessment and Capital, participated in a stocktaking exercise to identify 
the use of credit ratings in relevant statutes, regulations, policies and guidance.9  The 
agencies have identified multiple regulations that must be brought into compliance with 
Section 939A of the Act.  Included among these regulations are the agencies’ risk-based 
capital standards.  

 The agencies’ risk-based capital standards reference credit ratings issued by 
NRSROs (credit ratings) in four general areas: (1) the assignment of risk weights to 
securitization exposures under the general risk-based capital rules and advanced 
approaches rules;10 (2) the assignment of risk weights to claims on, or guaranteed by, 
qualifying securities firms under the general risk-based capital rules;11 (3) the assignment 
of certain standardized specific risk add-ons under the agencies’ market risk rule;12 and 
(4) the determination of eligibility of certain guarantors and collateral for purposes of the 
credit risk mitigation framework under the advanced approaches rules.13  In 2008, the 
agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking14 that sought comment on 
implementation in the United States of certain aspects of the standardized approach in the 
Basel Accord.  The Basel standardized approach for credit risk (Basel standardized 
approach) relies extensively on credit ratings to assign risk weights to various exposures.  
(Throughout the rest of this ANPR, references to the Basel standardized approach are 
references to the Basel Accord rather than the 2008 proposal.)    

 In 2009, the Basel Committee published the following documents that were 
designed to strengthen the risk-based capital framework in the Basel Accord: Revisions to 
the Basel II Market Risk Framework (Revisions Document); Enhancements to the Basel 
II Framework (Enhancements Document); and Strengthening the Resilience of the 
Banking Sector.15  In the Enhancements Document, the Basel Committee introduced

the use of external credit ratings in the regulations of the OCC.
