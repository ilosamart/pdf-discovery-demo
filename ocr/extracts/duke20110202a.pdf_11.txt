Bank has a board of directors drawn from business, public, labor, nonprofit, and banking 

leadership within its district.  In consultation with the Board of Governors, the Reserve 

Bank directors choose a president to run the bank.3  The Board of Governors oversees the 

Reserve Banks and is responsible for formulating bank regulations; supervising banks; 

and for making decisions regarding lending, other than discount window lending, to 

depository institutions.4   

The Reserve Banks provide financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. 

government, and foreign official institutions, including making discount window loans 

and playing a major role in operating the nation’s payments system.  Under delegated 

authority from the Board, the Reserve Banks also conduct on-site supervision of bank 

holding companies and state-chartered banks that choose to join the Federal Reserve 

System.   

Monetary policy decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC).  While all 12 Reserve Bank Presidents and all members of the Board of 

Governors participate in FOMC discussions, the voting members of the FOMC are made 

up of the members of the Board of Governors, the President of the New York Reserve 

Bank, and four of the remaining Presidents on a rotating basis.5 

The culture of the Federal Reserve is an interesting blend of government, 

academia, and business.  Differences of opinion regularly occur, but they are a source of 

strength rather than conflict within the institution.  They add liveliness to the debate and 

                                                 
3 Each Federal Reserve Bank’s Class B and Class C directors appoint a president. See section 4(4), 
subparagraph “Fifth,” of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by section 1107 of Pub. L. No. 111-203 
(2010).
