interest rates and the space to cut interest rates in what could become a downward spiral.6  So we 

need to be especially careful to preserve as much of our conventional policy space as we can, 

while exploring mechanisms to augment the effectiveness of our framework.7 

Maximum Employment in the New Normal 

The new normal has some important benefits.  With subdued inflation, the sustained 

expansion has drawn workers back into the labor market after a damaging recession.  The 

unemployment rate is approaching a 50-year low, and the overall labor force participation rate 

has remained constant despite the long-term aging of the population that would otherwise be 

pushing participation lower.   

Like the overall unemployment rate, broader measures of labor market slack are also 

lower than their pre-crisis levels.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 measure shows that two 

groups have recently shrunk to pre-crisis levels after rising considerably during the recession:  

those working part time who would prefer full-time employment and people marginally attached 

to the labor force who have looked for work in the previous year but stopped looking more 

recently.  The strong labor market is leading to employment gains among workers with
