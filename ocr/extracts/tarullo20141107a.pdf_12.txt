organizational convenience.  Nor is it only a means for promoting consistency of treatment 

among similar banks throughout the Federal Reserve System, important as that goal is.  As with 

tiered regulation, this tiered approach to supervision is intended to take account of differences in 

business models, risks, relative regulatory burden, and other salient considerations.  Where 

specific regulatory goals for the different portfolios vary, the supervisory programs should reflect 

those differences.  And where the goals are similar across portfolios, supervisory programs 

should take account of the differences among banks noted a moment ago.  A tiered approach to 

prudential regulation calls not for a single state of the art in supervision, but for distinct state-of-

the-art approaches to each supervisory portfolio.  Some important implications for community 

bank supervision follow from this principle. 

First, the characteristics and business model of community banks must be reflected in the 

supervisory program.  Detailed rules, regulations, and supervisory expectations are clearly 

needed at times for overseeing the systems created in large, geographically dispersed 

organizations where the distance from head office to operating branches can be very far indeed.  

But in a well-run community bank where the president may oversee a relatively small staff and 

can communicate and enforce expectations and standards face-to-face, some kinds of supervisory 

expectations needed for larger banks may be unnecessary.  In fact, such supervision can be 

burdensome, because community banks have a smaller balance sheet across which to amortize 

compliance costs.  Such rules can also sometimes conflict with the flexibility that is important to 

community banks meeting their customers’ needs.  For instance, community banks should 

readily comply with expectations that they extend credit on safe and sound terms.  However, to 

the extent that supervisors dictate the precise details of what terms are safe and sound, banks
