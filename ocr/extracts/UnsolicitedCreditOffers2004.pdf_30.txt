10 percent of individuals with credit scores above 700 have opted out, but only 3 percent 
of those with credit scores below 550 have done so. In the aggregate, 77 percent of all 
individuals who have opted out have credit scores above 700, whereas about 60 percent 
of the entire sample has a credit score in that elevated range. Almost 88 percent of all 
individuals who have opted out may be considered prime borrowers (credit scores above 
660), whereas about 73 percent of all individuals in the sample are in that category. 

As noted, not every individual in the Board sample of credit records has a credit score. 
Of the individuals who were not scored (mostly because of a sparse credit history), only 
0.2 percent opted out, compared with 7.6 percent of the scored individuals. The lower 
incidence of opting out among the individuals without credit scores may simply indicate 
that these individuals receive and review fewer prescreened solicitations and hence may 
have fewer opportunities to become aware of the opt-out option. Alternatively, such 
individuals may be relatively more interested in building their credit records by obtaining 
new credit and may be less interested in pursuing the opt-out option. 

Number of Collection Items and Public Records 

The number of collection items in an individual’s credit record is an important indicator 
of credit risk. More than one-third of the individuals in the sample data had one or more 
collection items in their credit records; these individuals are somewhat more likely to opt 
out than individuals with no reported collection actions—7.3 percent versus 5.8 percent. 

The number of public records in an individual’s credit record is also an important 
indicator of credit risk. Most individuals in the sample (88 percent) did not have any 
public-record actions in their credit records. The sample data indicate that individuals 
with one or more records of a public action are somewhat more likely to opt out than 
other individuals, but the difference is not particularly large—7.3 percent versus 6.2 
percent. 

Number of Recent Inquiries about Credit or Insurance 

Finally, credit records contain data on inquiries made about an individual’s credit 
circumstances. The information includes the identities of firms or individuals who 
request such information (for example, landlords or prospective employers), the date of 
the inquiry, and an indication of the purpose of the inquiry. Most inquiries arise when an 
individual is seeking credit and the prospective creditor or insurer contacts a CRA about 
the individual’s current credit status. 

Not every use of a credit file results in a lasting record of an inquiry. For example, only 
inquiries made over the previous two years are included in credit records. In addition, 
inquiries made in the course of sending prescreened solicitations or to monitor existing 
account relationships do not appear on the credit report used for prescreening. Also not
