Looking Ahead 

Of course, the structure of the Treasury market will continue to evolve, along with 

changes in technology and the broader financial environment.  Looking forward, we will 

need to ask more of the data as we seek to understand what is next for the structure of the 

Treasury market.  As I mentioned earlier, experimentation with new protocols is 

occurring now.  Although all-to-all trading in the Treasury market was contemplated at 

the first conference, direct streaming largely was not, which might prompt us to ask what 

else is on the horizon.   

In addition to direct streaming, another development that bears watching is the 

batch auction platforms that have arisen in the voice IDB market, something that has not 

received as much attention from market participants.  Started after the financial crisis, 

batch auctions are now conducted by a number of IDB firms at regular intervals 

throughout the trading day.  Like any closed auction, the IDB collects anonymous bids 

and offers for a specific security in specific amounts during a relatively short window of 

time, generally on the order of a few minutes.  After the batch auction closes, the orders 

are matched, and participants are notified of their awards.11  Figure 5, based on TRACE 

data, depicts average trading volumes of TIPS securities in the IDB venue of the market 

across five-minute intervals.  As you can see, the level of activity rises significantly at 

intervals, which correspond to the timing of the auctions.  While it is not a large part of 

the overall market, this activity appears to be an important innovation for segments often 

deemed to be less liquid--in particular, for off-the-run and TIPS trading on voice IDBs.  

                                                 
11 Note that these auctions differ from proposed high-frequency batch auctions in that they are held at much 
less frequent intervals, typically separated by hours and, in some cases, occurring only once a day or a 
week.
