processes of the 19 largest bank holding companies and evaluated their capital adequacy 

under a very severe hypothetical stress scenario that included a peak unemployment rate 

of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a further 21 percent decline in 

housing prices.  From a traditional safety-and-soundness perspective, we looked at 

whether each firm would have sufficient capital to remain financially stable, taking into 

account its capital distribution proposal, under the stress scenario.  The simultaneous 

review, by common methods, of the nation’s largest banking firms also helped us better 

evaluate the resilience of the system as a whole, including the capacity of the banking 

system to continue to make credit available to households and businesses if the economy 

were to perform very poorly.  Because stress tests will be an enduring part of the 

supervisory toolkit, we are evaluating the recent exercise particularly closely to identify 

both the elements that worked well and the areas in which execution and communication 

can be improved.  

 We also now routinely use macroprudential methods in analyzing the potential 

consequences of significant economic events for the individual firms we supervise and 

for the financial system as a whole.  A good example is our response to the European 

sovereign debt concerns that emerged in the spring of 2010.  Since those concerns arose, 

we have been actively monitoring U.S. banks’ direct and indirect exposures to Europe 

and tracking the banks’ management of their exposures.  We have also been analyzing 

scenarios under which European sovereign debt developments might lead to broader 

dislocations, for example, through a sharp increase in investor risk aversion that 

adversely affects asset values.  This work not only has improved our understanding of
