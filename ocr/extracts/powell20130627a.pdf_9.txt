Now that the financial crisis has receded and the economy is recovering at a 

moderate pace, are asset purchases still effective?  In my view, the evidence across the 

channels is mixed, but positive on balance.   

Economic models are used to provide a necessarily uncertain estimate of the 

effect on the economy of the FOMC’s asset purchases.  The Fed’s workhorse macro 

model is FRB/US, which estimates a reduction of about 20 basis points in the 

unemployment rate after three years in the wake of $500 billion in purchases of longer-

term securities.  There are reasons to think that this estimate may be too low; for 

example, FRB/US does not include any direct channel for LSAPs to boost house prices.  

There are also reasons to think that the estimate might be too high, since some of the 

channels by which lower rates spur economic activity could be attenuated in current 

circumstances, for example, by lower credit availability for small businesses and less 

creditworthy households, or corporate and household risk aversion.   

My view is that the LSAPs continue to provide meaningful support for economic 

activity but perhaps less than what the FRB/US estimates suggest.  Although the channels 

may not be working perfectly, it is unlikely that they are not working at all.  Beyond 

these model-predicted effects, it also seems likely that the economy continues to benefit 

from the knowledge that the Federal Reserve is committed to supporting growth as long 

as necessary.
