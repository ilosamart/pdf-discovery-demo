the weak labor market on workers and their families.  The influence of these benefits will 

dissipate as they are phased out and the economy recovers.  In addition, loop-like 

movements around the Beveridge curve are common during recoveries.  Vacancies 

typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing 

counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in 

the Beveridge curve.  Figure 4 plots the relationship seen during and after the 1973 and 

1982 recessions alongside the current episode.  As can be seen, such counterclockwise 

movements also occurred during these two earlier deep recessions.

While I do not see much evidence of any significant increase in structural 

unemployment so far, I am concerned that structural unemployment could increase over 

time if the labor market heals too slowly--a phenomenon known as hysteresis.  An 

exceptionally large fraction of those now unemployed--more than 40 percent--have been 

out of work for six months or more.  My concern is that individuals with such long 

unemployment spells could become less employable as their skills deteriorate and as they 

lose their connections to the labor market.  This outcome does not appear to have 

occurred in the wake of previous U.S. recessions, but the fraction of the unemployed who 

have been out of work for a long period is much higher now than it has been in the past.  

To date, I have not seen evidence that hysteresis is occurring to any substantial degree.  

For example, the probability of finding a new job has not deteriorated more for 

individuals experiencing a long-term bout of unemployment relative to those facing
