forward-looking requirement for a buffer against a potential stress on liquidity.  In addition, 

firms with weak liquidity positions under CLAR’s liquidity metrics are directed to improve their 

practices and, as warranted, their liquidity positions, through supervisory direction, ratings 

downgrades, or enforcement actions.  Because CLAR assesses all LISCC firms simultaneously, 

the Federal Reserve is also able to compare the range of practices in liquidity risk management 

across the portfolio.  Qualitative deficiencies identified in CLAR, such as questionable internal 

stress testing regimes, are addressed through the same set of supervisory tools.  Knowledge 

gained through CLAR assessments also provides a macroprudential perspective on liquidity 

vulnerabilities and funding concentrations in the system as a whole.   

An Interim Appraisal of Liquidity Regulation 

The financial crisis revealed the need for prudential regulation to consider systemic 

vulnerabilities, as well as weaknesses in traditional regulation aimed at assuring the financial 

condition of individual firms.  Both microprudential and macroprudential shortcomings were 

never as apparent as in the series of runs and general funding stress that defined much of the 

crisis.  Today, as I hope I have adequately explained, we have a better appreciation for the role 

liquidity regulation should play in tandem with capital regulation and resolution mechanisms, 

and as a means for both complementing and limiting the LOLR function of central banks.  We 

are well along the road of implementing regulatory and supervisory policies to play that role.  

Even though these measures are in some cases still under development and in others still being 

phased in, the liquidity positions and management practices of LISCC firms have improved 

considerably over the past few years.  Since 2012, the LISCC firms’ combined buffer of high-

quality liquid assets has increased by about a third, and their reliance on short-term wholesale 

funding has dropped considerably.
