expectations in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers have edged lower over 

the past year or two with the level in February nearly 1/2 percentage point below the 10-

year average.  Three-year inflation expectations in the New York Federal Reserveâ€™s 

Survey of Consumer Expectations have also moved steadily lower over the past two 

years, though the recent decline in energy prices may explain much of this drift. 

Notably, market-based measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury 

Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury yields are at historically low 

levels.  At the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, inflation compensation is 1 percentage 

point lower than mid-2014 levels.  Declines in swap-based measures of inflation 

compensation have been similar.  However, these declines appear correlated with oil 

prices, and it is not clear to what extent these declines reflect a change in inflation 

expectations, changes in investor demand for TIPS versus nominal Treasury securities, or 

an improvement in the risk characteristics of nominal Treasury securities versus other 

assets. 

Over the next couple of years, there are reasons to expect energy prices and the 

dollar to eventually stabilize, output to increase at around the moderate pace it has 

averaged over the recovery thus far, foreign growth to recover somewhat, the U.S. labor 

market to improve further, and inflation to move toward our 2 percent target.  However, 

there are risks around this baseline forecast, the most prominent of which lie to the 

downside.  For example, China faces risks as it navigates a sharp slowing in its goods 

sector, a large buildup in corporate debt, and an apparent surge in demand for foreign 

assets, although China possesses resources to deal with these challenges.  More broadly, 

sources of robust demand around the globe are few, and sources of weakness relatively
