might have expected, given the severity of the previous recession.  This swift recovery 

has not only benefited Asia, but the global economy as well.   

 Lately, however, the momentum in the emerging Asian economies has weakened, 

in part as their exports to Europe and the United States have slowed.  Exports to China 

from other countries in the region have also weakened, partly because of the unwinding 

of China’s earlier stimulus programs, but also because China’s exports to the advanced 

economies have slowed, thus lowering its demand for imported parts and components.  

For the moment, emerging Asia is offsetting weakness in external demand through 

accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.  But ultimately, it would be desirable, both 

for the region and for the global economy, if emerging Asia were able to rely less on 

temporary policy stimulus and more on a fundamental rebalancing of growth toward 

domestic demand.  To be sure, progress toward rebalancing has already occurred, as 

evidenced by the substantial reduction in current account surpluses in the region since the 

onset of the global crisis.  However, some of this adjustment likely reflects cyclical 

factors, and, moreover, the aggregate current account of emerging Asia remains 

substantially in surplus.   

Greater reliance on domestic demand would not only help shield Asia’s economic 

growth from the weakness in the advanced economies; it would also boost the well-being 

of its citizens by enabling them to consume a greater share of the output they produce.  

Moreover, transforming emerging Asia into an independent engine of global growth 

would put the global economy on a much surer footing, thus helping to achieve the Group 

of Twenty nations’ commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.
