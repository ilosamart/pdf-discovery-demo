Thank you, and let me say what an honor it is, as an alumna of this great 

university, to be here today and part of this important occasion.   

As we celebrate the 125th anniversary of women being admitted to Brown, it 

seems appropriate to reflect on the progress that women have achieved in the intervening 

years.  Since 1891, women have made tremendous strides in their ability to pursue their 

dreams of education and meaningful work and to support themselves and their families.  

In pursuing these goals, women have helped improve working conditions for all workers 

and have been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.   

Despite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to 

achieve their goals.  The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than 

it was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain 

industries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for 

work and family.  Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal 

opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life 

balance.  If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens 

and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the 

aging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic 

growth.   

To enliven the history I will present today, I will include the experiences of 

women graduates of this institution, in most cases in their own words, as related in oral 

histories preserved by Brown.1  Among these alumnae, I am proud to say, is a member of 

my own family who was an early graduate of Pembroke, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder 

                                                 
1 I am grateful for the assistance of Brown University staff in facilitating access to Brown Women Speak, 
the University’s oral history project, and particularly the help of archivist Mary Murphy.
