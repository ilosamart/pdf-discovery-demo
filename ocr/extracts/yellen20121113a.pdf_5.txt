a New York Times article as the equivalent of “sticking needles in the eyes of central 

bankers.”4      

This secretiveness regarding monetary policy decisions clashed with the openness 

regarding government decisions expected in a democracy, especially since Federal 

Reserve decisions influence the lives of every American.  And there were critics within 

the economics profession.  James Tobin and Milton Friedman, both Nobel laureates,
