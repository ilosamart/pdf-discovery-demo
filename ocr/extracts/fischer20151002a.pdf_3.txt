provide another one-third of credit within the system, while the government-sponsored 

enterprises (GSEs), primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, supply 20 percent of credit.  

A final group, which I will refer to as other nonbanks and is often associated with 

substantial reliance on short-term wholesale funding, consists of broker-dealers, money 

market mutual funds (MMFs), finance companies, issuers of asset-backed securities, and 

mortgage real estate investment trusts, which together provide 14 percent of credit.3  

In the first quarter of this year, U.S. financial firms held credit market debt equal 

to $38 trillion, or 2.2 times the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States.  As 

the figure shows, the size of the financial sector relative to GDP grew for nearly 50 years 

but declined after the financial crisis and has only started increasing again this year. 

From the perspective of financial stability, there are two important dimensions 

along which the categories of institutions in figure 1 differ.  First, banks, the GSEs, and 

most of what I have called other nonbanks tend to be more leveraged than other 

institutions.  Second, some institutions are more reliant on short-term funding and hence 

                                                   
 
3 Other nonbanks are often referred to as shadow banks because they engage in bank-like credit 
intermediation but are generally not subject to the same supervision and regulation as traditional banks and 
do not have direct access to deposit insurance.  I will continue to call them other nonbanks.   

There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes shadow banking.  As noted in 
International Monetary Fund (2014), most definitions classify shadow banks by entity.  Accordingly, by 
referring to other nonbanks as shadow banks, I am following an entity-based definition.  Indeed, the 
definition that I am using is what the International Monetary Fund would call the Flow of Funds definition 
of shadow banks (see table 2.1, page 73).  The Financial Stability Board (2013) describes shadow banking 
as “credit intermediation involving entities and activities (fully or partially) outside the regular banking 
system” (p. ii) and, in its annual Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report (see Financial Stability Board, 
2014), focuses on a class of institutions called Other Financial Intermediaries, which includes all financial 
intermediaries that are not banks, insurance companies, pension funds, public financial institutions, or 
central banks (p. 8).  This definition is close to the one that I am using but includes mutual funds.  The 
definition used by Adrian and Shin (2010) is also close to the one that I am using but includes public 
financial institutions (specifically, GSEs and agency and GSE-backed mortgage pools).  As the 
International Monetary Fund (2014) notes, shadow banking can also be defined according to activities and, 
indeed, they propose a classification that defines shadow banking as encompassing those activities by 
banks and nonbanks financed by nontraditional (noncore) liabilities.
