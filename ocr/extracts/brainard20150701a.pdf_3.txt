A reduction in the resilience of liquidity at times of stress could be significant if it 

acted as an amplification mechanism, impeded price discovery, or interfered with market 

functioning.  For instance, during episodes of financial turmoil, reduced liquidity can lead 

to outsized liquidity premiums as well as an amplification of adverse shocks on financial 

markets, leading prices for financial assets to fall more than they otherwise would.  The 

resulting reductions in asset values could then have second-round effects, as highly 

leveraged holders of financial assets may be forced to liquidate, pushing asset prices 

down further and threatening the stability of the financial system.3   

Although anecdotes of diminished liquidity abound, statistical evidence is harder 

to come by.  Indeed, there is relatively little evidence of any deterioration in day-to-day 

liquidity.  Traditional measures of liquidity, such as bid-asked spreads, are generally no 

higher than they were pre-crisis.  Turnover, an alternative measure of day-to-day 

liquidity, is lower, but it is unclear whether this reflects changes in liquidity or perhaps 

changes in the composition of investors.  The share of bonds owned by entities that tend 

to hold securities until maturity, such as mutual funds and insurance companies, has 

increased in recent years, which would lead turnover to decline even with no change in 

market liquidity.  In some markets, the number of large trades has declined in frequency, 

which could signal reduced market depth and liquidity, but could also reflect a shift in 

market participantsâ€™ preferences toward smaller trade sizes.   

Finding a high-fidelity gauge of liquidity resilience is difficult, but there are a few 

measures that could be indicative, such as the frequency of spikes in bid-asked spreads,

3 Of course, if the sharp reductions in asset values are fleeting, these second-round effects could be quite 
limited.
