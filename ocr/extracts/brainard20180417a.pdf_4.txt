particular the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities.   As we have seen all over 

the country, when banks are inclusive in their lending, it helps low- and moderate-income 

communities to thrive by providing opportunities for community members to buy and improve 

their homes and to start and expand small businesses.  We employ an extraordinary group of 

CRA examiners and community development professionals to make sure that we do our part to 

help banks meet this obligation, as the statute directs.  We are very proud of the role we play in 

educating banks on the CRA’s provisions, introducing them to potential partners in the 

community, and keeping them informed of best practices in the field.  In fact, one of CRA’s 

important achievements has been to help foster the growth of the community development field 

by building stronger relationships between financial institutions and community and economic 

development professionals.  This development has expanded the number and range of 

opportunities for banks to lend and invest in safe and sound ways, benefiting both banks and 

their communities. 

The current CRA regulations date back to 1995.  In the two decades since, there have 

been substantial changes in the ways that banks serve their customers and in the challenges faced 

by low- and moderate-income communities.  The time is ripe to modernize the CRA regulations 

to make them more effective in making credit available in low- and moderate-income areas at a 

time when technological and structural changes in the banking industry allow banks to serve 

customers outside of the areas with branches that have traditionally defined a bank’s community.  

As we update the rules, it should be possible to achieve better outcomes--both providing banks 

with the greater clarity and predictability they seek while also facilitating better provision of 

credit, investments, and banking services in low- and moderate-income areas.  There are several 

outcomes that we will work toward in the interagency rule-writing effort.
