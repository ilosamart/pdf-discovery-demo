The New Malaise 

After a cyclical boost early this year, the current state of the U.S. economy is 

unimpressive:  modest growth in output, high levels of unemployment, stagnant wages, low 

levels of consumer and business sentiment, and volatile financial markets.  Extrapolating from 

recent data, many in your business and mine predict only a middling recovery in the next several 

years.  They call it “the new normal.”  I call it the new malaise. 

The prevailing theory has it that U.S. policymakers should not deny our foregone fate.  

We should accept smaller improvements in output and employment and productivity over the 

horizon.  We should not stand before you and feign optimism or profess misplaced hubris.   

Instead, we should resign ourselves to the new normal now upon us, and conduct policy 

accordingly.  In particular, central bankers in advanced economies--against a backdrop of 

disinflation--should be comfortably permissive in the conduct of monetary policy, still more 

encouraging of still more accommodative central bank policies for still longer periods.  That is 

the last best hope, they argue, to preserve the remaining vestiges of a golden age that is no more. 

I reject this view.  I consider this emerging ethos to be dangerous and defeatist and 

debunked by America’s own exceptional economic history.  The dour economic tale being told is 

not inevitable.  Our citizens are not unwitting victims of some unavoidable fate.  The current 

period of subpar growth and high unemployment is real, but it need not persist.  We should not 

lower our expectations.  We should improve our policies.
