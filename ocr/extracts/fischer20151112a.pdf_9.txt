The Board staff’s general-equilibrium models that take explicit account of the 

ability of monetary policy to crowd in domestic demand--including the staff’s FRB/US 

and multicountry SIGMA models--suggest that monetary policy easing can substantially 

mitigate the effects of adverse shocks on GDP, including from the recent run-up in the 

dollar.  In the case of the dollar shock considered previously, these models suggest that 

the all-in effects of the stronger dollar on GDP are only about one-half to two-thirds as 

large as implied by the trade model that abstracts from a monetary policy response--still 

substantial, to be sure, but much less significant for the economy than if monetary policy 

failed to play an active role.  

Conclusion 

To wrap up, while the dollar’s appreciation and foreign weakness have been a 

sizable shock, the U.S. economy appears to be weathering them reasonably well, 

notwithstanding their large effects on certain sectors of the economy heavily exposed to 

international trade.  Monetary policy has played a key role in achieving these outcomes 

through deferring liftoff relative to what was expected a little over a year ago.  The 

October 2015 FOMC statement indicated that it may be appropriate to raise the target 

range for the federal funds rate at the next meeting in December, though the outcome will 

depend on the Committee’s assessment of the progress--realized and expected--that has 

been made toward meeting our goals of maximum employment and price stability.11  Of 

course, as policymakers, we must always be vigilant to events unfolding differently than 

we expect, and we must be ready to react accordingly.
