Moreover, it bears reemphasizing that having a CLF with an up-front fee is very 

different from simply allowing banks to count central-bank-eligible collateral as HQLA 

at no charge.  Rather, the CLF is like the pollution tax.  For every dollar of pre-CLF 

shortfall--that is, for every dollar of required liquidity that a bank canâ€™t obtain on the 

private market--the bank has to pay the commitment fee.  So even if there is not as much 

mitigation, there is still an incentive for conservation, in the sense that banks are 

encouraged to do less liquidity provision, all else being equal.  This would not be the case 

if the CLF were available at a zero price. 

What about the situation in countries where safe assets are more plentiful?  The 

analysis here has a number of moving parts because in addition to the implementation of 

the LCR, substantial increases in demand for safe assets will arise from new margin 

requirements for both cleared and noncleared derivatives.  Nevertheless, given the large 

and growing global supply of sovereign debt securities, as well as other HQLA-eligible 

assets, most estimates suggest that the scarcity problem should be manageable, at least 

for the foreseeable future.   

In particular, quantitative impact studies released by the Basel Committee 

estimate that the worldwide incremental demand for HQLA coming from both the 

implementation of the LCR and swap margin requirements might be on the order of $3 

trillion.13  This is a large number, but it compares with a global supply of HQLA-eligible 

                                                 
13 To be more precise, global incremental demand coming from swap margin requirements is estimated at 
$1.24 trillion; see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Board of the International Organization of 
Securities Commissions (2013), Margin Requirements for Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives:  Second 
Consultative Document (Basel:  Bank for International Settlements and IOSCO, February), 
www.bis.org/publ/bcbs242.htm.  Of this $1.24 trillion, $810 billion reflects margin (net of collateral 
already collected) on uncleared swaps, and $420 billion reflects margin on swaps that will migrate to 
central clearing.  In addition, global incremental demand coming from the LCR is estimated at 
$2.39 trillion; see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2012), Results of the Basel III Monitoring 
Exercise as of 30 June 2011 (Basel:  Bank for International Settlements, April),
