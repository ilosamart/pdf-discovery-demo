public shortly after the FOMC meeting in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), 

and they receive a good deal of scrutiny by financial market participants and journalists.6 

One important but underappreciated aspect of the SEP is that its projections are 

based on each individual’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Each FOMC 

participant writes down what he or she regards as the appropriate path for policy.  They 

do not write down what they expect the Committee to do.7  Yet the public often 

misinterprets the interest rate paths we write down as a projection of the Committee’s 

policy path or a commitment to a particular path. 

Models and the Modeling of Monetary Policy 

Now, that is a lot of talk about the process of monetary policymaking.  Let me 

turn to some of the machinery behind that process--in particular, to macroeconomic 

models and their role in assisting the FOMC’s decisionmaking.  The Board staff 

maintains several models; I will focus on the FRB/US model, the best known and most 

                                                 
6 The SEP was introduced in 2007 and expanded on forecasts that FOMC participants had already been 

making twice each year since 1979 in the Monetary Policy Report prepared for the Congress.  Since 2011, 

the Federal Reserve Chair has held a press conference following each FOMC meeting with an SEP, in part 

to discuss the projections. 
7 “Appropriate monetary policy” is Fedspeak for a policy that delivers on the Committee’s interpretation of 

its legislated mandate.  The fact that FOMC participants’ forecasts are conditional on each participant’s 

conception of the appropriate monetary policy has at least three noteworthy implications.  First, it means 

that their forecasts will tend to converge over time to the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and to 

each individual’s interpretation of maximum employment.  Second, revisions to the SEP tend to manifest 

themselves in the path for the federal funds rate deemed to be appropriate to achieve those objectives.  And 

third, the paths for the federal funds rate that deliver on those objectives will often differ from one 

participant to the next.
