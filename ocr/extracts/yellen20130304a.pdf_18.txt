product (GDP) by about 1.5 percentage points by late 2018.  The lower debt-to-GDP ratio 

mainly reflects stronger tax revenue as a result of more-robust economic activity. 

Finally, let me comment on the possibility that our asset purchase program could 

threaten financial stability by promoting excessive risk-taking, a significant concern that I 

and my colleagues take very seriously.  To put this concern in context, though, remember 

that during the most intense phase of the financial crisis, risk aversion surged.  Even in 

the aftermath of the crisis, businesses, banks, and investors have been exceptionally 

cautious, presumably reflecting their concern about future business conditions, 

uncertainty about economic policy, and the perception of pronounced tail risks relating, 

for example, to stresses in global financial markets.  I see one purpose of the 

Committeeâ€™s accommodative policies as promoting a return to prudent risk-taking.  

Indeed, the return to more normal levels of risk-taking and the associated normalization 

of credit markets have been vital to recovery from the Great Recession.    

Of course, risk-taking can go too far, thereby threatening future economic 

performance, and a low interest rate environment has the potential to induce investors to 

take on too much leverage and reach too aggressively for yield.  At this stage, there are 

some signs that investors are reaching for yield, but I do not now see pervasive evidence 

of trends such as rapid credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset 

bubbles that would clearly threaten financial stability.

  That said, such trends need to be 

carefully monitored and addressed, and the Federal Reserve has invested considerable 

resources to establish new surveillance programs to assess risks in the financial system.  

In the aftermath of the crisis, regulators here and around the world are also implementing

 In a recent speech, Governor Jeremy Stein (2013) discussed several areas in which a noticeable increase 

in risk-taking behavior has emerged.
