nonprofit entities, often with a limited lifespan and sunset provisions.  The notion of a 

land bank, as opposed to a land trust, is that properties are brought in and moved out of a 

land bank’s portfolio rather than permanently preserved.  While part of the land bank’s 

portfolio, foreclosed properties can be physically rehabilitated, rented, sold to new 

owner-occupants or responsible investors, or, in some cases, demolished.  Using this kind 

of mechanism, a community can gain control of vacant properties and keep them from 

causing problems for the surrounding neighborhood until market conditions are more 

conducive to redevelopment or sale.   

Land banks are just one example of the new approaches to housing issues that are 

being pursued across the country, many with the assistance of the Neighborhood 

Stabilization Program (NSP) administered by the Department of Housing and Urban 

Development.  The NSP program offers some funding to tackle these issues, but it also 

provides a structure to bring community stakeholders together to identify the best 

strategies for addressing foreclosures given the particular circumstances of each 

community.  Whether a community decides to purchase and rehabilitate homes for resale, 

demolish vacant homes, or create land banks to help control the destiny of these 

properties, the collaborative problem-solving approach used by NSP is one that can make 

the most of limited resources.   

Neighborhood stabilization is doubtless the precursor to community development 

in some communities and, in recognition of this, the federal banking agencies amended 

CRA regulations to specifically recognize neighborhood stabilization activities in 

designated NSP areas as appropriate for CRA consideration.2  In addition, the Federal
