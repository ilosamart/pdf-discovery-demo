therefore balance the extent of their profitable maturity transformation against the 

associated liquidity risks.3  Leading up to the 2007-09 financial crisis, some large firms 

were overly reliant on certain types of short-term funding and overly confident in their 

ability to replenish their funding when it came due.  Thus, during the crisis, some large 

banks did not have sufficient liquidity, and liquidity risk management at a broader set of 

institutions proved inadequate at anticipating and compensating for potential outflows, 

especially when those outflows occurred rapidly.4   

In the wake of the crisis, central banks and regulators around the world 

implemented a combination of regulatory reforms and stronger supervision to promote 

increased resilience in the financial sector.  With regard to liquidity, the prudential 

regulations and supervisory programs of the U.S. banking agencies have resulted in 

significant increases in the liquidity positions and changes in the risk management of our 

largest institutions.  And, working closely with other jurisdictions, we have also 

implemented global liquidity standards for the first time.  These standards seek to limit 

the effect of short-term outflows and extended overall funding mismatches, thus 

improving banks’ liquidity resilience.   

One particular liquidity requirement for large banking organizations is the 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, which the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted in 

2014.5  The LCR rule requires covered firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets 

                                                 
3 While deposit insurance helps mitigate the incentive for many depositors to run, it cannot fully eliminate 
this risk.  For a discussion of this vulnerability, see Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983),
