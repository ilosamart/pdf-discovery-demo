most large global firms.  However, a successful SPOE resolution of a large global firm has not 

yet been attempted and will require close cooperation among a large number of stakeholders, 

including both home and host country regulators.  This cooperation will be based on an 

understanding of separate and mutual interests, not on trust alone.  So while SPOE creates a 

potentially workable framework for resolution, setting the conditions for cooperation is critical.  

I grew up among the ranches of the American West, where we lived by the motto taught to me as 

a young child: trust everyone, but brand your cattle.  This is a theme that will run throughout my 

remarks today.   

In addition to setting the stage for effective cooperation, I will focus specifically on the 

type of ring-fencing that will almost certainly undermine the successful execution of an SPOE 

resolution--namely the disruptive seizure of assets by host regulators in the moment of stress.  As 

with other elements of our regime, I have been considering whether our current prepositioning 

requirements for domestic and foreign firms operating in the United States are both minimizing 

this risk and functioning in an efficient and transparent manner, and I will share some thoughts in 

that regard.  Our vantage point in the United States as a large home and host regulator would 

counsel that it is sensible to find a middle ground and fine tune our approach as we learn more 

and global conditions evolve. 

Resolution Considerations of a Home and Host Regulator 

To enable cooperation and avoid a destabilizing seizure of assets by host regulators, I 

would submit that all jurisdictions must find a balance of flexibility for the parent bank and 

certainty for local stakeholders.  Flexibility, or the ability to allocate capital and liquidity to 

different parts of the group on an as-needed basis, helps to meet unexpected demands on 

resources and reduces the risk of misallocation and inefficient use of resources.  Certainty, or the
