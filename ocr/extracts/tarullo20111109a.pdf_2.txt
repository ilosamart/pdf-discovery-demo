A little over three years ago, Lehman Brothers ignited the dry tinder of a badly 

overleveraged financial system that was too dependent on continuous, significant increases in 

housing prices and too opaque for supervisors, investors, analysts, and often participants 

themselves to understand.  As one would expect of a truly systemic crisis, there were many 

contributing factors--the prevailing statutory framework for financial regulation, supervisory 

practices, and the risk-management practices of financial actors.  And, as one would thus expect, 

the reform agenda has itself also been multi-dimensional.   

For all the regulatory changes that are in place, in process, or under consideration, 

however, I believe that capital regulation remains the single most important element of 

prudential financial regulation.  Let me immediately elaborate upon that statement in two ways.  

First, capital regulation itself must be multi-dimensional and rigorous in each of its components.  

Second, while strong capital regulation is necessary for a sound financial system, it is not, on its 

own, sufficient.  In my remarks this afternoon, I will concentrate on the first of these points and 

discuss how capital regulation reform is evolving in the wake of the crisis. 

Evolution and Shortcomings of Capital Regulation 

Although they had long used bank capital ratios as a supervisory instrument, U.S. bank 

regulators did not impose explicit minimum capital requirements until the 1980s.  The proximate 

reason for this change was regulatory concern over the decline in capital ratios of the largest 

banks--a concern reinforced by Congress, as it saw some of those large banks facing enormous 

losses on their loans to foreign sovereigns.  Within a few years this U.S. regulatory innovation 

was effectively internationalized by the original Basel Accord.  

At the same time, regulators came to regard capital requirements as a supple prudential 

tool.  As activity and affiliation restrictions were loosened in the United States, capital
