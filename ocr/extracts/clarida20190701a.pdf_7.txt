statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the 

FOMC’s meeting this past January with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC 

participants.  The statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of 

inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum 

level.  In doing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum 

employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  According to the Federal 

Reserve Act, the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation 

objective. 

As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy 

framework known in the research literature as “flexible inflation targeting.”16  However, 

the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most 

flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that 

when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the 

other.  We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has 

served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary 

policies that entailed some risk of inflation. 

The review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging 

where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions. 

Three Questions 

The first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives 

with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to 

reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”
