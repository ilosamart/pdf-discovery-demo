 For many years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach programs 

for banks in their districts.  For instance, the popular “Ask the Fed” calls conducted by the 

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve 

staff discuss recent policy initiatives and to be updated on the most common problems that 

examiners see in the field.  The calls also provide an informal setting for bankers to ask questions 

on issues of concern.  In addition, consumer compliance webinars have provided a forum for the 

Federal Reserve to discuss emerging consumer compliance issues and to answer questions from 

webinar participants directly.3  These initiatives have been so successful that a planning group is 

studying options for leveraging these efforts in a coordinated, national initiative to improve 

communication of relevant information to community banks supervised by the Federal Reserve.   

 Despite all efforts to communicate supervisory expectations, there are inevitably 

disagreements between banks and their examiners about examination findings.  The Federal 

Reserve Ombudsman actively works with banks that have concerns about their examinations or 

that wish to appeal an examination finding.  The Ombudsman works independently from the 

bank supervision chain of command and has broad authority to mediate complaints, including the 

authority to refer matters to committees of the Board.  The Ombudsman’s office also has a 

follow-up program in place to protect the banks that contact it from retaliation.  And the 

Ombudsman tracks the nature and source of complaints in order to identify potential systemic 

problems.4
