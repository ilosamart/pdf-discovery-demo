assets of more than $40 trillion.14  Moreover, the eligible collateral for swap margin is 

proposed to be broader than the LCR’s definition of HQLA--including, for example, 

certain equities and corporate bonds without any cap.  If one focuses just on U.S. 

institutions, the incremental demand number is on the order of $1 trillion, while the sum 

of Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed securities is more than $19 trillion.15   

While this sort of analysis is superficially reassuring, the fact remains that the 

HQLA premium will depend on market-equilibrium considerations that are hard to fully 

fathom in advance, and that are likely to vary over time.  This uncertainty needs to be 

understood, and respected.  Indeed, the market-equilibrium aspect of the problem 

represents a crucial distinction between capital regulation and liquidity regulation, and it 

is one reason why the latter is particularly challenging to implement.  Although capital 

regulation also imposes a tax on banks--to the extent that equity is a more expensive form 

of finance than debt--this tax wedge is, to a first approximation, a fixed constant for a 

given bank, independent of the scale of overall financial intermediation activity.  If Bank 

A decides to issue more equity so it can expand its lending business, this need not make it 

more expensive for Bank B to satisfy its capital requirement.  In other words, there is no

LCR; the recalibration of the LCR in the January 2013 final version will reduce this value for U.S. banks 
by roughly one-third.  Extrapolating this result to the global level suggests that incremental demand 
resulting from the LCR will fall by roughly $800 billion to $1.6 trillion.

15 According to Federal Reserve Board flow of funds data, as of December 31, 2012 the total stock of U.S. 
Treasury securities stood at $11.6 trillion, and the total stock of agency debt and mortgage-backed 
securities stood at $7.5 trillion.  A caveat here is that agency mortgage-backed securities are considered 
Level 2 assets, so they can count for at most 40 percent of any bank’s total holdings of HQLA.
