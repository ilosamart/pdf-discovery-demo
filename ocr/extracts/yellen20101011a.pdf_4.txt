To understand what went wrong, I refer you to Hyman Minsky’s path-breaking 

work on speculative financial booms and busts.2  As Minsky showed, success can lead to 

excess, and excess to ruin.  The Great Moderation saw a progressive growth of credit and 

extension of risk, which came to a head in the mortgage market.  Credit flowed freely and 

cheaply, and households and financial institutions alike took on greater risk, borrowing to 

the hilt.  House prices soared off the charts.  Financial innovators found increasingly 

exotic ways of packaging loans for investors.  Securities became so opaque that few 

understood their risks.  Originators sold mortgages to investors whose due diligence 

consisted of glancing at ratings.  The financial system became increasingly complex, 

interconnected, and hyperleveraged.   

When housing prices plunged, the value of real-estate-related assets on the 

balance sheets of financial institutions, both in the traditional and shadow banking 

sectors, collapsed.  Not only were many of those institutions highly leveraged, they had 

also relied heavily on short-term borrowing to acquire those assets.  The combination of 

leverage and short maturity funding left them perilously vulnerable to runs.  The result 

was panic and market breakdowns on an unimaginable scale, bringing us frighteningly 

close to a meltdown of the global financial system and a second Great Depression.   

Thankfully, that depression never occurred.  Governments and central banks 

around the world took extraordinary action to prevent complete collapse.  But what we 

did get was bad enough--the deepest and most prolonged recession in generations.  And 

the recovery has been agonizingly slow, held back, in part, by the ongoing efforts of 

overleveraged households and financial institutions to repair their balance sheets.  These
