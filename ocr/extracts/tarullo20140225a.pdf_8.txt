Here, then, is the potential quandary:  The very accommodative monetary policy 

that contributed to the restoration of financial stability could, if maintained long enough 

in the face of slow recovery in the real economy, eventually sow the seeds of renewed 

financial instability.  Yet removal of accommodation could choke off the recovery just as 

it seems poised to gain at least a bit more momentum.  Such a situation requires 

assessment of the extent of this risk and, of particular importance to my topic today, the 

appropriate role of monetary policy in containing it. 

Protecting Financial Stability 

In presenting the mix of salient considerations in reacting to possible financial 

stability risks arising from extended periods of accommodative monetary policy, I should 

state at the outset something that will not likely come as a surprise to any of you.  My 

observation has been that peopleâ€™s views on these risks tend to be at least generally 

correlated with their views on the effectiveness of monetary policy over the past few 

years and on the size of the output gap that remains today.  Having said that, I have also 

observed that most people engaging in these discussions--whether in policy circles, 

commentary, or academic work--would agree on the basic policy instruments available 

for systemic risk containment, even as they would disagree on the extent of the threat and 

the relative utility of those instruments.  So let me now present some of my own thoughts 

on both the specifics of the present situation and on some of the ongoing policy issues 

raised by these discussions. 

As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that incorporating financial 

stability considerations into monetary policy decisions need not imply the creation of an 

additional mandate for monetary policy.  The potentially huge effect on price stability
