of the evidence I discussed, it appears reasonable to conclude that nontraditional policy 

tools have been and can continue to be effective in providing financial accommodation, 

though we are less certain about the magnitude and persistence of these effects than we 

are about those of more-traditional policies.   

 The possible benefits of an action, however, must be considered alongside its 

potential costs.  I will focus now on the potential costs of LSAPs.   

One possible cost of conducting additional LSAPs is that these operations could 

impair the functioning of securities markets.  As I noted, the Federal Reserve is limited 

by law mainly to the purchase of Treasury and agency securities; the supply of those 

securities is large but finite, and not all of the supply is actively traded.  Conceivably, if 

the Federal Reserve became too dominant a buyer in certain segments of these markets, 

trading among private agents could dry up, degrading liquidity and price discovery.  As 

the global financial system depends on deep and liquid markets for U.S. Treasury 

securities, significant impairment of those markets would be costly, and, in particular, 

could impede the transmission of monetary policy.  For example, market disruptions 

could lead to higher liquidity premiums on Treasury securities, which would run counter 

to the policy goal of reducing Treasury yields.  However, although market capacity could 

ultimately become an issue, to this point we have seen few if any problems in the markets 

for Treasury or agency securities, private-sector holdings of securities remain large, and 

trading among private market participants remains robust. 

A second potential cost of additional securities purchases is that substantial 

further expansions of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed’s 

ability to exit smoothly from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time.  Even if
