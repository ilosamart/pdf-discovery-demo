Since I arrived at the Fed, I have put a premium on visiting communities all over 

the country to get a direct sense of how they are experiencing the economy.  In fact, my 

first such visit was in this District with community development staff from the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Richmond.  Due to the wisdom of the Fed’s original architects, the 

Federal Reserve System derives tremendous value from interacting with communities 

from all around the country.  In 2015, we created a Community Advisory Council at the 

Federal Reserve Board, where we hear from a broad variety of community groups and 

others.  And many of the regional Federal Reserve Banks have similar councils, including 

the Richmond Fed’s Community Investment Council.  

In our review this year, we are listening broadly and are seeking perspectives at 

the community level.  So today we want to hear from you.  How is your community 

experiencing today’s economy?  Is everyone who wants a job able to get one?  Can they 

get the necessary training?  Are businesses finding it relatively easy to hire the workers 

they need?  What about inflation and pricing power?  And what about the availability and 

cost of credit—whether it be to start or expand a small business, buy a car to get to work, 

or invest in owning a home or getting a degree?  I look forward to hearing your views on 

these and other questions.
