companies for which the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor hold about $2 trillion in 

total assets, representing about one-quarter of U.S. insurance industry assets.  These firms are 

highly diverse: they range in size from firms with total assets of approximately $3 billion to 

firms with total assets of over $700 billion.  They engage in a wide variety of insurance and non-
