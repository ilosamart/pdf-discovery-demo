should not be a guessing game or require hours of legal analysis of complex banking and 

securities regulations to determine if a particular entity is a covered fund.  It should not happen--

although it has happened--that our supervised firms come to us and ask questions about whether 

a particular derivative trade is subject to the rule, and we cannot give them our own answer or a 

consistent answer across the five responsible agencies.  Supervisors need to be able to provide 

clear and transparent guidance on what is covered by the Volcker rule and what is not.  This 

would benefit not only the firms, but the supervisors at the agencies as well.   

 Again, a good example is the exemption for market making-related activities, which is 

one of the key exemptions from the prohibition on proprietary trading.  The rule contains a 

gaggle of complex regulatory requirements, but the statute contains merely one--that the market 

making-related activities are designed not to exceed the reasonably expected near-term demands 

of clients, customers, or counterparties, otherwise known as RENT’D.7  We are considering 

different ways to use a clearer test for RENT’D.  We want banks to be able to engage in market 

making and provide liquidity to financial markets with less fasting and prayer about their 

compliance with the Volcker rule.       

 As I noted earlier, we also understand that the Volcker rule has had an extraterritorial 

impact on FBOs.  With respect to foreign banks, there are at least a few places where we would 

like to revisit the application of the final rule based on concerns raised by market participants and 

others over the past four years of implementation.   

 In particular, there are certain foreign funds--funds that are organized outside the United 

States by foreign banks in foreign jurisdictions and offered solely to foreign investors--that are
