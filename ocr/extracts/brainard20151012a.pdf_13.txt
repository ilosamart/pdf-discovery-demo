Because monetary policy acts with a lag, in this scenario, high rates of resource 

utilization may lead to a large buildup of inflationary pressures, a rise in inflation 

expectations and persistent inflation in excess of our 2 percent target.  However, we have 

well-tested tools to address such a situation and plenty of policy room in which to use 

them.  Moreover, the persistently deflationary international environment, the gradual 

pace of increases in U.S. resource utilization, the estimated small effect of resource 

utilization on inflation, the likely low level of neutral interest rates, and the persistence of 

inflation below our 2 percent target suggests this risk remains modest.  Financial markets 

appear to agree, as five-year inflation compensation is well below 2 percent. 

Now, take the alternative risk:  that the underlying momentum of the domestic 

economy is not strong enough to resist the deflationary pull of the international 

environment.  A further step-down in global demand growth and a further strengthening 

in the dollar could increase the already sizable negative effect of the global environment 

on U.S. demand, pushing U.S. growth back to, or below, potential.  Progress toward full 

employment and 2 percent inflation would stall or reverse.  With limited ability to ease 

policy, it would be more difficult to move the economy back on track. 

Indeed, many central banks in advanced economies have tightened policy since 

the financial crisis, prompted by improving domestic activity.  In these cases, the 

tightening was reversed as the outlook evolved.  Given the current uncertainty, we should 

put some weight on the risk of following this pattern.  Indeed, market participants put the 

probability of returning to the zero lower bound within two years of liftoff at 20 percent.10
