too-distant future, and I will provide a high-level preview here today. 

The Board’s Approach to a Capital Standard for Insurance Holding Companies 

It is worth sharing some further context for the Board’s development of the BBA before 

previewing its design and key attributes.  As outlined in the ANPR, the Board strove to develop a 

framework that encompassed all material risks across the entire supervised enterprise.  We 

favored an approach that is as standardized as possible, rather than relying on internal capital 

models of supervised firms, in order to promote transparency and facilitate comparability across 

firms.  We also aimed to strike an efficient balance between simplicity and risk sensitivity in 

order to ensure accurate reflection of risks while minimizing regulatory burden.  To further limit 

regulatory burden, the Board envisioned a BBA that would rely upon existing U.S. accounting 

and capital frameworks to the greatest extent possible.   

In designing the BBA, there were, of course, a number of ideas for how we should 

construct this framework.  At the outset, we decided against applying the Board’s bank holding 

company capital rules to supervised insurance firms at the enterprise level, in light of the very 

different business models of insurance and banking.   

We considered that a capital approach akin to the European Solvency II framework 

would not adequately incorporate U.S. accounting frameworks that, relative to other approaches, 

tend to be less prone to volatility and procyclicality.  Volatility in a valuation approach that is 

used in a capital standard can especially affect long-term contracts, with the potential for 

unintended consequences on the ability of insurers to provide long-term life insurance and 

retirement planning products.  Moreover, use of an approach that entails more reliance on
