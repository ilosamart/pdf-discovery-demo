for groups of loans with distinct characteristics, to show how supervisory models treat

scenarios and scenario design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the 

advisability of, and possible approaches to, gathering the public's input on scenarios and 

salient risks facing the banking system each year. Such a proposal may also provide
