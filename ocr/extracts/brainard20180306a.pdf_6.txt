Although experience in other countries suggests it can prove difficult to raise an 

underlying inflation trend that has been running below policymakers’ target for several 

years, stronger tailwinds may help re-anchor inflation expectations at the symmetric 

2 percent objective.  Of course, it is conceivable we could see a mild, temporary overshoot 

of the inflation target over the medium term.  If such a mild, temporary overshoot were to 

occur, it would likely be consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and could 

help nudge underlying inflation back to our target.8  Recent research has highlighted the 

downside risks to inflation and to longer-run inflation expectations that are posed by the 

effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it suggests the importance of ensuring 

underlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s new normal.9  

We also seek to sustain full employment, and we will want to be attentive to 

imbalances that could jeopardize this goal.  If the unemployment rate continues to decline 

on the current trajectory, it could fall to levels that have been rarely seen over the past five 

decades.  Historically, such episodes have tended to see elevated risks of imbalances, 

whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent 

decades.  One of the striking features of the current recovery has been the absence of an 

acceleration in inflation as the unemployment rate has declined, a development that is 

consistent with a flat Phillips curve.10  Although wage gains have seen some recent 

improvements, they continue to fall short of the pace seen before the financial crisis.11

the highest 12-month change in almost nine years.  The employment cost index rose 2.6 percent last year.
