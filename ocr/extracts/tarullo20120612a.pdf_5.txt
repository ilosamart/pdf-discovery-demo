investments also inevitably increased, since intermediaries need a place to park funds that are 

awaiting investment or needed to meet unexpected withdrawals. 

The growing demand for safe and liquid assets was met largely by the shadow banking 

system’s creation of assets that were seemingly safe and seemingly liquid.

  New varieties of 

shadow-banking activities were created, some pre-existing types grew larger, and the shadow 

banking system became much more internationalized.  For example, the volume of asset-backed 

commercial paper, or ABCP, grew enormously.  Many ABCP vehicles issued short-term, highly 

rated liabilities and bought longer-term, highly rated securities, often mortgage-backed 

securities.  Many of the vehicles were sponsored abroad, especially by European banks, which 

issued dollar-denominated ABCP in the U.S. market and bought dollar-denominated assets in the 

U.S. market.  The overall volume of this activity was very large, although the net flows between 

the U.S. and Europe were not, leaving European bank sponsors of such ABCP vehicles with a 

huge exposure when market participants stopped believing that ABCP was risk-free.   

It now seems clear that the tail risk associated with many shadow-banking instruments 

was not understood by many market actors, including both sellers and buyers.  An important 

contributing factor on the buyers' side that helped set the stage for the 2007-2008 financial crisis 

was the widespread acceptance that risk-free assets could be created by augmenting what was 

already thought to be a low-risk asset with a promise from a large financial institution to provide 

liquidity or bear credit losses in the unlikely event that such support might be needed.  When, in

 Insured demand deposits at traditional banks can help meet the needs of large investors, but only to a limited 

extent.  Such accounts are unattractive to large investors because of the limited scale of Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance; large deposits are, beyond the insurance cap, effectively unsecured exposures 

to a single bank, and small deposits at multiple banks are inconvenient.  The expansion of FDIC insurance to all 

noninterest bearing accounts, regardless of size—which occurred in November 2008 and which is scheduled to 

expire at the end of this year—has made deposits more attractive and more heavily utilized.
