Although it is still early days, it is already evident that the application of artificial 

intelligence (AI) in financial services is potentially quite important and merits our attention.  

Through our Fintech working group, we are working across the Federal Reserve System to take a 

deliberate approach to understanding the potential implications of AI for financial services, 

particularly as they relate to our responsibilities.  In light of the potential importance of AI, we 

are seeking to learn from industry, banks, consumer advocates, researchers, and others, including 

through today’s conference.  I am pleased to take part in this timely discussion of how 

technology is changing the financial landscape.1 

The Growing Use of Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services 

My focus today is the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, which 

is the basis of many recent advances and commercial applications.2  Modern machine learning 

applies and refines, or “trains,” a series of algorithms on a large data set by optimizing iteratively 

as it learns in order to identify patterns and make predictions for new data.3  Machine learning 

essentially imposes much less structure on how data is interpreted compared to conventional 

approaches in which programmers impose ex ante rule sets to make decisions.
