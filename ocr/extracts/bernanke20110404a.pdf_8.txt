of the Federal Reserve in 1913, in part to act as a liquidity provider of last resort as well 

as to strengthen the supervision of state-chartered banks. 

  Eighty years later, the 1987 stock market crash provided a marketwide test for 

securities and derivatives clearinghouses, as well as their members, banks, and related 

institutions.10  Surging volumes of trades and extraordinary price volatility during the 

week of October 19th created errors and delays in confirming stock trades, severe
