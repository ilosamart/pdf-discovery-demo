What About Leverage?

• Maybe sentiment forecasts economic activity through some other
channel, rather than through its effect on future credit market conditions.

• Example: frothy credit markets \( \Rightarrow \) nonfinancial firms lever up  \( \Rightarrow \) 
subsequent macroeconomic fragility

• Controlling for changes in nonfinancial sector leverage has no effect on 
results.
