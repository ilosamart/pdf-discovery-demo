countries resulted in massive increases in the size of the government debt as a share of 

GDP, as in Ireland at the start of the Great Financial Crisis, when the Irish government 

stepped in to guarantee bank liabilities.  This process is aptly known as a “doom loop”.   

 Lesson T4:  The lender of last resort, TBTF, and moral hazard.9  The role of the 

central bank as lender of last resort is a central theme in Walter Bagehot’s 1873 classic on 

central banking, Lombard Street.  The case for the central bank to be the lender of last 

resort is clear in the case of a liquidity crisis – one that arises from a temporary shortage 

of liquidity, typically in a financial panic – but less so in the case of solvency crises.10  

In principle the distinction between liquidity and solvency problems should guide the 

actions of the central bank and the government in a financial crisis.  But in a crisis, the 

distinction between illiquidity and insolvency is rarely clear-cut – and whether a 

company goes bankrupt will depend on how the authorities respond to the crisis.   

Further, one has to be clear about which aspects of government actions are critical in 

this regard.  If a firm is bankrupt, it may well be optimal for the firm to continue to 

operate while being reorganized, as typically happens in bankruptcies.  In such a case, in 

which the firm’s capital is negative, the ownership of the bankrupt firm should be 

changed – unless the owners succeed in mobilizing more capital, in which case the 

company was probably not bankrupt.   

If the government is dealing with a bank, or other financial institution, with an 

extremely large balance sheet and multiple interactions with the rest of the financial 

system, putting the firm into bankruptcy without a plan to continue its most important
