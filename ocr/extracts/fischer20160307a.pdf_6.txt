sectors, based on demand functions for assets other than money.  Later the demand 

functions were often replaced by pricing equations derived from the capital asset pricing 

model.  Researchers at the Fed have been bold enough to add estimated term and risk 

premiums to the determination of the returns on some assets.4  They have concluded, 

inter alia, that the arguments we used to make about how easy it would be to measure 

expected inflation if the government would introduce inflation-indexed bonds failed to 

take into account that returns on bonds are affected by liquidity and risk premiums.  This 

means that one of the major benefits that were expected from the introduction of 

inflation-indexed bonds (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, generally called TIPS), 

namely that they would provide a quick and reliable measure of inflation expectations, 

has not been borne out, and that we still have to struggle to get reasonable estimates of 

expected inflation.    

As students, we included NX, net exports, in the aggregate demand equation, but 

we did not generally solve for the exchange rate, possibly because the exchange rate was 

typically fixed.  Later, in 1976, Rudi Dornbusch inaugurated modern international 

macroeconomics--and here I’m quoting from a speech by Ken Rogoff--in his famous 

overshooting model.5  As globalization of both goods and asset markets intensified over 

the next 40 years, the international aspects of trade in goods and assets occupied an 

increasingly important role in the economies of virtually all countries, not least the 

United States, and in macroeconomics.   

At the LSE, we took a course on the British economy from Frank Paish, whose 

lectures consisted of a series of charts, accompanied by narrative from the professor.  He
