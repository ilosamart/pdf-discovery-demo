Over the past year, inflation has fallen short of the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent 

objective, and that has been the case more often than not in recent years.  On the one 

hand, that means the economy can continue to grow without pushing inflation too high.  

On the other hand, inflation that runs too low for long periods can pose difficult 

challenges.  Below-target inflation reduces the amount of room the Federal Reserve has 

to cut the federal funds rate to cushion the economy from negative developments.  And it 

could lead people to lower their expectations for future inflation, which in turn could lead 

to an increasing shortfall of inflation from our objective.1  Indeed, some indicators of 

longer-run inflation expectations have been on the soft side in recent months.   

Putting all of the pieces together, it appears the economy has been doing well so 

far this year, bolstered by confident consumers and a strong job market.  And after 

fluctuations earlier in the year, financial markets currently appear supportive of growth, 

with borrowing rates low and the stock market at all-time highs.   

While the modal outlook is solid, the downside risks, if they materialize, could 

weigh on economic activity.  Taking into account the downside risks at a time when 

inflation is on the soft side would argue for softening the expected path of monetary 

policy according to basic principles of risk management.  Of course, my judgment about 

the actual path of policy will continue to be influenced by the evolution of the data and 

the risks. 

I am mindful that low spreads on corporate credit, together with risky corporate 

debt at historic highs, suggest financial imbalances are growing.  We should be 

                                                 
1 The federal funds rate was close to zero for nearly seven years following the financial crisis, and it likely 
would return to zero in a downturn.  When nominal interest rates are zero, a drop in inflation expectations 
can be especially problematic, making the “real” interest rates that matter for household and business 
decisions higher than they would otherwise be and therefore less supportive of growth.
