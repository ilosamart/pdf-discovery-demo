same responsible practices long used by community banks are so complicated and expensive that 

they have the unintended effect of forcing some community banks to leave the market.  

 It is difficult to think about crafting a regulatory regime that is simplified for smaller 

lenders that retain 100 percent of the risk they take, but I think it is important to try.  The Federal 

Reserve had to think through a lot of these issues as we drafted proposals for escrow 

requirements and the definition of qualified mortgages.  The Dodd-Frank Act made a start by 

crafting exemptions for banks in rural or underserved areas, but I think broader exemptions could 

be warranted for the thousands of smaller banks that make loans in small metropolitan areas or 

suburban areas.  The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule-writing responsibility for most mortgage-

related statutes from the Federal Reserve to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  

So the CFPB will be finalizing the rules for which we issued initial proposals.  The CFPB has 

already established an office for outreach to community banks and I have discussed this issue 

with them.  I urge you to continue to explain how the burden of regulation, including regulations 

covering mortgage lending, impacts the ability of community banks to meet the credit needs of 

their communities. 

Conclusion 

 The bottom line is that doing the necessary work of protecting our financial system and its 

customers comes with a cost.  But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t continue to try to at least 

limit the burden.  I hope you have noticed the number of times I have referred to reports from 

bankers or concerns expressed by borrowers.  Even though I have experience living with 

regulatory burden, I still need regular feedback from bankers and consumers of banking services 

to understand the impact of regulation--both its effectiveness in achieving intended results and in 

limiting any unintended consequences.  The Federal Reserve makes every effort to identify
