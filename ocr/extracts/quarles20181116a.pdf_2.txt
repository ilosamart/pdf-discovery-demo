Professor Scott, and our hosts from Harvard and the Program on International 

Financial Systems, thank you for the chance to participate in today’s meeting.  Looking 

around the room, I see a mix of past and current colleagues, from academics, to 

supervisors and central bankers, to researchers and practitioners in industry.  All of you 

have seen, felt, and lived different aspects of the transition to the post-crisis regulatory 

framework, and I am grateful to hear your perspectives on such a critical aspect of it. 

In the depths of the financial crisis, the first regulatory stress tests were designed 

under intense scrutiny with high-stakes consequences.  Their contribution--an 

independent public view of the capital adequacy of the largest firms--helped reinforce the 

banking system at a critical juncture.  Since then, stress testing has meaningfully 

increased the post-stress resiliency of large financial institutions, and become a critical 

tool in keeping the system strong.  

Those accomplishments are real, and we should aim to do more than simply 

preserve them.  Now is a prudent time to consolidate the gains we have made, and to 

promote the efficiency and transparency of our processes.  Today, I will review some of 

our efforts along those lines, focusing on proposed changes to our stress-testing program.  

These changes, which I described in more detail in remarks last week, are intended to 

improve the program, maintaining its dynamism and flexibility while providing adequate 

notice to regulated firms, without altering materially the stringency of the tests or the 

overall level of capital in the system.1  

I share these views with a deep appreciation of the decades of international 

experience represented in this room.  The crisis came with a reminder that the financial 

system is global, that risks in one country can quickly spread to another, and that in 

keeping the system and the economy safe, we have no choice but to work together.  I 

look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes I outline, and on how to improve 

our stress testing processes in the years ahead.
