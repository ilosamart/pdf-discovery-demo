market participants alike.  For these proposals, it will not be a simple matter to find 

a way forward while meeting the heightened regulatory expectations I mentioned 

earlier.  The liquidity requirement of the PFMIs will present a particular challenge 

-- a CCP must have sufficient liquid resources to meet its payment obligations on 

time in extreme but plausible market conditions, including in the event of a default 

of that participant whose default would generate the largest obligations.10  In repo 

trading, unlike in swaps, the full notional principal amount is exchanged at the 

beginning and end of the trade.  As a result, the liquidity requirements for repo 

clearing will be quite high.   

Another key question is how great the opportunities for netting actually are, 

in light of the dominance of “one-way flows” in U.S. repo markets. Netting for 

balance sheet purposes is only permitted for offsetting trades with the same 

maturity and counterparty.11  The many repo market participants who act as either 

lenders or borrowers – but not both – have little opportunity for netting.  Netting 

opportunities are therefore more likely to occur in the interdealer market, so it is 

not surprising that the current repo CCP operates in this segment of the market.12

12 Repo CCPs mainly exist in markets where the underlying flows provide large-scale opportunities for multilateral 
netting.  For example, CCPs play a large role in the European and the Canadian repo markets, which are primarily 
interbank markets.
