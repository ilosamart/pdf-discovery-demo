Rural communities are critical for our nation for many reasons including food production 

and processing, manufacturing, and leading innovation in these industries.  According to the U.S. 

Census Bureau, 97 percent of the country’s land mass is rural, and about 60 million Americans 

call a rural community their home.1  To put that number in perspective, the rural population of the 

United States is larger than the combined populations of the New York, Los Angeles, and 

Chicago metro areas.  If we were talking about the economies of those great cities, we’d stress 

their regional differences, the complexities of demographic change, and the distinct challenges 

each city faces to remain vibrant and innovative.  When the focus shifts to the rural economy, 

however, the discussion tends to be overly broad and simplistic.  The diversity and complexity of 

our vast rural communities too often gets lost--and I think that needs to change.   

There are challenges in rural communities.  We know them all too well.  There is a 

notable gap in access to broadband.  As of 2016, 31 percent of Americans in rural areas were not 

able to access broadband compared to just 2 percent of Americans in urban areas.2  This can have 

a significant business impact on ag producers--for example, limiting access to internet-based 

cattle auctions or inhibiting the ability of dairies to leverage technology to remotely access animal 

nutritionists to formulate feed to maximize milk production.  

 Many rural schools struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers who can teach STEM 

and advanced math classes.  These subjects are vital to preparing our children for the 

opportunities and challenges of a more competitive and technological workplace.3
