Before I discuss the outlook for monetary policy, allow me to review some 

important structural changes that have taken place in the economy over the past decade 

that will be particularly relevant for our monetary policy decisions.   

Structural Changes in the U.S. Economy:  Demand and Supply 

Perhaps the most significant structural change relevant to monetary policy is that 

the real, or inflation-adjusted, rate of interest consistent with full employment and price 

stability, often referred to as the neutral rate, or r*, appears to have fallen in the United 

States and abroad from more than 2 percent before the crisis to less than 1 percent today.3  

The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging 

populations, higher private saving, a greater demand for safe assets, and a slowdown in 

global productivity growth.  The policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are 

important.  All else being equal, a lower neutral rate increases the likelihood that a central 

bank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower bound in a future economic downturn.  

Such a development, in turn, could make it more difficult during a future downturn for 

monetary policy to provide sufficient accommodation to rapidly return employment and 

inflation to mandate-consistent levels.4   

Another important potential change in the U.S. economy has been the steady 

decline in estimates of the structural rate of unemployment consistent with “maximum” 

employment, often referred to as u*.  This decline in u* may be due in part to higher 

                                                 
3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several 
contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); 
and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018). 
4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound 
and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others 
(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).
