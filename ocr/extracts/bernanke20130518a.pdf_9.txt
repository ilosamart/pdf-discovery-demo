overestimate the short-term effects of new technologies while underestimating their 

longer-term potential.5   

Finally, pessimists may be paying too little attention to the strength of the 

underlying economic and social forces that generate innovation in the modern world.  

Invention was once the province of the isolated scientist or tinkerer.  The transmission of 

new ideas and the adaptation of the best new insights to commercial uses were slow and 

erratic.  But all of that is changing radically.  We live on a planet that is becoming richer 

and more populous, and in which not only the most advanced economies but also large 

emerging market nations like China and India increasingly see their economic futures as 

tied to technological innovation.  In that context, the number of trained scientists and 

engineers is increasing rapidly, as are the resources for research being provided by 

universities, governments, and the private sector.  Moreover, because of the Internet and 

other advances in communications, collaboration and the exchange of ideas take place at 

high speed and with little regard for geographic distance.  For example, research papers 

are now disseminated and critiqued almost instantaneously rather than after publication in 

a journal several years after they are written.  And, importantly, as trade and globalization 

increase the size of the potential market for new products, the possible economic rewards 

for being first with an innovative product or process are growing rapidly.6  In short, both 

humanity’s capacity to innovate and the incentives to innovate are greater today than at 

any other time in history.
