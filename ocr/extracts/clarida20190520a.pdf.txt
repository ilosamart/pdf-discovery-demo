“Fed Listens:  A Capstone Roundtable” 
hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York

May 20, 2019 
 



I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing the New York perspective 

for the Federal Reserve’s review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices.1  We are bringing open minds to our review and are seeking a 

broad range of perspectives.  To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to 

engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive 

approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 

Motivation for the Review 

The Congress charged the Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate—

maximum employment and price stability—and this review will take this mandate as 

given.  We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for 

personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-

stability mandate.  While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and 

communications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate 

ways they might be improved. 

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and 

price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review.  The 

unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent 

objective.  We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming 

years.  In addition, we will evaluate the new policy tools and enhanced communication 

practices the Federal Reserve deployed in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the

2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy 
framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement 
needed changes.

Great Recession.  Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved 

significantly since before the crisis. 

Perhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United 

States and abroad.3  This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for 

years and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-

taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.  These factors’ contributions are 

highly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the 

decline in neutral rates are important.  All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates 

increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower 

bound in future economic downturns.  That development, in turn, could make it more 

difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business 

investment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.4 

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less 

responsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between 

inflation and employment.5  This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.  

It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during 

downturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained 

inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment 

                                                 
3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several 
contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); 
and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018). 
4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound 
and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others 
(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019). 
5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research as a 
flattening of the short-run Phillips curve.  For evidence of this flattening in the slope of the Phillips curve in 
the United States and abroad, see, among others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, 
and Summers (2015); and Bank for International Settlements (2017).

conditions.6  However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, 

of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, it is all the 

more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels 

consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 

Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the 

challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of 

the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent 

in April, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is 

currently operating beyond full employment.  However, the level of the unemployment 

rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be 

estimated.  The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current 

level of the unemployment rate.  For example, in the March Blue Chip economic outlook 

survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10 

                                                 
6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary 
policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such 
a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and 
Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a 
central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the 
adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary 
policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to 
shocks. 
7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others 
(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the 
precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the 
level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in 
these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low 
and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in 
determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.

respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10 

respondents.8 

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a 

pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working 

years.9  These increases in participation have provided employers with a significant 

source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures.  

As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight 

labor market remains uncertain. 

The strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that 

have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.  For example, African 

Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than 

whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as 

the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to 

these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11  Likewise, 

although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they 

are for their more-educated counterparts, these gaps appear to narrow as the labor market 

                                                 
8 The average estimate from the Blue Chip respondents was 4.3 percent.  The box “How Tight Is the Labor 
Market?” in the Board’s February 2018 Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of some indicators 
that can be used to assess labor market tightness; see Board of Governors (2018a, pp. 8-9). 
9 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018 
Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for 
prime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8-10). 
10 See Cajner and others (2017) for a careful examination of how labor market differentials by race and 
ethnicity have evolved over time. 
11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and 
ethnicity in a strong labor market.  The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and 
for employment-to-population ratios.

strengthens.12  And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for 

less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

Our monetary policy review will have several components.14  The Board and the 

Reserve Banks are hosting Fed Listens events—such as this one in New York—in which 

we are hearing from, among others, business and labor leaders, community development 

advocates, and academics.  Next month, we are holding a System research conference at 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  

The program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the 

review. 

Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal Open 

Market Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy, 

beginning around the middle of the year.  We expect to make our conclusions public in 

the first half of 2020. 

Concluding Thoughts 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

                                                 
12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.  
However, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened.  The box “Employment 
Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report 
examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10-12).  See also Weingarden 
(2017). 
13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be 
calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The 
Economic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data.

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict 

our ultimate finding.  What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary 

policy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and 

sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
