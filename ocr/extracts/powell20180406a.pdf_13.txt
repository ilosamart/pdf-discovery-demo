To summarize this discussion, some of the factors weighing on longer-term 

growth are likely to be persistent, particularly the slowing in growth of the workforce.  

Others are hard to predict, such as productivity.   But as a nation, we are not bystanders.  

We can put policies in place that will support labor force participation and give us the 

best chance to achieve broad and sustained increases in productivity, and thus in living 

standards.  These policies are mostly outside the toolkit of the Federal Reserve, such as 

those that support investment in education and workersâ€™ skills, business investment and 

research and development, and investment in infrastructure.

Let me turn now to monetary policy.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the 

FOMC went to extraordinary lengths to promote the recovery, support job growth, and 

prevent inflation from falling too low.  As the recovery advanced, it became appropriate 

to begin reducing monetary policy support.  Since monetary policy affects the economy 

with a lag, waiting until inflation and employment hit our goals before reducing policy 

support could have led to a rise in inflation to unwelcome levels.  In such circumstances, 

monetary policy might need to tighten abruptly, which could disrupt the economy or even 

trigger a recession.  

As a result, to sustain the expansion, the FOMC adopted a gradual approach to 

reducing monetary policy support.  We began in December 2015 by raising our target for 

the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.  Since then, with the economy 

improving but inflation still below target and some slack remaining, the Committee has 

continued to gradually raise interest rates.  This patient approach also reduced the risk 

that an unforeseen blow to the economy might push the federal funds rate back near
