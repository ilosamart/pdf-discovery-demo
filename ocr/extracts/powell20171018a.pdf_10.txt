We are very grateful to the members of the Faster Payment Task Force for all of 

their work and for the collaborative spirit they brought to the job.  But there is more to be 

done to advance our collective vision of a ubiquitous, real-time, secure future payment 

system.  Last month, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to that vision in the 

paper, “Federal Reserve Next Steps in the Payments Improvement Journey,” which 

outlines refreshed strategies and tactics that we, in collaboration with the payment 

industry, will employ to make further progress. 8  I will mention just a few. 

One of the recommendations from the Faster Payments Task Force work was to 

establish an industry governance framework for collaboration and decision-making on 

faster payments.  To move forward in creating this framework, the task force established 

the Governance Framework Formation Team to develop, publish, and solicit public 

comment on a proposal for a governance framework.  This work group will carry out 

many of the task force recommendations and the Federal Reserve, at the request of the 

task force, is chairing and facilitating this effort.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve is considering providing settlement services—a 

traditional core function of a central bank—to address the future needs of a ubiquitous 

real-time retail payments environment.  We plan to actively engage with the industry and 

other stakeholders to further understand gaps and requirements for real-time retail 

payments settlement and assess alternative models that will support needs over the long 

term.  We also plan to explore and assess the need, if any, for other related Federal 

Reserve services or capabilities.  In carrying out this assessment, we will be guided by
