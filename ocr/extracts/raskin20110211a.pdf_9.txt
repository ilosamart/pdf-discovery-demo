delinquencies.  There would also need to be much more clarity and specificity about loss 

mitigation standards and systems for auditing internal procedures.  Such a system could 

more appropriately compensate servicers and sub-servicers for the level of work involved 

in servicing very different types of loans.  Specialists could emerge who focus primarily 

on the routine performing loans or the more involved non-performing ones.  If the non-

performing specialist was a third party, the existing servicer could either transfer the 

servicing rights once a loan hits a certain delinquency trigger, or simply have the loans 

subserviced--of course with high levels of accountability--on a fee-for-services basis until 

the delinquency is resolved.  One structure along these general lines has recently been 

proposed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.  While many details would need 

to be worked out and possible implications thought through, I believe it is a promising 

start.   

Another structural change that would help would be a limit on the extent to which 

servicers have to advance principal and interest on non-performing loans.  In times of 

high delinquency, this can put considerable financial strain on servicers, which can lead 

to negative consequences for consumers trying to work with those stressed servicers.  

This could be addressed by changing secondary market standards so that servicers only 

have to advance  mortgage principal and interest up to, say, 60 or 90 days beyond 

delinquency.  Alternatively, they could advance principal and interest payments only as 

they come in--a so-called “actual/actual” schedule.  Either change would affect the 

payment streams to investors, but I would imagine that participants in the secondary 

markets would be able to model with some confidence how this would affect the value of 

securities and adjust pricing accordingly.
