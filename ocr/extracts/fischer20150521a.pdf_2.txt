It is an honor and a pleasure to participate in the ECB Forum on Central Banking, 

and I thank you, President Draghi, and other members of the ECB Board, for inviting me 

to take part.1  Although the topic of the conference is inflation and unemployment, I will 

take another perspective by discussing some of the past, present, and future challenges 

that have and may in future confront the ECB and the euro area.    

My theme is taken from Jean Monnet, who in 1976 wrote:  “Europe will be forged 

in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.”2  This quote is 

discussed in the interesting recent paper by Luigi Guiso, Paola Sapienza, and Luigi 

Zingales, whose view of Monnet’s contention can be deduced from the title of their 

paper:  “Monnet’s Error?”3  There are similar quotes from others, among them Jacques 

Chirac in 2003 and the former chief economist of the ECB, Ottmar Issing, in 2010.4   I 

first heard a statement to this effect from Jean-Claude Trichet at the 2011 Jackson Hole 

conference.5   

1 I am grateful to Brian Doyle, Jane Haltmaier, Stacey Tevlin and Paul Wood of the Federal Reserve Board 
for their assistance.  The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on 
the Federal Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.

4 In a 2003 TV interview, Chirac said, “And whenever there’s been a crisis, we’ve emerged from it with a 
stronger Europe.”  See TF1 and France2 (2003), “Excerpts of TV Interview by President Chirac to TF1 and 
France2,” March 10, www.david-morrison.org.uk/other-documents/chirac-20030310.htm.   
     In November 2010, Prof. Issing (then chief economist and member of the Board of the ECB) gave an 
address at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Pavia for the honoris causa degree in international 
economic integration.  He said, “After all, ‘Europe,’ to use this term, has been through many crises and all 
in all has emerged stronger from each one.”  See Otmar Issing (2010), “Professor Otmar Issing Address,” 
in “Otmar Issing:  An Economist and Architect of Supranational Institutions,” introduction by Guido 
Montani, Il Politico (University of Pavia, Italy), no. 1, p. 22,

5 A year later, at the 2012 Jackson Hole conference, I quoted Jean-Claude as having said, “[T]he European 
project is a project in process.  It was not set up with this particular aim of getting to a monetary union.  
We’ve had crisis after crisis since we started.  At every stage of the process, we have heard the same story 
from Americans . . . .  ‘You Europeans don’t know how to make decisions.  You’re always slow.  What 
phone number should I call if I want to speak to Europe?  This dream is bound to collapse.’  We have heard 
that every time, and we have been slow.  But in the end we have emerged stronger from every crisis.”  I
