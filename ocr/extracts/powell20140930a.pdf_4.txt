assets.  By most estimates, the 10-year Treasury term premium was deeply negative from 

mid-2011 through mid-2013; it remains near zero today, far below normal pre-crisis 

levels.  Given the very low level of rates over this period, it is not clear to me that a 

slightly more negative term premium would have produced materially different real 

economy results. 

Third, the authors’ proposals seem to me to be fraught with risk for the Federal 

Reserve.  I believe that the existing institutional arrangements have served the public 

well.  The independence of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly valuable to 

society.  There is considerable evidence that monetary policy independence leads to 

better macroeconomic outcomes.  Any active collaboration between debt management 

and monetary policy, even in a crisis, would risk calling into question that independence.  

That is a risk I would be very reluctant to take.   

The period after the Second World War during which debt management imposed 

requirements upon monetary policy was marked by strains between the Treasury and the 

Fed and less than full independence for monetary policy.  While current institutional 

arrangements may be imperfect, history suggests a need for caution before allowing these 

two policies to become entangled once again. 

Thanks again, and I look forward to our conversation.
