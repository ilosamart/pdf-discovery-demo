gradually improving, and the equilibrium real federal funds rate has been gradually 

rising.  Although the recent appreciation of the dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports 

over time, I nonetheless anticipate further diminution of the headwinds just noted over 

the next couple of years, and as the equilibrium real funds rate continues to rise, it will 

accordingly be appropriate to raise the actual level of the real federal funds rate in 

tandem, all else being equal.7  At present, the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which 

by some estimates is currently close to zero, appears to be well below the longer-run 

normal levels assessed by the FOMC.  The median SEP estimate of this longer-run 

normal rate--that is, the long-run projection of the nominal funds rate less 2 percent 

inflation--stood at 1-3/4 percent in the FOMC's recent projections.8  Provided that 

inflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward 2 percent in the context of 

continuing progress toward maximum employment, I therefore expect that a further 

tightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds rate will be 

warranted.  Should incoming data, however, fail to support this forecast, then the actual 

path of policy will need to be adjusted appropriately.  

7 If resource utilization was at a normal level and inflation was equal to 2 percent, policymakers would 
presumably opt to set the real federal funds rate equal to the equilibrium real rate in order to maintain those 
conditions.  Accordingly, if the equilibrium rate is rising over time, the “neutral” setting of monetary policy 
should be rising in tandem. 
8 For example, the estimate of the equilibrium real rate from the Laubach-Williams model for 2014:Q4 is 
negative 0.16.  For information on the model, see Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2003), 
“Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), 
pp. 1063-70; updated estimates of the baseline model are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco website at www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john-
williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.  Another recent study, however, concludes that the 
equilibrium real rate is probably in the range of 1 to 2 percent while also emphasizing that estimates in this 
area are quite imprecise; see James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West 
(2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate:  Past, Present, and Future,” working paper (San Diego:  
University of California at San Diego, March), http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/USMPF_2015.pdf. 
Note that the concept of the equilibrium real rate used in the latter study is explicitly long-run in nature and 
so excludes the effects of forces that have persistently restrained the pace of the current expansion but are 
expected to eventually fade away, such as household balance sheet repair; for this reason, the paper’s 
estimate is higher than the medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate discussed in the speech.
