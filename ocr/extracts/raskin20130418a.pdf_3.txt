you in the room have shed important light on the recent trends in inequality and on the 

potential role of fiscal policy in addressing them.  You have also explored how these 

trends are relevant to issues of financial stability.  I won’t attempt to repeat this strong 

line of research and analysis.  Instead, my remarks today are specifically focused on 

adding to the conversation about how such disparities in income and wealth could be 

relevant for a macro understanding of the financial crisis and the recovery and the 

appropriate course of monetary policy today.     

I will argue that at the start of this recession, an unusually large number of low- 

and middle-income households were vulnerable to exactly the types of shocks that 

sparked the financial crisis.  These households, which had endured 30 years of very 

sluggish real-wage growth, held an unusually large share of their wealth in housing, 

much of it financed with debt.  As a result, over time, their exposure to house prices had 

increased dramatically.  Thus, as in past recessions, suffering in the Great Recession--

though widespread--was most painful and most perilous for low- and middle-income 

households, which were also more likely to be affected by job loss and had little wealth 

to fall back on.  

Moreover, I am persuaded that because of how hard these lower- and middle-

income households were hit, the recession was worse and the recovery has been weaker.  

The recovery has also been hampered by a continuation of longer-term trends that have 

reduced employment prospects for those at the lower end of the income distribution and 

produced weak wage growth.   

Of course, it is not part of the Federal Reserve’s mandate to address inequality 

directly, but I want to explore these issues today because the answers may have
