Many banks engaged in agricultural lending are located in communities where 

farming is the primary economic driver, and simply pushing every borrower with 

challenges out of the bank does not benefit the long-term interests of the bank or the 

community it serves.  The Federal Reserve recognizes the benefits when lenders work 

prudently with troubled borrowers in a way that serves the long-term interests of all 

stakeholders. 

I would like to conclude by recognizing how fortunate we are to have so many 

highly skilled and experienced farmers and operators, and agricultural lenders who 

support them.  Modern agriculture is a sophisticated and complex business that requires 

skilled forecasting of supply and demand, rigorous financial and operational 

management, and sharp technical expertise.  Our farmers and operators are pushing 

forward the frontiers of agriculture.  The integration of robotics, data analytics, 

geolocation, and advanced sensors holds the promise of a new, more efficient and 

productive era of “precision agriculture.”   

A close working relationship between farmers and agricultural lenders is essential 

to the economic growth of agricultural borrowers and the continued success of many 

rural communities.  The outlook for U.S. agriculture is challenging, though agricultural 

banks remain relatively stable.  As such, it is important for the Federal Reserve to 

continue to tailor effective supervision and regulation to ensure the safety and soundness 

of agricultural banks, while also making sure that undue burden does not constrain the 

capacity of these institutions to continue supporting the agricultural communities that 

they serve.
