   On the financial education front, examples of the Federal Reserve’s many 

resources available to the public are 

 an online credit card calculator that helps consumers estimate how long it will 

take to pay off a credit card bill under different payment scenarios,2 

 concise brochures--in both English and Spanish--offering consumer tips on such 

topics as avoiding mortgage foreclosure scams and protecting their checking 

accounts,3 and 

  interactive websites  that provide consumers with what they need to know about 

new protections for credit card accounts and overdraft protection programs that 

recently took effect.4 

As for consumer protection, the Federal Reserve continues to demonstrate its 

commitment in this area.  We have recently issued rules pertaining to mortgages, credit 

cards, student loans, and overdraft protection programs, among others.  I should note that 

in recent years we have used extensive consumer testing, both to improve financial 

disclosures and to highlight practices that simply cannot be understood by consumers 

even with the best disclosures and thus must be prohibited.  We’ve also stepped up our 

consumer protection supervision and enforcement, including at the nonbank subsidiaries 

of bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations. 

Again, let me congratulate the foundation for all the good work that it does.  I 

would also like to recognize and congratulate the others honored this evening--John
