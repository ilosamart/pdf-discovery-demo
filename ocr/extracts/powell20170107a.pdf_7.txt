portfolios do not suggest that life insurers have increased risk-taking.  The same is true 

for banks.  Both the regulatory environment and banks’ own attitudes toward risk 

following the financial crisis have helped ensure that the largest banks have not taken on 

excessive credit or duration risks relative to their capital cushions. 

Low rates have provided support for asset valuations--indeed, that is part of their 

design.  But I do not see valuations as significantly out of line with historical experience.  

Equity prices have recently increased considerably, pushing the forward price-earnings 

ratio further above its historical median (slide).  And equity premiums (right)--the 

expected return above the risk-free rate for taking equity risk--have declined but are not 

out of line with historical experience.   

In the nonfinancial sector, valuation pressures are most concerning when leverage 

is high, particularly in real estate markets.  Residential real estate valuations have been in 

line with rents and household incomes in recent years, and the ratio of mortgage debt to 

income is well below its pre-crisis peak and still declining.  In contrast, valuations in 

commercial real estate are high in some markets.10  And in the nonfinancial corporate 

sector, gross leverage is high by historical standards.  Low long-term rates have 

encouraged corporate debt issuance at the same time that some regulations, particularly 

the Volcker rule, have discouraged banks from holding and making markets in such debt.  

High-risk corporate debt (the sum of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans) grew rapidly 

in 2013 and 2014 (slide), although growth has declined sharply since then.11  However, 

                                                 
10 The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, issued guidance regarding prudent management of risks from loans secured by 
commercial real estate (CRE) in late 2015.  Of course, the annual stress tests typically feature significant 
declines in CRE prices, suggesting that banks are capitalized against a deterioration in this sector. 
11 Gilchrist and Zakrajšek’s (2012) measure of the corporate bond spread, shown in figure A.3, is at about 
its average level, but their estimate of the risk premium in this market is low, so, by this measure, at least 
pricing is rich.
