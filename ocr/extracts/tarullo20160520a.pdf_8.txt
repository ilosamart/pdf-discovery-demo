management.  For firms designated as systemically important, our supervision has additionally 

emphasized capital and liquidity planning and positions, management of core business lines, and

continue to discuss supervisory plans and findings for the insurance firms, extend invitations for 

joint inspection activities, and discuss common areas of supervisory focus.   

As you likely know, the Board is also working to develop a regulatory framework for its 

supervised insurance companies.  The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Board to establish 

minimum capital requirements for both systemically important insurance companies and SLHCs 

and bank holding companies predominantly engaged in insurance activities.  For systemically 

important insurance companies, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Board to establish enhanced 

prudential standards in order to mitigate risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the 

material distress, failure, or ongoing activities of these companies.  The enhanced prudential 

standards must include, among other things, enhanced capital requirements, liquidity 

requirements, corporate governance and risk-management standards, and resolution planning 

requirements.  We have already established resolution planning requirements for the systemically 

important firms.  At present, we have three major regulatory initiatives underway for our 

supervised insurance firms: first, reporting requirements for the systemically important firms; 

second, enhanced corporate governance, risk management, and liquidity standards for those same 

firms; and third, capital requirements for all supervised insurance firms.  Let me say a few words
