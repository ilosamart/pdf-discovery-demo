markets-centric view of financial stability, as opposed to a purely intermediary-centric 

view.  This is, of course, not to suggest that shocks to large leveraged intermediaries are 

not as important--if not more so--as those that play out primarily in capital markets.  

Rather, the premise is simply that disruptions originating in the capital market can be of 

consequence in their own right, and that they may be less amenable to being dealt with 

via financial regulation.  In this regard, I am echoing a point made recently by Feroli and 

others, who have emphasized the fragilities related to bond fund flows.12      

Let me start by being clear on terminology:  By the “risk premium” on an asset 

category, I mean the ex ante expected return, based on an objective statistical model, that 

an investor can anticipate earning on the asset in excess of that on short-term Treasury 

bills.  So I will use the words “risk premium” and “expected return” interchangeably in 

what follows.  And, for the sake of concreteness, I will focus on two of these bond market 

risk premiums in particular:  the so-called term premium, which is the expected excess 

return on longer-term Treasury bonds relative to short-term bills, and the credit risk 

premium, which is the expected excess return on bonds with credit risk (for example, 

corporate bonds, or asset-backed securities) relative to safe Treasury securities. 

With all of the rhetorical heat that gets generated about whether the Federal 

Reserve can or should try to spot bubbles, it is worth keeping some uncontroversial facts 

in mind.  It is widely accepted among researchers in finance that there is an economically 

large amount of predictable variation in the risk premiums on a wide range of assets 

classes.13  For example, Cochrane and Piazzesi document that the excess returns on 

longer-term Treasury securities can be predicted one year ahead with a simple model that
