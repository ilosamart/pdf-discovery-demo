equilibrium interest rates was most pronounced at the time of the financial crisis, but 

rates have shown little tendency to increase during the long recovery from the crisis.  

How Should We Think about the Decline in Equilibrium Interest Rates?  An 

Investment and Savings Framework 

There are many factors that could be holding down interest rates, some of which 

could fade over time, including the effects of quantitative easing in the United States and 

abroad and a heightened demand for safe assets affecting yields on advanced-economy 

government securities.  I will focus on some of the more enduring factors that could 

potentially lower the equilibrium interest for some time. 

In attempting to explain why real interest rates have fallen, a useful starting point 

is to think of the natural interest rate as the price that equilibrates the economyâ€™s supply 

of saving with the demand for investment in the long run, when the economy is at full 

employment.  With this framework in mind, low interest rates reflect factors that increase 

saving, depress investment demand, or both.     

Focusing initially on the United States, I will look at three interrelated factors that 

are likely contributing to low interest rates:  slower trend economic growth, an aging 

population and demographic developments, and relatively weak investment.  I will then 

discuss global developments and spillovers between countries.   

But first I would like to interject a quick word on why we as policymakers might 

be concerned about low interest rates.  I highlight three main worries.  First, as John 

Maynard Keynes discussed in the concluding chapters of The General Theory of 

Employment, Interest and Money, a low equilibrium interest rate increases the risks of 

falling into a liquidity trap, a situation where the nominal interest rate is stuck, by an
