  The flow of funds data include breakdowns of the 

different assets and liabilities of each of these intermediaries.  Our test then requires us to 

measure the “illiquidity” of each category of asset and the “stickiness” of each category 

of liability, which we do using homemade indexes that vary from 0 to 1.  Although there 

is inevitably some subjectivity involved in constructing these indexes, we try to minimize 

this subjectivity by relying as heavily as possible on the parameters in Basel III’s Net 

Stable Funding Ratio and Liquidity Coverage Ratio.

  With these indexes in hand, we 

can then aggregate up to create values for the asset illiquidity and liability stickiness of an 

entire intermediary sector.

Figure 4 plots the results of this exercise using data as of year-end 2012.  As can 

be seen, there is a very tight cross-intermediary correlation between liability stickiness 

and asset illiquidity.  At one end of the spectrum are money market funds and broker-

dealers--prototypical shadow-bank-type institutions--with very low values of both, and at 

the other end are banks and life insurance companies.  While there are only eight data 

points, the close fit of the regression line is consistent with the broad thrust of our story. 

To further highlight the importance of stable bank liabilities, figure 5 takes an 

approach similar to that of figure 4 but plots asset illiquidity versus the contractual 

maturity of liabilities, rather than their effective stickiness.  Now the banking sector

 As an example, using this approach, we assigned values of the illiquidity index of 0 for Treasury 

securities, 0.15 for agency MBS, 0.5 for corporate equities, and 1.0 for unsecured commercial and 

industrial loans and commercial real estate loans.  Similarly, we assigned values of the stickiness index of 

0 for nondeposit short-term funding, 0.7 for wholesale bank deposits, 0.8 for retail time and savings 

deposits, and 0.9 for transactions deposits.
