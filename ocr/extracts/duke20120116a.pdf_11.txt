free of short-term political influence is critical for central banks.  This capability is 

especially true because the effective conduct of monetary policy requires a long-term 

perspective.  A central bank that is subject to political pressure might opt for policies that 

favor rapid expansion in the near term at the expense of higher inflation in the future.  

Such actions would surely result in the loss of the public confidence and credibility that 

are needed to achieve the objectives of monetary policy.  Indeed, research has shown that 

countries with independent central banks have better economic performance and lower 

inflation than countries whose central banks are not independent.

The structure of the Federal Reserve is uniquely American in its decentralization.  

The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., 

and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.  The members of the Board of

Bank directors choose a president to run the Bank.
