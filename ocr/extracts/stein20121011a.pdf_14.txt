both our conceptual understanding and our measurement techniques remain 

underdeveloped and where more work would be of great value in informing policy. 

Second, things can change over time.  One episode of interest is the Clinton-era 

debt buyback program, which was in many ways analogous to an LSAP.  Between 

March 2000 and December 2001, the Treasury repurchased long-term bonds with a face 

value of $63.5 billion, about 10 percent of the value of long-term government debt then 

outstanding.  Much as with an LSAP, this program appears to have had a powerful 

negative effect on the term premium, with long-term rates falling sharply relative to 

short-term rates.17  But in contrast to what we have seen with LSAPs thus far, it was also 

associated with a pronounced increase in Treasury-specific scarcity.  One way this 

scarcity manifested in the data available at the time was in a widening of the Treasury-

swap spread, which rose rapidly after the announcement of the buybacks, and hovered in 

a range of 120 to 130 basis points in the spring and summer of 2000.18  The lesson to be 

drawn is that we should continue to develop and monitor a variety of metrics of this 

scarcity phenomenon because they may provide an early warning if LSAP costs begin to 

rise relative to benefits.   

For the sake of concreteness, I have couched the discussion in terms of a 

hypothetical all-Treasury LSAP.  In light of our recent initiation of an MBS purchase 

program, it is natural to ask what the salient differences are between buying Treasury 

securities and buying MBS.  In my view there are two, both of which suggest that MBS 

purchases may offer a better cost-benefit profile than Treasury purchases in the current 

                                                 
17 See Greenwood and Vayanos (2010) for an analysis of the Clinton buyback program and its effect on the 
Treasury yield curve. 
18 One important distinction is that in the case of the Clinton-era buybacks, bond prices were likely 
influenced not simply by the bond purchases themselves, but by the prospect of future surpluses over a 
longer horizon.
