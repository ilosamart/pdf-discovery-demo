prolonged hit to output growth following the global financial crisis.  As Cerra and Saxena 

and Reinhart and Rogoff, among others, have documented, it takes a long time for output 

in the wake of banking and financial crises to return to pre-crisis levels.5  Possibly we are 

simply seeing a prolonged Reinhart-Rogoff cyclical episode, typical of the aftermath of 

deep financial crises, and compounded by other temporary headwinds.  But it is also 

possible that the underperformance reflects a more structural, longer-term, shift in the 

global economy, with less growth in underlying supply factors.   

Separating out the cyclical from the structural, the temporary from the permanent, 

impacts of the Great Recession and its aftermath on the macroeconomy is necessary to 

assessing and calibrating appropriate policies going forward.  The difficulty in 

disentangling demand and supply factors makes the job of the monetary policymaker 

especially hard since it complicates the assessment of the amount of slack, or 

underutilized productive capacity, in the economy.  Over the longer term it will be 

possible to disentangle the amount of slack on the basis of the behavior of prices and 

wages as the levels of resource utilization in economies rise, but it would be better to 

understand why growth has been so slow without experiencing either a runup in inflation 

or a descent into deflation.   

In the United States, three major aggregate demand headwinds appear to have 

kept a more vigorous recovery from taking hold.  The unusual weakness of the housing
