take stock of how the Federal Reserve formulates, conducts, and communicates monetary 

policy.  As part of this outreach effort, the Federal Reserve System will hold a research 

conference June 4-5, 2019, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and featuring 

outside speakers and panelists.  The Federal Reserve Board and Reserve District Banks 

will also be holding outreach and public events as we seek views from a wide range of 

interested parties.  Beginning in the summer of 2019, the FOMC will draw on what it has 

learned from the conference and the System outreach events as it assesses possible ways 

in which the Fedâ€™s strategy, tools, and communication practices might evolve to best 

achieve, on a sustained basis, the twin goals of maximum employment and price stability 

assigned to it by the Congress.  We anticipate making our findings public after the FOMC 

concludes this review sometime in 2020.  

Concluding Thoughts 

The U.S. economy enters 2019 after a year of strong growth, with inflation near 

our 2 percent objective, and with the unemployment rate near 50-year lows.  That said, 

growth and growth prospects in other economies around the world have moderated 

somewhat in recent months, and overall financial conditions have tightened materially.  

These recent developments in the global economy and financial markets represent 

crosswinds to the U.S. economy.  If these crosswinds are sustained, appropriate 

forward-looking monetary policy should seek to offset them to keep the economy as 

close as possible to our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price 

stability.  As we have long said, monetary policy is not on a preset course.  Going 

forward, we need, I believe, to be cognizant of the balance we must strike between 

(1) being forward looking and preemptive and (2) maximizing the odds of being right.
