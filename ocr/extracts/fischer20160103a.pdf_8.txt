sort in the United States is the potential for destabilizing effects in money 

markets.  For example, various observers have noted that negative rates could lead 

to scenarios in which money funds “break the buck” or simply shut down, either 

of which could generate strains in money markets.  Another concern is whether 

the complex and interconnected infrastructure supporting securities transactions in 

the U.S. financial system could readily adapt to a world of negative interest rates.  

For example, similar to the types of issues addressed ahead of the year 2000, there 

could well be automated systems that simply are not coded properly at present to 

process transactions based on instruments with negative rates.  All of these are, of 

course, transitional problems, but they might be sufficient to make a move to 

negative rates difficult to implement on short notice.

Raising the Equilibrium Real Rate:  An even more ambitious approach to ease the 

constraints posed by the zero lower bound would be to take steps aimed at raising 

the equilibrium real rate.  For example, expansionary fiscal policy would boost 

the equilibrium real rate. In particular, the need for more modern infrastructure in 

many parts of the American economy is hard to miss.  And we should not forget

that additional effective investment in education also adds to the nation’s capital.

As another example, numerous studies of the effects of the Federal Reserve’s 

asset purchases suggest that these operations have reduced the level of the term 

premium embedded in long-term interest rates.  If aggregate demand depends 

primarily on the level of long-term interest rates, it might be possible, in principle, 

to maintain a level of long-term rates consistent with full employment and stable 

prices by lowering term premiums while at the same time raising the level of
