observation reinforces the importance of the international agenda for strengthening 

capital and liquidity standards.  It also counsels continued attention to efforts to ensure 

that globally active institutions are subject to effective consolidated supervision, and that 

information-sharing arrangements among home and host country supervisors are well 

designed and implemented.  To this end, the key supervisors and central banks for each 

of the largest global banks will begin to meet regularly to discuss crisis planning, with 

particular attention to contingency liquidity planning. 

The crisis demonstrated that issues around cross-border liquidity support are 

difficult.  Liquidity pressures may arise in unexpected places, time for coordination will 

be short, and failures in one jurisdiction likely will spread quickly to other jurisdictions.  

The Basel Committee and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors are each 

working on definitions of liquid assets, common stress-testing metrics, and structural 

balance sheet measures.  We are actively discussing the appropriate division of 

responsibility between home and host authorities to provide liquidity support and the 

related issue of how to approach cross-border branch operations.  Some have called into 

question the traditional assumption that home country authorities will be willing and able 

to support all of the worldwide operations of a banking group headquartered in its 

jurisdiction.  It is not clear what approach might work better, but there is an obvious need 

for broad international consistency and careful calibration with other prudential 

requirements. 

One of the key issues identified by the Basel Committee’s Cross-Border Bank 

Resolution Group is the complexity and interconnectedness of the largest organizations.  

Often the complexity is motivated by tax or regulatory factors, rather than a clear
