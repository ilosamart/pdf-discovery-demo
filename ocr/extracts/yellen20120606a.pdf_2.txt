Good evening.  I’m honored to have the opportunity to address the Boston Economic 

Club and I’m grateful to Chip Case for inviting me to speak to you tonight.  As most of you 

probably know, Chip was one of the first economists to document worrisome signs of a housing 

bubble in parts of the United States.  After sounding an early alarm in 2003, Chip watched the 

bubble grow and was prescient in anticipating the very serious toll that its unwinding would 

impose on the economy.  Chip recognized that declining house prices would affect not just 

residential construction but also consumer spending, the ability of households to borrow, and the 

health of the financial system.  In light of these pervasive linkages, the repeat sales house price 

index that bears Chip’s name is one of the most closely watched of all U.S. economic indicators.  

Indeed, as I will discuss this evening, prolonged weakness in the housing sector remains one of 

several serious headwinds facing the U.S. economy.  Given these headwinds, I believe that a 

highly accommodative monetary policy will be needed for quite some time to help the economy 

mend.  Before continuing, let me emphasize that my remarks reflect my own views and not 

necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1 

Economic Conditions and the Outlook 

In my remarks tonight, I will describe my perspective on monetary policy.  To begin, 

however, I’ll highlight some of the current conditions and key features of the economic outlook 

that shape my views.  To anticipate the main points, the economy appears to be expanding at a 

moderate pace.  The unemployment rate is almost 1 percentage point lower than it was a year 

ago, but we are still far from full employment.  Looking ahead, I anticipate that significant 

headwinds will continue to restrain the pace of the recovery so that the remaining employment

Reifschneider--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks.
