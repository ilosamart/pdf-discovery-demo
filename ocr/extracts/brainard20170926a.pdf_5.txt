the aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of 

any additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are 

likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.6   

Disparities by Race and Ethnicity 

 When we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.7  In August, the national 

unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked 

substantial differences across different demographic groups.  As shown in figure 1, 

unemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians, 

5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans.  Labor force 

participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than 

unemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent.  These 

differences are not a recent development--similar differences across racial and ethnic 

dimensions have existed for as long as these data have been collected.  Even more 

striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic 

groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age 

and education levels.8   

 Although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups 

are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably 

during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades.  Differences in 

unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during
