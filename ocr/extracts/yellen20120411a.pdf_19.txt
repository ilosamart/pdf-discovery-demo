situation and the limits placed on conventional policy by the zero lower bound on interest 

rates, these issues of risk management take on special importance. 

More broadly, these considerations help illustrate why it would be imprudent to 

adhere mechanistically to the prescriptions of any single policy rule.  Such rules can 

serve as useful benchmarks for facilitating monetary policy deliberations and 

communications, but a dose of good judgment will always be essential as well.   

Uncertainty and Policy Conditionality  

The policy prescriptions I’ve discussed thus far are conditioned on an illustrative 

baseline forecast for unemployment and inflation.  Because any economic forecast is 

inherently uncertain, the FOMC’s forward policy guidance states explicitly that the 

Committee “currently anticipates” that economic conditions are likely to warrant such a 

stance of policy. The guidance does not state that the Committee will keep the funds rate 

exceptionally low until at least late 2014.  I’d consider it completely appropriate to 

modify the specification of the forward guidance in response to significant changes in the 

economic outlook.  

Potential modifications of the forward guidance can be illustrated by showing 

how the Taylor (1999) rule responds to two different shifts in the outlook.  Figure 9 

shows one scenario in which the recovery turns out to be unexpectedly strong, with the 

unemployment rate reaching 6 percent by the end of 2014 and inflation moving a little 

above 2 percent later in the decade.  It also shows a second scenario in which the 

recovery is unexpectedly weak, with the unemployment rate remaining above 8 percent 

until early 2014.  In this scenario, inflation stays persistently below 2 percent.  In the 

stronger scenario, the Taylor (1999) rule calls for the liftoff from the zero lower bound to
