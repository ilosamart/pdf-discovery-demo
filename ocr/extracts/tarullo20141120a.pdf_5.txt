placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, thereby accelerating margin calls on 

leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for all holders of the assets.  The margin 

calls and booked losses would start another round in the adverse feedback loop.  In short, the 

financial industry in the years preceding the crisis had been transformed into one that was highly 

susceptible to runs on the short-term, uninsured cash equivalents that funded longer-term 

extensions of credit.2  

Designing and implementing a policy response in light of the vulnerabilities of short-term 

wholesale funding markets that were revealed in the 2007–09 crisis is an integral part of post-

crisis reform.  The key question is how to balance the important role these markets have come to 

play in funding economic activity with the need to contain the destabilizing risks of runs in these 

same markets.  To get a better sense of the terms of this balancing effort, let me examine the 

implications, first, of relying completely on liquidity requirements to manage liquidity problems, 

and then of relying entirely on LOLR liquidity from a central bank.  The shortcomings associated 

with either of these one-dimensional approaches demonstrate why liquidity regulation and LOLR 

should be viewed as complements and not substitutes.3   

2 Note that financial entities that do not use debt financing can nevertheless experience liquidity pressures that are 
structurally similar to bank runs.  For example, in the context of various pooled investment vehicles, investors may 
have an incentive to redeem their shares early because the costs of the redemptions are effectively borne by 
remaining investors.  The resulting “first-mover advantage” contributed to runs on money market mutual funds in 
the fall of 2008 and could, at least in theory, lead to runs on other open-end fund vehicles.  The U.S. Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is currently developing a work plan to analyze potential risks associated with 
asset management products and activities (minutes of the October 6, 2014, meeting,
