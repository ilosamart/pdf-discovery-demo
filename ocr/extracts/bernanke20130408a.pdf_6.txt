 Although the stress tests focus on the largest banks, the medium-sized and smaller 

banks outside of the 18 CCAR firms have also improved their aggregate capital position 

considerably since the SCAP.  For that group of banks, aggregate tier 1 common equity 

stood at 12.4 percent of risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2012, more than 4 

percentage points higher than at the end of 2008.   

 Another key lesson of the crisis, given the intense funding pressures experienced 

by many financial institutions during the period, is the importance of maintaining 

adequate liquidity--that is, a stock of cash and unencumbered high-quality liquid assets 

that can be converted easily into cash.  Here too, the news is mostly positive, as the 

broader banking system--including both larger and smaller banks--has generally 

improved its liquidity position relative to pre-crisis levels.  For example, banksâ€™ holdings 

of cash and high-quality liquid securities have more than doubled since the end of 2007 

and now total more than $2.5 trillion.  However, in the area of liquidity and funding, 

continued improvement is still needed on some dimensions.  Notably, supervisors will 

continue to press banks to reduce further their dependence on wholesale funding, which 

proved highly unreliable during the crisis.  And, in analogy to the need for effective 

capital planning, banks of all sizes need to further strengthen their ability to identify, 

quantify, and manage their liquidity risks.  

The Evolution of Stress Testing 

 Let me turn now to the evolution of stress testing as a supervisory tool.  The main 

benefits of stress tests for supervision have not changed much since the SCAP was 

conducted in 2009.  First, stress tests complement standard capital ratios by adding a 

more forward-looking perspective and by being more oriented toward protection against
