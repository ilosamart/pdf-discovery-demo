resulted from a failure to act.  We should always be mindful of moral hazard incentives 

and seek to contain them, but well-designed regulation might reduce rather than increase 

moral hazard.  In the banking sector, bank regulators have focused on improving 

resolution planning at banks and enhancing the ability of the FDIC to manage the 

resolution of a systemically important firm in a way that mitigates spillovers to the 

economy.  For example, proposals are now under consideration to require the largest and 

most interconnected banks to maintain a buffer of debt that could be converted to equity 

or that could otherwise absorb losses upon failure.  Such proposals could be viewed as a 

form of solvency regulation and this form of loss-absorbing capital might be appropriate 

for some of the largest and most interconnected nonbanks as well.   

In addition, nonbank intermediation often involves complex chains of activity 

encompassing many entities and markets.  Such chains tend to increase the web of 

interconnections in the financial system that, in some circumstances, can increase the 

likelihood or severity of systemic stress.  For example, movements in collateral values 

can trigger margin calls and fire sales of assets, and thus activities that depend on market-

valued collateral can be vulnerable.  The Financial Stability Board is currently 

considering reforms for margins on securities financing transactions.  Other 

interconnections involve exposures to counterparty default.  The new regulatory regime 

for derivatives, which I will discuss in a moment, seeks to mitigate counterparty risk. 

It is often said that stronger regulation of the banking sector will cause activity to 

move outside the perimeter of regulation.  This evolution also could lead to greater 

complexity, such as longer chains of interconnections, which makes it more difficult for 

market participants to understand the risks arising from their exposures.  Examples of
