were suddenly no longer comfortable with the collateral and were unsure of their potential 

exposure to losses.  Given the uncertainties, the rational response went beyond raising haircuts or 

other means of tightening credit terms:  Banks simply stopped lending, typically by not “rolling 

over,” or renewing, short-term financing when trades matured.  In addition, collateralized 

borrowing had taken on many transactional forms, including OTC derivatives or securities 

financings, which were not always recognized as economically equivalent.  Given the extent of 

layering, and sometimes opacity of leverage, the result was a rapid and disorderly unwinding, 

over just weeks or months, of a very complicated system that had taken years to evolve.  

Assessing Current Financial Imbalances 

In light of this experience, the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring financial 

indicators for signs of potential imbalances and is assessing the extent to which leverage is 

currently employed by investors, particularly where some of the potentially amplifying factors I 

just discussed may be present. 

Asset Valuations 

Misaligned asset prices are notoriously difficult to detect in a timely fashion, and no 

single metric or set of metrics can consistently and reliably identify stretched valuations.  

Nonetheless, it is clearly worthwhile to track a wide range of metrics and to view them in the 

context of their historical norms.  Current conditions can be evaluated against a baseline of past 

experience, and then assessed in light of the various institutional and market factors that could 

conceivably account for deviations from historical ranges.  The Federal Reserve tracks a large 

number of indicators, and I will highlight a few examples.  

Overall, these indicators do not obviously point to significant excesses or imbalances in 

the United States.  For example, as shown in figure 1, forward price-to-earnings ratios in the
