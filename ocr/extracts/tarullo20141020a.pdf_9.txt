Rewards and Punishments 

 An important determinant of behavior in any organization is the system of rewards and 

punishments applicable to its employees.  Assuming that they are able to discern factors that 

generally explain patterns of hiring, raises, promotions, demotions, and dismissals, employees 

receive very strong signals as to what those running the organization actually value.  This set of 

signals has, I suspect, considerably more influence on employee behavior than a corporate 

statement of values or purposes, particularly if the system of rewards and punishments appears at 

odds with that statement.   

Indeed, the significance of reward and punishment signals is probably magnified by their 

role in shaping the composition of the firm’s workforce—by influencing which people are 

attracted to work at the firm in the first place, which acquire more authority over time, and which 

are asked to leave.  To take one example: if a financial firm’s recruitment of young professionals 

is driven almost entirely by promises of the large amounts of money they can make and the 

speed with which they can make it, then the firm should not be too surprised when those same 

young professionals give short shrift to values such as respect for customers, or skirt risk-

management guidelines, or perhaps even ignore regulatory and legal compliance requirements.   

One topic within this broader area of reward and punishment that has received 

considerable attention is incentive compensation.  The deleterious effects of many incentive 

compensation arrangements were recognized by firms well before regulators began to focus on 

them in earnest following the financial crisis, as reflected in a survey conducted early in 2009 on 

behalf of the Institute of International Finance, which reported that all but one of 37 large 

banking organizations believed that compensation practices were a factor underlying the crisis.3
