Many factors are contributing to these changes—well-anchored inflation 

expectations in the context of improved monetary policy, demographics, globalization, 

slower productivity growth, greater demand for safe assets, and weaker links between 

unemployment and inflation.  And these factors seem likely to persist.  If that happens, 

the neutral rate of interest will remain low, and policymakers will continue to operate in 

an environment in which the risk of hitting the effective lower bound is much higher than 

before the crisis.  This proximity to the lower bound poses new complications for central 

banks and calls for new ideas. 

It is true that many of these features have been with us for some time.  Trend 

inflation, productivity, and interest rates were declining well before the crisis.  But, for 

monetary policymakers in that era, the threat of high inflation felt proximate, the hard-

fought battle to control high inflation having been just recently won.  Technological 

progress seemed likely to continue to sustain rapid increases in productivity—an outcome 

we continue to await.  And the effective lower bound for interest rates was mainly a 

theoretical concern, except of course in Japan.  The changes to the macroeconomic 

environment may have been in train earlier, but the crisis seems to have accelerated the 

process.  The world in which policymakers are now operating is discretely different in 

important ways from the one before the Great Recession.   

I should also note, as is fitting given this event and this audience, that since the 

crisis policymakers are even more keenly aware of the relevance of global factors to our 

policies.  The global nature of the financial crisis and the channels through which it 

spread sharply highlight the interconnectedness of our economic, financial, and policy 

environments.  U.S. economic developments affect the rest of the world, and the reverse
