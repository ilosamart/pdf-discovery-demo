of demand.  Likewise, if inflation moves down persistently, then the economy is likely 

operating with some slack, as firms restrain prices to sell their products in the face of 

weak demand.     

If inflation is the primary indicator of the economy’s position relative to potential, 

how confident can we be in the quality of the signal?  It has been noted--quite frequently, 

I might add--that the relationship between inflation and the tightness of the economy has 

gotten weaker, which is to say that inflation appears to be less affected by movements in 

economic slack or tightness, traditionally measured by the unemployment rate, than in the 

past.  As the role of slack in explaining inflation has diminished, inflation expectations 

have assumed greater importance.  However, it is reasonable to ask, if inflation is, in fact, 

now largely a reflection of inflation expectations, is inflation still a good indicator of the 

cyclical state of the economy?  Or, more directly, can we count on inflation to warn us in 

time if the economy is overheating? 

To be a little controversial, perhaps what we are witnessing with inflation is an 

application of what has been called Goodhart’s law, named after Charles Goodhart, the 

distinguished scholar of central banking at the London School of Economics.4  The law 

can be summarized as the idea that if an indicator becomes a target of policy, that 

indicator loses its value as a gauge of the state of the economy.  Rather, the indicator 

becomes a signal of the public’s belief in the competence and commitment of the 

government agency that is targeting the indicator.
