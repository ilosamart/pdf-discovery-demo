China has, of course, been subject to many of the forces I have already discussed.  One 

notable trend, shown by the black line in slide 8, is that Chinese processing exports--that is, re-

exports from assembled imported parts and components--as a share of China’s total exports have 

been falling steadily for several years.  This trend in part reflects weak global demand, as weaker 

demand for final goods and services from the advanced economies should have led Chinese 

processing exports to fall disproportionately.  It is also consistent with the deceleration of global 

supply chain formation.   

Although global factors have undoubtedly played a role, however, the evidence suggests 

that a substantial part of the slowdown in Chinese trade reflects developments that are specific to 

the Chinese economy and that are likely to exert a lasting imprint on global trade.9  First, the 

rapid expansion of China’s manufacturing base over the past 15 years--made possible by vast 

reserves of cheap, rural labor--may simply be reaching its natural limit.  Accordingly, we would 

expect China’s manufacturing exports to slow. 

Second, China is moving up the sophistication ladder by producing some higher value-

added parts and components itself, instead of importing them.  One manifestation of this 

phenomenon is the higher domestic value-added in Chinese exports in recent years, shown by the 

gray bars in this slide, relative to the period before the Global Financial Crisis.  Another 

manifestation can be seen in slide 9, which shows the decline in the share of parts and 


9 A recent note from the Banque du France--Gaullier, Steingress, and Zignago (2016)--argues that the long run 
elasticity of world trade to income is unity, and that structural changes in China go a long way in explaining both the 
sharp rise in the elasticity in the years before the Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent decline in the post-crisis 
years as China rebalances toward domestic demand.
