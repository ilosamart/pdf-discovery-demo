and SBA lending.  Some of these meetings will focus on a specific aspect of small business 

lending such as credit gaps with respect to small business credit products, types of financial 

institutions, or demographic groups (including minority borrowers).  Others will employ a 

standard agenda in different parts of the country to ascertain regional differences in small 

business access to credit and support services.   

 Finally, in your invitation letter you asked that we discuss actions taken by the 

Administration to assist small business owners.  As you know, the Administration has 

undertaken a number of actions aimed at improving small businesses’ access to credit.  Since the 

signing of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in February 2009, SBA 7(a) and 504 

loan volumes have increased quite substantially relative to the period immediately preceding the 

bill’s passage.  Most recently, the Administration announced a small business lending initiative 

to provide low-cost capital to community banks that submit a plan to increase their small 

business lending and to Community Development Financial Institutions that serve the hardest-hit 

communities.  A number of these small business lending initiatives are new, and their effects on 

small business lending cannot yet be measured.  Nonetheless, a number of programs have been 

established to assist small businesses and the regulatory agencies recently issued guidance that 

strongly encourages banks to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers.  We will closely 

monitor credit conditions to consider whether additional measures may be needed to ensure that 

the funding needs of qualified small businesses are met in the coming months.
