likely that we will have to deploy our unconventional tools again.  In contrast, if the 

neutral rate is as low as we estimate or even lower, we will be glad to have our 

unconventional tools in our toolkit. 

The bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might 

have to be used again.  If we are indeed living in a low-neutral-rate world, a significantly 

less severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive 

short-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.   

Conclusion 

Let me conclude with a brief summary.  As a result of the Great Recession, the 

Federal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years:  One, the 

FOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short-term interest rates 

reached their effective lower bound; and two, subsequently, as we made progress toward 

the achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the 

presence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.   

Today I highlighted two points about the FOMCâ€™s experience with those 

challenges.  First, the monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve deployed in the 

immediate aftermath of the crisis--explicit forward rate guidance, large-scale asset 

purchases, and the payment of interest on excess reserves--have helped us overcome 

these challenges.   

Second, in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of short-term interest 

rates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades, the likelihood that future 

monetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is 

uncomfortably high.  For this reason, we must keep our unconventional policy tools
