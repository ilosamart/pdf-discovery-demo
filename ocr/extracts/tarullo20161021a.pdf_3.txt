This broader category of “financial regulation” as the relevant delineation of an academic 

subject area seems right to me.  For one thing, different forms of financial intermediation are--if 

not equally attractive for the preferences of specific investors and users of capital--at least 

significantly overlapping in the roles they can play.  Beginning in the 1970s these overlaps 

multiplied, as the traditional separation of lending and capital market activities--which had been 

reinforced by the Glass-Steagall Act--began to break down under the weight of macroeconomic 

turbulence, technological and business innovation, and competition.  In the 30 years that 

followed, these activities were progressively integrated further, both within bank holding 

companies and beyond, ultimately producing the explosive growth of money market, 

securitization, and derivative instruments. 

More fundamentally, the broader category of “financial regulation” reflects the 

importance of a macroprudential, or systemic, perspective on the financial system.  This means 

taking account of the relationships among the circumstances and activities of significant financial 

actors through such channels as funding dependencies and correlated assets.  The financial crisis 

has made what was formerly a minority view--the need to incorporate systemic considerations 

into the regulatory regime--into something approaching a consensus. 

But this shift of perspective--whether in pedagogy or in policy--raises as many questions 

as it answers.  My remarks this morning will detail some of the questions that have recurred in 

regulatory deliberations in recent years, which I believe to be salient for policy, scholarship, and 

pedagogy.  Then, more briefly, I will make a few observations about teaching and scholarship 

from the broadened perspective of financial regulation.  I should note at the outset that, in the 

interest of time, I will confine myself to the prudential aspects of financial regulation.
