review applications.3  We are currently reviewing our rules to see whether there are ways 

to expedite the applications review process by delegating additional matters to the 

Reserve Banks.

measure of the degree of competition in a banking market to include the activities of 

Internet banks.4  Doing so would reduce the market shares of other banks and the
