tightly connected to the rest of the financial system.  But were a clearing bank to decline 

to provide intraday credit to a dealer, that dealer’s ability to operate normally would be 

substantially compromised, likely causing difficulties for its clients and counterparties, 

including many other financial institutions.  As a result, during a period of market stress, 

the actions of clearing banks can jeopardize the stability of securities dealers, and vice

 An industry task force recognized this mutual vulnerability in 2010 and 

recommended the “practical elimination” of intraday credit in the triparty repo market.  

Although some progress has been made, securities dealers and clearing banks have yet to 

fully implement that recommendation.  Nevertheless, through supervision and other 

means, we continue to push the industry toward this critical goal.  In doing so, we are 

collaborating with other agencies, notably the SEC, which has regulatory responsibility 

for money market funds and securities dealers, institutions that are active in the triparty 

repo market.  At the same time, we continue to urge market participants to improve their 

risk-management practices, and, in particular, to ensure that tools are in place to address 

the risks that would be posed to the repo market by the default of a major firm.   

 International regulatory groups have also been focused on addressing the financial 

stability risks of shadow banking.  The Group of Twenty leaders have directed the 

Financial Stability Board (FSB), whose membership consists of key regulators from 

around the world, including the Federal Reserve, with developing policy 

recommendations to strengthen the regulation of the shadow banking system.  The FSB 

currently has five major projects under way devoted to understanding the risks of, and 

developing policy recommendations for, shadow banking.  The areas under study include
