Efforts to develop these rules have been progressing well.  The Federal Reserve 

will soon release for comment its proposed rule on enhanced prudential standards that 

would apply to large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank 

financial firms.  It also recently approved a final rule implementing the resolution plan 

requirement.  Let me note that in these instances, as in all its rulemaking responsibilities, 

the Federal Reserve is attentive to aligning the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act with 

international agreements, such as higher capital standards and new liquidity standards for 

large banks and capital surcharges for the largest global SIFIs.   

The Federal Reserve, working with other financial regulators, has issued a 

number of proposed and final rules relating to such areas as the centralized clearing of 

derivatives, swap margin requirements, and the designation of systemically important 

FMUs and nonbank financial firms.  The proposed rule for designating nonbank financial 

firms was put out for comment in October.2  This rule specifies a process for designating 

such institutions, starting by analyzing firms that exceed a size threshold and exhibit 

characteristics, including excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding, that 

could contribute to systemic risk if the firm were to become distressed.   

Less-discernible progress has been made to date, however, in addressing other 

key vulnerabilities that came to the fore during the financial crisis.  Indeed, short-term 

funding markets remain an important source of structural risk.  Despite some significant 

reforms that enhance liquidity and impose additional restrictions on portfolios, money 

market funds are still susceptible to liquidity constraints largely because of attributes like
