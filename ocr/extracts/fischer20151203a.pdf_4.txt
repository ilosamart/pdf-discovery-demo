Cyclical developments 

Turning to developments in the cyclical behavior of the financial system, at least 

five factors contribute to financial fragility:  (1) high debt burdens at households and 

firms; (2) elevated leverage and maturity transformation within the financial sector; (3) 

complexity and interconnectedness in intermediation chains; (4) low risk premiums on 

assets, especially assets funded with debt; and (5) complacency on the part of investors, 

supervisors and decisionmakers in the private sector of the financial system.   

At the Federal Reserve, staff members present their assessment of vulnerabilities 

to the financial sector in terms of these risk factors and further organize these risk factors 

along institutional lines--distinguishing among developments within the banking sector 

and the nonbank sector, with a special focus on nonbank institutions that engage in 

maturity transformation or deploy notable degrees of leverage.5  

Using this framework, I see overall financial vulnerabilities as moderate--that is, 

considerably lower than a decade ago.  Asset valuations and debt burdens in key markets 

do not appear outsized.  Perhaps most important, house prices, while substantially above 

their recent lows, do not appear broadly elevated relative to rents or disposable income, in 

contrast to conditions a decade ago.  Moreover, household-sector debt growth has been 

modest and driven mainly by prime borrowers, although rapid growth in auto and student 

lending across the credit spectrum may create repayment challenges for some households.  

However, signs of valuation pressures are emerging in commercial real estate markets, 

where prices have been rising at a solid clip and lending standards have deteriorated, 

although debt growth has not yet accelerated notably.
