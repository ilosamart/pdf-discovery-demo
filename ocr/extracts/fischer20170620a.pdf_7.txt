However, some other research suggests that the effectiveness of LTV limits is not 

significant or somewhat temporary.19  

Other macroprudential policies focus on lenders.  First and foremost, tightening 

bank capital regulation enhances loss-absorbing capacity, strengthening financial system 

resilience.  In addition, bank capital requirements for mortgages that increase when house 

prices rise may be used to lean against mortgage credit growth and house price 

appreciation.20  These policies are intended to make bank mortgage lending more 

expensive, leading borrowers to reduce their demand for credit, which tends to push 

house prices down.  Estimates of the effects of such changes vary widely:  After 

consideration of a range of estimates from the literature, an increase of 50 percentage 

points in the risk weights on mortgages would result in a house price decrease from as 

low as 0.6 percent to as high as 4.0 percent.21  These policies are more effective if 

borrowers are fairly sensitive to a rise in interest rates and if migration of intermediation 

outside the banking sector to nonbanks is limited.   

Of course, regulatory reforms and in some countries, macroprudential 

policies--are still being implemented, and analysis is currently under way to monitor the 

effects.  So far, research suggests that macroprudential tightening is associated with 

slower bank credit growth, slower housing credit growth, and less house price

countercyclical capital buffer.
