price stability.  Under such conditions, the Federal Reserve would typically ease 

monetary policy by reducing the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal 

funds rate.  However, the target range for the funds rate has been near zero since 

December 2008, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are 

likely to warrant an exceptionally low target rate for an extended period.  As a result, for 

the past two years we have been using alternative tools to provide additional monetary 

accommodation.   

In particular, over the past two years the Federal Reserve has further eased 

monetary conditions by purchasing longer-term securities on the open market.  From 

December 2008 through March 2010, we purchased about $1.7 trillion in longer-term 

Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed securities.  In August 2010, we began 

reinvesting the proceeds from all securities that matured or were redeemed in longer-term 

Treasury securities, so as to keep the size of our securities holdings roughly constant.  

Around the same time, we began to signal to financial markets that we were considering 

providing additional monetary policy accommodation by conducting further asset 

purchases.  And in early November, we announced a plan to purchase an additional 

$600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year.  All these 

purchases are settled through the banking system, with the result that depository 

institutions now hold a very high level of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve.   

Although large-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a different monetary 

policy tool than the more familiar approach of targeting the federal funds rate, the two 

types of policies affect the economy in similar ways.  Conventional monetary policy 

easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest
