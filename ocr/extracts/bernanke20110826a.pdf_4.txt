Overall, the global economy has seen significant growth, led by the emerging-market 

economies.  In the United States, a cyclical recovery, though a modest one by historical 

standards, is in its ninth quarter.  In the financial sphere, the U.S. banking system is 

generally much healthier now, with banks holding substantially more capital.  Credit 

availability from banks has improved, though it remains tight in categories--such as small 

business lending--in which the balance sheets of potential borrowers remain impaired.  

Companies with access to the public bond markets have had no difficulty obtaining credit 

on favorable terms.  Importantly, structural reform is moving forward in the financial 

sector, with ambitious domestic and international efforts underway to enhance the capital 

and liquidity of banks, especially the most systemically important banks; to improve risk 

management and transparency; to strengthen market infrastructure; and to introduce a 

more systemic, or macroprudential, approach to financial regulation and supervision. 

In the broader economy, manufacturing production in the United States has risen 

nearly 15 percent since its trough, driven substantially by growth in exports.  Indeed, the 

U.S. trade deficit has been notably lower recently than it was before the crisis, reflecting 

in part the improved competitiveness of U.S. goods and services.  Business investment in 

equipment and software has continued to expand, and productivity gains in some 

industries have been impressive, though new data have reduced estimates of overall 

productivity improvement in recent years.  Households also have made some progress in 

repairing their balance sheets--saving more, borrowing less, and reducing their burdens of 

interest payments and debt.  Commodity prices have come off their highs, which will 

reduce the cost pressures facing businesses and help increase household purchasing 

power.
