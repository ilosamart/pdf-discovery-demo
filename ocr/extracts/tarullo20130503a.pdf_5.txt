Severe repercussions were felt throughout the financial system, as short-term 

wholesale lending against all but the very safest collateral froze up, regardless of the 

identity of the borrower.  Moreover, as demonstrated by the intervention of the 

government when Bear Stearns and AIG were failing, and by the aftermath of Lehman 

Brothers’ failure, the universe of financial firms that appeared too-big-to-fail during 

periods of stress extended beyond the perimeter of traditional safety and soundness 

regulation.   

In short, the financial industry in the years preceding the crisis had been 

transformed into one that was highly vulnerable to runs on the short-term, uninsured cash 

equivalents that fed the new system’s reliance on wholesale funding.  The relationship 

between large firms and shadow banking meant that strains on wholesale funding markets 

could both reflect and magnify the too-big-to-fail problem.  These were not the relatively 

slow-developing problems of the Latin American debt crisis, or even the savings and loan 

crisis, but fast-moving episodes that risked turning liquidity problems into insolvency 

problems almost literally overnight.   

However, note that while the presence of too-big-to-fail institutions substantially 

exacerbates the vulnerability created by the new system, they do not define its limits.  

Even in the absence of any firm that may individually seem too big or too interconnected 

to be allowed to fail, the financial system can be vulnerable to contagion.  An external 

shock to important asset classes can lead to substantial uncertainty as to underlying 

values, a consequent reluctance by investors to provide short-term funding to firms 

holding those assets, a subsequent spate of fire sales and mark-to-market losses, and the
