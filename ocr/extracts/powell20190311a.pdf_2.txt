Good evening, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. 

The National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) and its member 

organizations are at the forefront of an important conversation about how to ensure that 

low- and moderate-income communities are fairly served by the banking industry.  The 

work that you do to promote access to basic banking services, affordable housing, and 

entrepreneurship opportunities supports the Federal Reserve and other agencies that 

enforce fair lending laws.  The large number and variety of NCRC’s local member 

organizations allow the NCRC to draw a detailed picture of how the Federal Reserve’s 

policies affect lower-income communities, and we deeply appreciate the information that 

you share with us and the work that it represents.   

As you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the 

struggles many individuals and families face in lower-income urban and rural 

communities.  Low- and moderate-income homeowners saw their wealth stripped away 

as home values dropped during the financial crisis and have not recovered as quickly or 

completely as others.  Because home equity has been the main source of wealth among 

low- and moderate-income people, the crisis dealt a particularly severe blow to these 

households.  Most Americans rely on home equity to send their children to college, invest 

in their own education and training, or start or grow a business.  These aspirations are the 

basis upon which a strong economy is built.  That is why your work as NCRC member 

organizations offering financial counseling, homeownership education, and technical 

assistance for small businesses is as important as ever.
