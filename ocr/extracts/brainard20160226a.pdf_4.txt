the extent that the downward pressure on global inflation is due to falling oil prices, this 

pressure would be expected to abate if oil prices stabilize.   

But even after removing energy prices, core PCE inflation has come in 

consistently under the Federal Reserveâ€™s 2 percent target here in the United States and 

does not look very different from inflation in economies that are expected to maintain 

accommodative monetary policy for some time.  Core PCE inflation, or inflation 

excluding food and energy prices, has remained stubbornly in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-

1/2 percent over the past three years in the United States, similar to the United Kingdom 

and not very different from the roughly 1 percent core inflation in the euro area and 

Japan. 

We also see notable similarities in the recent deterioration in market measures of 

inflation expectations.  While in the euro area, swaps-based inflation compensation has 

fallen about 3/4 percentage point since the middle of 2014 and is now around 1-1/2 

percent at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, in the United States, swaps-based 

inflation compensation has fallen 1 full percentage point over the same period and is now 

at 1-3/4 percent.  Japan has experienced a similar decline over this period, while the 

United Kingdom has seen a much more modest decline. 

With realized and expected future inflation not showing large differences, the 

expectation of monetary policy divergence between the United States, on the one hand, 

and the United Kingdom and the euro area, on the other, must rest to a large extent on 

remaining differences in resource utilization and expectations that inflation outcomes will 

diverge as a result of these differences.  However, it is important to note that the extent of 

inflation divergence generated by differences in resource utilization across countries is
