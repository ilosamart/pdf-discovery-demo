Assessing Capital Needs in an Uncertain World 

Projecting estimated losses and revenues for BHCs is an inherently uncertain exercise, and this difficulty 

has been amplified in the current period of increased macroeconomic uncertainty. The future path of 

GDP growth, unemployment, and home prices, for example, are unknown, wi th a wide range of 

plausible outcomes. Indeed, this increased uncertainty was a key motivation for the SCAP, as 

policymakers are interested in restoring confidence that BHCs have sufficient resources to continue to 

lend to creditworthy borrowers across a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes. 

Forward-looking assessments across a range of possible outcomes including more adverse 

environments, commonly referred to as "stress tests," are regularly used by both institutions and 

supervisors and are regularly integrated in traditional risk-management practices. This approach 

provides additional information to firms and supervisors about the vulnerability of a BHC by examining 

how it might fare under different economic scenarios. This type of analysis, however, is itself subject to 

considerable uncertainty, including uncertainty about the range of potential macroeconomic outcomes 

to consider, the relationship between BHC results and macroeconomic scenarios, the degree to which 

historical relationships will continue to be relevant in a more stressed environment, and the potential 

changes to consumer behavior in response to both macroeconomic and institutional changes. 

Nevertheless, this type of exercise can be extremely useful in helping supervisors and analysts broadly 

understand a BHC's risk, especially in periods of high uncertainty. Moreover, a stress test provides a 

systematic, disciplined framework for gauging the magnitude of capital buffers that might be needed by 

different firms to absorb losses under plausible "what if" scenarios. 

III. Supervisory Reviews and Assessments 

III.A. Supervisory Review of the Submissions and Benchmark Assessments 

The supervisory review and assessment of the loss and resource estimates submitted by the 

participating BHCs were critical parts of the SCAP exercise. This review involved the work of more than 

150 people f rom the supervisory agencies, including senior examiners, economists, and financial 

analysts. Staff was organized into teams, each of which focused on examining a distinct aspect of the 

loss and resource projections across all 19 participating BHCs. In particular, there were teams charged 

with examining loss projections for consumer portfolios, commercial and industrial (C&I) and 

commercial real estate loan (CRE) portfolios, AFS and HTM securities portfolios, trading account assets, 

and counterparty credit risk, and teams examining projections of PPNR and ALLL coverage. There were 

also advisory groups composed of specialists in accounting, regulatory capital, and financial and 

macroeconomic modeling. 

These teams were charged with evaluating the quality of the f irm submissions so that each 

submission had sufficient information on data, methods, and assumptions to be analyzed. The teams 

were responsible for analyzing the loss and resources projections from a cross-firm perspective, using
