elsewhere in the region, particularly in India and most of ASEAN, including Indonesia, 

Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have medians of 30 years or less.  Just as 

slowing workforce growth is likely to be a drag on growth in many developed countries, 

trend growth is likely to be held back by demographic developments in relatively elderly 

emerging Asian economies as well.  

Up to this point, I have discussed a number of factors that are likely to lower 

emerging Asia’s growth trajectory in the coming years.  However, the overall message is 

not a pessimistic one; rather, for the most part, the slowing of growth is a natural 

transition and an outcome of Asia’s remarkable economic success.   

As many have noted over the years, maintaining growth sufficiently rapid to meet 

the development aspirations of the region will require a transition toward an economic 

paradigm more rooted in domestic demand, particularly consumption.  The need for this 

transition, or rebalancing, is most apparent and also widely acknowledged in China, the 

current hub of emerging Asia’s export-led model.  The need for these economies--

primarily China, but also those economies that export through China--to switch toward 

domestic demand largely reflects their having become too big and too important to rely to 

the extent they have on the export-led models of the past.   

On growth, the bottom line that should be emphasized is that even with a 

diminished pace of growth, the region is still expected to significantly outpace the global 

economy and make by far the largest contribution to global growth in the years ahead. 

Spillovers from Asia’s Economic Transition:  Commodity Markets 

I will now focus on an area where the spillovers of Asia’ economic transition are 

likely to be substantial--global commodity markets.
