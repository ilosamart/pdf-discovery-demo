concerns that have been expressed by community banks and still achieve the goal of having 

strong levels of high-quality capital--built up over a reasonable and realistic transitional period--

in banks of all sizes, including community banks.   

 As we met with bankers and listened to them describe the threat to their role in residential 

mortgage lending posed by the proposed mortgage risk weightings, I realized that we had very 

little data about mortgages on the books of community banks.  Much of our research has focused 

on securitized loans.  So I set out to learn more about residential lending in smaller institutions, 

and as I did, it became clear to me that there are regulatory issues that go far beyond those raised 

in the capital proposals.  I am now concerned that, even if the specific issues in the capital 

proposals can be addressed, the totality of new mortgage lending regulations might still seriously 

impair the ability of community banks to continue to offer their traditional mortgage products.  

In fact, in our discussions with community bankers, more of them report that they are reducing or 

eliminating their mortgage lending due to regulatory burden than report that they are entering or 

expanding their mortgage business in response to the business potential of low mortgage rates.  I 

think this represents a real concern, both for mortgage availability and for the viability of 

community banking. 

Community Banks and Mortgage Lending 

When I think about community banks, I usually envision a bank, thrift, or credit union 

that serves customers in one or more well-defined local markets and that is engaged in a 

traditional community banking model--making a variety of loans and funding itself primarily 

with local core deposits.  At the Federal Reserve, we generally define our community bank 

portfolio as those institutions with $10 billion or less in total assets, which is the definition I will 

use in this discussion.
