final rules to make the requirements substantially more rigorous for the largest, most 

systemically important banking organizations than for community banks.4   

While we have taken a number of steps to address too-big-to-fail concerns, our work is 

not finished.  Because the failure of a systemic institution could impose significant costs on the 

financial system and the economy, the Board recently finalized a requirement for the eight large, 

globally systemic banks to meet a significantly higher leverage requirement than other banking 

organizations.  And we are working to implement risk-based capital surcharges for these 

systemically important firms.  We also need to ensure that the new rules are embedded in our 

supervision of the largest firms; and, we must continue to watch for emerging sources of 

systemic risk and take steps as appropriate to address these risks.   

One such risk that the Federal Reserve has been monitoring closely is the reliance of 

some firms on potentially volatile short-term wholesale funding.5  We are carefully considering 

the systemic vulnerabilities that may be posed by overreliance on short-term wholesale funding 

and are weighing potential policy responses.  While it would be premature to indicate whether or 

how we might address these vulnerabilities, I can say that few, if any, community banks are 

reliant on levels of short-term wholesale funding that could raise concerns about systemic risk, 

and regulators would carefully consider the ramifications of any action, including the effect on 

community banks.

published a guide that summarizes changes to the capital rules for exposures commonly held by such organizations.
