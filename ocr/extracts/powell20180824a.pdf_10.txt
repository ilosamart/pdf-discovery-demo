late 1998.10  Starting in 1996, the economy boomed and the unemployment rate fell, but, 

contrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11     

Once again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many 

had seen as a puzzle.  Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real-time natural rate 

of unemployment had been well below our current-day assessment, in the new-economy 

period, this relation was reversed (figure 3).  The labor market looked to be tight and 

getting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor 

market in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through 

1998 (figure 4).  Greenspan was also right that the potential growth rate had shifted up.  

With hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the 

very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth 

policymakers were forecasting.12  

The FOMC thus avoided the Great-Inflation-era mistake of overemphasizing 

imprecise estimates of the stars.  Under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership, the Committee 

converged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request:  

Let’s wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence 

tightening.13  Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while 

                                                 
10 In the second half of 1998, a Russian debt default and other ongoing financial instability in Asia 

intervened, and the FOMC rapidly lowered the federal funds rate 3/4 percentage point.  
11 By current data, over the eight quarters starting in 1996:Q3, core PCE (personal consumption 

expenditures) inflation fell from 1.8 percent to 1.3 percent. 
12 During this period, FOMC participants submitted six-quarter forecasts each July as part of the Fed’s 

semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  Each July from 1996 through 1998, the FOMC 

forecast growth very close to or above the real-time estimates of potential growth. The forecast growth is 

well below current estimates of potential output growth.  For the forecasts, see Board of Governors (1996, 

1997, 1998).
