Issues Facing Monetary Policymakers in the Wake of the Crisis and Recession 

Prior to the global financial crisis, a rough consensus had emerged among 

academics and monetary policymakers that best-practice for monetary policy was flexible 

inflation targeting.  In the U.S., flexible inflation targeting is implied by the dual mandate 

given to the Fed, under which monetary policy is required to take into account deviations 

of both output and inflation from their target levels.  But even in countries where the 

central bank officially targets only inflation, monetary policymakers in practice also aim 

to stabilize the real economy around some normal level or path.    

Much has changed in the world of central banking since the onset of the Great 

Recession.  With short-term interest rates near zero, many central banks considerably 

expanded their balance sheets, for instance through large-scale purchases of assets or 

significant liquidity injections.  They also engaged in forward guidance to put downward 

pressure on interest rates and support aggregate demand.   

I consider quantitative easing to have been largely successful, and that data 

dependent forward guidance consistent with the central bankâ€™s expectations of its future 

intentions can also be successful.  But the use of these tools--particularly as reflected in 

the size of central bank balance sheets--will make the conduct of monetary policy more 

complicated during the recovery.  In the United States, we have a number of tools to 

control short-term rates, despite the large level of reserves in the system.  Raising the rate 

of interest paid on excess reserves should play a central role in the eventual normalization 

of short-term interest rates.  An overnight reverse repo facility could also play a useful 

part in setting a floor under money market rates.  With these and other possible tools, we
