Conclusion 

In today’s new normal, it is important to achieve inflation and inflation expectations 

around our 2 percent target on a sustained basis while guarding against financial imbalances 

through active use of countercyclical tools.  We want to be mindful of the risk of financial 

imbalances that could amplify any shock and help tip the economy into recession, which the 

Federal Reserve has less conventional space to address in today’s low interest rate environment.  

In my view, it is therefore wise to proceed cautiously, helping to sustain the expansion and 

further gains in employment and with appropriate regulatory safeguards that reduce the risk of 

dangerous financial imbalances.
