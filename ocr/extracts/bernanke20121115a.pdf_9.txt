Policymakers have also taken steps to remove barriers to the flow of mortgage 

credit.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency recently announced new rules that will 

provide mortgage lenders greater clarity about the conditions under which they will be 

required to buy back defaulted mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or 

otherwise address origination problems.  This greater clarity may result in reduced 

concern about putback risk, which in turn should increase the willingness of lenders to 

make new loans.  In its rulemakings and supervision, the Federal Reserve, along with 

other bank supervisors, has worked with lenders to try to achieve an appropriate balance 

between reasonable prudence and ensuring that qualified borrowers are not denied access 

to credit. 

Although regulatory policy will be important for restoring a fully functioning 

housing and mortgage market, the strength of the overall economic recovery is crucial as 

well.  Obviously, loss of employment or income makes it more difficult for families to 

pay their mortgages, maintain good credit histories, refinance their mortgages at lower 

rates, and avoid foreclosure.  People who are worried about their jobs are understandably 

more reluctant to purchase homes, and households who have suffered hits to their 

incomes face difficulty qualifying for a mortgage and saving for a down payment.  

Concerns about the financial strength of households and about the economic recovery 

also make lenders more cautious.
