if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7  Reflecting these 

concerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has 

improved appreciably.   

However, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects 

of monetary policy.8  Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too 

long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the 

economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals.  Such an abrupt tightening 

would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy 

into recession.  Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long 

could also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.   

On balance, economic and financial information received since our October 

meeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor 

market.  And, as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps 

strengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the 

medium term.  That said, between today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive 

additional data that bear on the economic outlook.  These data include a range of 

indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity.  When my 

colleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and their implications for 

the economic outlook in making our policy decision.

8 Milton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag 
that is both long and variable” (1961, p. 447).  Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag 
comes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a 
variety of identification assumptions.  See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and 
Uhlig (2005).
