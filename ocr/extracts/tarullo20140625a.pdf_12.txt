by the Board of Governors to the capital distribution plans of a firm.12  If a firm’s internal 

processes are unreliable, supervisors will necessarily be concerned that a firm may not properly 

have assessed risks clearly and, where needed, assured adequate capital for the many risks that 

cannot be fully captured by standardized stress tests. 

As the process and expectations for the quantitative test have become better understood, 

attention has shifted a bit to the qualitative assessment.  To place that part of the CCAR in 

context, let me make several additional points. 

First, as I have already noted, many firms had a long way to go to meet high standards of 

capital planning backed by strong risk management when we began CCAR.  Given that initial 

gap, we have allowed time for firms to work toward full achievement of those standards.  Thus, 

what may be perceived as a raising of the bar every year is better understood as our effort to 

provide a demanding, but still realistic, glide path for firms to reach that goal.  We do, however, 

expect firms to continue to make steady progress each year. 

Second, the horizontal nature of the qualitative assessment does not mean that every year 

one or more firms must receive an objection on qualitative grounds.  The comparative approach 

helps ensure that firms are evaluated consistently and fairly.  And it does allow us to see where 

specific firms may be outliers from good practices followed in the rest of the industry.  But this 

is not a PGA tournament--there is no foreordained cut that some participants will miss.   

Third, while there are minimum standards for all CCAR firms, the standards are more 

stringent for firms of greater systemic importance.13  It is not enough for the largest and most

13 It is also worth emphasizing that both elements of CCAR--the qualitative and the quantitative assessments--only 
apply to BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies with 
between $10 and 50 billion in assets to conduct an annual company-run stress test.  The Federal Reserve does not 
conduct a CCAR-like exercise to evaluate these company-run stress tests, although we do review the firms’
