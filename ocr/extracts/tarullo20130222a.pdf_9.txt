banks prior to the stabilizing measures taken by the European Central Bank, these problems are 

still very much with us. 

 Within the United States, reform efforts are underway in some discrete, but important, 

areas.  The provisions of Dodd-Frank requiring more central clearing of derivatives and  

minimum margins for those that remain uncleared are designed to provide more systemic 

stability.  As to shadow banking itself, the FSOC recently proposed options to address the 

structural vulnerabilities in money market mutual funds, with an eye toward recommending 

action by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  And the Federal Reserve has begun using 

its supervisory authority to press for a reduction in intraday credit risk in the triparty repo 

market.  But these measures are incomplete, and do not extend to all forms of short-term funding 

that can pose run risks, a universe that is likely to expand as prudential constraints begin to apply 

to large existing shadow banking channels. 

 Monetary Policy. While the first two policy challenges are shared among regulatory and 

financial agencies, the third lies solely with central banks.  In the wake of the crisis, we need to 

consider carefully the view that central banks should assess the effect of monetary policy on 

financial stability and, in some instances, adjust their policy decisions to take account of these 

effects.  The dramatic rise in housing prices, and the associated high amounts of leverage taken 

on by both households and investors, occurred during an extended period of low inflation.  Some 

have suggested that, by not raising rates because inflation remained subdued, monetary policy in 

the United States and elsewhere may have contributed to the magnitude of the housing bubble.  

Whatever the merits of that much-contested point, it seems wise to address this issue as we face 

what could well be another extended period of low inflation and low interest rates.
