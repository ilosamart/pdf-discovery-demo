institutional credibility.  In particular, as an academic I had written favorably about the 

flexible inflation-targeting approach used by the Bank of England and a number of other 

central banks.  By making public considerable information about policy goals and 

strategies, together with their economic forecasts, these central banks provided a clear 

framework to help the public and market participants understand and anticipate policy 

actions.  The provision of numerical goals and policy plans also helped make these 

central banks more accountable for achieving their stated objectives.  I was confident that 

we could adapt this type of framework to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote 

both maximum employment and price stability.  Indeed, central banks using this 

framework were already, in practice, often pursuing economic objectives in addition to 

low and stable inflation--hence the term, “flexible” inflation targeting.  

Because the financial crisis and its aftermath naturally occupied so much of 

policymakers’ attention, progress toward a more explicit policy framework at the Federal 

Reserve was slower than I had hoped.  Nevertheless, progress was made.  In the minutes 

of its October 2007 meeting, the FOMC introduced its quarterly Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP), which included FOMC participants’ projections of key 

macroeconomic variables such as inflation, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and 

the unemployment rate.1  Over time, we added long-run projections of inflation, growth, 

                                                 
1 Prior to October 2007, FOMC participants provided semiannual projections of nominal and real GDP, 
unemployment, and core inflation, which were reported in the meeting minutes and in the Monetary Policy 
Report to the Congress.  The innovations associated with the introduction of the SEP included (1) the 
switch from semiannual to quarterly frequency, (2) the addition of projections for overall inflation 
(projections of nominal GDP growth were dropped), (3) the extension by two years of the projection 
horizon, (4) the inclusion of participants’ views about the risks to and the uncertainty surrounding the 
outlook for each projected variable, (5) the inclusion of the full distribution of participants’ projections, not 
just the range and central tendency, and 6) a write-up of the rationales provided by participants for their 
projections.  As noted in the text, further innovations, including interest rate projections and long-run 
projections of economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate were added over 
time.  The role of the projections in policy communication was also significantly increased after October
