As I will discuss later in my remarks, the effective use of data is a common theme among 

success stories in neighborhood stabilization.  In the hope that the census tract data referenced in 

this speech might be helpful to others working to address vacancy problems, I plan to post our 

data on the Federal Reserve website along with this speech.2 

Level and Distribution of Vacant Housing   

Since the beginning of this year, there have been signs of improvement in aggregate 

housing market conditions nationally.  Sales of new and existing homes have risen and home 

prices have turned upward.  So far this year, house prices have risen sufficiently to move a 

noticeable number of underwater households--that is, those who owe more on their mortgages 

than the market value of their homes--from negative equity to positive equity.  However, housing 

markets differ greatly both across regions and within metropolitan areas, and the positive signs in 

the aggregate data do not apply to all neighborhoods equally.  For example, even within those 

metropolitan areas that have experienced rising average prices over the past year, one-fourth of 

ZIP codes saw a decrease in prices over the same period.3  Moreover, those ZIP codes with 

falling prices have also experienced rising vacancy rates more often than in other ZIP codes.4  

These struggling high-vacancy areas provide evidence of the hard work that remains even as 

housing markets show signs of improvement.  Although many of these areas share a high level of 

vacancy, they differ significantly in other characteristics:  the concentration of vacancies, age of 

the housing stock, cause of the problem, and even the demographics of the residents.  By looking
