This diverse group of workers faces numerous barriers when trying to access the 

labor market or advance in their current positions.  Many of these barriers were identified 

in an initiative that the Federal Reserve’s Community Development function launched in 

2011.  Over the course of a year, Reserve Banks across the country hosted a series of 32 

regional discussions aimed at examining the complex factors creating chronic 

unemployment conditions and identifying promising workforce development solutions.6  

The kinds of problems faced by low-wage workers are familiar to all of you and have 

long been part of the structural conditions of poverty and near-poverty in America. 

  We know, for example, that location presents thorny challenges for many low-

wage workers.  Within metropolitan areas, jobs are not spread out evenly and job creation 

tends to be depressed in low-income communities.  As a result, many low-wage workers 

face long commutes and serious commuting difficulties due to less reliable transportation 

and an inadequate transportation infrastructure.  Moreover, a number of low-wage 

employees work non-standard hours, exacerbating both transportation and childcare 

issues, as well as personal health problems.7   

Traditionally, many workers find jobs through social networks and through 

personal connections that they have to the labor market.  But, because low-income 

individuals are typically less mobile, more isolated, and less socially connected than other 

people, they are often left out of the social networks that, in practice, lead to jobs for most 

Americans.
