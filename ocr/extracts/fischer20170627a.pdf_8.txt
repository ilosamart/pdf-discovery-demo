more and not paying it back as often.  Of note, delinquencies on recently issued auto 

loans have also increased, indicating that underwriting standards in the auto loan industry 

may be deteriorating.  Student loan balances keep rising, and delinquency rates on those 

loans are near historical highs.  These strains within the household sector leave such 

borrowers vulnerable to adverse shocks and probably weigh on their spending.  At first 

glance, one is tempted to say that the potential for this distress to adversely affect the 

financial system seems moderate, because both subprime auto loan and student loan 

borrowers account for a small share of other debt categories.  But, on second thought, one 

should remember that pre-crisis subprime mortgage loans were dismissed as a stability 

risk because they accounted for only about 13 percent of household mortgages, and not 

take excessive confidence.7  

Liquidity and maturity transformation 

Similar to my assessment of leverage, I believe that the primary vulnerability 

associated with liquidity and maturity transformation--that of a self-fulfilling run--is 

relatively low.  In recent years, banks have shifted away from more run-prone short-term 

wholesale sources of funds toward more stable sources such as core deposits.  Large 

domestic banks have also significantly boosted their holdings of high-quality liquid 

assets, making them more resilient to funding stress.  

In the nonbanking sector, the SEC revised the regulations governing money 

market mutual funds, first adopted in 2014, with the aim of reducing the key structural 

vulnerabilities exposed by the massive and destabilizing run on the funds in late 2008. 

The second round of reforms went into full effect in October 2016; ahead of this date,
