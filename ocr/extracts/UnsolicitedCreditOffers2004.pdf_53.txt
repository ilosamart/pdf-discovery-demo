Section 213(e) of the Fair and Accurate

Credit Transactions Act of 2003


(e) ANALYSIS OF FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OFFERS OF CREDIT OR INSURANCE.— 

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Board shall conduct a study of— 

(A) the ability of consumers to avoid receiving written offers of credit or 
insurance in connection with transactions not initiated by the consumer; and 

(B) the potential impact that any further restrictions on providing consumers with 
such written offers of credit or insurance would have on consumers. 

(2) REPORT.—The Board shall submit a report summarizing the results of the study 
required under paragraph (1) to the Congress not later than 12 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, together with such recommendations for legislative or 
administrative action as the Board may determine to be appropriate. 

(3) CONTENT OF REPORT.—The report described in paragraph (2) shall address the 
following issues: 

(A) The current statutory or voluntary mechanisms that are available to a 
consumer to notify lenders and insurance providers that the consumer does not 
wish to receive written offers of credit or insurance. 

(B) The extent to which consumers are currently utilizing existing statutory and 
voluntary mechanisms to avoid receiving offers of credit or insurance. 

(C) The benefits provided to consumers as a result of receiving written offers of 
credit or insurance. 

(D) Whether consumers incur significant costs or are otherwise adversely 
affected by the receipt of written offers of credit or insurance. 

(E) Whether further restricting the ability of lenders and insurers to provide 
written offers of credit or insurance to consumers would affect— 

(i) the cost consumers pay to obtain credit or insurance;

(ii) the availability of credit or insurance;

(iii) consumers’ knowledge about new or alternative products and

services;

(iv) the ability of lenders or insurers to compete with one another; and

(v) the ability to offer credit or insurance products to consumers

who have been traditionally underserved.
