collaboration with the other members of Team USA that continues to this day.  The standards 

produced through the IAIS are, of course, not binding upon the United States.  However, it 

remains in our national interest to engage in the international insurance standards-development 

process so that it produces standards that are appropriate for the U.S. market and consumers and 

for U.S. companies operating abroad.  I see this philosophy as being important not only in the 

Federal Reserve’s engagement in the IAIS, but also with the broader Financial Stability Board. 

Team USA’s collaboration is prominently visible in our advocacy at the IAIS.  In order 

for any form of an ICS to be implementable globally, it needs to be suitable for the U.S. 

insurance market.  The current core proposal in the ICS would face implementation challenges in 

the United States.  For instance, such a framework may fail to adequately account for U.S. 

accounting frameworks, both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the 

NAIC’s Statutory Accounting Principles, introduce excessive volatility, and involve excessive 

reliance on supervised firms’ internal models.   

Among other things, this motivates our advocacy of an aggregation alternative, and the 

use of an alternative valuation method that derives from U.S. GAAP, in the ICS.  Furthermore, 

we support the collection of information on an aggregation-based approach that would reside 

within the ICS, and actively participate, together with other jurisdictions that espouse 

aggregation-based approaches, in the development of such an approach for the ICS.  Among 

other things, aggregation approaches bring advantages, including sensitivity to local products 

and risks.  The BBA, in adding to Team USA’s work on aggregation methods with a tangible 

example, can assist in our collective advocacy.   

In sum, we remain committed to discharging our domestic authority responsibly and in a 

way that recognizes the unique business of insurance companies.  Additionally, we will continue
