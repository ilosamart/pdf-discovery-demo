referencing a risk-free (or nearly risk-free) rate based on a robust and liquid underlying 

market.  These transactions are more appropriately linked to a narrower measure of 

interest rates that does not include a bank credit risk component.  Encouraging 

alternatives that better reflect today’s funding markets would also allow for greater 

choice, increase the resilience of the system, and would potentially make hedging of 

some risks less costly.  In addition, the incentive to manipulate LIBOR would be 

substantially reduced if a smaller share of the multi-hundred-trillion-dollar derivatives 

market was referencing it. 

Some possible alternatives include rates based on the U.S. Treasury market or 

rates based on the secured funding markets that have replaced much of the borrowing 

banks used to do in the unsecured interbank market.  The Federal Reserve is not seeking 

to dictate the particular rate that financial markets adopt.  Instead, we will encourage key 

market participants to further the work done by the FSB’s MPG by narrowing down the 

list of alternatives and developing them into robust reference rates that meet agreed-upon 

international standards and best practices.12  There are enough suggestions on the MPG’s 

list to inspire confidence that we should be able to find common ground.  Any alternative 

would, of course, need to be in accord with the IOSCO principles mentioned earlier, and 

some potential alternatives would take time to fully develop.  But the establishment of 

alternative reference rates for certain products is in our shared interests and would 

substantially strengthen the financial system.
