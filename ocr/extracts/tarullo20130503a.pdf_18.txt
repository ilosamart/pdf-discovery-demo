much leverage arising from low-risk-weighted assets.  This relationship has obviously 

been changed by the substantial increase in the risk-based ratio resulting from the new 

minimum and conservation buffer requirements of Basel III.  The existing U.S. leverage 

ratio does not take account of off-balance-sheet assets, which are significant for many of 

the largest firms.  The new Basel III leverage ratio does include off-balance-sheet assets, 

but it may have been set too low.  Thus, the traditional complementarity of the capital 

ratios might be maintained by using Section 165 to set a higher leverage ratio for the 

largest firms.   

The other capital measure that might be revisited is the risk-based capital 

surcharge mechanism. The amounts of the surcharges eventually agreed to in Basel were 

at the lower end of the range needed to achieve the aim of reducing the probability of 

these firms’ failures enough to offset fully the greater impact their failure would have on 

the financial system.  At the time these surcharges were being negotiated, I favored a 

somewhat greater requirement for the largest, most interconnected firms.

  Here, after all, 

is where the potential for negative externalities is the greatest, while the marginal benefits 

accruing from scale and scope economies are hardest to discern.  While it is clearly 

preferable at this point to implement what we have agreed, rather than to seek changes 

that could delay any additional capital requirement, it may be desirable for the Basel 

Committee to return to this calibration issue sooner rather than later. 

The area in which the most work is needed is in addressing the risks arising from 

the use of short-term wholesale funding by systemically important firms.  The systemic
