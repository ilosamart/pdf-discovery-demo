Earlier this year—also speaking to a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 

—I explained the need for an explicitly tiered approach to banking regulation and supervision.1  

Today I would like to elaborate on those earlier remarks to suggest in more detail what a tiered 

approach would mean for community banks.  Let me begin, though, by recapitulating my basic 

premise and the reasoning behind it. 

Rationale for Regulatory Tiering 

For more than 75 years following passage of the Banking Act of 1933, the motivation for 

banking regulation was fairly simple: the government had granted deposit insurance and access 

to the discount window to depository institutions to forestall runs and panics.  The resulting 

moral hazard and the use of insured deposits as a funding source for these institutions justified 

prudential measures, including prohibitions on non-banking activities, aimed at maintaining safe 

and sound banks, which would in turn protect taxpayers.  Prudential regulation of bank holding 

companies by the Federal Reserve under authority granted by the Bank Holding Company Act of 

1956 was aimed primarily at protecting insured depository institutions and the federal deposit 

insurance fund from knock-on effects of problems at affiliated nonbank businesses.    

This approach is what we now characterize as microprudential—that is, the focus is on 

the soundness of individual banks rather than on the financial system more broadly.  This is not
