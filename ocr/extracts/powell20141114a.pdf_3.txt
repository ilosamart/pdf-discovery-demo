my view, while market volatility will continue to ebb and flow, these fluctuations are not 

likely to have important implications for policy.  The path of policy will depend on the 

progress of the economy toward fulfilment of the dual mandate. 

Overall, accommodative monetary policy seems to have provided significant 

support for U.S. growth.  And, of course, a strong U.S. economy contributes to strong 

growth around the globe, particularly in the emerging market economies (EMEs).  But

financial sectors are small compared with global investment flows?  Such spillovers 

could merely reflect investor responses to changing differentials between rates of return 

abroad and in the United States.  But these spillovers could also reflect shifts in investor 

preferences for risk.  

By design, accommodative monetary policy--whether conventional or 

unconventional--supports economic activity in part by creating incentives for investors to 

take more risk.  Such risk-taking can show up in domestic financial markets, in the
