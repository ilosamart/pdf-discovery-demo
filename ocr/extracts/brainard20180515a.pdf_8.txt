facilitate finality of settlement.  Such wholesale digital settlement tokens could potentially 

reduce the time and costs required for wholesale financial transactions. This is being discussed, 

for instance, for the use cases of interbank payments, securities settlements, and cross-border 

transactions, where the introduction of a digital token native to a platform may facilitate certain 

types of settlement.    

Likewise, it is possible at some point in the future that a limited central bank digital 

instrument that serves as a settlement asset for wholesale payment and settlement activity may 

hold some promise.  Several central banks have been studying this issue, and we have been 

actively watching these developments.8  We are also interested in work that decouples the 

underlying distributed ledger technology from cryptocurrencies and attempts to build on the 

benefits of the technology, a topic to which I now turn. 

Distributed Ledger Technology 

Even if cryptocurrencies prove to have a very limited role in the future, the technology 

behind them is likely to live on and offer improvements in the way we transfer and record more 

traditional financial assets.  Distributed ledger technology could also facilitate other applications 

that could improve the way we share information, validate possessions, and handle logistics. 

Recall that distributed ledger technology is the mechanism for recordkeeping and transfer 

of ownership that underpins cryptocurrencies.  Over the past few years, the financial industry has 

conducted a great deal of research and development on how to adapt the more promising aspects 

of distributed ledger technology for use with more traditional financial assets.  The industry has 

moved a number of these projects through a series of phases, often developing more incremental 

changes at first in order to gain confidence in the technology before tackling large projects with
