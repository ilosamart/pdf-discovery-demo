Let me now turn to the monetary policy outlook.  As you know, at our September 

meeting, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 

1/2 percent.  As we noted in the statement, the recent pickup in economic growth and 

continued progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the 

federal funds rate.3  Indeed, in our individual economic projections prepared in advance 

of the September meeting, nearly all FOMC participants anticipated an increase in the 

target range for the federal funds rate by the end of this year.  Moreover, as economic 

growth has picked up and some of the earlier concerns about the global outlook have 

receded, the Committee judged the risks to the U.S. economic outlook to be roughly 

balanced.  

Given that generally positive view of the economic outlook, one might ask, why 

did we not raise the federal funds rate at our September meeting?  Our decision was a 

close call, and leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged did not reflect 

a lack of confidence in the economy.  Conditions in the labor market are strengthening, 

and we expect that to continue.  And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to 

our 2 percent objective over time.  But with labor market slack being taken up at a 

somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the 

labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we 

chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives.   

As we noted in our statement, we continue to expect that the evolution of the 

economy will warrant some gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to
