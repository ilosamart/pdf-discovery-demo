Because the capital surcharge on the eight G-SIBs already exists as a part of our regular 

capital rules, the stress capital buffer approach would effectively add the surcharge to our 

estimates of the amount of capital needed under stress.  The surcharges were put in place because 

the material distress or failure of a G-SIB would have an adverse impact on the financial system 

as a whole that is far greater than the impact on the financial system of the distress or failure of a 

non-G-SIB firm.15  Accordingly, G-SIBs should face capital surcharges that compel 

internalization of those external costs.  Because the difference in the external costs of the distress 

or failure of a G-SIB as compared to a non-G-SIB is likely to be at least as high during times of 

macroeconomic and financial market stress as during ordinary times, there is no reason why the 

G-SIB surcharge should not be a part of the post-stress capital regime.  A complementary point 

is that the extra buffer required by the G-SIB surcharge reflects the fact that even the best-

conceived annual stress scenarios cannot capture all tail risks in the financial system.16 

The SCB proposal would thus raise somewhat the capital requirements of the eight G-

SIBs.  This outcome is consistent with analysis of the costs and benefits of capital requirements 

that I discussed earlier, as well as the rationale for surcharges.17  It is also consistent with the 

intuition, itself having some analytic backing, that because Congress decided against 

fundamental structural measures to deal with the too-big-to-fail problem, we should err 

                                                 
15 Board of Governors, “Calibrating the G-SIB Surcharge.” 
16 An argument against inclusion of the G-SIB surcharge offered by some is that macroprudential risks facing G-
SIBs are lower in the aftermath of a financial crisis.  We looked into this argument and concluded that experience 
actually shows that there is no lower probability of another serious reversal in a year following an initial serious 
reversal.  
17  Some have argued that incorporating the G-SIB surcharge into post-stress capital expectations is not warranted 
because doing so would be duplicative of the stress test’s global market and counterparty default shocks, which 
apply only to G-SIBs, and because post-crisis resolvability measures have lessened the likelihood that a G-SIB 
would fail.  The first argument reflects a misunderstanding of CCAR’s shocks, which apply only to G-SIBs because 
G-SIBs are the only firms in CCAR for which these exposures are material and are not designed to capture the 
adverse impact that a G-SIB failure would have on the financial system as a whole, as the G-SIB surcharge is.  The 
second argument fails to acknowledge that making the largest firms more resolvable and strengthening their 
resiliency are two separate goals.
