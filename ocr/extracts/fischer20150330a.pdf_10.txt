migration that have already occurred include the movement of many loans made to large 

corporations from banks to collateralized loan obligations, the securitization of many 

credit card receivables, and the securitization of mortgages.  This kind of migration 

makes close monitoring by regulators particularly important.  Authorities should monitor 

for changes that may arise in response to the new regulations or to changing economic 

and financial conditions.  They will need information to do so, but for many nonbank 

entities, the flow of information is currently nonexistent or very limited and informal.   

Another force for evolution in the nonbank sector is the demand for safe money-

like assets.  Some argue that this demand for private money creation prompted the growth 

in “shadow banking” prior to the crisis.7  Indeed, whenever shortages develop, we might 

expect the nonbank financial system to create assets that appear safe but that could in 

certain circumstances pose systemic risks. 

Progress to Date 

We have seen some progress in improving the regulation of the nonbank financial 

sector.  Let me mention four areas of reform.  The first is the Dodd-Frank Act’s creation 

of the FSOC and the power it was given to designate individual nonbank firms as 

systemically important and thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve.  

The FSOC has designated four nonbank firms as systemically important.8  The FSOC is 

also a useful venue for regulators to collaborate on identifying emerging threats.  And it
