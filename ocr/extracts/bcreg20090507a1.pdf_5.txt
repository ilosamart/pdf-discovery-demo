As mentioned above, any BHC needing to augment its capital buffer will be required to develop 

a detailed capital plan to be approved by its primary supervisor, after consultation with the FDIC and the 

Treasury, over the next 30 days, and to implement that plan in the next six months. BHCs are 

encouraged to design capital plans that, wherever possible, actively seek to raise new capital f rom 

private sources. These plans can also include actions such as restructuring current capital instruments, 

sales of assets, and restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases, and will have benchmarks for firms 

to achieve in specified t ime frames. 

Some firms may choose to apply to the U.S. Treasury for Mandatory Convertible Preferred 

(MCP) under its Capital Assistance Program (CAP) as a bridge to private capital in the future. MCP can 

serve as a source of contingent common capital for the f i rm, convertible into common equity when and 

if needed to meet supervisory expectations regarding the amount and composition of capital. In 

addition, the Treasury will consider requests to exchange outstanding preferred shares sold under the 

Capital Purchase Program (CPP) or Targeted Investment Program (TIP) for new MCP. The 19 firms have 

U.S. Treasury preferred equity securities of $216 billion. 

Strong banks with ample capital are essential for a robust economy. By making a careful 

evaluation of the potential vulnerabilities of the largest 19 U.S. BHCs—which together hold two-thirds of 

assets and more than one-half of the loans in the U.S. banking system—the SCAP will help to ensure the 

strength of the U.S. banking sector. The SCAP is also an important complement to the U.S. Treasury's 

support of the U.S. banking system, and helps to protect the taxpayers' investments in U.S. financial 

institutions. Both of these programs, by increasing the quantity and quality of capital held by large U.S. 

BHCs, will help reduce uncertainty about the impact of potential losses, and allow the U.S. banking 

system to play its role in supporting a stronger, faster, and more sustainable economic recovery. 

II. SCAP Loss and Resource Projections 

The participating BHCs were asked to estimate their potential losses on loans, securities, and 

trading positions, as well as pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) and the resources available from the 

allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) under two alternative macroeconomic scenarios. These 

estimates were reviewed and analyzed by supervisors and then evaluated against independent 

benchmarks developed by supervisors to arrive at the supervisors' loss estimates. Care was taken to 

ensure that the loss and resource estimates reflected the risk and business lines of each BHC, and that 

they were consistent with the macroeconomic environment specified in the two economic scenarios, 

especially for the more adverse scenario that forms the basis of the capital buffer calculations. This 

section reports the results of this process, first in aggregate for the 19 participating BHCs and then for 

individual firms. 

II.A. Loss and Resource Estimates by BHCs 

Each participating BHC was instructed to estimate potential losses on its loan, investment 

securities, and trading portfolios, including off-balance sheet commitments and contingent liabilities and 

exposures, over the two-year horizon beginning with year-end 2008 financial statement data. For loans, 

the BHCs were instructed to estimate forward-looking, undiscounted credit losses - that is, losses due to 

failure to pay obligations ("cash f low losses") - rather than discounts related to mark-to-market values. 

To guide estimation, the firms were provided with a common set of indicative loss rate ranges for 

specific loan categories under conditions of the baseline and the more adverse economic scenarios (see
