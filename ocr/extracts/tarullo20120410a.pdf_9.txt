virtually every firm, and at some firms the amount of work needed is still significant.2  This will 

remain a major focus of supervisory efforts, in next year’s capital review, and more generally. 

The 2012 Experience in Retrospect 

 The 2012 exercise extended our supervisory emphasis on forward-looking, data-driven, 

horizontal assessments of the largest bank holding companies.  It built upon, and incorporated, 

lessons learned from prior exercises.  But these supervisory tools are still relatively new.  Just as 

capital planning and internal stress testing capacities could be improved at every firm, so we 

intend to consider both substantive and procedural improvements in our use of these tools.  To 

this end, over the coming months we will be consulting extensively with academics, other 

analysts, and the banks themselves.  

 Substantively, the Federal Reserve will be focusing on potential refinements to 

supervisory models, such as modifying them to use more granular data.  We will continue to pay 

considerable attention to model validation.  Among other things, we are forming an advisory 

group of academics and other experts to advise our internal model-validation team on an ongoing 

basis.  Then, later in the year, we intend to convene a modeling symposium to bring a broader 

array of voices into the discussion. 

 We are, of course, mindful of the statements by some of the 19 participating bank holding 

companies that certain loss rates produced by the Federal Reserve’s model for the 2012 stress 

test significantly exceeded their own estimates.  We may gain greater insight into the source of 

these differences as we proceed with the review of our modeling.  However, our experience 

during the stress test has already suggested some possible reasons.  First, not surprisingly, the 

supervisory perspective on stress test modeling tends to be somewhat more conservatively
