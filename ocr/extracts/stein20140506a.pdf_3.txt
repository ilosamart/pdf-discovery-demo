accelerated release of the minutes, an increase in the frequency and scope of participants’ 

economic projections, and the introduction of postmeeting news conferences, to name a 

few.     

These are all welcome developments, and I expect there will be further changes 

down the road, as the Committee keeps trying to improve how it explains its policy 

decisions to the public.  In this spirit, I would like to spend the rest of my time discussing 

a few of the things that make life interesting for those trying to communicate clearly and 

effectively about monetary policy.      

More specifically, I am going to touch on three factors that strike me as 

particularly relevant for our efforts in this area:  the fact that the market is not a single 

person, the fact that the Committee is not a single person either, and the delicate interplay 

between the Committee and the market. 

The Market Is Not a Single Person 

This point was very nicely made by Hyun Shin in his remarks at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s symposium at Jackson Hole last summer.  Shin wrote: 


The “market” is not a person.  Market prices are outcomes of the 

interaction of many actors, and not the beliefs of any one actor. . . . 

But most discussions of central bank forward guidance treat the 

market as if it were an individual that you can sit down and reason 

with. . . . By doing so, I believe we are in danger of committing a 

category mistake where we anthropomorphize the “market” as a 

rational individual with beliefs.
