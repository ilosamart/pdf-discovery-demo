being traded and the underlying structure of the markets in which they are traded.  Based 

on granular disaggregation of the traded securities, liquidity appears little changed in 

secondary markets that have traditionally been highly liquid, such as on-the-run Treasury 

bonds and highly rated corporate bonds.  By contrast, there has been some reduction in 

liquidity in the segments of these markets that have historically been less liquid.10 

The move toward somewhat greater segmentation of liquidity, in conjunction with 

ongoing electronification and acceleration of trade execution, might be contributing to 

increased linkages across markets.  Anecdotally, it appears market participants may be 

using relatively more liquid instruments to hedge exposures in other less liquid market 

segments, perhaps unintentionally contributing to increased correlation across markets.11 

From a broader financial stability perspective, the possible deterioration in the 

resilience of liquidity suggests a special focus on segments where price gaps are most 

likely to arise at times of stress between holders of relatively illiquid or thinly traded 

securities that want to sell and dealers with an apparently reduced willingness to take the 

other side of the trade, as indicated, for example, by leaner dealer inventory holdings.12  

Mutual funds holding relatively less liquid assets is one area of focus.  Despite having 

share prices that move with market prices, these funds can give rise to first-mover 

advantages for redeeming shareholders and create the potential for destabilizing waves of 

redemptions and asset fire sales if liquidity buffers and other tools to manage liquidity 

risk prove insufficient.13  In this regard, our surveillance has been closely monitoring for

13 In particular, research has suggested that corporate bond funds exhibit herding behavior--that is, a 
tendency for waves of sales or purchases of common securities across funds.  This herding appears more 
significant for less liquid bonds, which could exacerbate the concerns noted above.  See Cai and others 
(2015).  Also, see Cetorelli, Duarte, and Eisenbach (2016) for estimates of the effects of asset fire sales.
