announcement dates shown in the table, bolstering the judgment that these securities 

purchases contribute to more accommodative financial conditions. 

One complication that arises in evaluating the contribution of portfolio balance 

effects to the observed movements in longer-term rates is that news about large-scale 

asset purchases may also influence investors’ perceptions regarding the likely path of 

short-term interest rates.  Such effects may not have been very important, however, when 

the FOMC announced the expansion of its securities purchases in March 2009.  As 

shown in Figure 4, that announcement appeared to have only modest effects on the 

outlook of professional forecasters (left panel) and investors (right panel) regarding the 

likely trajectory of the federal funds rate.  Thus, the substantial decline in longer-term 

yields following this announcement appears to have mainly reflected the effect of the 

purchases in pushing down term premiums rather than a shift in the expected path of the 

funds rate.5  This evidence suggests that the portfolio balance channel of influence is not 

only operative but also fairly large.   

That said, as we saw in figure 2, the expected path of the federal funds rate does 

appear to have flattened for a time during the late summer and early autumn of last year.  

Even allowing for that change in near-term policy expectations, however, it seems 

reasonable to conclude that the announcement of additional securities purchases mainly 

affected financial conditions through the portfolio balance channel.  

                                                 
5 As noted earlier, in the March 2009 FOMC statement, the Committee did modify its forward guidance by 
indicating that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would likely be warranted “for an extended 
period” (rather than “for some time”, as in the December 2008 and January 2009 FOMC statements), but 
that modification does not appear to have substantially influenced professional forecasters’ expectations 
about the near-term path of the federal funds rate.  To the extent that the expanded asset purchases were 
expected to strengthen the economic recovery, the change in the forward guidance may have helped clarify 
that the FOMC did not intend to offset that effect by accelerating the initiation of policy firming; 
consequently, expectations for the trajectory of the federal funds rate were little changed on balance.
