help.  So, if I were to write a prescription for housing recovery, I would include the 

following items. 

Most important to the health of the housing market is the strength of the economic 

recovery--the labor market in particular.  Potential homeowners are unwilling to buy if 

they are uncertain about their income prospects.  And credit standards will remain tight as 

long as lenders are concerned about borrowersâ€™ ability to repay.  For its part, the Federal 

Reserve remains committed to fostering maximum employment consistent with price 

stability, which should help reduce some of the macroeconomic uncertainty. 

In addition, I think efforts under way to reduce the flow of foreclosed homes and 

distressed sales in the market will help to stabilize home prices.  Mortgage loan 

modifications, short sales, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure all act to reduce the number of 

homes in the foreclosure pipeline.  Recent price signals--higher rental rates and falling 

rental vacancies combined with low home prices and elevated single-family home 

vacancies--indicate that by reallocating some of the foreclosed home inventory to rental 

property, investors could help balance supply and demand in both the rental and the 

owner-occupied markets.  Neighborhood stabilization efforts can help alleviate some of 

the costs to neighborhoods of foreclosure and allow local decisions regarding low-value 

and dilapidated properties.  Many borrowers are current on their payments but are still 

unable to refinance to take advantage of low interest rates.  Recent changes to the Home 

Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, will allow more of these borrowers to 

refinance and lower their payments, thus reducing the likelihood that they will become 

delinquent.
