increase the prospects for orderly resolution and, thereby, counteract the moral hazard 

associated with expectations of taxpayer bailouts.  Switzerland has already adopted a 

requirement of this sort, and similar proposals are being actively debated in the European 

Union.  A U.S. requirement, enacted under the Federal Reserve’s Section 165 authority, 

would both strengthen our domestic resolution mechanisms and be consistent with 

emerging international practice. 

 With respect to “going concern” capital requirements, there is a good case for 

additional measures to increase the chances that large financial institutions remain viable 

financial intermediaries even under stress.  To me, at least, the important question is not 

whether capital requirements for large banking firms need to be stronger than those 

included in Basel III and the agreement on capital surcharges, but how to make them so 

and with what specific risks in mind.  In this regard, I would observe that our stress tests 

and capital-planning requirements have already strengthened capital standards by making 

them more forward-looking and more responsive to economic developments.  As we gain 

experience, and as the annual process becomes smoother for both the banks and the 

Federal Reserve, we have the opportunity to enhance the stress tests by, for example, 

varying the scenario for stressing the trading books of the largest firms, so as to reflect 

changes in the composition of those books. 

As to regulatory measures of capital outside the customized context of stress 

testing, one approach is to revisit the calibration of two existing capital measures 

applicable to the largest firms.  The first is the leverage ratio.  U.S. regulatory practice 

has traditionally maintained a complementary relationship between the greater sensitivity 

of risk-based capital requirements and the check provided by the leverage ratio on too
