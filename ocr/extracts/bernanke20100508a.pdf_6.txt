beings are intrinsically very adaptable and are able to find satisfaction in their lives even 

in very difficult circumstances. 

Another area of this research bears directly on what I said earlier about the 

relationship between income and happiness.  Some years ago the economist Richard 

Easterlin showed that, just as would be expected, wealthier people in any given country 

are more likely to tell a survey-taker that they are happy with their lives than are poorer 

people in the same country.  However, Easterlin also found two other things that don’t fit 

so well with the economic perspective.  First, he found that as countries get richer, 

beyond the level where basic needs such as food and shelter are met, people don’t report 

being any happier.  For example, although today most Americans surveyed will tell you 

they are happy with their lives, the fraction of those who say that they are happy is not 

any higher than it was 40 years ago, when average incomes in the United States were 

considerably lower and few could even imagine developments like mobile phones or the 

Internet.  Second, he found that--again, once you get above a basic sustenance level--on 

average, people in rich countries don’t report being all that much happier than people in 

lower-income countries.  The finding that people in rich countries don’t report much 

greater happiness than those in lower-income countries--even though, in any given 

country, the rich say they are happier than the poor do--is called the Easterlin paradox, 

after its discoverer.5 

                                                      
5 Richard Easterlin’s original analysis was published in 1974 (see Richard Easterlin (1974), “Does 
Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot?  Some Empirical Evidence” in Paul A. David and Melvin W. 
Reder, eds., Nations and Households in Economic Growth:  Essays in Honor of Moses Abramovitz (New 
York:  Academic Press).  His finding was quickly dubbed “Easterlin’s paradox” (for example, see James A. 
Davis (1975), “Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot?  Yes, Indeed, About .0005 per Year,” 
paper presented at the International Conference on Subjective Indicators of the Quality of Life, held at 
Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, England, September 8).
