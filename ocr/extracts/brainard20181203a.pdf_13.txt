Federal Reserve staff analysis reveals that the 3 p.m. spike in trading volumes tends to be 

fairly evenly divided between the DTC and IDB market segments, suggesting that both 

dealers and proprietary trading firms play an important role during this narrow window of 

activity.  In the DTC market, the increase around 3 p.m. would be consistent with trading 

related to mutual fund daily and end-of-month portfolio rebalancing.  In the electronic 

IDB market, the increase around 3 p.m. would be consistent with the increased role of 

proprietary trading firms in intraday intermediation and the possible closeout of positions 

toward the end of the main part of the trading day.  From a market resilience perspective, 

it would be valuable to analyze these systematic intraday spikes in trading volumes, 

particularly as they may influence price formation and liquidity provision in the Treasury 

market.   

The large spike in flows toward the end of the trading day points to a financial 

stability consideration that is worth flagging.  The Treasury Market Practices Group 

(TMPG) has done valuable work in mapping out clearing and settlement patterns in the 

Treasury market.  One issue that this analysis highlights is the currently limited potential 

for same day, or T+0, settlement on transactions conducted near the end of the day.  The 

flash events we have seen in the Treasury market so far have occurred early enough in the 

day to allow time for prices to recover before market close, and they have not been 

accompanied by any participant’s failure to perform, let alone a major participant, 

platform, or exchange.   

As the TMPG’s work shows, most transactions in the Treasury market settle the 

next day, or T+1.  As can be seen in figure 8, Federal Reserve staff analysis based on the 

transactions recorded in TRACE shows that same-day settlement volumes, on average,
