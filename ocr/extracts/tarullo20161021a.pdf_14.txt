appropriate duties for boards of directors in such institutions, and the appropriate scope of 

supervisory expectations for boards.7  These issues remain worthy of discussion.  The preceding 

questions and others, such as the advisability of a requirement for a non-executive chair of the 

board, have only grown in significance since I spoke to this topic a couple of years ago.8 

Third is the subject of overseeing the regulators, which includes such matters as the 

advisability of publicly releasing some or all supervisory ratings and informal enforcement 

actions.  You may recall that our decision in 2009 to release the results of our stress test--a 

practice that we have continued in subsequent years--was quite controversial, but has proven to 

be enormously helpful both for giving investors in the firms and the public a better sense for how 

the Federal Reserve is conducting its capital regulation policies. 

Fourth is the rather broad topic of the implications of technological innovation for 

financial services regulation and, indeed, for the competitive position of insured depository 

institutions.  Many innovations now promising dramatic change in the way that credit is 

extended will probably end up having considerably less impact.  But some could prove 

significant.  I suspect that innovations in payments systems are quite likely to have far-reaching 

effects, including the growth of what might be termed the “shadow payment system” at the retail 

level.  Here, by the way, I am departing a bit from my self-limitation to prudential issues, since 

consumer protection issues around alternative payments systems may be quite significant.
