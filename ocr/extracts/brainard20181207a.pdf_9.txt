The widening adoption of practices that make risk harder to measure suggests a 

heightened focus on industry risk-management practices is warranted.6 

A substantial share of the leveraged loans are packaged in collateralized loan 

obligations (CLOs).  Gross issuance of CLOs hit $71 billion in the first half of 2018.  

This pace represents an increase of about one-third compared with the same period in the 

previous year.7   

Many large banks are engaged in the origination of leveraged loans with an intent 

to distribute, often to CLOs.  The originate-to-distribute model exposes banks to pipeline 

risk--the risk that some originated loans may be difficult to distribute if market conditions 

deteriorate. Although banks have improved pipeline management over the past decade, 

risk-management practices may have weakened somewhat recently in the face of strong 

investor demand.  The direct exposures of the banking system, in the form of loan 

portfolios and warehousing exposures, can be tracked.  But there are also indirect 

exposures, including through bank investments in CLOs on the order of $90 billion, that 

bear vigilance.  More broadly, bank lines to the nonbank financial sector have increased 

notably (figure 9). 

Loan funds have also become increasingly important in the leveraged loan market 

and are estimated to purchase about one-fifth of newly originated leveraged loans.  If 

prices were to move sharply lower, a rush to redeem shares by open-ended mutual fund 

investors could lead to large sales of their relatively illiquid holdings, further 

exacerbating price declines and run incentives.
