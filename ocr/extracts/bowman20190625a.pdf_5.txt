Research 

The Board and Reserve Banks also conduct valuable research on the impact of 

MDIs on underserved households and communities.  Last November, we held a webinar, 

which I hope some of you were able to participate in, on recent research on MDIs.  All of 

our MDI research is available on the Partnership for Progress website.  The PFP 

continues to seek to sponsor high-quality research to enhance our understanding of the 

MDI business model and how MDIs serve their communities.  We welcome your input 

on research topics you find interesting and helpful.   

Tech Assistance/Outreach 

 Through this biennial conference and several PFP conferences and outreach 

events each year, the Federal Reserve facilitates networking among MDI institutions.  

District coordinators from each Federal Reserve Bank will serve on local exam teams 

during examinations, and collect feedback from MDIs on how the PFP can provide 

additional assistance. District coordinators meet regularly with MDI management to 

discuss emerging issues and provide technical assistance, especially to those in troubled 

condition, to explain supervisory guidance, discuss challenges, and respond to 

management concerns and inquiries. High-interest items include the Community 

Reinvestment Act, IT and cybersecurity, concentrations in commercial real estate,
