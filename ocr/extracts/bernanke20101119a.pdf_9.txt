Global Policy Challenges and Tensions 

The two-speed nature of the global recovery implies that different policy stances 

are appropriate for different groups of countries.  As I have noted, advanced economies 

generally need accommodative policies to sustain economic growth.  In the emerging 

market economies, by contrast, strong growth and incipient concerns about inflation have 

led to somewhat tighter policies. 

Unfortunately, the differences in the cyclical positions and policy stances of the 

advanced and emerging market economies have intensified the challenges for 

policymakers around the globe.  Notably, in recent months, some officials in emerging 

market economies and elsewhere have argued that accommodative monetary policies in 

the advanced economies, especially the United States, have been producing negative 

spillover effects on their economies.  In particular, they are concerned that advanced 

economy policies are inducing excessive capital inflows to the emerging market 

economies, inflows that in turn put unwelcome upward pressure on emerging market 

currencies and threaten to create asset price bubbles.  As is evident in figure 6, net private 

capital flows to a selection of emerging market economies (based on national balance of 

payments data) have rebounded from the large outflows experienced during the worst of 

the crisis.  Overall, by this broad measure, such inflows through the second quarter of this 

year were not any larger than in the year before the crisis, but they were nonetheless 

substantial.  A narrower but timelier measure of demand for emerging market assets--net 

inflows to equity and bond funds investing in emerging markets, shown in figure 7--
