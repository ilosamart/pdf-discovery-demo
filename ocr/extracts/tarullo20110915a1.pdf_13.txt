identify and respond to new practices that increase systemic risk, while not suppressing financial 

innovation that can improve the efficiency of capital allocation.  In furtherance of this regulatory 

objective, it could be useful to complement finance research with an inquiry into whether and 

how industry structure or other competitive factors act to increase, or possibly dampen, such 

risks. 

My second example where researchers might usefully draw on IO insights is incentive-

based compensation practices at financial firms.  There is now widespread agreement that the 

very high-powered, short-run incentives in the compensation structure of finance professionals 

prior to the crisis may have induced them to take certain kinds of risks that were detrimental to 

shareholders of their firms, the overall financial system, or both.  While firms have already 

changed compensation practices, both on their own initiative and in response to guidance from 

the Board, the complexity of some of these issues will require continuing attention.  These 

efforts might be advanced through adapting lessons from the IO literature on how competitive 

forces can affect the way that individual firms solve principal-agent problems, and how those 

decisions affect economy-wide risk when aggregated across firms.  

Conclusion 

 In some respects, my talk today has been a financial regulatorâ€™s wish list for research at 

the intersection of IO and finance, intended as a complement to the formidable finance research 

agenda that has already been generated and is on display at this conference.  Some of the items 

on this list--such as the scale and scope economies issue--are of clear and immediate significance 

for systemic risk regulation.  Others are perhaps more speculative.  And I hope to have provoked 

you, and readers of this speech, to add some items to the agenda.
