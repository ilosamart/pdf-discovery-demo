initiative.  But as banks grow in size or specialize in different types of lending, they may have 

greater capacity to invest through additional channels.  We should be sensitive to the ways in 

which a bank’s business model, in addition to its size, influences the types of activities it 

undertakes to meet its CRA obligations.  We will want to maintain the flexibility to ensure that, 

no matter the business line, a bank can meet its CRA obligation by doing what it has the 

expertise to do well.  And as we look to improve our CRA evaluations, the agencies will need to 

determine what kind of data will be necessary to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance based on 

the activities it chooses and which banks should collect and report that data based on their scale 

and business model. 

Consistency and Predictability   

The fourth principle is that the revised regulations should promote greater consistency 

and predictability in evaluations and ratings, both within and across the agencies.  The members 

of our Federal Advisory Council have recommended that the regulations “need to be consistent 

across the [a]gencies and provide for all regulated financial institutions to be subject to the same 

CRA ‘crediting’, examination, and remedial standards.” 14  Banks have expressed understandable 

concern regarding the variation they see in evaluations.  Banks seek greater clarity in advance 

about what activities will qualify for CRA consideration.  They want to understand how the 

qualitative criteria--those measuring the impact and responsiveness of loans, investments, and 

services--will be factored into their ratings.   

This concern is not limited to banks.  The community organizations and local 

governments that are trying to attract bank financing to their projects need this clarity, too.  

Regulatory streamlining can help to promote consistency, as would regular examiner training.
