will become more of a problem.  Of course, if anything, this possibility argues for more-

aggressive policies to reduce unemployment sooner.12 

Effective Policy Responses 

The policy issues presented by today’s labor market problems are challenging, to 

say the least.  There is need, and ample room, for additional measures to increase 

aggregate demand in the near to medium term, particularly in light of the limited upside  

risks to inflation over the medium term.     

Unlike in the aftermath of the steep recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, 

demand growth has not become sufficiently self-sustaining to produce the strong 

recovery that followed those earlier episodes.  Of the nine quarters that have passed since 

positive GDP growth reappeared in the third quarter of 2009, the rate of growth was 

significantly above trend in only three--the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first two 

quarters of 2010.  These quarters were probably the first to benefit significantly from the 

effects of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed earlier in 2009. 

Up until quite recently, the dominant metaphor one heard for the economy was 

that it was on its way to a healthy recovery but was hitting occasional “soft patches.”  

This reading of the data always seemed to me quite optimistic.  Now, I believe, nearly 

                                                 
12 Another line of argument is that the sluggish recovery in the labor market, and in the economy more 
generally, is a result of wage rigidity.  According to this view, prospective workers are unwilling to accept 
wage rates low enough to induce businesses to hire and increase production.  However, it is hard to see why 
this phenomenon would be any stronger now than in earlier recessions, when a greater fraction of the U.S. 
workforce was covered by collective-bargaining agreements.  Moreover, there would seem to be little 
indication in the wage data to support the idea that wage rigidity is having a major influence on 
unemployment.  Wage rates have decelerated across a broad range of industries and occupations, and unit 
labor costs have fallen sharply.  A simple histogram of the distribution of nominal wage changes in recent 
years does show a spike at zero, indicating some resistance to reductions in nominal wage rates, but the 
spike does not seem particularly large relative to those in earlier recessions.  In any case, because the 
difficulties suggested by this argument arise from the interaction between nominal wage rigidity and a 
deficiency of aggregate demand, the most straightforward way to overcome problems caused by nominal 
wage rigidity would be to expand aggregate demand.
