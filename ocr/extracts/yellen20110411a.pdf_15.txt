that uncertainty subsides.  Finally, with higher oil prices weighing on household income, 

weaker consumer spending could discourage business capital spending to some degree. 

Fortunately, considerable evidence suggests that the effect of energy price shocks 

on the real economy has decreased substantially over the past several decades.  During 

the period before the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 

(OPEC), cheap oil encouraged households to purchase gas-guzzling cars while firms had 

incentives to use energy-intensive production techniques.  Consequently, when oil prices 

quadrupled in 1973-74, that degree of energy dependence resulted in substantial adverse 

effects on real economic activity.  Since then, however, energy efficiency in both 

production and consumption has improved markedly. 

Consequently, while the recent run-up in commodity prices is likely to weigh 

somewhat on consumer and business spending in coming months, I do not anticipate that 

those developments will greatly impede the economic recovery as long as these trends do 

not continue much further.  For example, the simulation of the FRB/US model that I 

noted earlier indicates that a persistent increase of $25 per barrel in oil prices would 

reduce the level of real GDP about 1/2 percent over the first year and a bit more 

thereafter.  The magnitude of that effect seems broadly consistent with the estimates of 

professional forecasters; for example, the Blue Chip consensus outlook for real GDP 

growth has edged down only modestly in recent months. 

Monetary Policy Considerations 
 

Let me now turn to the stance of monetary policy.  As you know, monetary policy 

has been highly accommodative since the financial crisis intensified.  In December 2008, 

the FOMC lowered the target federal funds rate to near zero and started to provide
