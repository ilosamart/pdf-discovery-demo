unemployment rate has flattened out this year after several years of sharp declines, thanks 

to welcome developments in labor force participation (figure 3).   

The labor force participation rate represents the percentage of adults aged 16 and 

over who are in the labor force, which is defined to include only those who are employed 

or actively looking for work.  When people enter or reenter the labor force and begin to 

search for a job, that is generally a good thing even though at the margin their entry tends 

to increase the unemployment rate (or prevent it from declining).  Beginning in the 

1960s, labor force participation rose steadily as women entered the paid workforce 

(figure 4).  That trend ran its course as participation peaked around 2000 and has declined 

steadily since then as a result of the aging of our population and other longer-run trends, 

notably the decline in participation by men in the heart of their working-age years.  Going 

forward, many analysts expect labor force participation to decline at a trend rate of 

roughly 0.3 percent per year as a result of these factors.  However, participation fell much 

more sharply than that after the financial crisis.  Some of those who left the labor force 

went back to school, but others moved onto disability, took early retirement, or just 

became discouraged and stopped seeking work.  The sharp drop raised fears that the 

crisis might leave behind permanent damage to our labor force.  Fortunately, since late 

2013, the participation rate has remained about flat and thus has gradually moved back 

close to its estimated longer-term trend.2  On net, people have been entering and 

remaining in the labor market as job prospects have brightened, offsetting the natural 

decline from population aging.
