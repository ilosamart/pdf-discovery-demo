I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this evening.  The Money 

Marketeers are renowned for their keen interest in the economy and monetary policy.  

With that in mind, I’ll describe how my views concerning the stance of monetary policy 

relate to my assessment of the economic outlook.  As you know, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) issued statements following its January and March meetings 

indicating that it “currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of 

resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely 

to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”  

I agreed with those judgments and, in my remarks tonight, I’ll explain my views and 

describe some of the analytical tools that I use in making such policy decisions.  I will 

also discuss the conditional nature of the Committee’s policy stance.  Let me emphasize 

at the outset that the remainder of my remarks reflect my own views and not those of 

others in the Federal Reserve System.

The Labor Market and the Economic Outlook 

I will start by describing current conditions and key features of the economic 

outlook that influence my views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  To 

summarize, the labor market has shown welcome signs of improvement.  Even so, the 

economy remains far from full employment.  Furthermore, the improvement in labor 

market conditions has outpaced the seemingly moderate growth of output.  Looking 

ahead, significant headwinds are likely to continue to restrain aggregate spending, and 

progress in closing the remaining employment gap is likely to be quite gradual.  Apart
