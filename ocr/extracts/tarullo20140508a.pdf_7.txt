in making its provision on incentive compensation applicable to banking organizations with at 

least $1 billion in assets.  Clearly, the unitary approach of the pre-crisis period has been 

abandoned.  This is an important move in the right direction.  But in terms of differentiating 

regulatory aims, Dodd-Frank really identifies only one additional objective—that of preventing 

or mitigating risks to U.S. financial stability.  By developing this objective a bit more, and by 

introducing other salient considerations, we may be able to specify the varying aims of 

regulation for different kinds of banks in a manner that helps us rationalize applicable regulatory 

structures.  

Specifying Regulatory Aims 

 Let me begin with what I regard as relatively straightforward cases in specifying 

regulatory aims—those of the very largest banking organizations and of small ones.  The largest, 

of course, have commanded enormous attention, with too-big-to-fail concerns often dominating 

the public debate on regulatory reform in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  There is now a 

consensus among banking authorities, both U.S. and foreign, that the failure of financial
