lower risk profiles.  These efforts should reduce the disruption that an on-site examination can 

cause to a bank’s day-to-day operations.   

We recently adopted a new consumer compliance examination framework for community 

banks.16  Under this new program, our consumer compliance examiners base examination 

intensity more explicitly on the individual community bank’s risk profile, weighed against the 

effectiveness of the bank’s compliance controls.  We expect that examiners will spend less time 

on low-risk compliance issues at community banks, increasing the efficiency of our supervision 

and reducing regulatory burden on many community banks.   

Much of the work to tailor our supervisory requirements and programs is being overseen 

by the community bank subcommittee of the Board’s Committee on Bank Supervision.  This 

subcommittee oversees the supervision of community and regional banks and reviews proposed 

supervisory policies to help ensure that they are appropriate for, and tailored to, community 

banks.  This subcommittee was formed several years ago under the direction of now former 

governors Betsy Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin, and I want to assure you that the subcommittee 

will continue to play an important role in helping ensure that our supervisory policies make sense 

for community banks.  I should also add that we are working closely with our colleagues at the 

state level to help ensure that our supervisory approaches and methodologies are as consistent as 

possible.
