Almost exactly a year ago, the Federal Reserve and the other bank regulatory 

agencies publicly reported the results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or 

SCAP, also known as the bank stress test.1  In many respects, the SCAP was a milestone 

in both the financial crisis and in the practice of banking supervision.  By helping to 

restore confidence in the banking system, the program was an important step toward 

quelling the crisis.  Beyond that, however, our experience during the stress assessments 

also contributed to the development of tools and approaches that will inform our 

supervisory process as we work to reduce the likelihood of future financial crises.  My 

remarks today will look back at the assessment program and its effects, then look forward 

to how our experience with the program and with the crisis in general is influencing the 

practice of banking supervision.  I’ll also make a few comments on how the Federal 

Reserve is working to restore the flow of bank credit to creditworthy borrowers. 

Objectives and Design of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program 

In February 2009, against a backdrop of severe strains in the financial system and 

a sharply contracting economy, the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the other U.S. 

banking agencies, launched a simultaneous and comprehensive test of the health of the 

largest banking organizations in the country.  At that time, many steps had already been 

taken to help stabilize our banking system.  The Treasury Department had injected capital 

into banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had expanded guarantees for bank 

liabilities, and the Federal Reserve had established lending programs to provide liquidity 

to a range of financial institutions and markets.  These efforts, together with similar 

measures abroad, had averted the imminent collapse of the global banking system in the
