To further build shock absorbers in the derivatives network, non-standardized derivatives 

that are not suitable for clearing should have margin requirements that are sufficient to prevent 

contagion when the next Lehman fails.  An international working group has been formed for this 

purpose.  We hope to see considerable progress on this element of OTC derivatives reform next 

year.  

Institutional Changes 

An audience of banking lawyers will appreciate the impact of the institutional features of 

international arrangements on the substantive output of those arrangements.  In the time 

remaining this afternoon, I cannot do justice to this subject.  But I do want to leave you with two 

observations about the international regulatory reform agenda of the last few years, along with 

some implications of those observations for desirable institutional changes. 

The first observation is that, although there are exceptions, the output of this agenda has 

largely consisted of what are essentially regulatory rules, intended to be applied to firms through 

national law.  Second, most of these rules are being generated, or at least reviewed, within an 

overlapping set of organizations and arrangements--the Basel Committee, IOSCO, the FSB, the 

G-20, and a veritable potpourri of committees functioning under the umbrella of the Bank for 

International Settlements (BIS).   

These rather mundane observations lead, I think, to some rather important institutional 

implications.  It goes without saying that the benefits of international regulatory rules will be 

realized only if they are implemented rigorously and consistently across jurisdictions.  Not only 

must they be incorporated into national legislation or regulations effectively, they must also be 

rigorously enforced by national supervisors.  We do not need formal dispute mechanisms similar 

to those in the World Trade Organization, which could undermine supervisory cooperation, but
