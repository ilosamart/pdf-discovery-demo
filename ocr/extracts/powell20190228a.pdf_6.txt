person must either be employed or have looked for work within the past four weeks.  The 

share of people of working age who are actually in the labor force has fallen significantly 

since the late 1990s.  This decline raises the important question of why have people of 

working age increasingly chosen not to work.   

The data suggest that there are both positive and more problematic forces at work.  

For example, among those aged 16 to 24, participation in the labor market has fallen from 

about 65 percent in the 1990s to 55 percent now (figure 6).  But this drop in participation 

appears to reflect young people getting more education.  The fraction of this age group 

who are neither in school nor in the labor force has held fairly constant at around 

11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5  Higher educational attainment is 

much more important in today’s job market than in the past, and investing in education 

today has long-term benefits for both the student and for society.6  Statistics confirm that 

higher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower 

unemployment, and higher wages.   

Turning to those aged 25 to 54, the participation picture is more troubling.  

Among prime-age men, participation has been falling for more than 60 years, with the 

decline averaging about 1.5 percentage points per decade (figure 7).  For women, 

participation rose over the second half of the 20th century until peaking in the late 1990s.  

Since then, women’s participation has dropped just a bit.
