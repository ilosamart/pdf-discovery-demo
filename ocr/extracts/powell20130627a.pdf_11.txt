prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future 

returns.  Of course, in the equity markets there is always downside risk.   

But, as my Board colleague Jeremy Stein has observed, there have been signs of a 

“reach for yield” in the fixed-income markets for some time.8  Demand for higher-

yielding fixed-income securities has outstripped new supply.  The result has been very 

low rates, declining spreads, increasing leverage, and pressure on non-price terms such as 

covenants.  These concerns have diminished somewhat as rates have risen since mid-

May.  Nonetheless, since it is likely that asset purchases will continue for some time, 

markets will need careful monitoring. 

What about house prices?  At the peak of the bubble, house prices were more than 

40 percent above their usual relationship to rents, according to one model that the Fed 

staff follows.  At their trough, house prices had fallen about 10 percent below fair 

valuation.  Given the price increases over the past year, they are--by the lights of this one 

model--moving back into the approximate neighborhood of fair valuation.   

The second concern is that the process of normalizing monetary policy and the 

balance sheet could itself be destabilizing or disruptive to the economy.  Many cite the 

experiences of 1994 and 2003, when long-term rates increased quite sharply on changing 

views about the likely near-term path of policy.  In those instances, there were both 

changes in views about the economy and changes in the public’s understanding of the 

Federal Reserve’s policy intentions.  These same two factors have affected markets in 

recent weeks.
