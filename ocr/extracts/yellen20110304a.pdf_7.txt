independent monetary policies that will facilitate the adjustment of global imbalances.  

But we must recognize that countries face diverse challenges in such a transition.  For 

countries with undervalued currencies, the adoption of more-flexible exchange rates 

requires an internal shift in resources across sectors--a transition that takes time.  As 

noted earlier, the recent crisis has also uncovered numerous flaws in the functioning of 

regulation of our financial system, and these, too, will take time to correct.  Finally, 

although I have not addressed this concern in my remarks today, the expansion of public-

sector deficits and debts in many countries poses very serious medium- to long-run risks 

for both the international monetary and financial systems that will need to be addressed. 

Against the background of these longer-term issues, we must also support 

countriesâ€™ efforts to address their more immediate challenges.  Some advanced 

economies struggle with weak demand, high unemployment, and disinflation.  Many 

emerging market economies face increasing inflationary pressures and capital inflows 

amid strong growth.  In light of these differing challenges, a cooperative spirit among 

policymakers is essential to ensure prosperity of the global economy.
