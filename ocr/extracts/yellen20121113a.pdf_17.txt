numerical results of the exercises I am about to report depend on the specific model, the 

qualitative points that I’ll highlight are fairly general.  

To derive a path for the federal funds rate consistent with the Committee’s 

enunciated longer-run goals and balanced approach, I assume that monetary policy aims 

to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of the 

unemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives.17  In computing 

the best, or “optimal policy,” path for the federal funds rate to achieve these objectives, I 

will assume that the public fully anticipates that the FOMC will follow this optimal plan 

and is able to assess its effect on the economy.18    

The blue lines with triangles labeled “Optimal policy” show the resulting paths.  

The optimal policy to implement this “balanced approach” to minimizing deviations from 

the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate close to 

zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline, and 

keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018.  This highly 

accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the 

baseline, while inflation slightly overshoots the Committee’s 2 percent objective for 

several years.   

                                                 
17 More precisely, the loss function that the central bank is assumed to minimize is the discounted sum of 
current and future squared deviations of inflation from 2 percent, current and future squared deviations of 
the unemployment rate from 6 percent, and current and future quarterly changes in the federal funds rate.  
The last term is included to avoid unrealistically large quarterly movements in the “optimal” federal funds 
rate path. 
18 This illustration takes the anticipated scale of asset purchases as fixed.  The effect of these purchases, 
given that the modal expectation in the primary dealer survey was for $500 billion of purchases, is 
implicitly already incorporated into the baseline forecast.  In principle, we could use the FRB/US model to 
perform a joint optimization exercise in which the optimal paths of asset purchases and the federal funds 
rate are simultaneously determined, but the results from such an exercise would be highly sensitive to 
assumptions about possible costs of asset purchases that are not well defined, such as the potential for 
market disruption.
