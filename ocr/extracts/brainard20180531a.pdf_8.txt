a future macroeconomic risk that could lead to a weaker economy, this concern would 

tend to lower expected longer-term interest rates, both because monetary policy would be 

expected to become more accommodative in the future and because market participants 

may increase their relative holdings of safe assets, such as Treasury securities.  In this 

case, longer-dated Treasury yields may fall, and if short-term interest rates do not adjust 

commensurately, the yield curve will invert ahead of a weaker economy. 

Turning to current conditions, the spread between the 10-year and 3-month 

Treasury yields has declined from 375 basis points in early 2010 to about 125 basis 

points in the first quarter of this year.  While that represents a considerable flattening, the 

current spread between the 10-year and 3-month yields is only about 20 basis points 

narrower than the average over the 45 years before the financial crisis. 

As we try to assess the implications of this flattening of the yield curve, it is 

important to take into account the very low level of the current 10-year yield by historical 

standards.  For the 20 years before the crisis, the 10-year Treasury yield averaged about 

6-1/4 percent, compared with recent readings around 3 percent.  One reason the 10-year 

Treasury yield may be unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the 

longer run may be unusually low.  A second reason may be that the term premium--the 

extra compensation an investor would demand for investing in a 10-year bond rather than 

rolling over a shorter-dated instrument repeatedly over a 10-year period--has fallen to 

levels that are very low by historical standards.  According to one estimate from Federal 

Reserve Board staff, the term premium has tended to be slightly negative in recent years.
