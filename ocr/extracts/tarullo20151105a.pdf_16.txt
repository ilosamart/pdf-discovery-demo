exercises of other jurisdictions.  These kinds of interactions, along with the more traditional 

device of supervisory colleges, can help foster confidence among host jurisdictions in both the 

regulatory and supervisory activities of home country authorities.  

Another useful practice for furthering mutual confidence would be a program for regular 

contact among the very top officials of key regulators.  The original Basel Committee brought 

together these officials for what were usually relatively informal meetings.  As one of the early 

participants in those meetings once told me, the relationships he built with his counterparts 

through these regular contacts served everyone well when issues concerning international banks 

arose.  But with the concentration of the Basel Committee on sometimes highly technical 

standards, participation has generally drifted down to the senior staff level.  The FSB was created 

in part to compensate for this change in the Basel Committee.  And the FSB usually does garner 

higher levels of participation.  However, other features of the FSB--such as including market 

regulators and finance ministries in order to provide a broader range of views on financial 

stability issues--mean that the FSB cannot serve the original Basel Committee purpose either.  

Moreover, even when the right member agencies are represented, the actual individuals 

participating may not be the most senior officials in the supervisory function of those agencies.  

Finally, the near doubling in size of both the Basel Committee and the FSB, while again critical 

for ensuring a representative group to consider financial stability issues, further complicates the 

matter. 

Thus, while a regular, high-level interaction among all key regulators would be optimal, 

for the foreseeable future, we will probably have to live with something less than optimal.  Ad 

hoc meetings around the fringes of various Basel convocations and bilateral interactions may 

have to suffice.  In this regard, I note the importance of the creation of the SSM within the
