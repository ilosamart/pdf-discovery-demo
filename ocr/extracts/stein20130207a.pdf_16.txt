Policy Implications 

Let me turn now to policy implications.  The question of how policymakers

I would like to provoke some discussion around one specific aspect of the question--

namely, what are the respective roles of traditional supervisory and regulatory tools, on 

the one hand, versus monetary policy, on the other, in addressing the sorts of market-

overheating phenomena that we have been talking about?  To lend a little concreteness 

and urgency to this issue, imagine that it is 18 months from now, and that with interest 

rates still very low, each of the trends that I identified earlier has continued to build--to 

the point where we believe that there could be meaningful systemic implications.  What, 

if any, policy measures should be contemplated? 

It is sometimes argued that in such circumstances, policymakers should follow 

what might be called a decoupling approach.  That is, monetary policy should restrict its 

attention to the dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment, while 

the full battery of supervisory and regulatory tools should be used to safeguard financial 

stability.  There are several arguments in favor of this approach.  First, monetary policy 

can be a blunt tool for dealing with financial stability concerns.  Even if we stipulate that 

low interest rates are part of the reason for, say, a worrisome boom in one segment of 

credit markets, they are unlikely to be the whole story.  So, would one really want to raise 

rates, and risk choking off economic activity, in an effort to rein in that one part of the
