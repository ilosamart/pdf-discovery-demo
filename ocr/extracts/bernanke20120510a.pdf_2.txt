I am pleased to speak this morning at what has become, over nearly 50 years, 

perhaps the most prestigious conference for bankers, academics, and bank supervisors in 

the United States.  The first part of my remarks will highlight the significant progress that 

has been made over the past several years toward restoring the banking system to good 

health.  I will also talk about some of the challenges banks face as they adapt to the post-

crisis economic and regulatory environment.  I will then review recent trends in credit 

conditions, noting that bank lending has generally been improving but remains restrained 

in some areas.  

The State of the Banking System 

Since the financial crisis, banks have made considerable progress in repairing 

their balance sheets and building capital.  Risk-based capital and leverage ratios for banks 

of all sizes have improved materially and are significantly above their previous highs.  

Importantly, the 19 largest banking institutions that participated in the 2009 stress tests, 

as well as the two subsequent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 

processes, have considerably more and better-quality capital than a few years ago.  

Indeed, those firms have increased their Tier 1 common equity, the best buffer against 

future losses, by more than $300 billion since 2009, to nearly $760 billion.  The Tier 1 

common ratio for these firms, which compares this high-quality capital to risk-weighted 

assets, stood at 10-1/2 percent at the end of last year.  

The latest CCAR, conducted earlier this year, demonstrated that most of the 19 

firms would likely have sufficient capital to withstand a period of intense economic and 

financial stress and still be able to lend to households and businesses.  The hypothetical 

supervisory stress scenario used in the CCAR was quite severe; it included a peak
