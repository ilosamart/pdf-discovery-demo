It will be a long road back to a healthy job market.  It will be years before many 

workers feel like they have regained the ground lost since 2007.  Longer-term trends, 

such as globalization and technological change, will continue to pose challenges to 

workers in many industries.  

Let me close with some words of encouragement.  The job market is improving.  

The progress has been too slow, but there is progress.  My colleagues and I at the Federal 

Reserve are well aware of the difficulties faced by workers in this slow recovery, and 

we’re actively engaged in continuing efforts to promote a stronger economy, more jobs, 

and better conditions for all workers.   

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.
