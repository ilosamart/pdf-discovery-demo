entities such as Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs), money market funds, asset-

backed commercial paper conduits, and auction rate securities.  These firms also 

dominated the underwriting of assets purchased by entities within the shadow banking 

system. 

Though motivated in part by regulatory arbitrage, these developments were driven 

by more than regulatory evasion.  The growth and deepening of capital markets lowered 

financing costs for many companies and, through innovations such as securitization, 

helped expand the availability of capital for mortgage lending.  Similarly, the rise of 

institutional investors as guardians of household savings made a wide array of investment 

and savings products available to a much greater portion of the American public.  

But these changes also helped accelerate the fracturing of the system established 

in the 1930s.  While the increasingly outmoded regulation of earlier decades was eroded, 

no new regulatory mechanisms were put in place to control new risks.  When, in 2007, 

questions arose about the quality of some of the assets on which the shadow banking 

system was based--notably, those tied to poorly underwritten subprime mortgages--a 

classic adverse feedback loop ensued.  Investors formerly willing to lend against almost 

any asset on a short-term, secured basis were suddenly unwilling to lend against a wide 

range of assets, notably including the structured products that had become central to the 

shadow banking system.  Liquidity-strained institutions found themselves forced to sell 

positions, which placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, thereby 

accelerating margin calls on leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for 

all holders of the assets.  The margin calls and booked losses would start another round in 

the adverse feedback loop.
