Market Participants’ Concerns 

1.  Decline in dealers’ inventory 

Market participants have cited a decline in dealers’ inventories as a possible source of 

decreased liquidity.  Figure 1 shows that primary dealers’ inventories of fixed-income 

securities, which are predominantly used for market making, declined sharply after the 

Lehman Brothers failure, from about $1.3 trillion to about $800 billion, and have since 

fallen further to about $700 billion.  The recent decline might be due in part to 

regulations, such as the Volcker rule and the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, aimed at 

making the financial system safer and sounder, as well as to changes firms may have 

made on their own, perhaps in reaction to the experience of the financial crisis.  

Regardless of the causes of the change, market participants have expressed a concern that 

the decline in inventories reflects in part a reduced willingness or capacity of the primary 

dealers to make markets--which may in turn lead to lower liquidity.  However, whether 

markets are in fact less liquid depends on both the degree to which the decrease in 

primary dealers’ inventories affects their willingness to provide liquidity and the extent to 

which nonbank firms such as hedge funds and insurance companies fill any lost market-

making capacity.4   

2.  Decline in trade size and turnover 

Market participants also often cite the decline in average trade size and 

turnover--the volume of trades relative to the total amount of bonds outstanding--as 

                                                 
4 Bessembinder, Jacobsen, Maxwell, and Venkataraman (2016) find that bank dealers are less willing to 

provide liquidity now than in the recent past, while nonbank dealers are more willing.  Duffie (2012) argues 

that the negative effect the Volcker rule may have on market liquidity in the short run may disappear in the 

long run as nonbanks step in to provide liquidity.  Duffie (2012) also mentions that the migration of 

liquidity provision from banks to nonbanks, which are not regulated, may have potentially important 

adverse consequences for financial stability.
