individuals with science and engineering skills is important for promoting innovation, 

and this need raises questions about education policy as well as immigration policy.  

Other key policy issues include the definition and enforcement of intellectual property 

rights and the setting of technical standards.  Finally, as someone who spends a lot of 

time monitoring the economy, let me put in a plug for more work on finding better ways 

to measure innovation, R&D activity, and intangible capital.  We will be more likely to 

promote innovative activity if we are able to measure it more effectively and document 

its role in economic growth.
