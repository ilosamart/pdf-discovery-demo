combines the clearing of futures on Eurodollars and U.S. Treasury securities with 

positions in fixed-income instruments, New York Portfolio Clearing, launched in March.     

Clearinghouses and Financial Crises 

 As clearinghouses developed, their resilience--in particular, their ability to 

manage their liquidity and ensure the integrity of transactions under stressed conditions--

was tested by financial shocks and crises.  I’ll briefly discuss three historical episodes 

that tested the financial infrastructure:  the financial panic of 1907, the 1987 stock market 

crash, and the recent crisis.  Although the clearinghouses of the time survived all of these 

episodes, in each case the problems they faced demonstrated potential vulnerabilities and 

a need for reform.  More generally, these episodes warn us to remain vigilant and to 

guard against complacency; complexity and change in the financial system will continue 

to present new challenges to stability, as they have in the past.  

 I noted earlier the development of clearinghouses for checks in cities around the 

country in the second half of the 19th century.  In the financial panic of 1907, which 

involved depositor runs on banks and trust companies in New York and elsewhere, check 

clearinghouses struggled to obtain the liquidity needed to complete daily settlements.  To 

avoid settlement failures and address a wider need for liquidity, including liquidity being 

demanded by the anxious depositors of troubled banks, many clearinghouses followed a 

practice that sprang up shortly after the founding of the New York Clearing House.  

Specifically, members of the clearinghouse, as a group, issued collateralized loans in the 

form of “clearinghouse loan certificates” to those members that were short of liquidity 

needed for settlements; in a real sense, the clearinghouse served as a private-sector lender
