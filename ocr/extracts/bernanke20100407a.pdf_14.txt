What about the longer term?  The economist John Maynard Keynes said that in 

the long run, we are all dead.5  If he were around today he might say that, in the long 

run, we are all on Social Security and Medicare.  That brings me to two interrelated 

economic challenges our nation faces:  meeting the economic needs of an aging 

population and regaining fiscal sustainability.  The U.S. population will change 

significantly in coming decades with the combined effect of the decline in fertility rates 

following the baby boom and increasing longevity.  As our population ages, the ratio of 

working-age Americans to older Americans will fall, which could hold back the long-

run prospects for living standards in our country.  The aging of the population also will 

have a major impact on the federal budget, most dramatically on the Social Security and 

Medicare programs, particularly if the cost of health care continues to rise at its 

historical rate.  Thus, we must begin now to prepare for this coming demographic 

transition.6 

The economist Herb Stein once famously said, “If something cannot go on 

forever, it will stop.”7  That adage certainly applies to our nation’s fiscal situation.  

Inevitably, addressing the fiscal challenges posed by an aging population will require a 

willingness to make difficult choices.  The arithmetic is, unfortunately, quite clear.  To 

avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose 

among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and
