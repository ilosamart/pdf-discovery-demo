requirements can also help offset any funding advantage derived from the perceived status of 

such institutions as too-big-to-fail.   

In acting on this rationale for capital standards to mitigate risks to financial stability, we 

first sought to ensure that there would be an international initiative to develop financial stability 

capital standards for global systemically important financial institutions, since the severe distress 

or failure of a foreign banking institution of broad scope and global reach could have effects on 

the U.S. financial system comparable to those caused by failure of a similar domestic firm.  The 

Basel Committee agreed to take up this agenda and is well on its way to completing a framework 

covering more than two dozen large financial firms from around the world.  Our intention has 

been to make our enhanced capital standards under Section 165 congruent with the Basel 

Committee’s framework. 

The task of determining how much additional capital is needed to reduce the probability 

of a systemically important firm’s failure to more acceptable levels is not a straightforward one.  

Conceptually, there is a good starting point, in what has been termed the "expected impact" 

approach, which calls for additional capital to reduce the probability of the firm’s failure 

sufficiently to equalize the expected impact on the financial system of the failure of a 

systemically important firm and the failure of a banking firm just outside systemic status.28  But 

implementing this concept is complicated by the fact that, despite some very useful metrics that 

have been developed in the last few years for measuring the systemic risk associated with a 

particular firm, there is certainly no generally accepted approach.29  Each has its shortcomings as 

well as its strengths.  Thus it is not realistic to think that, at least in the foreseeable future, the 

concept of a capital surcharge precisely offsetting the systemic risk actually created by that firm 

can be achieved in practice.  Indeed, differences among reasonable assumptions in applying the
