Arguably, the imperative to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability is an 

opportunity as well as a challenge.  Opportunities for both taxing and spending reforms 

are ample.  For example, most people agree that the U.S. tax code is less efficient and 

less equitable than it might be; moreover, the code is excessively complex and imposes 

heavy administrative and compliance costs.  Collecting revenues through a more 

efficient, better-designed tax system could improve economic growth and make 

achieving sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier.  Likewise, many federal 

spending programs doubtless could be reformed to achieve their stated objectives more 

effectively and at lower cost.  Certainly, continued efforts to reduce health-care costs and 

government health spending, while continuing to ensure appropriate care for those who 

need it, should be a top priority. 

Failing to address our unsustainable fiscal situation exposes our country to serious 

economic costs and risks.  In the short run, as I have noted, concerns and uncertainty 

about exploding future deficits could make households, businesses, and investors more 

cautious about spending, capital investment, and hiring.  In the longer term, a rising level 

of government debt relative to national income is likely to put upward pressure on 

interest rates and thus inhibit capital formation, productivity, and economic growth.  

Larger government deficits increase our reliance on foreign lenders, all else being equal, 

implying that the share of U.S. national income devoted to paying interest to foreign 

investors will increase over time.  Income paid to foreign investors is not available for 

domestic consumption or investment.  And an increasingly large cost of servicing a 

growing national debt means that the adjustments, when they come, could be sharp and 

disruptive.  For example, large tax increases that might be imposed to cover the rising
