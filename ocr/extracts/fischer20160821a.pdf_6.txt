labor force that will use this new capital has been expanding much less rapidly than in 

previous decades, but it is also possible that investment has been restrained by the 

subdued outlook for growth and profits, thereby generating less demand for expanding 

productive capacity.6 

However the slow growth in capital per worker has been quantitatively less 

important--accounting for only one-fourth of the slowdown in productivity compared 

with its long-run average--than the decline in the growth rate of total factor productivity 

(TFP), the portion of productivity that is not accounted for by measurable inputs to 

production.  Indeed, TFP growth has averaged less than 1/2 percent per year in the past 

10 years, well below its long-run average of 1-1/4 percent.  Pinning down the exact 

causes of this slowdown is difficult, and there are many possibilities.  For instance, it may 

reflect a slowdown in technological innovations, which may be persistent, as some have 

argued, or may be a temporary phenomenon, as I am inclined to believe.7 

Low-to-middling TFP growth might also reflect the downward trend in business 

dynamism, as evidenced by a notable slowdown in gross job creation and destruction.  

Diminished dynamism has been linked to a marked slowdown in the reallocation of labor 

and capital from low-productivity establishments and firms to high-productivity ones,

Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press), 
that slow productivity growth is likely to persist.
