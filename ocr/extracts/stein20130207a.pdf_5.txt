rating agency.  To the extent that this model is behind the curve and does not fully 

recognize the additional structural leverage and correlational complexities embedded in a 

second-generation securitization like the CDO, as opposed to a first-generation one, it 

will be particularly vulnerable to the introduction of a second-generation product.

These agency problems may be exacerbated by competitive pressures among 

intermediaries and by the associated phenomenon of relative performance evaluation.  A 

leading example here comes from the money market fund sector, where even small 

increases in a money fundâ€™s yield relative to its competitors can attract large inflows of 

new assets under management.

  And if these yield differentials reflect not managerial 

skill but rather additional risk-taking, then competition among funds to attract assets will 

only make the underlying put-writing problem worse. 

But it is not all that satisfying--either intellectually or from a policy perspective--

to simply list all of the ways that the delegation of credit decisions to agents inside big, 

complicated institutions can lead things astray.  It must be the case that, on average over 

long periods of time, these agency problems are contained tolerably well by the rules of 

the game--by some combination of private governance and public policy--or else our 

credit markets would not be as large and as well developed as they are.  A more 

interesting set of questions has to do with time-series dynamics:  Why is it that 

sometimes, things get out of balance, and the existing set of rules is less successful in

 To be clear on terminology:  A subprime CDO is a securitization where the collateral is composed of the 

mezzanine tranches of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as opposed to a collection of the 

underlying mortgages.  Thus, in this case, the RMBS is the first-generation securitization, and the CDO, 

which takes as its input a specific tranche of the RMBS, is the second-generation product.  See Coval, 

Jurek, and Stafford (2009) for an analysis of the relative risks and modeling uncertainties of first and 

second-generation securitizations.
