without having to worry too much about rising costs, but high enough to keep the 

economy away from deflation--falling wages and prices--which is both a cause and a 

symptom of an extremely weak economy.  Although spikes in oil and food prices, and 

other transitory factors, pushed inflation up earlier this year, inflation appears to be 

moderating, and we expect, based on the best information that we have today, that it will 

remain reasonably close to our objective of 2 percent or a bit less for the foreseeable 

future. 

In the longer term, monetary policy is the main determinant of inflation, and so 

Federal Reserve policymakers have considerable latitude to choose our longer-term 

inflation goal.  In contrast, “maximum employment” depends on many factors outside of 

the Federal Reserve’s control, such as the skills of the workforce and the pace of 

technological innovation.  Right now, my colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking 

committee estimate that the U.S. economy could sustain an unemployment rate of 

somewhere between 5 and 6 percent without generating a buildup of inflation pressures.  

But, regardless of whether the sustainable rate is 5 or 6 percent, with unemployment 

currently at 9 percent, our economy is certainly falling far short of maximum 

employment.  That high unemployment rate is why the Federal Reserve is focusing its 

monetary policy at strengthening the recovery and job creation, including keeping short-

term interest rates near zero and longer-term rates, such as mortgage rates, at the lowest 

levels in decades.  Keeping borrowing costs very low supports consumer purchases of 

houses, cars, and other goods and services, as well as business investment in new 

equipment, software, and facilities.  Over time, greater demand on the part of households 

and businesses leads to increased economic activity and employment.
