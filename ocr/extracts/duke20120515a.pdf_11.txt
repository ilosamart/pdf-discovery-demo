rather than after the loans became delinquent, it would allow errors to be corrected much 

earlier, and thus should result in better outcomes for taxpayers, borrowers, investors, and 

lenders.  Judging from the responses to the April SLOOS, I would expect any effort to 

clarify or reduce putback liability to have a corresponding effect on the standards for 

underwriting GSE loans. 

Reluctance to make loans because of the higher cost of servicing delinquent loans 

could stem from uncertainty about future standards for delinquency servicing.  Some of 

this uncertainty has been resolved by the state attorneysâ€™ general settlement with the 

5 largest servicers and the consent orders that 14 large servicers have entered into with 

federal regulators.  However, only about two-thirds of mortgages are covered by the 

terms of the settlement or are subject to consent orders. 

To be sure, a number of efforts are under way to establish additional mortgage 

servicing standards.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently 

declared its intent to propose servicing rules that would apply to all mortgage loans.  The 

FHFA strategic plan includes an initiative already in motion to create a single set of 

servicing protocols for both Fannie and Freddie loans.  These new standards are being 

developed in consultation with federal financial regulators who are also exploring 

establishing uniform servicing standards for the institutions they supervise.  However, 

while we hope that the prospect of uniform national servicing standards will lead to more 

consistent, efficient, and fair servicing practices, it is also generating uncertainty about 

the future costs of servicing mortgages and may be a factor in decisions by servicers to 

delay or abandon investments in servicing capacity.
