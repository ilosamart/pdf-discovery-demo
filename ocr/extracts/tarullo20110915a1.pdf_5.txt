Scale and Scope Economies in Financial Services 

Well before the financial crisis and my arrival at the Federal Reserve, I had found that the 

relative dearth of empirical work on the nature of economies of scale and scope in large financial 

firms hindered the development and execution of optimal regulatory and supervisory policies.  

Some regulatory features added by the Dodd-Frank Act only increase the importance of more 

such work to fill out our understanding of the social utility of the largest, most complex financial 

firms.  Ultimately, we want to understand what these scale or scope economies imply for the 

degree to which large size or functional reach across many types of financial activities is 

essential for the efficient allocation of capital and liquidity and for the international 

competitiveness of domestic firms.     

Significant economies of scale in terms of production costs have been demonstrated for 

services related to payment networks.  Generally, though, even where intuition suggests 

economies in some other areas--such as the breadth of securities distribution networks and the 

ability to provide all forms of financing in significant amounts--evidence for the existence of 

such economies is limited and mixed.  Moreover, even where significant scale is necessary to 

achieve certain economies, an important question will be what the minimum efficient scale--or, 

perhaps more realistically, the minimum feasible scale--actually is.  It is possible that a firm 

would need to be quite large and diversified to achieve these economies, but still not as large and 

diversified as some of todayâ€™s firms have become. 

There are some promising lines of inquiry begun by academics, including funding-cost 

advantages enjoyed by large firms; possible diseconomies of scope resulting from firm 

complexity; and the effect of market concentration and firm size on intra- and inter-firm 

diversification.  As I noted earlier, there has also been a considerable amount of work on scale
