physical capital that the revolutionary information technology firms with high 

stock market valuations have needed is remarkably small.  The slowdown of 

productivity growth, which as already mentioned has been a prominent and 

deeply concerning feature of the past six years, is another important factor.12  

Others have pointed to demographic trends resulting in there being a larger 

share of the population in age cohorts with high saving rates.13  Some have 

also pointed to high saving rates in many emerging market countries, coupled 

with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, as 

putting downward pressure on rates in advanced economies--the global 

savings glut hypothesis advanced by Ben Bernanke and others at the Fed 

about a decade ago.14  

Whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the long-run 

equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future 

episodes in which monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB will be higher 

than in the past.  Prior to the crisis, some research suggested that such 

episodes were likely to be relatively infrequent and generally short lived.15  

The past several years certainly require us to reconsider that basic assumption.   

Moreover, recent experience in the United States and other countries has 

taught us that conducting monetary policy at the effective lower bound is

jobs front during a period of historically slow growth.
