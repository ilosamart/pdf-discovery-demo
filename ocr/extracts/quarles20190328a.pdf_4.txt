Let me turn to the core principles--engagement, rigor, and analysis.  These core principles 

reflect goals that are both inward and outward looking.  From within, FSB members have the 

occasion to reflect on how our work is executed--that is, we must ask ourselves how we can 

accomplish our mission more effectively, improving the financial sector’s ability to support  

economic growth without threatening financial stability.  Outwardly, we will endeavor to reach 

out to a greater number of constituents and stakeholders for their input on the important financial 

stability issues they are encountering.  This is also a good time to inform a wider public audience 

on the nature of our mission in a clear, articulate, and jargon-free manner. 

Engagement 

As the FSB pivots away from the urgency of post-crisis reform development, it is an 

opportune time to improve our efforts at effective engagement.  Recognizing the wide-reaching 

effects of its work, the FSB must seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom 

brings a different perspective to the issues under consideration.  While we are directly 

accountable to the G20, we are, through the G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our 

actions.  In my view, that means we must engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of 

these stakeholders, to a greater and more effective degree than we have in the past. 

To start, we can strengthen the role of the six regional groups that are a part of the FSB 

organization.  In 2011, the FSB established six consultative groups representing large regions of 

the globe--the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the 

Commonwealth of Independent States, and Asia.  The intent was to expand its outreach program 

beyond the membership in a systematic manner to better reflect the FSB’s global mission.  Each 

group meets once or twice a year and helps the FSB obtain broader input into its policy 

development agenda.  These groups should be re-engineered to not only promote implementation
