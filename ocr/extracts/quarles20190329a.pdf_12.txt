booms, as noted above for Hong Kong, have been a concern in several countries in recent 

years.9  Accordingly, some national authorities have used macroprudential tools focused 

on housing, such as caps on loan-to-value ratios, to try to increase the resilience of 

borrowers and to indirectly strengthen the resilience of the banks and the financial system 

should their housing booms turn to busts.  For example, policymakers in Canada have not 

activated the CCyB in response to concerns about housing market risks, but they have 

lowered the maximum loan-to-value ratio for various mortgage products and capped 

debt-service-to-income ratios.10  The availability of such alternative tools for limiting 

systemic risk may be among the factors influencing the decision to adjust, or not adjust, 

the CCyB in a number of countries.  In this regard, it is notable that the set of 

macroprudential tools in the United States is limited relative to that in many other 

countries.11 

Finally, another difference, one that is particular to the United Kingdom, is the 

framework adopted by the U.K. Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to integrate the CCyB 

with its structural capital requirements.  Specifically, under the FPC’s framework, the 

CCyB would equal 1 percent in standard risk conditions--but to avoid having this be a

    Another example of a macroprudential tool used in some countries is a sector-specific version of the 
CCyB.  Switzerland, for example, has activated a housing-sector CCyB to address imbalances related to 
residential mortgage and real estate markets.  See Swiss National Bank (2013), “Countercyclical Capital
