Table 2

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
at Selected Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks in the United States 1  

(Status of policy as of January 2012) 

Questions 1-6 ask about commercial and industrial (C&I) loans at your bank. Questions 1-3 deal with changes 
in your bank's lending policies over the past three months. Questions 4-5 deal with changes in demand for C&I 
loans over the past three months. Question 6 asks about changes in prospective demand for C&I loans at your 
bank, as indicated by the volume of recent inquiries about the availability of new credit lines or increases in 
existing lines. If your bank's lending policies have not changed over the past three months, please report them as 
unchanged even if the policies are either restrictive or accommodative relative to longer-term norms. If your 
bank's policies have tightened or eased over the past three months, please so report them regardless of how they 
stand relative to longer-term norms. Also, please report changes in enforcement of existing policies as changes 
in policies. 

1. Over the past three months, how have your bank's credit standards for approving applications for C&I loans or 
credit lines—other than those to be used to finance mergers and acquisitions—changed?
