Given this backdrop, it is important to give promising technologies the serious 

consideration they merit, seek to understand their opportunities and risks, and actively 

engage in dialogue about their potential uses and evolution.  At the Federal Reserve, we 

approach these issues from the perspective of policymakers safeguarding the public 

interest in safe and sound core banking institutions, financial stability, particularly as it 

pertains to the wholesale financial markets, and the security and efficiency of the 

payment system.   

Distributed ledger technology was introduced for the transfer and record-keeping 

of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The essential advantage of the technology is that 

it provides a credible way to transfer an asset without the need for trust in intermediaries 

or counterparties, much like a physical cash transaction.  To do that, a transfer process 

must be able to credibly confirm that a sender of an asset is the owner and has enough of 

the asset to make the transfer to the receiver.  This requires a secure system or protocol to 

transfer assets (the rails), protection against assets being transferred twice (the so-called 

double spend problem), and an immutable record of asset ownership that can be 

automatically and securely updated (the ledger).  The tokenization of digital assets can 

facilitate the transfer process. 

The genuinely innovative aspect of the technology combines a number of 

different core elements that support the transfer process and recordkeeping:    

o Peer-to-peer networking and distributed data storage provide multiple copies 

of a single ledger across participants in the system so that all participants have 

a shared history of all transactions in the system.
