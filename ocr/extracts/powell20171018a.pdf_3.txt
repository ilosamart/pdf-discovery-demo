analytical tools, and off-the-shelf machine learning tools, to make sense of those data.  

The banking industry is adjusting to this world, and facing significant challenges to 

traditional banking business models.  

For example, today financial technology can support access to credit through 

innovative approaches to gathering and analyzing data.  Historically, a customer seeking 

a loan has provided financial statements to a bank or other traditional lending institution.  

More recently, the use of a fintech platform may allow a lender to quickly monitor and 

analyze more up-to-date data from a broader range of sources, including those outside of 

the traditional lending process, to verify an applicant’s identity and make inferences 

about the applicant’s overall financial health.  For example, a business loan applicant 

could submit information such as shipping data or customer reviews as additional input to 

more traditional data sources.  With this additional information, the bank would have a 

more complete picture of an applicant’s day-to-day activity and overall financial 

capacity, and potentially a greater ability to provide credit to customers, including some 

who might have been otherwise denied a loan based on traditional data.  

Fintech firms are also finding ways to use banks’ data, in some cases without 

entering into an explicit partnership with the bank.  With customers’ permission, fintech 

firms have increasingly turned to data aggregators to “screen scrape” information from 

financial accounts.  In such cases, data aggregators collect and store online banking 

logins and passwords provided by the bank’s customers and use them to log directly into 

the customer’s banking account.  This information can be used to provide consumers with
