contrast, the value of defined benefit plans requires estimating how much the future fixed 

payments each year in retirement are worth today.  These future payments are a sizable 

asset for households, currently estimated at about $15 trillion, or about 70 percent of total 

pension assets.11   

The DFAs indicate that the average pension wealth for middle-income 

households—including both types of plans—has increased 2.5 percent per year over the 

past three decades (figure 6).  Pension assets are now the largest asset held by middle-

income households, representing 40 percent of their wealth, substantially exceeding the 

22 percent share of home equity in their wealth.  

In part, the growth in pension balances reflects the sustained decrease in long-

term interest rates over this period, which has boosted the value of the future fixed 

payments associated with defined benefit pensions.  It reflects the aging of the 

population, since households near or in retirement age have the largest accumulated 

levels of pension savings and are also likely hold a relatively greater share of defined 

benefit plans (figure 7). 

How do we square the growth in pension assets with survey evidence indicating 

that many households in the middle of the income distribution are concerned that they 

will not have enough to live on in retirement?  Only 35 percent of middle-income adults, 

who are not retired, say that their retirement saving is on track, and 16 percent of middle-
