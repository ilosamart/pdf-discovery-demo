Distinguished guests, colleagues, and friends:  It is my privilege to welcome you 

to this conference on “Central Banking:  Before, During, and After the Crisis,” which is 

jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the International Journal of Central 

Banking.

  We hope that the conference will foster discussion among policymakers and 

researchers about the evolving challenges facing central banks around the world.  To help 

get that discussion started, the conference will feature original research on monetary 

policy, macroprudential regulation, and the provision of liquidity, topics that are 

obviously highly relevant to the public policy missions of the Federal Reserve and other 

central banks.  The proceedings from this conference will be published in a special issue 

of the journal and disseminated to researchers in central banks and academic institutions 

worldwide. 

Needless to say, the events of the past few years pose serious challenges to the 

conventional, pre-crisis views and approaches of central banks and other financial 

supervisors.  The crisis, the recession it sparked, and the subsequent slow recovery, 

especially in the advanced economies, have demonstrated that we have much to learn 

about the workings and vulnerabilities of our modern, globalized financial system and its 

interactions with the broader economy.  In responding to these stressful financial and 

economic developments, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have had to deploy 

a variety of new tools and approaches to carry out their responsibilities regarding 

monetary policy and the provision of liquidity, tools about which we still have more to 

learn.  Finally, in the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory 

agencies have been charged with challenging new responsibilities in the area of
