Some recent labor force trends have been promising.  For example, the two-

decade-long trend increase in the population not in the labor force on account of 

disability peaked in 2014 and has started to move down quite rapidly--again, for reasons 

that defy easy explanation but may reflect the general improvement in labor market 

opportunities.3 

I will now turn to productivity.  Labor productivity has averaged an annual 

growth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 2-1/4 percent pace that 

prevailed in the two decades before the financial crisis.  Although there are competing 

theories, the productivity decline is not well understood, and a consensus explanation has 

yet to emerge.  As such, the slowdown could reverse unpredictably as well.  The most 

recent data have been moving in the right direction, but only haltingly, with labor 

productivity increasing about 1-1/4 percent over the past year.   

There are reasons that productivity growth could shake off some of its recent 

torpidity.  I would like to start with the capital stock.  After a few years of abysmal 

business-sector investment spending, it appears as though the drought has broken.  After 

picking up in 2017, business fixed investment climbed a robust 10 percent at an annual 

rate in the first half of this year, likely supported by lower corporate tax rates and other 

incentives in last year’s tax bill.  Also, indicators for investment, including orders and 

shipments of nondefense capital goods, point toward continued strength, and survey 

evidence points to high business optimism and solid capital expenditure plans.  More 

capital should allow labor to be more productive.
