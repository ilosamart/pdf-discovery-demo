For now, the budget deficit seems to have topped out.  So long as the economy 

and financial markets continue to recover, the deficit should narrow relative to GDP over 

the next few years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces safety-net 

expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus and promote 

financial stability wind down.  That said, the budget situation over the longer run presents 

some very difficult challenges, in part because the aging of the U.S. population implies a 

sizable and sustained increase in the share of the population receiving benefits from 

Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Currently, there are about five individuals 

between the ages of 20 and 64 for each person aged 65 and older.  This ratio is projected 

to decline to around three by the time most of the baby boomers have retired in 2030, and 

further increases in average life expectancies may push this ratio down a little more in the 

years after that.  Moreover, the demographic pressures on the budget appear likely to be 

compounded by continued large increases in per capita spending on health care.  

Admittedly, the ability of budget analysts to forecast the trajectory of health-care 

spending is limited, but it is prudent to assume that federal health spending per 

beneficiary will continue to rise faster than per capita GDP for the foreseeable future. 

In a nutshell, the problem is that, in the absence of significant policy changes, and 

under reasonable assumptions about economic growth, demographics, and medical costs, 

federal spending will rise significantly faster than federal tax revenues in coming years.  

As a result, if current policy settings are maintained, the budget will be on an 

unsustainable path, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income 

rising rapidly.
