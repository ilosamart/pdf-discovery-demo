Importantly, this forecast is not a plan set in stone that will be carried out regardless of 

economic developments.  Instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the 

economy’s twists and turns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic 

environment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress.   

The proviso that policy will evolve as needed is especially pertinent today in light 

of global economic and financial developments since December, which at times have 

included significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values.  So far, these 

developments have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline--or most likely--

outlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term.  Specifically, we 

continue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our 

2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent 

months.  But this is not to say that global developments since the turn of the year have 

been inconsequential.  In part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation is little 

changed because investors responded to those developments by marking down their 

expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward 

pressure on longer-term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on economic 

activity.  In addition, global developments have increased the risks associated with that 

outlook.  In light of these considerations, the Committee decided to leave the stance of 

policy unchanged in both January and March.   

I will next describe the Committee’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that 

cloud that outlook, emphasizing the FOMC’s commitment to adjust monetary policy as 

needed to achieve our employment and inflation objectives.
