reduce counterparty risk.  

The market for government securities saw reforms as well, following the failures 

in the early 1980s of several smaller government securities dealers and increasing 

concerns about the integrity of clearing in that market.  In 1986, authorities and market 

participants developed a CCP for over-the-counter (OTC) government securities trades to 

augment bilateral clearing, at the time the dominant practice.  Today, this CCP is part of 

the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing 

Corporation.     

 In the case of exchange-traded derivatives, the significant benefits of 

clearinghouses likewise became apparent over time.  The Chicago Board of Trade 

(CBOT), now part of the CME Group, was established in 1848.  After various 

experiments to manage the paperwork associated with growing trading volumes, the 

CBOT established a clearinghouse in 1883.  Although the role of the clearinghouse was 

initially limited, it significantly reduced back-office work and the amount of funds and 

credit needed by its members.7  In 1925, the members of the CBOT set up a full-fledged 

and independent central counterparty--The Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, now 

called The Clearing Corporation--to provide the guarantee and settlement functions that

were adopted to backstop the guarantee provided by the clearinghouse.  The use of CCPs
