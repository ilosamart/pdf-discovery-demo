It is tempting to view the economic events of the last three years as a series of 

unrelated, unpredictable, unfortunate financial shocks.1  And it is easy--too easy, really--

to bemoan the latest flare-up of crisis conditions, and chalk it up to the global economy’s 

continued string of bad luck. 

If what ails us is nothing more than a case of bad fortune, then the mixed 

metaphor of the moment has it about right:  the black swans are caught up in the perfect 

storm.  And if what is needed to induce a durable global economic expansion amounts to 

more doses of the now-familiar spending packages and weekend shock therapies, then we 

would know that our luck was indeed changing.  If only it were so. 

In my view, a strong, sustainable U.S. economic expansion is not in the hands of 

the fates.  It rests in our hands--the hands of fiscal, regulatory, trade, and monetary 

policymakers.  Equally, it rests with business leaders like you here at the Atlanta Rotary 

Club. 

We will soon give notice to the third anniversary since the onset of the global 

financial crisis.  As we mark this occasion--and continue to witness shocks arising 

intermittently and unevenly--it might be worth debunking some popular views that have 

become part of the crisis narrative.  In their stead, I will begin with what I believe are 

some truths, perhaps hiding in plain sight all along. 

Subprime mortgages were not at the core of the global crisis; they were only 

indicative of the dramatic mispricing of virtually every asset everywhere in the world.  

The crisis was not made in the USA, but first manifested itself here.  The volatility in 

financial markets is not the source of the problem, but a critical signpost.  Too-big-to-fail
