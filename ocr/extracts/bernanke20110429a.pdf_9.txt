local, state, and federal agencies; academics; real estate professionals; financial 

institutions; small business and workforce development professionals; and loan servicers

attorneys.   

 As a final example, in Cleveland, local leaders in the Slavic Village neighborhood

of foreclosures in the nation.  By 2010, more than 1,500 properties in a neighborhood of 

11,000 homes needed to be demolished.  This community has a history of strong 

neighborhood organizations, and as might be expected, its residents, community leaders,
