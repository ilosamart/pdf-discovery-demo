Committee expects to maintain the federal funds rate near zero.  The situation in early 

2009 was similar to 2003 but even more challenging, because in that earlier episode, the 

FOMC at least retained the option of a further reduction in the federal funds rate target.  

In 2009, communication about the future path of the federal funds rate was the only 

option. 

Initially, the forward guidance was simple and familiar:  The FOMC statement 

noted that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for an extended period.”7  The Committee enhanced its forward 

guidance in August 2011, when it substituted “at least through mid-2013” for the words 

“an extended period.”8  This date was moved into the future several times, most recently 

last September, when it was shifted to mid-2015.9   

This “calendar guidance” was an advance over the indefinite “extended period,” 

but it suffered from an important limitation.  The date failed to provide the public with a 

clear understanding of what conditions the FOMC was trying to achieve or the economic 

conditions that would warrant a continuation of the policy.  As a consequence, it was 

hard for the public to tell whether a change in the calendar date reflected a shift in policy 

or a change in the Committee’s economic forecast.  

To help provide greater clarity about the Committee’s objectives, in January 

2012, the FOMC adopted and released a statement of its longer-run goals and monetary
