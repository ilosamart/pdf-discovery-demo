 There must be some assurance beyond mere words from parent banks or home-country 

supervisors that a large FBO will remain strong or supported in periods of stress.  After all, as we 

saw in the crisis, while a parent bank or home-country authorities may have offered those words 

with total good faith in calm times, they may be unable to carry through on them in more 

financially turbulent periods.  None of this means that we need be at odds with one another.  On 

the contrary, these very circumstances call not only for more tangible safeguards in host 

countries, but also for more genuine cooperation among supervisory authorities.  Indeed, as I 

hope will continue to be the case with the international agenda on resolution, total loss 

absorbency, and related matters, we should aspire to converge around the kinds of protections 

that we can expect at both consolidated and local levels.
