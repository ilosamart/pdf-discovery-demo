Some Issues to Explore 

Given the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of 

inflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here 

and around the world, with a view to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the 

Congress assigned to us.  As such, we will be looking widely at our tools and strategies, 

assessing not just the various approaches that were undertaken, but also approaches that 

have been proposed but not tried.   

One of those is the idea that the Federal Reserve should explicitly promise to 

“make up” for the fact that interest rates can’t be cut as much as during past recessions.  

The Federal Reserve could hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by 

promising not to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached 

a particular level.   

A related idea is average inflation targeting, meaning the Fed would aim to 

achieve its inflation objective on average over a longer period of time—perhaps over the 

business cycle.  So if inflation fell short during a recession, the Federal Reserve would 

aim at inflation above target during the recovery and expansion.  This approach would 

also have aspects of a make-up policy, as policy would likely be kept easier—that is, 

more accommodative—than otherwise during the period where inflation is above target.   

While such approaches sound quite appealing on their face, they have not yet 

been implemented in practice.  There is some skepticism that a central bank would in fact 

prove able to support above-target inflation over a sustained period without becoming 

concerned that inflation might accelerate and inflation expectations might rise too high.
