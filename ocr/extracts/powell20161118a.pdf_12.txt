see the direct contribution of Chinese growth to that of its neighbors at the margin, apart from the 

indirect effect due to China’s exports to advanced economies.   

The results of such an exercise, based on 10-year rolling regressions, are presented in 

slide 14.  Note that in the first half of the 2000s, the effect of advanced-economy growth on 

emerging Asia ex. China (shown on the left) steadily rises from near zero to a one-to-one effect 

by 2005, whereas the coefficient on Chinese growth (on the right) hovers around 0.25 and is 

statistically insignificant.  These results suggest that the effect of the rise in China on the rest of 

emerging Asia in the 2000s mainly reflected China’s role as a “conduit” for trade with the 

advanced economies.   However, after the Global Financial Crisis, we see the coefficient on 

advanced-economy growth move down some, whereas the coefficient on China’s growth rises to 

0.5 and becomes statistically significant.  But the direct effect of advanced-economy growth is 

still larger than the direct effect of Chinese growth, consistent with the idea that it is still early 

days for the rebalancing of China’s economy and that China will only slowly supplant the role of 

advanced economies as drivers of emerging Asian growth. 

Rethinking the “Export-Led Growth” Paradigm  

That brings me to the final topic of my remarks today, which is how emerging Asia can 

respond to the global trade slowdown and the structural changes taking place in China.  Some of 

the structural changes I have discussed suggest that the recent deceleration of trade relative to 

GDP will likely persist and that we may expect global trade to grow perhaps about as fast as, but 

not substantially faster than, global GDP growth for the foreseeable future.  Under these 

circumstances, emerging Asian countries may not be able to look to their export sectors as the 

key source of dynamism for their economies.
