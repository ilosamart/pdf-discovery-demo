One possible interpretation is that the high-yield share acts as a summary statistic for a 

variety of nonprice credit terms and structural features.  That is, when agents’ risk 

appetite goes up, they agree to fewer covenants, accept more-implicit subordination, and 

so forth, and high-yield issuance responds accordingly, hence its predictive power. 

A second implication of the institutions view is what one might call the “tip of the 

iceberg” caveat.  Quantifying risk-taking in credit markets is difficult in real time, 

precisely because risks are often taken in opaque ways that escape conventional 

measurement practices.  So we should be humble about our ability to see the whole 

picture, and should interpret those clues that we do see accordingly.  For example, I have 

mentioned the junk bond market several times, but not because this market is necessarily 

the most important venue for the sort of risk-taking that is likely to raise systemic 

concerns.  Rather, because it offers a relatively long history on price and nonprice terms, 

it is arguably a useful barometer.  Thus, overheating in the junk bond market might not be 

a major systemic concern in and of itself, but it might indicate that similar overheating 

forces were at play in other parts of credit markets, out of our range of vision. 

Recent Developments in Credit Markets 

With these remarks as a prelude, what I’d like to do next is take you on a brief 

tour of recent developments in a few selected areas of credit markets.  This tour draws 

heavily on work conducted by the Federal Reserve staff as part of our ongoing 

quantitative surveillance efforts, under the auspices of our Office of Financial Stability 

Policy and Research.   

The first stop on the tour is the market for leveraged finance, encompassing both 

the public junk bond market and the syndicated leveraged loan market.  As can be seen in
