Nearly all job market indicators are better than a few years ago, and many are at 

their most favorable levels in decades.  After lagging earlier in the expansion, wages and 

overall compensation--pay plus benefits--are now growing faster than a few years ago 

(figure 3).  It is especially encouraging that the labor force participation rate of people in 

their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, has been rising for the past three years.  More 

plentiful jobs and rising wages are drawing more people into the workforce and 

encouraging others who might have left to stay.   

In addition, business-sector productivity growth, which had been disappointing 

during the expansion, moved up in the first three quarters of 2018.  Rising productivity 

allows wages to increase without adding to inflation pressures.  Sustained productivity 

growth is a necessary ingredient for longer-run improvements in living standards.   

The price stability side of our mandate is also in a good place.  After remaining 

below our target for several years, inflation by our preferred measure averaged roughly 

2 percent last year (figure 4).  Inflation has softened a bit since then, largely reflecting the 

recent drop in oil prices.  Futures markets and other indicators suggest that oil prices are 

unlikely to fall further, and if this proves correct, oilâ€™s drag on overall inflation will 

subside.  Consistent with that view, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and 

energy prices and often provides a better signal of where inflation is heading, is currently 

running just a touch below our 2 percent objective.  Signs of upward pressure on inflation 

appear muted despite the strong labor market.   

While the data I have discussed so far give a favorable picture of the economy, it 

is also important to acknowledge that not everyone has shared in the benefits of the 

expansion to the same extent, and that too many households still struggle to make ends
