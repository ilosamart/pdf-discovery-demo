market a sense of current policy and the policy expectations for the future.  Over time, market 

participants have learned how to translate that sort of statement into expectations for market and 

economic conditions.  When we began large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities and 

agency debt, however, that decision was much more difficult to interpret.  So we communicated 

that we expected to purchase x amount of securities over y amount of time.  In subsequent 

statements, we reiterated that intention, added to some totals, subtracted from others, added 

purchases of Treasury securities, and ultimately stated our intentions to stop purchasing the 

securities. 

Minutes 

If you are interested in the debate, though, the best place to look for information on the 

topics discussed and views presented in FOMC meetings is in the minutes.4  Although the 

minutes have always been of interest to market participants, for a long time, the minutes of a 

meeting were not released until after the next FOMC meeting had occurred.  Starting with the 

December 2004 FOMC meeting, the Committee began releasing its minutes three weeks after 

each meeting.  This expedited timing enabled market participants to gain insight into the 

Committee’s previous decision as well as participants’ views on important issues before the next 

FOMC meeting.5

  The minutes are not just a longer, more detailed version of the statement.  An 

enormous amount of effort goes into making sure the minutes accurately reflect the discussion 

that took place at the meeting so that the public can see the full range of ideas and assessments 

considered by the Committee in reaching its decisions.
