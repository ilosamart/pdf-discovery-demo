The surveys reveal that while beliefs are dispersed across participants, 

importantly individual survey participants are also significantly uncertain--in other 

words, any given participant does not appear to have firmly decided on the likely path of 

policy.  The general point is that while we often measure and report differences in views 

across individuals, the uncertainty that individuals feel internally is also relevant.  Recent 

survey results that show that market participants assign a positive probability to a wide 

range of outcomes also suggest that the factors that exacerbated the taper tantrum--

dispersed but firmly held beliefs--may be less pronounced in current circumstances than 

they were at the time of the taper tantrum.      

The market reaction to the release of the minutes of the March 2017 FOMC 

meeting supports this interpretation of the interaction of uncertainty and Fed policy 

communications.  The minutes reported that, “provided that the economy continued to 

perform about as expected, most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the 

federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the Committee’s 

reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year.”14  As was shown in 

figure 5, in the March 2017 surveys, respondents placed the most weight, 71 percent for 

the primary dealers and 57 percent for the market participants, on an announced change 

in reinvestment policy not occurring until 2018 at the earliest.  Presumably, the April 

survey will reveal a shift in these distributions.   

It is noteworthy, however, that even though the statement in the minutes of the 

March FOMC meeting regarding Committee members’ expectations for announcing 

changes in the reinvestment policy was not aligned with market expectations, there was
