The third and final component of the long-term interest rate is the term premium, 

defined as the residual component not captured by expected real short-term rates or 

expected inflation.  As I noted, the largest portion of the downward move in long-term 

rates since 2010 appears to be due to a fall in the term premium, so it deserves some 

special discussion.   

In general, the term premium is the extra return investors expect to obtain from 

holding long-term bonds as opposed to holding and rolling over a sequence of short-term 

securities over the same period.  In part, the term premium compensates bondholders for 

interest rate risk--the risk of capital gains and losses that interest rate changes imply for 

the value of longer-term bonds.  Two changes in the nature of this interest rate risk have 

probably contributed to a general downward movement of the term premium in recent 

years.  First, the volatility of Treasury yields has declined, in part because short-term 

rates are pressed up against the zero lower bound and are expected to remain there for 

some time to come.  Second, the correlation of bond prices and stock prices has become 

increasingly negative over time, implying that bonds have become more valuable as a 

hedge against risks from holding other assets.

 Beyond interest rate risk, a number of other factors also affect the term premium 

in practice.  For example, during periods of financial turmoil, the prices of longer-term 

Treasury securities are often driven up by so-called safe-haven demands of investors who 

place special value on the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities.  Indeed, even during 

more placid periods, global demands for safe assets increase the value of Treasury 

securities.  Many foreign governments and central banks, particularly those with 

sustained current account surpluses, hold substantial international reserves in the form of
