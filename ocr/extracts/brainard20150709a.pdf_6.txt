conservation buffer in order to meet the CCAR post-stress minimum requirement, given their 

planned capital distributions. That’s more than twice the average common equity increment 

above the regulatory capital minimum plus capital conservation buffer required of the next 

largest group of banks, those with $250 billion or more in assets that are not globally systemic.  

In addition to the quantitative assessments, CCAR provides a powerful process for 

assessing the quality of each institution’s risk modeling and internal controls on a portfolio by 

portfolio basis. This is particularly important for institutions where the sheer size and complexity 

of their activities make it very challenging for even the highest-quality senior executives to 

effectively monitor and control risk.  

The CCAR and stress test exercises provide valuable, forward-looking mechanisms to 

ensure that large banking institutions can meet their minimum capital ratios through the cycle. 

For the systemic banking institutions, it will be important to assess incorporating the risk-based 

capital surcharge in some form into the CCAR post-stress minimum in order to ensure these 

institutions remain sufficiently resilient to reduce the expected losses to the system through 

periods of financial and economic stress. Conceptually, the stress test and the capital surcharge 

should work to reinforce each other--not to substitute for each other.  

Third, as we learned from the crisis, risk modeling and risk weighting are subject to 

considerable uncertainty, and stressed financial markets can make even the most rigorous risk 

assessments look optimistic in hindsight. Thus, the Basel III capital framework includes a 

simple, non-risk-adjusted ceiling on leverage that is designed not to bind under most 

circumstances while providing a robust cushion as a backstop. Although all internationally active 

U.S. banking organizations are subject to a 3 percent leverage standard that takes into account
