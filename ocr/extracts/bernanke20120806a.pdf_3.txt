Reserve has a statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability, 

which motivates our extensive efforts to monitor and forecast measures of employment 

and inflation.  Substantial research and the development of data collection infrastructures 

have, over the years, greatly enhanced our ability to receive timely and accurate measures 

of those variables.  Aggregate measures, such as gross domestic product and personal 

consumption expenditures, are useful for monitoring peopleâ€™s ability to meet basic 

material needs and for tracking cyclical and secular changes in the economy as a whole.  

Indeed, the experience of the recent financial crisis and the ensuing recession was 

strongly reflected in nearly all of these aggregate measures, indicating the severe 

economic stress felt by millions of people and hundreds of communities across the 

country.  

But, as many of you will discuss this week, aggregate statistics can sometimes 

mask important information.  For example, even though some key aggregate 

metrics--including consumer spending, disposable income, household net worth, and debt 

service payments--have moved in the direction of recovery, it is clear that many 

individuals and households continue to struggle with difficult economic and financial 

conditions.  Exclusive attention to aggregate numbers is likely to paint an incomplete 

picture of what many individuals are experiencing.  One implication is that we should 

increase the attention paid to microeconomic data, which better capture the diversity of 

experience across households and firms.  Another implication, however, is that we should 

seek better and more-direct measurements of economic well-being, the ultimate objective 

of our policy decisions.
