in real terms--from $344,000 in 2007 to $229,000 in 2013.  The top 5 percent of families 

with children saw their median wealth fall only 9 percent, from $3.5 million in 2007 to 

$3.2 million in 2013, after inflation. 

For families below the top, public funding plays an important role in providing 

resources to children that influence future levels of income and wealth.  Such funding has 

the potential to help equalize these resources and the opportunities they confer. 

Social safety-net spending is an important form of public funding that helps offset 

disparities in family resources for children.  Spending for income security programs since 

1989 and until recently was fairly stable, ranging between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of gross 

domestic product (GDP), with higher levels in this range related to recessions.  However, 

such spending rose to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3 percent in 2010.22  Researchers 

estimate that the increase in the poverty rate because of the recession would have been 

much larger without the effects of income security programs.23  

Public funding of education is another way that governments can help offset the 

advantages some households have in resources available for children.  One of the most 

consequential examples is early childhood education.  Research shows that children from 

lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education are more 

likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have 

higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.24
