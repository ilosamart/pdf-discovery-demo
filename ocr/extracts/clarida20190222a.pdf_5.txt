Scope of the Review 

In the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the 

responsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of 

maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”8  Our 

review this year will take this statutory mandate as given and will also take as given that 

inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the 

congressional mandate.   

Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on 

Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.9  First adopted in January 2012, the 

statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the 

FOMC’s meeting last month with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC participants.  

The statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 

2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.  In 

doing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are 

necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  According to the Federal Reserve Act, the 

employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective. 

                                                 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  In a paper discussed at this forum two years ago, 
Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead 
inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated 
since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers 
should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in 
realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations. 
8 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is 
commonly known as the “dual mandate.”  The reason is that an economy in which people who want to 
work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad 
measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed 
for interest rates to settle at moderate levels.  For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007).
