TYPES OF CREDITORS AND INSURERS THAT USE PRESCREENING 

Prescreened solicitations are used to establish credit relationships for a wide variety of 
products including credit cards, home equity lines of credit, “live check” loans, student 
loans, and automobile credit.6 Perhaps the most frequent use of prescreening is in the 
area of credit cards. 

Industry sources indicate that nearly 70 percent of general-purpose credit card accounts 
established in 2002 resulted from direct mail contact, prescreened or not (table 1). Such 
mailings have grown substantially over the past decade, to about 5 billion in 2001 and 
2002, a level nearly five times that of a decade earlier (figure 1). About 75 percent of the 
credit card accounts established through direct mailing (53 percent of all new accounts)

6 A prescreened mail solicitation for a live-check loan is sent in the form of a check made out to the 
consumer for an exact amount. The terms of the offer specify that by endorsing and depositing the check, 
the consumer has agreed to a loan from the company for the amount of the check.
