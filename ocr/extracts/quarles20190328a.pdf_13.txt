extensively on academic advisors during all phases of the work we are undertaking.  I also 

encourage other experts in this field to look closely to the consultative document that will be 

coming from the study next year.  We welcome the input as we undertake the study of this 

signature issue from the crisis. 

Conclusion 

 Let me conclude by reiterating some of the broad themes I intended to convey today.  

First, I touched on some of the key principles that I hope will guide the FSB work while I am 

chair.  Those principles include expanded engagement with a broad range of stakeholders and 

experts, rigorous and careful examination of financial vulnerabilities that may threaten our 

financial system, and analytical examination of past reforms to ensure that they are making the 

financial system as resilient as it can be in the most efficient manner possible.   

Second, I shared some of the key questions we are working on relating to the rise of large 

technology firms in the financial sector and decentralized financial technologies, the growing 

importance of the nonbank financial sector, and our burgeoning efforts to look at how well we 

have addressed too big to fail, the signature issue of the recent financial crisis. 

Moving forward there will surely be additional issues to address and areas to examine.a  

During my time as chair of the FSB, I hope to make progress not only on the areas I have 

outlined but on a range of forward-looking issues and continue to demonstrate the value of the 

FSB.  International standard-setting bodies serve an important role within our global financial 

sector, and I look forward to the FSB advancing our progress and work in these areas.
