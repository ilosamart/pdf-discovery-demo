New Monetary Policy Tools

The MPC and FOMC have extensively--particularly in recent years--used two 

monetary policy tools other than decisions on the current short-term interest rate.  These 

tools are forward guidance and asset purchases.19

Monetary authorities used to be reluctant to discuss the future course of the policy 

rate.20 By 1997, however, there was widespread recognition of the merits of clarity on 

the reaction function and of having long-term interest rates incorporate accurate 

expectations of future policy.  These considerations led to the FOMC’s use of forward 

guidance regarding the short-term interest rate in its postmeeting statements during the 

mid-2000s.  The MPC, in contrast, for a long time generally preferred to let markets infer 

likely future rates from the extensive communication it provided about its reaction 

function.21

Beginning in 2008, with the policy rate at or near its lower bound, regular forward 

guidance acquired new efficacy.22 Through forward guidance, additional 

19 In addition to these tools, the MPC has used the Funding for Lending Scheme to boost bank lending.  It is 
beyond the scope of my talk to discuss this further innovation.
20 For example, Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns once noted (Burns, 1977, p. 717): “Federal 
Reserve officials are extremely careful to avoid any public comment that might suggest or imply some 
particular outlook for interest rates.”  In the United Kingdom, in 1981 Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Geoffrey Howe observed (Howe, 1981) that it was not the authorities’ “practice to forecast interest rate 
movements.”
21 Although it provides an inflation forecast in the Inflation Report, the MPC does not form an interest rate 
forecast in conjunction with that inflation forecast.  Instead, its current practice is to report a “CPI inflation 
projection based on market interest rate expectations” (Bank of England, 2017b, chart 5.1). The fact that 
the MPC’s Inflation Report forecasts (for real output growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate)
condition on market expectations of interest rates is one difference between the MPC forecasts and the 
FOMC participants’ projections that are summarized in the SEP.  Another difference is that the SEP 
consolidates information on the projections constructed and submitted separately by the individual FOMC 
participants, while the Inflation Report’s economic projections are arrived at collectively by the MPC and 
are therefore the forecasts of the committee as a whole. This is another aspect of the differences of 
behavior between the two monetary committees that is both interesting and possibly important, but for 
which there is not enough time for a more detailed discussion.
22 Woodford (2013) provides an analysis of the value of forward guidance under various conditions, 
including the case in which the policy rate is at its lower bound.
