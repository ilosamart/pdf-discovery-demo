Cukierman goes on to note, however, that the causality from independence to lower 

inflation is not clear, and several studies over the past 10 to 15 years have found 

conflicting results on that front.7    

Let me touch on four issues that are now an essential part of the understanding of 

central bank independence, but that were less prominent in the 1990s.  First, there is a 

distinction between the terms monetary policy independence and central bank 

independence.  In the literature that developed before the global financial crisis, central 

bank independence referred to independence from political influences in the setting of 

monetary policy.  But many central banks have roles outside monetary policy--in 

particular, bank regulation and supervision.  These roles are in certain cases granted their 

own level of independence, a subject to which I shall return later in the lecture.   

Second, there is a useful distinction between goal independence and instrument 

independence.8  A central bankâ€™s mission--its purposes and goals--are set out in its 

founding legislation and subsequent refinements.  The purposes may be general, such as 

preserving the value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the financial system, 

and, in some countries, promoting economic growth or employment.  These purposes 

have typically to be translated into operational goals--for instance, maintaining an 

inflation rate of 2 percent.  The question of goal independence is whether the central bank 

itself establishes the operational goals or whether some other official body does so.  

Examples of such bodies are the finance ministry or the cabinet.  If the central bank sets
