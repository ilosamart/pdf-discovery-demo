doctrine, as well as the fact that the United States was on the gold standard.

  In the 

framework of the real bills doctrine, the Federal Reserve saw its function as meeting the 

needs of business for liquidity--consistent with the idea of providing an elastic currency--

with the ultimate goal of supporting financial and economic stability.

  When business 

activity was increasing, the Federal Reserve helped accommodate the need for credit by 

supplying liquidity to banks; when business was contracting and less credit was needed, 

the Fed reduced the liquidity in the system. 

As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve pursued this approach to policy in the 

context of the gold standard.  Federal Reserve notes were redeemable in gold on demand, 

and the Fed was required to maintain a gold reserve equal to 40 percent of outstanding 

notes.  However, contrary to the principles of an idealized gold standard, the Federal 

Reserve often took actions to prevent inflows and outflows of gold from being fully 

translated into changes in the domestic money supply.

  This practice, together with the 

size of the U.S. economy, gave the Federal Reserve considerable autonomy in monetary 

policy and, in particular, allowed the Fed to conduct policy according to the real bills 

doctrine without much hindrance. 

The policy framework of the Fed’s early years has been much criticized in 

retrospect.  Although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrained U.S. 

monetary policy in the years after the Fed’s founding, subsequent research has 

highlighted the extent to which the international gold standard served to destabilize the

 See Humphrey (1982) for a discussion of the historical evolution of the real bills doctrine.

 This interpretation follows from the discussion in the Tenth Annual Report of the Federal Reserve Board 

(Board of Governors, 1924).  Soon after the Federal Reserve was founded, its mission shifted to supporting 

the war effort and then to managing the unwinding of that support.  The year 1923 was thus one of the first 

in which the Federal Reserve confronted normal peacetime financial conditions, and it took the opportunity 

to articulate its views on the appropriate conduct of policy in such conditions.

 The Federal Reserve could undo the effects of gold inflows on the domestic money supply through open 

market operations, discussed later.
