Capital stress testing for banks is not new but the Federal Reserve has employed it 

much more extensively since the crisis.8  Using information on a bank’s finances and 

operations, these tests gauge how a firm’s capital position would be affected by 

hypothetical scenarios covering a range of adverse economic and financial conditions.  

Such tests show the potential harm faced by individual banks in stressful conditions and 

thus the potential that such problems could affect the stability of the financial system.  

The goal is to see that large institutions have enough capital not just to survive in these 

conditions, but also to continue serving their customers.  The Federal Reserve conducts 

stress tests once a year, and the firms are required to run their own tests and disclose 

results to the public twice a year.   

Stress testing is an important tool, but it is not sufficient to provide a full picture 

of the capital adequacy of large firms.9  The Fed also looks at other aspects of large 

banks’ capital planning, such as their risk management, internal controls, and 

governance.  If the Federal Reserve is not satisfied with the results from capital stress 

tests or identifies shortcomings in a firm’s capital planning, we may restrict the firm’s 

ability to pay dividends, buy back shares, or take other actions that would reduce its 

capital base.   

In addition to these steps related to capital, in 2012 the Federal Reserve began a 

comprehensive assessment of large banks’ liquidity.10  We review the firms’ own 

8 In addition to ad hoc stress testing that was conducted throughout the crisis, in 2009 the Federal Reserve 
and the other U.S. federal banking agencies undertook the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program at the 
19 largest U.S. bank holding companies.  This exercise played a key role in publicly identifying capital 
deficiencies at the largest firms and bolstering market confidence by requiring companies to address these 
deficiencies.
