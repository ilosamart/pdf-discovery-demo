unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in May, has been interpreted by many as 

suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.  

However, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is 

not directly observable and thus must be estimated.  I believe the range of plausible 

estimates extends to 4 percent or below.  For example, in the Summary of Economic 

Projections submitted in conjunction with the June meeting of the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC), the range of estimates for the longer-run normal unemployment rate 

is 3.6 to 4.5 percent.8 

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a 

pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working 

years.9  These increases in prime-age participation have provided employers with a 

source of additional labor input and have been one factor restraining inflationary 

pressures.  As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to 

increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain. 

The strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that 

have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.  For example, African 

Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than 

whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as 

the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to
