Rule-based regimes on issues of capital and liquidity--even on scope--are inevitably 

crude and imperfect.  And to be effective, these rules would need to reduce systemic risks 

meaningfully.  Still, this regime strikes me as superior to one in which our financial firms are 

micromanaged as quasi-public utilities, subject to the changing preferences of Washington and 

immunized from real competition.  The U.S. economy runs grave risks if we slouch toward a 

quasi-public utility model. 

I worry that some systemically significant firms may end up willing to accept new, 

permanent government masters and supplementary public purposes in order to protect their 

status.  Apportioning economic rents to appease the official sector may appear rational to some 

firms.  But, it is destructive to the financial and economic system overall.  We should not want 

clients of the state at the core of our financial system.  We do not want some new social contract 

between government and large banks.  Now more than ever, we need more private firms 

competing to serve client needs and make markets. 

Conclusion 

The standing of market-oriented principles is being severely tested.  Our policy response 

must be worthy of this challenge, and so should necessarily be broader in scope than some new 

team of financial regulators with new powers.  We need a new financial architecture, one in 

which improved regulation and supervision play an important but co-extensive role with greater 

market discipline.  The new architecture must stoke competition, allow failure, and reward 

innovation and success.  The new architecture should establish the rules of the game without 

micromanaging the affairs of private firms.  And the new architecture should not give perpetual 

license to select, incumbent firms to dominate the financial landscape.  For in the new regime, no 

firm should be too big to fail.
