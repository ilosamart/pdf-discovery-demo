including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent 

inflation target.)  This decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that 

persistently deviates--up or down--from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of 

ways.  Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort 

trying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more 

frequently than would otherwise be necessary.  More importantly, high inflation also 

tends to raise the after-tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment.  

These adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of 

our tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6 

Persistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for 

households that rely on pensions, annuities, and long-term bonds to provide a significant 

portion of their retirement income.  Because the income provided by these assets is 

typically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly 

quickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with 

potentially serious consequences for retirees’ standard of living as they age.7  

                                                 
Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of 
employment is something that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 
dynamics of the labor market.  Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate 
of unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change 
over time, and can only be estimated imprecisely.  As a result, views vary about what labor market 
conditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization.   
6 For a general survey of the costs of high inflation, see Briault (1995).  English (1999) discusses costs 
associated with an increased need for cash management.  For a discussion of costs that arise through 
interactions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999).  
Finally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the 
magnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their 
prices; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new-Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and 
Sbordone (2014).   
7 More broadly, if inflation evolves in an unpredictable manner over many years, then even financially 
sophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their 
attendant costs.  Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other 
entity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or 
decreases in inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit.
