The Federal Reserve has not been alone in implementing unconventional 

monetary policies.  The Bank of England has also engaged in substantial asset purchases 

and recently introduced explicit forward guidance for its policy rate.  The Bank of Japan, 

a pioneer in the use of unconventional policy, has recently embarked on an ambitious 

asset purchase program to combat deflation.  And the European Central Bank (ECB) 

substantially extended its liquidity provision by offering unlimited longer-term 

refinancing operations.  The ECB also purchased some securities in distressed markets, 

and recently indicated that it expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period. 

Thus, since the end of the crisis, central banks in the advanced economies have adopted 

similar policies to promote recovery and price stability. 

While a great deal of attention has focused on unconventional policy actions, 

especially asset purchases, these policies appear to affect financial conditions and the real 

economy in much the same way as conventional interest rate policy.  Indeed, recent 

research suggests that adjustments in policy rates and unconventional policies have 

similar cross-border effects on asset prices and economic outcomes.4  If that is so, then 

the overall stance of policy accommodation matters more here than the particular form of 

easing.  Moreover, neither conventional nor unconventional monetary policy actions are 

shocks that come out of the blue.  Instead, they are the policies undertaken by central 

banks to offset the adverse shocks that have restrained our economies.   Thus, any 

spillovers from monetary policy actions must be evaluated against the consequences of 

failing to respond to these adverse shocks. 

                                                 
4 See Glick and Leduc (2013), IMF (2013a), Moore and others (2013), Rosa (2012), and Wu and Xia 
(2013).  Recent research by Federal Reserve Board staff finds that reductions in U.S. interest rates for any 
reason--whether caused by monetary policy or other factors--have typically been associated with declines 
in EME interest rates and appreciation of EME currencies.  Moore and others (2013) document a similar 
historical relationship.
