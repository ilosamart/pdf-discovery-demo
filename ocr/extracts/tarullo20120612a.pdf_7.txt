Many money funds sustained significant capital losses when the market for asset-backed 

commercial paper collapsed in the summer and fall of 2007.  As in previous decades, losses at 

money funds were absorbed by the funds’ sponsors.  Indeed, money funds were seen as highly 

safe in 2007 and received large net inflows as concerns about other portions of the financial 

system increased.     

But when, in 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund did not provide support for the relatively 

small losses at its money market fund, the illusion that money funds were effectively as safe as 

insured bank accounts was shattered.  A general run on money funds ensued.  Within two days, 

investors withdrew nearly $200 billion from prime money market funds, about 10 percent of 

their assets.  This contributed to severe funding pressures for issuers of commercial paper.  The 

run ultimately prompted—and was stopped by—unprecedented interventions by the Treasury 

and the Federal Reserve to provide insurance and liquidity support to the industry. 

A second example is the triparty repo market, which had grown to about $2.8 trillion of 

outstanding financing by early 2007.  In general, a repo, or ―repurchase agreement,‖ is the sale of 

a security with an agreement to repurchase the security at a later date; the economics of repos are 

similar to that of short-term loans collateralized by longer-term assets.  So-called triparty repos, 

typically used by broker-dealers to raise financing from cash-rich institutions such as money 

market funds, insurance companies, and some central banks, utilizes a particular settlement 

mechanism.  The third party in this triparty market is a clearing bank, which handles settlement 

through accounts held at that institution by the broker-dealers who are cash borrowers and the
