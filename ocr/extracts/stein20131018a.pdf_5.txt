financial crises unfold over months or even years, and the choices made during this in-

between period can be among the most crucial to the eventual outcome. 

 Recall that problems with subprime mortgages were already surfacing in late 

2006.  The first serious tremors associated with the crisis were felt in August 2007, with 

BNP Paribas suspending redemptions on its money funds and investor runs on multiple 

asset-backed commercial paper programs.  At this point, there was no longer any real 

doubt about the nature of the shock confronting us—even if its precise magnitude was yet 

to be determined.  And yet it was more than a full year until the failure of Lehman 

Brothers in September of 2008, which ignited the most intense part of the crisis.  

Moreover, during the interval from the start of 2007 through the third quarter of 2008, the 

largest U.S. financial firms—which, collectively, would go on to charge off $375 billion 

of loans over the next 12 quarters—paid out almost $125 billion in cash to their 

shareholders via common dividends and share repurchases, while raising only $41 billion 

in new common equity.  This all happened while there was a clear and growing market 

awareness of the solvency challenges they were facing.  Indeed, the collective market cap 

of these firms fell by approximately 50 percent from the start of 2007 through the end of 

June 2008.  

There are two points here worth emphasizing.  First, it seems indisputable that the 

severity of the crisis would have been mitigated if policymakers had clamped down on 

these payouts earlier, and had compelled substantial new equity raises.  Second, the 

conflict between the interests of the firms, acting on behalf of their shareholders, and 

those of the broader public became particularly acute once the crisis got underway, 

because of the debt overhang problem.  Cutting back on dividends and issuing new shares
