In theory, as is done in credit risk modeling to calculate capital needs, one could multiply 

PD by LGD to yield a single “systemic financial risk” number for both the status quo and the 

post-acquisition firm, in order to determine – or at least create a presumption of – which outcome 

is preferable from a financial stability perspective.  This would be the financial stability 

equivalent of the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) in antitrust.34  But we are still in the 

relatively early stages of exploring the utility of different approaches to measuring both these 

variables, and we do not have a single well-established metric for either variable today.  As 

already noted in my discussion of systemic risk surcharges, the quantification of a “systemic loss 

given default” seems particularly challenging. 

A second issue is time contingency.  Consider an acquisition that, in calm times, seems 

pretty clearly to increase the systemic footprint of an already large, interconnected acquiring 

institution without having a material positive effect on the resilience of that firm during a stress 

period.  That starkly stated circumstance would seem a prototypical case in which a conclusion 

of an adverse effect on financial stability would be reached.  But now suppose that the target firm 

is already under substantial pressure in an increasingly stressed financial environment and that 

the potential acquirer appears relatively strong.  A case could be made that allowing the 

acquisition in that circumstance would support financial stability by relieving funding and other 

counterparty pressures, and forestalling distressed asset sales and other problematic 

developments.  Continuing my comparison to antitrust law, this outcome would be an analogue 

to a failing firm defense.  

 Of course, this was precisely the rationale in 2008 for the government not only 

permitting, but encouraging, JP Morgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, 

Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch and, to some degree, Wells Fargo’s acquisition
