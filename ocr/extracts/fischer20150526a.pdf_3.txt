In a progressively integrating world economy and financial system, a central bank 

cannot ignore developments beyond its country’s borders, and the Fed is no exception.  

This is true even though the Fed’s statutory objectives are defined as specific goals for 

the U.S. economy.  In particular, the Federal Reserve’s objectives are given by its dual 

mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and our policy 

decisions are targeted to achieve these dual objectives.3  Hence, at first blush, it may 

seem that there is little need for Fed policymakers to pay attention to developments 

outside the United States.   

But such an inference would be incorrect. The state of the U.S. economy is 

significantly affected by the state of the world economy.  A wide range of foreign shocks 

affect U.S. domestic spending, production, prices, and financial conditions.  To anticipate 

how these shocks affect the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve devotes significant 

resources to monitoring developments in foreign economies, including emerging market 

economies (EMEs), which account for an increasingly important share of global growth.  

The most recent available data show 47 percent of total U.S. exports going to EME 

destinations.  And of course, actions taken by the Federal Reserve influence economic 

conditions abroad.4  Because these international effects in turn spill back on the evolution 

of the U.S. economy, we cannot make sensible monetary policy choices without taking 

them into account.  

                                                 
3 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has judged that 2 percent inflation in the price of personal 
consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory 
mandate.  For more information, see Federal Open Market Committee (2014).  The Fed also has separate 
responsibilities for promoting financial stability (some of which are spelled out in the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010) that are, in many respects, complementary to the dual 
mandate.  See Yellen (2014) for further discussion.

(2015).
