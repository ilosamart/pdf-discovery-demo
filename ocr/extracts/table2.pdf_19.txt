Questions 10-11 ask about commercial real estate (CRE) loans at your bank, including construction and land 
development loans and loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate. Question 10 deals with changes in 
your bank's standards over the past three months. Question 11 deals with changes in demand. If your bank's 
lending standards or terms have not changed over the relevant period, please report them as unchanged even if 
they are either restrictive or accommodative relative to longer-term norms. If your bank's standards or terms 
have tightened or eased over the relevant period, please so report them regardless of how they stand relative to 
longer-term norms. Also, please report changes in enforcement of existing standards as changes in standards. 

10. Over the past three months, how have your bank's credit standards for approving applications for CRE loans 
changed?  

11. Apart from normal seasonal variation, how has demand for CRE loans changed over the past three months?
