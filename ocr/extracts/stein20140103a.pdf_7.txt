mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)--which collectively accounted for 57.7 percent of 

securities holdings in 2012.  Also important is the “Other” category, which includes 

corporate and municipal bonds, as well as asset-backed securities, and which accounted 

for 29.3 percent of holdings in 2012.   

This composition of banks’ securities portfolio is not what you would expect if 

they were simply holding securities as a highly liquid buffer against, say, unexpected 

deposit outflows or commitment drawdowns.  It also appears--superficially, at least--at 

odds with the narrow-banking premise that one can profitably exploit a deposit franchise 

simply by taking deposits and parking them in Treasury bills.  Rather, it looks as if banks 

are purposefully taking on some mix of duration, credit, and prepayment exposure in 

order to earn a spread relative to Treasury bills.  And indeed, over the period from 1984 

to 2012, the average spread on banks’ securities portfolio relative to bills was 1.73 

percent.   

By contrast, over this same period, we estimate that if banks had raised deposits 

and invested them exclusively in three-month Treasury bills, they would have earned an 

average net return of only 0.06 percent of deposits.  This figure is based on three 

components.  First, the spread between the rate earned on bills and that paid on deposits 

averaged 0.87 percent over the sample period.  Second, there was additional noninterest 

income on deposits (for example, overdraft fees) of 0.49 percent of deposits.  Third, 

however, deposit-taking involves considerable bricks-and-mortar costs.  Using Call 

Report data on banks’ total costs, and a hedonic regression approach to infer the portion 

of cost that is due to deposit-taking, we estimate this piece to have averaged 1.30 percent
