of output from potential has narrowed, supply-side considerations such as the level and 

growth rate of potential output naturally begin to matter more for policy.  I will turn now 

to a discussion of these issues.  

The tension between labor market and spending data is not a recent phenomenon.  

Throughout the recovery period, forecasters have consistently overestimated both actual 

and potential GDP growth while underestimating the rate of job creation and the pace of 

decline of the unemployment rate (table 1).  For example, in 2007, the average 

expectation for long-run GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 

2.9 percent (table 2).  After successive reductions, the estimate now stands at 2.1 percent.  

Blue Chip forecasters also underestimated the decline in the unemployment rate.  Other 

well-known forecasts followed this same pattern, including those of the Congressional 

Budget Office, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and, yes, FOMC participants.  The 

pattern suggests that forecasters have only gradually taken on board the decline in 

potential in the wake of the financial crisis. 

Output growth can be decomposed into increases in hours worked and changes in 

output per hour, or productivity growth.  For the United States, much of the post-crisis 

decline in estimates of potential output growth appears to reflect weak labor productivity 

growth rather than damage to labor supply.  Labor productivity has increased only 

1/2 percent per year since 2010--the slowest five-year growth rate since World War II 

and about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 2).  For further perspective, 

productivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent during the so-called slow productivity period 

from 1974 to 1995 and 3 percent during the tech-boom decade from 1995 to 2005.  The 

slowdown has been worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by
