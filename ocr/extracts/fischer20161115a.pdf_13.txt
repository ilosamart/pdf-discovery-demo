i Update December 21, 2016:  The original version of this speech, referring to figure 5, 

stated that “In addition, mutual funds that offer daily redemption rights hold a greater 

share of bonds than investors who buy and hold. As shown in figure 5, the share of 

investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds held at mutual funds (the solid blue 

area) has hovered around 25 to 30 percent in recent years, up from about 15 percent 

before the crisis.”  The figure shows assets under management by corporate bond mutual 

funds, not such funds’ holdings of corporate bonds, relative to outstanding corporate 

bonds.  The text has been revised to correctly describe the figure.
