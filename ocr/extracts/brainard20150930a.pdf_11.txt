Risks and Opportunities 

Across the Federal Reserve System, we are actively following developments in 

the alternative online lending space and have engaged with several alternative online 

lenders over the past few years to learn more about the industry, the technology, and the 

business models as well as engaging with bankers to understand how these developments 

are affecting their markets.19  Most recently, several alternative lenders have participated 

in events where we have joined with community development finance experts to discuss 

ways to adopt platform lending technology to better serve low- and moderate-income 

borrowers and small business owners.20   

We want to better understand the opportunities presented by technological 

advances that may bring new data to bear and help lenders make available credit to a 

                                                 
18 For example, in June 2015, Lending Club and the Opportunity Fund, a California-based CDFI 

microenterprise lender, announced a partnership intended to provide $10 million in loans over a period of 

five months to 400 small businesses in underserved areas of California (for more information, see  

www.opportunityfund.org/media/blog/clinton-announces-partnership-between-opportunity-fund-and-

lending-club).  In 2012, the Association for Enterprise Opportunities (AEO) launched the TILT Forward 

platform, an online lending platform that is powered by OnDeck’s technology and can be used by AEO’s 

network of nonprofit community lenders and other community-based organizations to reach underserved 

entrepreneurs (more information is available at www.tiltforward.com).

Business Credit Innovations.” and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco will be hosting the 

Consumer Financial Services Revolution in November 2015. 
20 For example, in March 2014, the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San Francisco 

convened a small group of thought leaders for a discussion on the challenges and opportunities presented 

by crowdfunding investments as a significant source of capital for the community development industry; 

and in March 2015, we cohosted the Financial Innovations Roundtable with the University of New 

Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy and brought together representatives from banks, CDFIs, 

mission-driven lenders, and small business online alternative lenders to talk about opportunities for 

collaboration, the challenges of scaling up small business lending, and potential consumer and safety and 

soundness regulatory issues facing partnerships between regulated financial institutions and alternative 

online lenders. As the sector grows and evolves, we will continue to monitor the development of online 

alternative lenders and the risks and opportunities that they may have for a range of stakeholders.
