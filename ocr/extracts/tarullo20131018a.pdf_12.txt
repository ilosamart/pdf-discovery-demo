debt to absorb additional losses and to recapitalize the business transferred to the bridge 

operating company.  The presence of this debt explicitly identified for possible bail-in on a “gone 

concern” basis should help other creditors clarify their positions in the orderly liquidation 

process.  A requirement for long-term debt could also have the benefit of improving market 

discipline, since holders of that debt would know they faced the prospect of loss should the firm 

enter resolution and would presumably demand an appropriate risk premium. 

 The Federal Reserve, in consultation with the FDIC, will be issuing in the next few 

months a proposal that would require the largest, most complex banking firms to hold minimum 

amounts of long-term, unsecured debt at the holding company level.  This requirement will have 

the effect of preventing erosion of the current long-term debt holdings of the largest, most 

complex U.S. firms, which, by historical standards, are currently at fairly high levels.  Absent a 

minimum requirement of this sort, one could expect declines in these levels as the quite flat yield 

curve of recent years steepens; indeed, we have recently seen some evidence of the beginnings of 

such declines.  At the international level, the FSB has recently announced that it will be issuing 

proposals for global standards on gone-concern loss absorbency for global systemically 

important financial institutions.8   

The single-point-of-entry approach will also be facilitated by the presence of a sufficient 

amount of assets of the right types at the SIFI parent to enable the recapitalization of its material 

operating subsidiaries when losses have eroded the capital of the subsidiaries.  The write-down 

of equity and the imposition of haircuts on parent holding company debt in Title II does not by 

itself recapitalize the operating subsidiaries.  Moreover, foreign operations of a SIFI are more 

likely to be ring-fenced or wound down separately under the insolvency laws of their host
