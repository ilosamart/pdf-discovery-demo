In addition to a slower pace of innovation, it is also likely that demographic 

changes will weigh on U.S. economic growth in the years ahead, as they have in the 

recent past.  In particular, a rising fraction of the population is entering retirement.  

According to some estimates, the effects of this population aging will trim about 

1/4 percentage point from labor force growth in coming years.6   

Lower trend increases in productivity and slower labor force growth imply lower 

overall economic growth in the years ahead.  This view is consistent with the most recent 

Summary of Economic Projections of the FOMC, in which the median value for the rate 

of growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the longer run is just 1-3/4 percent, 

compared with an average growth rate from 1990 to 2005 of around 3 percent.7 

We can use simulations of the FRB/US model to infer the consequences of such a 

slowdown in longer-run GDP growth for the equilibrium federal funds rate.  Those 

simulations suggest that the slowdown to the 1-3/4 percent pace anticipated in the 

Summary of Economic Projections would eventually trim about 120 basis points from the 

longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate.8   

Let me move now to the second major development on my list.  In addition to its 

effects on labor force growth, the aging of the population is likely to boost aggregate 

household saving.  This increase is because the ranks of those approaching retirement in 

the United States (and in other advanced economies) are growing, and that group 

typically has above-average saving rates.9  One recent study by Federal Reserve
