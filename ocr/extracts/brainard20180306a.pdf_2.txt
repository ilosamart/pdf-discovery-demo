I appreciate the invitation from the Money Marketeers to discuss the path ahead for 

our economy and monetary policy.1 

Many of the forces that acted as headwinds to U.S. growth and weighed on policy 

in previous years are generating tailwinds currently.  Today many economies around the 

world are experiencing synchronized growth, in contrast to the 2015–16 period when 

important foreign economies experienced adverse shocks and anemic demand.  The 

International Monetary Fund revised up its outlook for the world economy in January, 

continuing a recent pattern of upward revisions, in contrast to a string of downward 

revisions in 2015 and 2016.2  Stronger economies abroad should increase demand for 

America’s exports and boost the foreign earnings of U.S. companies. 

The upward revisions to the foreign economic outlook are also pulling forward 

expectations of monetary policy tightening abroad and contributing to an appreciation of 

foreign currencies and increases in U.S. import prices.  By contrast, foreign currencies 

weakened in the earlier period, pushing the dollar higher and U.S. import prices lower.  

Since the end of 2016, a broad index of the exchange value of the dollar has depreciated 

nearly 8 percent, whereas it appreciated by 25 percent from mid-2014 to 2016.   

In recent quarters, the combination of higher oil prices and robust global demand 

has been providing strong support to business investment--in contrast to the sharp pullback 

from 2015 to 2016.  Business spending on fixed investment rose at more than a 6 percent
