operations of private dollar funding markets had become impaired.  The Bank of Koreaâ€™s 

efforts were complemented by substantial fiscal stimulus put in place by the Korean 

government. 

This suite of policy responses helped stabilize Korean financial markets and 

promote a swift recovery of economic activity.  The equity market bottomed in late 2008 

and has since then retraced much of its losses.  Real GDP, which contracted at a 

remarkable 17 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 as international trade 

collapsed, has rebounded decisively. 

 It is interesting that, just a few years ago, strong countercyclical policy actions of 

the type taken by Korea would not have been recommended for an emerging market 

country during a period of crisis, and might not even have been feasible.  In earlier crises, 

foreign investors were not inclined to give emerging market policymakers the benefit of 

the doubt when they promised low inflation and sustainable fiscal policies.  Attempts to 

support economic activity through conventional expansionary policies thus risked a 

vicious circle of capital flight, exchange rate depreciation, higher inflation, a worsening 

balance of payments, and more capital flight.  As a result, monetary policymakers in 

emerging markets often reacted to crises--such as the Asian financial crisis of the late 

1990s--by raising rather than lowering policy rates, in order to defend the value of the 

currency, slow capital flight, and bolster the credibility of monetary policy.  Likewise, the 

scope for fiscal expansion was severely limited by concerns about medium-term fiscal 

sustainability.   

Why was this crisis different?  In particular, why was the Bank of Korea able to 

respond in a countercyclical manner this time, reducing rather than raising the policy rate
