5-1/4 percent in mid-2007, was subsequently reduced to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the 

end of 2008, and that target range has been maintained since then. 

Given the magnitude of the financial crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve

operations have been employed to put downward pressure on interest rates; lower interest 

rates, in turn, reduce the costs of borrowing for households and businesses and also boost 

household wealth, thereby providing economic stimulus. 

In my judgment, our deployment of unconventional policy tools has been

of information and analysis in reaching its decisions.  That said, even in normal times, 

uncertainty is intrinsic to real-world monetary policymaking.  Uncertainty about the 

effects of policy is particularly relevant under current circumstances where the scope for
