complete liquidity; through market-making, by which dealers provide liquidity to investors in 

various instruments; or through other forms of intermediation.2   

Precisely because financial intermediaries provide these liquidity services, they are 

subject to funding strains when customers or counterparties become uncertain of the value of the 

loans, securities, or other assets held by the intermediaries.  Where those assets are opaque—as 

can be the case, for example, with a portfolio of conventional loans or with securities backed by 

many loans bundled together from various originators—the incentive  to withdraw funding 

increases, particularly in periods of stress when the value of broadly held asset classes may be at 

risk of precipitous decline.   

This familiar dynamic is obviously a potential problem for the intermediary.  It becomes 

a problem for society when one or both of two things follow:  First, as in the classic case of bank 

runs, problems at one bank lead depositors or counterparties at other banks to withdraw their 

own funds, fearing that their own banks may have similar difficulties repaying them because 

they hold similar assets.  Or, second, the liquidity squeeze leads a sizeable financial firm to 

engage in a fire sale of its assets in order to raise the funds necessary to compensate for the 

disruption of its normal funding channels.  Dumping a sizeable book of assets on the market, in 

turn, can lead to the adverse feedback loop observed during the crisis: Downward pressure is 

placed on similar assets held by others, thereby accelerating margin calls on leveraged actors and 

amplifying mark-to-market losses for all holders of the assets, thereby prompting fire sales by 

others.  In either or both of these eventualities, the potential insolvency of the financial firm is a 

problem not just for shareholders, employees, and creditors, but for the financial system as a 

whole. 

                                                 
2 The long-standing special resolution powers of the FDIC for insured depository institutions, on which Title II was 
in part modeled, themselves reflect some relevant peculiarities of banking, and financial markets more generally, 
compared to other industries.
