they could continue serving as viable financial intermediaries.  So the focus on resiliency 

was initially a matter of necessity. 

But there is also logic to making the resiliency of the largest firms the most 

important part of our ongoing macroprudential regulatory agenda.  Just as a 

microprudential approach to regulation has come to emphasize building up capital 

because it makes the individual firm better able to absorb losses from any source, 

including unpredictable ones, so an appropriately refocused set of macroprudential 

capital requirements can help make the financial system better able to withstand shocks 

from unanticipated, as well as familiar, sources.  As mentioned by Andrew Crockett, a 

macroprudential perspective suggests two ways in which resiliency should be 

strengthened: the first is to treat the financial system as a whole as the “portfolio” of 

assets subject to safety and soundness oversight; the second is to apply stricter 

regulations on firms of systemic importance whose failure would carry a good chance of 

endangering the entire system.  In the last four years, we have developed both kinds of 

measures to increase resiliency.  

Following our use of stress tests of the nation’s 19 largest bank holding 

companies in the midst of the crisis, Congress included in the Dodd-Frank Act a 

requirement of annual supervisory stress tests for a larger group of firms: all those with 

greater than $50 billion in assets.  These stress tests, and an associated supervisory review 

of the capital processes and practices of the covered firms, have in just a few years 

become a core part of the oversight of these large firms. 

Our stress testing program is one form of the first type of macroprudential 

resiliency measure.  It also provides a good example of how sound microprudential
