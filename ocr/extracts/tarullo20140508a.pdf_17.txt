Conclusion 

 In practical terms, the unitary approach to banking regulation has been supplanted by 

various statutory, regulatory, and supervisory responses to the financial crisis.  In particular, the 

aim of protecting financial stability has figured prominently in those responses, though a broader 

macroprudential aim can be detected as well.  I have tried today to suggest that an explicit effort 

to specify relevant aims as they pertain to different kinds of banking organizations can provide a 

basis for rationalizing applicable regulatory frameworksâ€”sometimes by paring back or 

foregoing regulation for certain kinds of firms, and sometimes by adding a regulatory measure 

where the relevant aim has not been adequately promoted by existing measures. 

 By design and necessity, I have offered only a handful of illustrations as to how this 

perspective might lead to certain regulatory changes.  I look forward to debate on the merits of 

these, and other, possible implications of a more precise specification of prudential regulatory 

aims.  I also look forward to seeing new editions of banking law casebooks that differentiate 

regulatory measures with an eye to these multiple aims and their differential application to 

various banking organizations.
