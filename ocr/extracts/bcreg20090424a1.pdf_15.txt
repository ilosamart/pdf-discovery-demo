Commercial and Industrial Loans 

Analysis of C&I loan loss projections was based on the distribution of exposures by industry and 

by internal rating provided by the firms. In many cases, these ratings were mapped to default 

probabilities by the f i rm; in other cases, this association was established by supervisory analysts. This 

information was confirmed and supplemented by external measures of risk, such as expected default 

frequencies from third party vendors. Supervisors evaluated f i rm loss estimates using a Monte Carlo 

simulation that projected a distribution of losses by examining potential dispersion around central 

probabilities of default. The approach produced a consistently-prepared set of loss estimations across 

all the BHCs by combining firm-specific exposure and rating information with standardized assumptions 

of the performance of similar exposures. The results of this analysis were compared to the f irms' 

submissions and adjustments made to ensure consistency across BHCs. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

For commercial real estate (CRE) loans, firms were asked to submit detailed portfolio 

information on property type, loan to value (LTV) ratios, debt service coverage ratios (DSCR), geography, 

and loan maturities. The supervisors analyzed loans for construction and land development, mult i-

family property, and non-farm non-residential projects separately. The supervisors employed common 

industry vendor models, and developed proprietary models, to generate independent loss estimates for 

each portfolio. Specifically, for loans maturing in 2009 to 2010, the supervisors constructed a model that 

compared current LTV ratios to benchmark LTVs in order to assess the probability that borrowers would 

be able to refinance their exposure. For loans maturing beyond 2010, the team used vendor models 

that incorporate factors such as property type, LTV, DSCR, and geographic market factors. For 

construction loans, the geography and nature of the project received special attention. The resulting 

loss estimates were compared with the firms' submissions. 

Other Loans 

This category is highly heterogeneous, including farmland lending, loans to depository 

institutions, loans to governments, and other categories. For most categories of other loans, a firm's 

loss record over the past five years was used to provide a relative ranking, and to assess the firm's 

submission. 

Securities in AFS and HTM Portfolios 

The majority of securities in the AFS and HTM portfolios are Treasury securities, government 

agency securities, sovereign debt, and high-grade municipal securities. Private-sector securities include 

corporate bonds, equities, asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and 

non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). About 15 percent of the portfolio is non-

agency RMBS or CMBS. Supervisors focused their efforts on evaluating the private-sector securities 

portfolio for possible impairment, obtaining details of each security, such as collateral type, vintage, 

metropolitan area, and property type, as well as elements of each security's structure, such as credit 

ratings, current credit support, and carrying and market values. Each security was tested to determine if 

the security would become impaired during its lifetime. Loss estimates were based on an examination 

of more than 100,000 securities identified by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification 

Procedures, or CUSIP. For each securitized asset, credit loss rates on underlying collateral, consistent 

with those loss rates used for unsecuritized accrual loan portfolios, were weighed against current credit
