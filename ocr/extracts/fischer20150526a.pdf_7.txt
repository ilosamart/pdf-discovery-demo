Earlier studies of the international effects of conventional U.S. monetary policy--

namely, changes in the policy rate--have also found significant spillovers to asset prices 

in other countries.14  Studies that have compared the spillovers of monetary policy across 

conventional and unconventional measures generally conclude that the effects on global 

financial markets are roughly similar.15  

Given the relatively fast recovery of many EMEs from the crisis, post-crisis 

monetary accommodation in the United States and other advanced economies created 

policy challenges for many EMEs.16  If they resisted currency appreciation pressures by 

lowering their policy rates, they risked overstimulating domestic demand, exacerbating 

financial excesses, and overheating their economies.  If, instead, they reduced their policy 

rates less than the United States had done while intervening to resist currency 

appreciation, capital inflows could have increased further, thus partially offsetting their 

attempts to stabilize their economies.  And, if they allowed currency appreciation 

pressures to pass through to their full extent, this could threaten their recoveries by 

hurting exports.  In the event, EMEs tried to make the best of a difficult set of tradeoffs 

by allowing some exchange rate appreciation, partially reducing their interest rates, and 

in some countries also using capital controls.

15  Among studies of spillovers from conventional versus unconventional U.S. monetary policy, Rogers, 
Scotti, and Wright (2014) report no significant differences in relative announcement effects on advanced 
foreign economy asset prices and Treasury yields; Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014) find similar 
EME asset price responses; Takáts and Vela (2014) report mixed results for EMEs, with a weaker post-
2007 relationship in levels of EME policy rates with U.S. rates but a stronger post-2008 relationship in 
levels of five-year yields; and Glick and Leduc (2013) also report similar spillovers to exchange rates.  The 
effects of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program on corporate bond yields and sterling 
exchange rates are similar to predictions from a model estimated over an earlier period by Joyce, Lasaosa, 
Stevens, and Tong (2011).
