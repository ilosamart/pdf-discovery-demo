not implausible outcome in which the U.S. economy experiences a serious recession 

simultaneously with a significant contraction of global economic activity and a global financial 

shock.  Thus, the assumed increase in unemployment is similar to that experienced in the three 

deep post–World War II recessions.  It is because current unemployment stands so much higher 

today than it did at the outset of those recessions that it is assumed to rise to a postwar high.   

 More fundamentally, the severity of the recession reflects two considerations.  First, as I 

have already suggested, a core rationale for stress testing is the macroprudential goal of ensuring 

that the nation’s financial system could continue to operate even in the face of severely adverse 

developments.  It is precisely an outcome fairly far out on the tail at which a stress test should be 

directed.  A more probable scenario, with a milder downturn, would not serve that purpose.  

Second, presumably reflecting this logic, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that we include a 

“severely adverse” scenario.  Accordingly, as we fully implement the Dodd-Frank requirement 

beginning next year, this level of severity will in any case be required by law. 

 As one might expect from the severity of the adverse scenario, the losses projected by our 

models for the 19 firms were quite high.  Total losses amounted to about $650 billion, of which 

$535 billion was due directly to declines in balance sheet asset values.  The remaining $115 

billion was accounted for by additional items run directly through net revenue estimates, such as 

expenses from mortgage putbacks.  The portfolio losses would be very high by historical 

standards.  For example, the $340 billion in loan losses included in the total loss figure translates 

into a loss rate of about 7.2 percent, which compares to about a 5.4 percent loss rate in the peak 

eight quarters of losses during the financial crisis and is a higher rate than has been experienced 

at any point in the last century except during the Great Depression.  Similarly, pre-provision net 

revenue was projected to be equal to only about 2.5 percent of average assets, an historically low
