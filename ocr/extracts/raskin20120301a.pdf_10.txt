For instance, they need to be prepared for unexpected expenses and to rebuild the 

retirement nest eggs that were depleted by losses in equity and housing wealth during the 

recession.  In fact, the portion of disposable income that households are saving has risen 

considerably since the recession began.  Moreover, it is important to remember that the 

way that households’ savings get channeled into productive capacity is that businesses 

have to be willing to use those funds to invest in expanding their plants and starting new 

businesses.  Raising interest rates now would dampen those incentives.  Thus, at the 

moment, channeling households’ savings into the productive resources that will support 

our longer-term economic growth prospects requires low interest rates, not higher ones.       

Conclusion 

In summary, the length of time required for the economy to fully recover given 

the extraordinary strains of the past few years is difficult to predict.  I believe that the 

policy record in recent years clearly demonstrates the Federal Reserve’s commitment to 

act as appropriate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The highly 

accommodative monetary policy now in place is intended to provide the support needed 

to strengthen the economic expansion and, over time, return the economy to sustainable 

rates of output growth, unemployment, and inflation.  While the Federal Reserve 

recognizes that the accommodative policy we have put in place to support the economic 

recovery may limit the financial returns to saving for a time, ultimately our goal is an 

economy that is operating close to its potential and is producing jobs, income, and 

opportunities for investment that will lead to higher returns across a range of assets for 

savers and investors.   

Thank you.
