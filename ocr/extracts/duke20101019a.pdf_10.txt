Projections 

 To understand policy, it is important to understand policymakers’ views of the economy.  

In the early years of the Committee, it was hard for the public to know, in any numerical way, 

what FOMC participants were thinking about the outlook for growth, unemployment, or 

inflation.  Starting about 30 years ago, though, bank presidents and Board members began 

submitting twice-a-year economic forecasts for a year or two ahead that were published and 

available to the public.  In November 2007, the Committee made a major change in its projection 

practices.  The change had two important dimensions:  The projections window was extended to 

three years, and the frequency of projections was doubled from two times a year to four times a 

year.  Then, a little over a year later, the Committee participants began making projections for 

key variables over the “long run” as indicators of their views on the steady state of the economy. 

Because of the press coverage that the quarterly economic projections often garner, it is 

likely that most observers are somewhat familiar with this development.  Now, I’d like to talk 

about the evolution of the post-FOMC statement and the minutes of the FOMC meetings.  Both 

of these documents are obviously closely watched, but I’d like to highlight here how they 

developed into their current forms. 

Statements 

 Anyone who reads the newspaper has probably read some report based on the statement 

the FOMC releases after each meeting.3

  Reporters, investors, and others track changes to the 

statements word-by-word.  If I start with a little background on how the Committee’s focus on 

the statement has developed, I trust that you’ll come to see that the market’s focus on the 

statement is not entirely unfounded.
