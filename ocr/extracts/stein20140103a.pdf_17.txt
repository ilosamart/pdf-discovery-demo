1984 to 2012.  And of course, these costs ultimately represent an endogenous decision--

banks could always choose to offer their customers fewer and less attractive branch 

locations, fewer opportunities for interacting with a human teller, and so forth.  One view 

is that these amenities are simply a separable flow of services to depositors, conceptually 

analogous to interest income.  However, an interesting alternative is that they represent a 

deliberate effort to build loyalty--that is, to create a form of switching costs.  To the 

extent that other elements of their business model are also devoted to creating and 

exploiting deposit stickiness, it may make more sense for banks to make complementary 

investments of this sort in enhancing customer loyalty.  By contrast, a money market fund 

complex--which also takes deposits, but which invests exclusively in short-term assets--

has less reason to spend as heavily on a branch network. 

Conclusion 

Let me summarize.  The creation of private money--that is, safe claims that are 

useful for transactions purposes--is obviously central to what banks do.  But safe claims 

can be manufactured from risky collateral in different ways, and banks are not the only 

type of intermediary that engages in this activity.  What makes banks unique is that they 

use a particular combination of financial and institutional arrangements--including 

capital, deposit insurance, and access to a lender of last resort--as well as substantial 

investments in bricks and mortar, to create liabilities that are not only safe and money-

like, but also relatively stable and thus unlikely to run at the first sign of trouble.  This is 

in contrast to shadow banks, who create money-like claims more cheaply, by relying on 

an early exit option, and who are therefore more vulnerable to runs and the 

accompanying fire-sale risk.
