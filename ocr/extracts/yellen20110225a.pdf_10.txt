2010 FOMC meeting, most Committee participants expressed a preference for 

renormalizing the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over a 

period of about five years that would commence following the initiation of policy 

firming. 

Figure 6 shows the results of simulations of the FRB/US model to gauge the 

effect of these asset purchases on the unemployment rate and core personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) inflation.  For this purpose, the baseline path (denoted by the dashed 

line in each panel) is constructed using historical data in conjunction with the latest set of 

consensus projections from the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  Then the staff model is used to simulate the 

counterfactual scenario in which the FOMC never conducts any asset purchases (denoted 

by the solid line in each panel).7  The pace of recovery under the baseline scenario is 

expected to be painfully slow.  But the counterfactual scenario suggests that conditions 

would have been even worse in the absence of the Federal Reserve’s securities purchases:  

The unemployment rate would have remained persistently above 10 percent, and core 

inflation would have fallen below zero this year.  Of course, considerable uncertainty 

surrounds those estimates, but they nonetheless suggest that the benefits of the asset 

purchase programs probably have been sizeable.   

My final observation concerning the FOMC’s asset purchase program pertains to 

the importance of clear and effective communications in the years ahead.  As I noted 

earlier, both theory and empirical evidence suggest that market prices and yields at any 

particular time reflect both the Federal Reserve’s current securities holdings and also 

                                                 
7 Because the latest release of the Survey of Professional Forecasters provided forecasts of the 
unemployment rate only through 2014, the authors extrapolated the forecasts through 2018 using the 
extended consensus forecasts reported in the October 2010 Blue Chip survey.
