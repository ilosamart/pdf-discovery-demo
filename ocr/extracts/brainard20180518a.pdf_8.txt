primarily to enhance the customer experience.  In the middle of the spectrum, regional and 

national banking organizations are using online and mobile app capabilities to attract and retain 

customers well beyond their physical footprint.  At the other end of the spectrum, online banks 

employ business models that reach customers across much or all of America without relying on 

branches.  Although these online banks may provide the same retail products and services as a 

traditional bank with a branch network, because they have only one location, they are evaluated 

for CRA purposes in the area around that location, rather than in the many areas where they have 

customers.    

Still other banks offer a limited set of credit products or wholesale services. Take, for 

instance, the example of Industrial Loan Companies (ILCs), which have CRA obligations as 

state-chartered insured depository institutions.  ILCs are owned by corporations rather than bank 

holding companies and are typically chartered to provide credit cards or other forms of financing 

related to their parent companyâ€™s business.  Many large ILCs are chartered in Utah and are 

evaluated on their CRA performance in Salt Lake City, even though they lend nationally.  The 

result is a saturated market for community development lending and investment in Salt Lake 

City.  At the same time, other areas in Utah and beyond have important community development 

opportunities that may go unmet.  At a minimum, revised CRA regulations should allow banks 

with this type of business model to expand CRA activities beyond the area surrounding its 

branch so that the community and economic development needs of more underserved 

communities can be met.  

Branches are important vehicles for reaching small business customers and low-income 

consumers, but they are not the only way.  In considering ways to revise the CRA regulations,
