Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond also identified transportation for 

low-income workers across the country as an important barrier to income stability.  The 

Richmond Bank found that higher-paying jobs tend to be located on the outer fringes of 

metropolitan areas, at a distance from many people seeking jobs.  Moreover, many of the jobs in 

growth sectors, such as health care and technology, tend to have varying shifts, which makes 

using public transportation difficult.   The Richmond Bank co-hosted an event, Cars and 

Working Families, to build support for the concept that car ownership has become a necessity 

rather than a privilege for working people.  The event highlighted some of the barriers to auto 

ownership among lower-income workers, including the cost of insurance, mandatory driving 

classes that are primarily taught in English, and significant license fees.  Since then, the 

Richmond Bank has undertaken an initiative to focus community organizations, community 

development foundations, and the financial industry on the importance of car ownership to a 

personâ€™s ability to hold a job that pays a living wage.   

As you can see, the Federal Reserve is not only working to improve the national 

economic outlook, but it is also engaged in some very local initiatives designed to identify and 

address barriers to employment for those most impacted by recent job losses.  We are committed 

to continue lending our research and outreach resources to assist in these and other promising 

community economic development initiatives.  

Conclusion 

 In conclusion, I commend the work that you do in communities across the country.  

Having been involved in several economic development initiatives as a community banker, I 

know how complicated it is to build vision and consensus among local stakeholders.  While 

current economic circumstances are challenging, the work you do has never been more important
