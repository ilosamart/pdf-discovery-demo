Iâ€™m grateful to the organizers for inviting me to participate in this conference.  I 

would like briefly to describe the legal frameworks that exist for resolving banking 

organizations in the United States, the steps that the Federal Reserve and other U.S. 

regulators have taken to make global systemically important banking organizations 

(GSIBs) in the United States more resolvable, and a few of the criticisms of U.S. 

regulatory actions in this area, together with my responses to them.1 

U.S. law provides several legal frameworks for resolving failed financial firms.  

In the United States, a failed depository institution is resolved by the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation (FDIC) using a framework created by the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Act.  The FDIC has acted as receiver for several thousand failed banks since 

1934, including 465 from 2008 through 2012.  Most of these failed banks were relatively 

small community banks, and all were considerably smaller than the most systemically 

important firms active today.2 

While the Federal Deposit Insurance Act creates a special resolution framework 

for failed banks, a failed U.S. bank holding company--that is, a corporate entity that 

controls one or more banks--would generally be resolved under the same provisions of 

the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as would apply to other corporate debtors, such as industrial 

firms, in a proceeding overseen by a federal judge.  During the recent crisis, fears about 

the systemic consequences that would follow from the bankruptcies of systemically 

important financial firms motivated extraordinary government actions to prevent such

Board for their assistance in the preparation of these comments. 
2 The average (per bank) assets of the 465 banks resolved by the FDIC between 2008 and 2012 was roughly 
$1.5 billion, with a total of $680.3 billion. The largest depository institution ever resolved by the FDIC was 
Washington Mutual, which was resolved in 2008 and had total assets of $307 billion prior to failure.
