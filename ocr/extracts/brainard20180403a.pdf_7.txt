macroprudential in design so that banks internalize the costs of undertaking activities that 

pose risks to the system.  

The core of the framework is the requirement of a substantial stack of common 

equity to build resilience against shocks and to provide an incentive for prudent risk 

management.  Regulatory capital ratios for the largest banking firms at the core of the 

system have about doubled since 2007 and are currently at their highest levels in the post-

crisis era.  U.S. firms have substantially increased their capital since the first round of 

stress tests led by the Federal Reserve in 2009. The common equity capital ratio--which 

compares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets--of the bank holding companies 

participating in the 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review has more than 

doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12 percent in the fourth quarter of 

2017. Their leverage ratios--defined as Tier 1 capital to total assets--increased from 7.3 

percent to 8.6 percent over the same period.6 There has also been an important shift in 

the distribution of high-quality capital so that the average ratio of high-quality common 

equity to risk-weighted assets at the largest banks now exceeds the average for smaller 

banks.  The larger and more complex banking organizations are now holding more 

capital, commensurate with the greater risks their distress could pose.  

Reduced vulnerability associated with liquidity and maturity transformation 

similarly is due importantly to key financial reforms instituted since the crisis.  Large 

financial institutions are required to maintain substantial buffers of high-quality liquid 

assets (HQLA) calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in stressed 

6 These statistics are for the 18 bank holding companies that participated in both the 2009 and 2017 stress 
tests. The risk-based capital statistics for 2009 report tier 1 common equity, and for 2017 report Basel III 
common equity tier 1.
