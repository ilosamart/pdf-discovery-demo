For all of these reasons, I hope that researchers will strive to improve our 

understanding of inflation dynamics and its interactions with monetary policy.

Before closing, let me mention one additional area where more study is needed--

the effects of changes in U.S. monetary policy on financial and economic conditions in 

the rest of the world and the ways in which those foreign effects can feed back to 

influence conditions here at home.  Of course, cross-country monetary policy spillovers 

have been the subject of scholarly debate since the Great Depression, and much of the 

formal analysis of this topic dates back to the early 1960s.25  But this issue has received 

renewed interest with the advent of unconventional monetary policies after the Great 

Recession and, more recently, the divergence of monetary policies among major 

advanced-economy central banks.   

Broadly speaking, monetary policy actions in one country spill over to other 

economies through three main channels:  changes in exchange rates; changes in domestic 

demand, which alter the economyâ€™s imports; and changes in domestic financial 

conditions--such as interest rates and asset prices--that, through portfolio balance and 

other channels, affect financial conditions abroad.  Research by Federal Reserve staff 

suggests that, all told, U.S. monetary policy spillovers to other economies are positive--

that is, policies designed to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy also boost activity 

abroad, as negative effects of dollar depreciation are offset by positive effects of higher 

U.S. imports and easier foreign financial conditions.26  However, this issue is far from

Kimura, Sudo, and Ugai (2013); Georgiadis (2015); Glick and Leduc (2015); and Ilzetski and Jin (2013).
