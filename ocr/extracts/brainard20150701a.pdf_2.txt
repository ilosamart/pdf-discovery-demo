Recent events and commentary raise concerns about a possible deterioration in 

liquidity at times of market stress, particularly in fixed income markets.1  These concerns 

are highlighted by several episodes of unusually large intraday price movements that are 

difficult to ascribe to any particular news event, which suggest a deterioration in the 

resilience of market liquidity.  For example, on the morning of October 15, 2014, 10-year 

U.S. Treasury yields gyrated wildly, and the intraday movement in Treasury prices was 

6 standard deviations above the mean.  In addition, after 4 p.m. on March 18 EDT of this 

year, a meeting day for the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. dollar depreciated 

against the euro by 1.75 percent in less than three minutes, an unusually large drop in 

such a short interval.  A few weeks later, markets experienced some very large intraday 

movements in the price of German bunds during times of little market news.   

In contrast, there have been a few notable episodes where market volatility was 

clearly attributable to significant news but nonetheless appeared to evidence some 

deterioration in the resilience of liquidity.  For example, on January 15 of this year, the 

announcement by the Swiss National Bank regarding the floor of the exchange rate 

between the euro and the Swiss franc led to severe disruptions in foreign exchange 

markets.  Separately, the rise in bond yields in May and June 2013, the so-called taper 

tantrum, also appeared to many observers to have been out of proportion to the news that 

prompted it.2
