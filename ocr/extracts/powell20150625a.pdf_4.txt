payments task force as they identify effective approaches for implementing faster 

payment capabilities.  The secure payments task force also will advise the Fed on 

payment security matters, and determine areas of focus and priorities for future action to 

advance payment system safety, security, and resiliency. 

I am pleased to report that we are off to a great start in the months since the 

“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System” paper was released.  More than 300 

participants from a range of stakeholders signed up to be part of the faster payments task 

force, and more than 200 joined the secure payments task force.  These task forces have 

chosen, or are in the process of choosing, members to serve on their respective steering 

committees, which will help guide the task forces’ efforts. 

Earlier this month, the faster payments steering committee met to begin 

developing timelines, processes, and criteria--including criteria related to security--that 

will be used to evaluate potential approaches to improving the speed of the payment 

system. Last week, the full task force met to continue the work.   I am told that they had a 

great meeting--everyone was interested, engaged, and eager to get to work.  The secure 

payments task force conducted its first organizing call earlier this month and, in mid-July, 

its steering committee will meet for the first time.  Momentum is growing.  By the end of 

next year, the plan is for the faster payments task force, with input from the secure 

payments task force, to have laid out its detailed thinking on the most effective 

approaches for implementing faster payments in the United States.  Then, it will be up to 

the industry to implement these approaches.
