scarcity problem with respect to bank equity--both A and B can always make more.  By 

contrast, the total supply of HQLA is closer to being fixed at any point in time.16 

Policy Implications 

What does all of this imply for policy design?  First, at a broad philosophical 

level, the recognition that liquidity regulation involves more uncertainty about costs than 

capital regulation suggests that even a policymaker with a very strict attitude toward 

capital might find it sensible to be somewhat more moderate and flexible with respect to 

liquidity.  This point is reinforced by the observation that when an institution is short of 

capital and canâ€™t get more on the private market, there is really no backup plan, short of 

resolution.  By contrast, as I mentioned earlier, when an institution is short of liquidity, 

policymakers do have a backup plan in the form of the LOLR facility.  One does not want 

to rely too much on that backup plan, but its presence should nevertheless factor into the 

design of liquidity regulation. 

Second, in the spirit of flexibility, while a price-based mechanism such as the 

CLF may not be immediately necessary in countries outside of Australia and a few 

others, it is worth keeping an open mind about the more widespread use of CLF-like 

mechanisms.  If a scarcity of HQLA-eligible assets turns out to be more of a problem 

than we expect, something along those lines has the potential to be a useful safety valve, 

as it puts a cap on the cost of liquidity regulation.  Such a safety valve would have a 

direct economic benefit, in the sense of preventing the burden of regulation from getting 

unduly heavy in any one country. 

                                                 
16 This is not to say that banks cannot adjust on other margins if HQLA is in unexpectedly short supply.  
For example, they can do less liquidity provision, by terming out their funding or by extending fewer credit 
lines.  This is like the power plant doing more conservation and less mitigation:  It reduces the upward 
pressure on the price of scrubbers (or HQLA), at the cost of cutting back on a set of services that 
presumably has some social value.
