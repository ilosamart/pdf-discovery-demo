policy response.  The FOMC is determined to ensure that we never again repeat the 

experience of the late 1960s and 1970s, when the Federal Reserve did not respond 

forcefully enough to rising inflation and allowed longer-term inflation expectations to 

drift upward.  Consequently, we are paying close attention to the evolution of inflation 

and inflation expectations.  

Sources of the Recent Rise in Commodity Prices 

 Let me now turn to a discussion of the sources of the recent increase in 

commodity prices.  In my view, the run-up in the prices of crude oil, food, and other 

commodities weâ€™ve seen over the past year can best be explained by the fundamentals of 

global supply and demand rather than by the stance of U.S. monetary policy.   

 In particular, a rapid pace of expansion of the emerging market economies 

(EMEs), which played a major role in driving up commodity prices from 2002 to 2008, 

appears to be the key factor driving the more recent run-up as well.  Although real 

activity in the EMEs slowed appreciably immediately following the financial crisis, those 

economies resumed expanding briskly by the middle of 2009 after global financial 

conditions began improving, with China--which has accounted for roughly half of global 

growth in oil consumption over the past decade--again leading the way.  By contrast, 

demand for commodities by the United States and other developed economies has grown 

very slowly; for example, in 2010 overall U.S. consumption of crude oil was lower in 

than in 1999 even though U.S. real gross domestic output (GDP) has risen more than 20 

percent since then.  On the supply side, heightened concerns about oil production in the 

Middle East and North Africa have recently put significant upward pressure on oil prices,
