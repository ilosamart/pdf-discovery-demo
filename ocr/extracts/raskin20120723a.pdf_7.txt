The Role of Regulation 

New regulation may not always be popular, but, when crafted appropriately, it can 

effectively alter the actions of those financial institutions that follow low-road business models.  

Given that the recent crisis in the financial system contributed to a sharp downturn in the 

economy that had broad effects, including the loss of millions of jobs, we have seen how all 

Americans are on the hook for financial institutions’ decisions.  The relationship between 

financial markets and the public compels decisionmakers to correct the adverse incentives and 

moral hazards created by low-road business models. 

In my view, though, the regulation of low-road banking models is not without cost.  

Indeed, some banking models are so complicated that they cannot be regulated without the 

expenditure of significant public or private dollars.  When these business models have such a 

distant connection to meaningful financial intermediation, I believe that we as a society may very 

well want to rethink whether we want to support these business models at all.  The costs of 

supporting them, simply put, may be prohibitive.   

Indeed, there may not be worthwhile regulatory approaches to all problems, even where 

the benefits of an activity outweigh the costs to regulate it.  For example, when considering the 

“cost-to-regulate” perspective, some regulatory structures consist of rules that are based solely 

on metrics.  While such rules may have the advantage of being less costly and easier to 

implement than a more subjective rule, as a regulator, I have to ask whether a metric-based rule 

will foster the development of internal controls, processes, and cultures that are capable of 

correcting the problems embedded in a low-road business model.  Metrics-based oversight 

regimes do not work well in correcting misaligned incentives if the metrics in the regime can be
