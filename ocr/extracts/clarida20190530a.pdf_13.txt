coming years.  Furthermore, the shifts in r* and u*, as well as the flattening of the 

Phillips curve that I discussed earlier, suggest that the U.S. and foreign economies have 

evolved in significant ways relative to the pre-crisis experience. 

The Federal Reserve System is currently conducting “town hall”-style Fed Listens 

events, in which we are hearing from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, 

including business and labor leaders, community development advocates, and 

academics.  In addition, we are holding a System research conference next week at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that will feature speakers and panelists from outside 

the Fed.  Building on both the perspectives we hear and staff analysis, the FOMC will 

conduct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning around the 

middle of the year.  We will share our conclusions with the public in the first half 

of 2020. 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to prejudge or predict our 

ultimate findings.  What I can say is that any refinements or more-material changes to our 

framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to achieve 

and sustain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.  

Thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.
