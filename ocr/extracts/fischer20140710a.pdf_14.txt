After reviewing the structure of the FSOC, Kohn presents a series of suggestions 

to strengthen its powers and its independence.  The first is that every regulatory 

institution represented in the FSOC should have the goal of financial stability added to its 

mandate.  His final suggestion is, “Give the more independent FSOC tools it can use 

more expeditiously to address systemic risks.” 23  He does not go so far as to suggest the 

FSOC be empowered to instruct regulators to implement measures somehow decided 

upon by the FSOC, but he does want to extend its ability to make recommendations on a 

regular basis, perhaps on an expedited “comply-or-explain” basis.  

Kohn remarks that he does not hold up the U.K. structure of macroprudential 

supervision as ideal for all countries at all times and further notes that the U.K. system 

vests a great deal of authority in a single institution, the Bank of England.  This element 

is not consistent with the U.S. approach of dispersing power among competing 

institutions.   

These are important, and difficult, issues.  Kohn’s proposals clearly warrant 

serious examination.  It may well be that adding a financial stability mandate to the 

overall mandates of all financial regulatory bodies, and perhaps other changes that would 

give more authority to a reformed FSOC, would contribute to increasing financial and 

economic stability.   

Financial Reform and TBTF 

Diagnoses of what went wrong with the financial system at the start of the Great 

Recession in the United States generally placed heavy emphasis on the problem of too 

big to fail.  The TBTF problem derives from the typical response of governments 

23 The FSOC would become more independent as a result of implementing Kohn’s suggestions.
