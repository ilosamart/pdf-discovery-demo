if, in the future, a mortgage-credit fueled house price bubble were to reemerge, the 

banking regulators could perhaps impose higher risk weights on mortgage loans with 

certain characteristics either directly or through expectations around stress testing.8  This 

approach would be slow, perhaps requiring upwards of a year to adjust, and narrow in its 

scope of application, and it may prove ineffective at times when bank regulatory capital 

comfortably exceeds the required thresholds.  

Third pillar:  Working across the regulatory perimeter 

In some cases, foreign central banks acted in concert with other financial 

authorities to address the buildup of risk in their housing sectors.  In the American 

context, the Federal Reserve’s work is embedded in a larger web of efforts by other 

financial authorities.  In parallel to the Federal Reserve’s own efforts to formalize its 

financial stability surveillance and policy making, the network of independent financial 

agencies is enhancing cooperation through the formal structure and responsibilities of the 

FSOC as well as through joint rulemakings and joint supervisory efforts.9   

It is vitally important that the bank and market regulators actively work to share 

assessments of risks across the financial system and to develop joint macroprudential 

efforts to address risks that stretch across regulatory perimeters.  Realistically, however, 

8 The Federal Reserve Board and five other federal agencies approved risk-retention rules in October 2014 
designed to ensure that securitization sponsors have an incentive to monitor and ensure the quality of the 
securitized assets underlying a securitization transaction.  Sponsors of securities collateralized solely by 
“qualified residential mortgages,” or QRMs, as defined by the agencies, are not required to hold credit risk 
in their securitizations.  The QRM definition rests, in part, on the debt service-to-income of the mortgage 
borrower, but it does not include loan-to-value ratios.  The agencies have committed to review the QRM 
definition at five-year intervals, or earlier at the request of any agency, in order to ensure that the definition 
remains appropriate as mortgage and securitization market conditions and practices change.  Altering the 
QRM definition more frequently would likely be cumbersome and time-consuming.

international standard-setting bodies under the umbrella of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).
