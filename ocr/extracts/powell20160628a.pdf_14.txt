burdensome and may have contributed to the secular decline in job and worker

 Dynamism is a fast-developing field of research, and it will be important that 

public policy react appropriately as this work continues.  It goes without saying that 

economic policymakers should use all available information and tools to create a 

supportive environment for growth.  We need policies that support labor force 

participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and 

productivity growth.  For the most part, these policies are outside the remit of the Federal 

Reserve, but monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable 

expansion, in a context of price stability.  

Conclusion 

How should we think about the performance of our economy since the Crisis?  

The picture is mixed, and that question will no doubt be debated in the decades ahead.  

But here are some facts.  Since 2011, job growth has been stronger and unemployment 

has declined faster than most forecasts.  On the other hand, economic growth has been 

consistently lower than almost all private- and public-sector forecasts, including those of 

FOMC participants.  Growth has been slower in this recovery than in many previous 

recoveries; a growing body of research shows that weak recoveries are the norm after 

deep recessions and those associated with severe financial crises.  Finally, our recovery 

has also been stronger than those of many other advanced economies following this 

crisis.
