Financial stability is integral to achieving the Federal Reserveâ€™s objectives of full 

employment and price stability.  We need only look back a decade to see the dramatic 

damage from financial vulnerabilities that increase unchecked:  Millions of Americans 

lost their livelihoods and their homes, business losses and failures rose, and the 

government had to provide extraordinary support to the system.  Since then, financial 

sector resilience has strengthened, and household balance sheets have been repaired over 

the course of a lengthy recovery.  Today employment is strong, inflation is around target, 

and incomes are growing.1

vulnerabilities may be building.  That is why the Federal Reserve actively monitors the 

potential vulnerabilities to the financial system.  Last week, for the first time, we released 

our assessment in the Financial Stability Report.2  Today I will offer a brief summary of 

the outlook, highlight areas where I see financial imbalances building, and touch on the 

implications for policy.
