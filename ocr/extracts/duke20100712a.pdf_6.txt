workouts;2 and, most recently, restated supervisory views on lending to small 

businesses.3  

At the Federal Reserve, we have complemented the guidance with training 

programs for examiners and outreach to the banking industry that underscores the 

importance of sound lending practices.  In January, Federal Reserve staff instituted a 

Systemwide examiner training initiative that is reaching Federal Reserve and state 

examiners all across the United States.  In addition, in May more than 1,400 bankers and 

state bank commissioners from across the country participated in an “Ask the Fed” 

conference call to discuss CRE-related issues, such as credit workouts and troubled debt 

restructurings.  The session was an effective way to help clarify the guidance and allowed 

us to hear more about concerns of people in the industry.       

But we are not finished. The Federal Reserve is also working to develop better 

ways to measure the effectiveness of the lending guidance we have issued.  After all, if 

these sorts of issuances don’t work, we need to know that so we can figure out a better 

way to get our messages across.  For example, before issuing the CRE guidance last year, 

Federal Reserve staff surveyed examiners to gain a better understanding of the banks’ 

workout practices.  That information is serving as a baseline for assessing the impact of 

the supervisory guidance.  We are asking examiners to capture, where possible, 

information on troubled debt restructurings and other types of loan workouts and 

dispositions as part of the ongoing examination process.  We are also exploring the
