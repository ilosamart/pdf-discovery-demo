firms and activities in a highly connected financial system.  Within the Federal Reserve, a 

tangible manifestation of this macroprudential approach is the LISCC—the Large 

Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee—that was created specifically to

institutions.6 

Other changes to the banking system in the United States include tighter than 

Basel III capital and liquidity requirements, heightened prudential standards for the 

largest banking firms, and stress tests.  Accounting standards and prudential regulations 

have also been changed to require banks to recognize their links to nonbank entities, such 

as direct connections or provision of back-up support.  Heightened prudential standards 

require the largest and most interconnected banks to meet capital surcharges and stricter 

risk-management standards than other banks.  Stress tests evaluate banks’ ability to 

remain solvent and liquid when under severe macroeconomic stresses and have 

incentivized better risk-management and information systems within banks.   

A variety of reforms have helped address risks in the nonbank sector as well.  I 

will touch briefly on three of those reforms.  First, the United States has an unusually 

large number of independent financial sector regulatory bodies.  There is accordingly an 

especially great need for efficient cooperation and coordination among the various 

regulators that collectively oversee the financial system.  In response to this need, the 

Dodd Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to help
