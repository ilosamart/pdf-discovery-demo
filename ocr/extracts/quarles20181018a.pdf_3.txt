following an extended period of post-crisis slow growth.  I argued that while it might be 

too soon to call a turning point, there was a definite possibility of an upside surprise.2 

So now that we are fairly deep into 2018, where do we stand overall?  My view 

has not changed all that much from February.  While many other forecasters had to revise 

up their forecasts over the course of the year, my own outlook is basically unchanged, 

because the economy is evolving essentially as I expected at the outset of the year.  The 

economy remains in a good spot.  Gross domestic product increased a robust 

3-1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and indicators suggest continued strong growth 

through the summer.  Economic conditions are as close to meeting the Federal Reserve’s 

dual mandate for monetary policy--maximum sustainable employment and price 

stability--as they have been in a long time.  Inflation is in line with the Committee’s 

2 percent objective, and the unemployment rate is at nearly a 50-year low.      

How long can this strong growth be sustained?  The answer depends largely on 

what form growth takes.  Growth that is supported by increases in the productive capacity 

of the economy should be durable.  However, if growth primarily reflects strong demand 

that stretches production beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy will run into 

constraints that will result in slower growth, higher prices, or a potentially destabilizing 

buildup of financial imbalances.  So, which is it?  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to tell.  

I will return to that question shortly. 

That said, I see many reasons to be optimistic about the growth of the potential 

capacity of the economy over the next few years.  In part, my optimism is rooted in the
