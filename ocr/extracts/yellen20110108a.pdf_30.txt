     Note. The figure displays a scatter plot of quarterly average observations of the unemployment rate (indicated on the horizontal axis) and a measure of vacancies
(indicated on the vertical axis) for the following periods: 1973:Q4 to 1976:Q2; 1979:Q2 to 1983:Q4; 1990:Q1 to 1993:Q3; and 2007:Q1 to 2010:Q4. The measure 
of vacancies is given by an index of help-wanted advertisements divided by the labor force. The 2010:Q4 observation is the average of the October and November 
readings.
