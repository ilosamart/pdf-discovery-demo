In my time at the Fed, I have come to see the range of viewpoints on the FOMC as a 

unique strength of the Committee.  Yet, I have seen numerous reports recently about the different 

views expressed by various FOMC participants, emphasizing the perceived level of discord.  

After reading the descriptions of meetings covering four decades, I have the sense that 

differences of opinion have been quite common throughout the years.  So I would like to share 

three observations I’ve gleaned from participating in discussions covering a period that, I 

believe, has been one of the most difficult times ever faced by the FOMC.  First, the diversity of 

views adds richness to the debate and ensures that we consider numerous possibilities.  Second, 

all the FOMC participants share a deep respect for each other and for the process.  And third, 

Chairman Bernanke has an extraordinary ability to lead us to conclusions that are designed to 

best meet our responsibilities and that are, in the end, supported by most members of the 

Committee.   

My comments today aren’t made in an attempt to focus more attention on our 

communications—it is hard to imagine more attention!  But I do want to highlight just how much 

progress we, as a Committee, have made over the years.  The actions we take are intended to 

have specific effects on the structure of interest rates and the economy.  Some of the impact 

comes from the transactions themselves, but most of the impact comes from expectations of what 

we are going to do.  A shift in monetary policy or, as importantly, a shift in the expectations for 

monetary policy can have a huge impact on financial markets and the economy.  And it is our 

communications that most directly shape expectations.  For this reason, I think it is critically 

important that we use our official communication to be as clear as we can possibly be about our 

assessments of economic conditions, our policy decisions and intentions, our targets, and our 

implementation strategies for nonstandard monetary policy tools.
