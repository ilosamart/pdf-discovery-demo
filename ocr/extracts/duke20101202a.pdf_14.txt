consumer credit and payments landscape in the years ahead will be equally shaped by 

technological innovation. 

Innovative product and system design in the payment card marketplace continues 

to produce new electronic payment products.  For example, a growing number of 

consumers are using prepaid cards.  Preliminary estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank 

of Bostonâ€™s 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice indicate that about one-third of 

consumers sampled reported having a prepaid card of some type. 

Offering functionality similar to credit and debit cards, prepaid cards include a 

variety of products targeted to different groups of customers, from general-purpose 

reloadable cards that may serve as deposit account substitutes for the unbanked or the 

underbanked to more-limited-purpose products, such as gift cards, teen spending cards, or 

mass transit cards.  In addition, as an alternative to checks, employers issue payroll cards 

to employees and numerous government entities make payments and issue benefits on 

cards.  And of course, the idea behind prepaid cards is not limited to being in card form; 

their function also may show up in the form of codes, stickers, cell phones, and chips 

embedded in any number of other devices, with payments transferring across the debit 

card interchange system or automated clearinghouse systems.  Depending on the card 

type, the issuer, the purpose of issuance, the payment collection network, and the form of 

access, payments made using prepaid cards or other devices may be governed by 

different regulations and interchange fee restrictions.  Consumers cannot be expected to 

know these differences.  It will be important for regulators to monitor, over time, the 

effect of differences in regulation and pricing restrictions to ensure that consumers are 

adequately protected regardless of their payment method preferences.
