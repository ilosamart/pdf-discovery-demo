regulation of the largest banking firms can be difficult to distinguish from regulation with 

a macroprudential orientation.  Conventional capital requirements are by their nature 

somewhat backward-looking, reflecting loss expectations based on past experience and 

loss recognition that often occurs well after the likelihood of loss has become clear.  

Rigorous stress testing helps compensate for these shortcomings through a forward-

looking assessment of the losses that would be suffered under stipulated adverse 

economic scenarios, so that capital can be built and maintained at levels high enough for 

the firms to withstand such losses and still remain viable financial intermediaries.  This 

forward-looking aspect of stress testing automatically builds capital, and boosts 

resilience, in the face of weakening loan-underwriting standards because, for any given 

adverse scenario, weaker underwriting standards will imply higher losses.  Also, because 

the firms are stressed simultaneously, supervisors are able to identify and take account of 

correlated exposures and other common risks.

  The firms covered by the Dodd-Frank 

Act supervisory stress tests account for more than 70 percent of U.S. banking sector 

assets, thus approaching Sir Andrewâ€™s standard of a supervisory perspective that 

examines the assets of the financial system as a whole.     

The effectiveness of stress testing as a macroprudential tool depends, of course, 

on how the tests are constructed.  For example, a macroprudential perspective must 

inform the construction of the scenarios against which the assets and revenues of the 

banks are stressed.  Such a perspective argues for incorporating particular risks to the

 It is important to emphasize here, as we do in our annual capital reviews of large banking organizations, 

that our supervisory stress testing of all covered firms simultaneously does not supplant the need for firms 

to develop, and make capital decisions dependent upon, their own stress scenarios that incorporate risks 

more specific to the activities and portfolios of each firm.  That is, the necessary emphasis on 

macroprudential measures at the present time does not obviate the need for solid microprudentially inspired 

measures.
