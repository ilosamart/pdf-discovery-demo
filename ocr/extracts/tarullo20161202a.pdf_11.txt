A second important feature of the post-crisis regulatory regime for large banks has been 

the introduction of quantitative liquidity regulations.  The financial crisis was, in the first 

instance, as much about liquidity as solvency.  What proved in retrospect to be excessive 

liquidity for some types of assets turned into scarcity nearly overnight, confirming the view that 

liquidity is most available when you need it least and least available when you need it most.  The 

period was defined by runs, not on bank deposits (at least not insured bank deposits), but on 

short-term wholesale funding.  Because of deep uncertainty about the condition of counterparties 

and the value of assets serving as collateral, investors refused to roll over existing repurchase 

agreements (or repos) and similar extensions of credit, much less to offer new lending.  Many 

trading activities ground to a near halt, and dealers were forced into fire sales of the assets on 

their balance sheets that remained liquid.  Indeed, it was difficult at times to distinguish between 

liquidity and solvency crises at particular firms. 

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) have placed 

the funding of large banks on a firmer footing.  The LCR requires a large bank to hold enough 

high-quality liquid assets to cover the net cash outflows the bank would expect to occur over a 

30-day stress scenario.  This requirement establishes a buffer against liquidity risk that reduces 

the bank’s vulnerability to a run, such as materialized in the recent crisis.  In the event a bank 

does encounter liquidity difficulties, the LCR’s 30-day buffer will give the authorities time to 

assess the bank’s condition and react as appropriate. 

The NSFR complements the LCR by requiring an amount of stable funding that is 

tailored to the liquidity risk of a bank’s assets and liabilities, based on a one-year time horizon.  

The NSFR creates an incentive for banks to extend the maturity of their funding, making them 

more resilient to market stress.  To offset the risks of the short-term wholesale funding structures
