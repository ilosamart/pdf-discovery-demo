  This incredible growth in 

securitization and derivatives markets reflects a significant increase in the number, types, 

and complexity of network connections in the financial system.    

Financial economists have long stressed the benefits of interactions among 

financial intermediaries, and there is little doubt that some degree of interconnectedness 

is vital to the functioning of our financial system.  Economists take a well-reasoned and 

dim view of autarky as the path to growth and stability.  Banks and other financial 

intermediaries channel capital from savers, who often have short-term liquidity demands, 

into productive investments that typically require stable, long-term funding.  Financial 

intermediaries work with one another because no single institution can hope to access the 

full range of available capital and investment opportunities in our complex economy.  

Connections among market actors also facilitate risk sharing, which can help minimize 

(though not eliminate) the uncertainty faced by individual agents.  Yet experience--most 

importantly, our recent financial crisis--as well as a growing body of academic research 

suggests that interconnections among financial intermediaries are not an unalloyed good.  

Complex interactions among market actors may serve to amplify existing market 

frictions, information asymmetries, or other externalities.  The difficult task before 

market participants, policymakers, and regulators with systemic risk responsibilities such 

as the Federal Reserve is to find ways to preserve the benefits of interconnectedness in 

financial markets while managing the potentially harmful side effects.  Indeed, new 

regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection

 A CDS is a derivative contract in which one party, the protection “seller,” agrees to insure another party, 

the protection “buyer,” from default on an underlying bond or index of bonds in exchange for a fee.  

Notional amounts do not reflect the economic exposure in these markets, which is a small fraction of the 

notional value, but the growth noted here is indicative of the growth in exposure.  See Bank for 

International Settlements (2012b).
