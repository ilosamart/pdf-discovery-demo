But it also looks like the economic gains of the past few years are finally raising 

living standards for most people.  Median household income grew and poverty fell 

significantly in 2015, although these measures were still lagging their levels from before 

the recession.2  An improving economy may be especially important for you, as new 

graduates.  Those who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are 

more likely to find employment, remain employed, and enjoy persistently higher 

earnings.3 

The second reason for optimism is that you have already done the one thing that 

research shows is most important to a successful and stable working life:  earning the 

degrees you will receive today.  Economists are not certain about many things.  But we 

are quite certain that a college diploma or an advanced degree is a key to economic 

success.  Those with a college degree are more likely to find a job, keep a job, have 

higher job satisfaction, and earn a higher salary.  The advantage in earnings is large.  

College gradsâ€™ annual earnings last year were, on average, 70 percent higher than those 

with only a high school diploma.  Back in 1980, the difference was only 20 percent.  The 

gap in earnings is significant only a few years after graduation--almost $18,000 a year, 

according to some recent data.  Beyond these advantages, research also shows that a 

college or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier, and longer life.4  

One explanation for the greater advantage in recent decades conferred by higher 

education is that it reflects an increase in the demand for educated workers compared
