this example to illustrate how the specification of aims and the progressive stringency of section 

165 could be usefully combined. 

 Largest institutions.  Specifying prudential regulatory aims in the context of community 

and middle-range banks suggests a rationalization that could possibly eliminate certain 

requirements as they apply to some of these banks.  In the case of the LISCC institutions, 

however, I believe there are additional requirements needed to implement prudential aims 

associated with financial stability.  These include capital surcharges and minimum amounts of 

“gone concern” loss absorbing capacity, among others.  Most important is continued work on the 

vulnerabilities posed by short-term wholesale funding and, more generally, by large trading 

books, including maturity matched books of securities financing transactions.  The regulatory 

response to these vulnerabilities will likely require some combination of measures directed at 

capital, liquidity requirements, and resolution procedures.  There is also a need for a 

complementary set of measures such as minimum margining requirements applicable to all 

securities financing transactions, whether or not they involve systemically important firms. 

But there are some opportunities for rationalization even with respect to regulation of the 

larger institutions.  While necessary new rules will now be applied to these institutions, vestiges 

of the pre-crisis regulatory approach that did not rest on well-specified regulatory aims are still in 

place and might sensibly be modified or removed.  Most prominent in this regard is the Basel II 

IRB approach for risk-weighted capital requirements.  The IRB approach, which generally 

applies in the United States to all bank holding companies with $250 billion or more in assets, 

was developed a decade ago in an effort to align risk weightings more closely to the increasingly 

sophisticated quantitative risk-assessment techniques in the financial industry.
