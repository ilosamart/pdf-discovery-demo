their supervisors, we do not want our examiners to take an overly mechanistic approach to 

evaluating small business lending.   

 The Federal Reserve has directed examiners to be mindful of the effects of excessive 

credit tightening on the broader economy.  As a general matter, we do not expect examiners to 

adversely classify loans based solely on a decline in collateral value where, for example, the 

borrower has stable revenue streams and thus the ability to repay the loan.  We have 

implemented training for examiners and outreach to the banking industry to underscore this 

expectation.  We are aware that bankers, as well as examiners, may become overly conservative 

in an attempt to ameliorate past weaknesses in lending practices, and are working to emphasize 

that it is in all parties’ best interests to continue making loans to creditworthy borrowers.   

The most recent guidance is the latest in a series of actions taken by the Federal Reserve 

and the other banking agencies to support sound bank lending and the credit intermediation 

process.  In an effort to encourage prudent CRE loan workouts, the Federal Reserve led the 

development of interagency guidance issued in October 2009 regarding CRE loan restructurings 

and workouts.4  That policy statement provides guidance for examiners and for financial 

institutions who are working with CRE borrowers experiencing diminished operating cash flows, 

depreciated collateral values, or prolonged delays in selling or renting commercial properties, 

particularly as the loans on those properties mature and need to be refinanced.  The statement is 

especially relevant to small businesses because owner-occupied CRE often serves as collateral 

for small business loans.   

Prudent loan workouts are in the best interest of both financial institutions and borrowers, 

particularly during difficult economic conditions.  Accordingly, the CRE policy statement details
