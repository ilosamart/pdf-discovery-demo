revolution; after all, computing speeds and memory have increased many times over in 

the 30-plus years since the first personal computers came on the market, and fields like 

biotechnology are also advancing rapidly.  Moreover, even as the basic technologies 

improve, the commercial applications of these technologies have arguably thus far only 

scratched the surface.  Consider, for example, the potential for IT and biotechnology to 

improve health care, one of the largest and most important sectors of our economy.  A 

strong case can be made that the modernization of health-care IT systems would lead to 

better-coordinated, more effective, and less costly patient care than we have today, 

including greater responsiveness of medical practice to the latest research findings.4  

Robots, lasers, and other advanced technologies are improving surgical outcomes, and 

artificial intelligence systems are being used to improve diagnoses and chart courses of 

treatment.  Perhaps even more revolutionary is the trend toward so-called personalized 

medicine, which would tailor medical treatments for each patient based on information 

drawn from that individual’s genetic code.  Taken together, such advances could lead to 

another jump in life expectancy and improved health at older ages.   

Other promising areas for the application of new technologies include the 

development of cleaner energy--for example, the harnessing of wind, wave, and solar 

power and the development of electric and hybrid vehicles--as well as potential further 

advances in communications and robotics.  I’m sure that I can’t imagine all of the 

possibilities, but historians of science have commented on our collective tendency to
