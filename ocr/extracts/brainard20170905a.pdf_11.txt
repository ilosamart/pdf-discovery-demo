These estimates suggest that the neutral rate of interest is likely to rise only 

modestly in the medium term.  It is worth remembering, in addition, that the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet policy may be reinforcing this tendency over the next several 

years.  A recent study suggests balance sheet runoff could boost the level of the term 

premium on the 10-year Treasury yield by about 40 basis points over the first few years.15  

Typical rules of thumb suggest that such an increase in term premiums would imply a 

decrease in the short-run neutral rate of interest.   

Although the FOMC expects to begin normalizing its balance sheet relatively 

soon, several foreign central banks are continuing their purchases of longer-term assets in 

their own currencies.16  Because longer-term government securities in the major 

economies are close substitutes, the ongoing balance sheet programs of some foreign 

central banks will likely continue to hold down U.S. longer-term interest rates.  But with 

economies abroad strengthening, it may not be too long before some foreign central 

banks will end their net purchases and, eventually, begin reducing their balance sheets.  

As that happens, the current downward pressure on longer-term interest rates from 

foreign spillovers will abate. 

For these reasons, my current expectation is that the short-run neutral rate of 

interest may not rise much over the medium term.  But this is an open question and bears 

close monitoring.  Of course, it is entirely possible that other factors will be working to 

offset this downward pressure on the equilibrium funds rate--as could be the case, for 

instance, if fiscal stimulus is greater than many observers currently expect.
