balance sheet later this year.  Of course, both decisions will depend on the performance 

of the economy. 

To put this process in context, consider where we have come from.  Ten years 

ago, in the summer of 2007, we were just entering the most painful economic crisis since 

the Great Depression.  The crisis and its aftermath prompted large-scale policy 

interventions by the Federal Reserve and other authorities to avert the collapse of the 

financial system and prevent the economy from spiraling into depression. 

Most of the Federal Reserve’s targeted financial measures--such as liquidity 

facilities to ensure the flow of credit to households and businesses--were withdrawn soon 

after the crisis as orderly conditions resumed in financial markets.  In contrast, the 

FOMC’s easing of monetary policy increased over time as the longer-term economic 

effects of the crisis gradually became clear.  From 2007 through 2013, the FOMC added 

ever greater support for the economy.7  From late 2008, with rates pinned at the zero 

lower bound, the Committee resorted to unconventional policies to put additional 

downward pressure on long-term rates, including strong calendar-based forward guidance 

regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate, and several rounds of large-scale 

asset purchases (often referred to as quantitative easing (QE)).8   

Both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet are currently set at levels 

intended to provide significant support to economic activity.  Normalization of the stance

8 The FOMC’s purchases of longer-term securities (U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt obligations, and 
agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities) reduced the outstanding stock of these securities available 
in the market and therefore tended to put upward pressure on bond prices and downward pressure on their 
yields--specifically, on the term premium component of longer-term interest rates.  This unconventional 
monetary policy was an appropriate means of providing a boost to spending by households and firms 
during a period of economic slack, when our ability to provide accommodation by conventional means was 
limited by the fact that the federal funds rate had reached almost zero.
