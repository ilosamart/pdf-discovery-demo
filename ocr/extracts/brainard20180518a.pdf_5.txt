community’s needs and priorities in the hands of local stakeholders:  financial institutions that 

lend and invest, community organizations that deliver services and develop real estate, and state 

and local governments that direct incentives and subsidies.  The enactment of other laws around 

the same time supported the CRA’s success, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 

which requires lenders to report the location of their home mortgage lending and the race and 

income of borrowers.   

Much has changed in the years since the CRA was enacted, including technology-driven 

changes in the delivery of financial services, and it is high time to consider corresponding 

improvements to the regulations.  Both banks and community organizations have offered a 

variety of suggestions for improving the CRA regulations and their implementation in the last 

several years.  We are undertaking discussions with the Office of the Comptroller of the 

Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with which we have traditionally 

issued joint rulemakings on the CRA.  The Federal Reserve has long been interested in engaging 

in an interagency review of the CRA regulations, so we are pleased to participate in this process.  

In addition, the Treasury Department recently completed an extensive outreach effort related to 

modernizing the CRA regulations.

communities, and I believe the time is ripe for a refresh to make it even more relevant to today’s 

challenges.  There are five principles that can help guide our efforts.

Quercia, Janneke Ratcliffe, and Wei Lei, “Risky Borrowers or Risky Mortgages: Disaggregating Effects Using 
Propensity Score Models,” Journal of Real Estate Research 33 no. 2 (2011): 245–77. Another analysis found 
evidence of a substantial increase in mortgage lending due to the CRA--especially among low-income borrowers--
with no measurable rise in the likelihood of default; see Daniel Ringo, “Mortgage Lending, Default, and the 
Community Reinvestment Act,” June 15, 2017.
