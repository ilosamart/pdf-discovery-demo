Some women may think that they can leave the financial details of their lives to their 

spouses or other family members.  But the hours you have invested in this program demonstrate 

your interest and willingness to take responsibility for your own financial well-being.  In my 

remarks today, I will share some of the basic facts that argue for all women making a similar 

investment in themselves.  I will also debunk some popular myths that persist about women and 

money.  Finally, I will encourage you to embrace the financial freedom that comes from 

participating in the Financially Hers program. 

The Financial Facts about Women 

  I am sure that each of you could tell a story about the experiences that inspired you to 

participate in the Financially Hers education program.  Indeed, facts indicate that most women 

will someday need the knowledge you have already gained.  For example: 

 Women are quite likely to be solely responsible for financial decisionmaking at some 

point in their lives.  Indeed, as women age, the probability of living alone increases. 

o According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for 

women is 81 years, compared to 73 years for men. 

o Census information tells us that the average age of widowhood is 55 years old. 

o The current divorce rate is estimated at between 36 and 50 percent.1   

o Statistics indicate that the earlier in life one marries, the higher the probability of 

divorce.   

o Women are more likely than men to be single parents.2 

 Women have lower average wages, lower lifetime earnings, and are less likely to be 

covered by a pension plan.
