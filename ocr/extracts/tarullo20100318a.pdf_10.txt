whereas the supervisors’ objective in a crisis is to achieve an orderly resolution, which 

will often entail winding down or restructuring the insolvent firm in ways that effectively 

wipe out shareholder interests.  

The living will requirement could be broadened so as to make it into a potentially 

very useful supervisory tool for healthy firms, as well as a resource in the event that 

resolution became necessary.  Under this approach, the firm would, in addition to 

developing a resolution plan, be required to draw up a contingency plan to rescue itself 

short of failure, identify obstacles to an orderly resolution, and show it can quickly 

produce the information needed for the supervisor to orchestrate an orderly resolution 

should the need arise.  These plans will need to evolve as the organization’s business and 

economic conditions evolve, and accordingly, the plans will need to become a regular 

part of normal supervisory processes. 

A living will of this type could remove some of the uncertainty around a possible 

resolution.  It would force firms and their supervisors to review contingency plans 

regularly.  As part of their ongoing oversight, supervisors could target the areas where a 

firm’s planning falls short of best practices.  Focusing on the legal, contractual, and 

business relationships among the firm’s subsidiaries could yield significant benefits for 

prudential supervision in normal, as well as stressed, times. The various elements of the 

regulatory system could thus be better integrated by identifying mechanisms and 

connections for the transmission of risk and liability between affiliates and by identifying 

relationships that may present an obstacle to the ready sales of businesses, the proceeds 

from which might allow the firm to avoid failure.
