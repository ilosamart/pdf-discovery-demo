overreaction to the release of information would still exist, there would be no single 

number on which market participants could focus.  

 A third possibility would be to have supervisors release aggregate results of their 

horizontal, forward-looking assessments, along with details about their assumptions and 

methods, without requiring additional disclosure by firms.  This approach could still 

confer considerable benefits by providing information to the public about the overall 

condition of the banking system as well as about supervisory methods.  It has, in fact, 

been applied by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which conducted a special 

bank inspection in 2002 and 2003, when Japanese banks were still recovering from a 

crisis.  The FSA publicly released aggregate results showing the differences between the 

banks’ and the FSA’s assessments of loan quality, which showed that the FSA’s 

assessments were more stringent than the banks’.  Many of the major banks subsequently 

increased their loan loss reserves, and the inspections appeared to increase confidence in 

the banking system.  Of course, the informational benefit to market participants could be 

substantially diluted if they are unable to distinguish the conditions of individual firms as 

reflected in the aggregate numbers.   

Conclusion  

 To conclude, you should now have a sense of the degree to which our experience 

with SCAP has informed changes in our supervision of large institutions as part of the 

broader enterprise of regulatory reform.  As to the issue of stress test transparency, I look 

forward to hearing how others assess the merits of the alternative approaches I have 

described and, of course, any new ideas.
