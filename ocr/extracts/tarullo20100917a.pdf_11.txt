Boesky (July 2010): “Shadow Banking,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 458. (The report is

Federal Reserve System (2010), “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Alternatives to the Use of 
Credit Ratings in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Banking Agencies,” Joint Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (August 10), www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20100810a1.pdf.
