Conclusion 

     It may not always be the case that the most interesting time to be involved in a regulatory 

area is at its early stages, but I am reasonably certain it applies to the formation of a system for 

the regulation of systemic risk.  From the standpoint of a regulator, the key challenge in these 

early stages is to be neither excessively self-confident about what we know about financial 

stability so as to produce unfortunate unintended consequences, nor excessively tentative so as to 

fail to take steps to counter the very real risks that do exist, in keeping with the aims stated by 

Congress.  As I hope was apparent, that effort at balance informed my suggestions as to how we 

should apply the financial stability factor in our pre-merger reviews under the Bank Holding 

Company Act. 

 Before concluding, I want to make one final reference to antitrust law.  As you know, the 

evolution of antitrust in recent decades was heavily influenced by the work of academics – 

specifically, law professors and industrial organization economists.  That was due in part, I think 

to the practice of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and the Competition Bureau of 

the Federal Trade Commission recruiting so many present and future academics to work in those 

agencies for a few years.  Indeed, quite a few heads of the Antitrust Division and the FTC were 

themselves academics, often law professors.  The result was a cross-pollination of theoretical 

advances and institutionally grounded knowledge that is unusual, if not unique in regulatory 

areas.  While it may be difficult to replicate this pattern in the nascent field of financial stability 

regulation, there is ample room – and need – for some version of this cross-pollination.  Issues 

such as those I have discussed today can only profit from an academic perspective, informed by 

practical and institutional considerations.  Obviously, I am standing this afternoon in front of an
