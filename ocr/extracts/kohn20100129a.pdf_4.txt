losses on market participants exposed to rising bond yields.  By contrast, in the second half of 

2004, long-term rates hardly rose, and in 2005 they actually declined when the Federal Reserve 

tightened monetary policy.  In my view, the decline in long-term rates partly reflected a strong 

demand for dollar-denominated assets, especially from countries running current account 

surpluses, which were, in effect, greatly adding to the global pool of savings seeking higher 

returns.  Extremely low interest rate volatility probably also contributed to investors’ willingness 

to extend duration.  No one knows what will happen to long-term rates over coming years, but 

the Group of 20 leaders have focused on emerging from this recession with better-balanced 

global growth, which suggests that foreign capital could be less plentiful for the United States.  

And volatilities are unlikely to return to their previous quiescent state.  Banks and other investors 

cannot count on a repeat of the most recent experience--the absence of capital losses when short-

term rates rise.   

 In addition, the behavior of intermediate- and longer-term interest rates over coming 

years could well be influenced by a number of unusual elements in the current circumstances.  

Short-term rates have been close to zero for a year and, if the economy follows the trajectory 

expected by the Federal Reserve, are likely to stay there for an “extended period.”  One of the 

purposes of those very low short-term rates is to induce investors to buy longer-term and riskier 

assets than they were buying over the past year, thus reducing borrowing costs for households 

and businesses.  How people will react to increases in expected, and then actual, short-term 

interest rates after such a period is hard to tell.  Moreover, to counter the financial forces 

weighing on the economy, the Federal Reserve purchased large quantities of long-term agency, 

agency mortgage-backed, and Treasury securities, putting significant downward pressure on 

longer-term interest rates.  We are now winding down those purchases.  The effects on rates of 

the cessation of our purchases are likely to be modest, but that judgment is subject to
