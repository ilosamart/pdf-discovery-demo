market indicators.  For example, the agencies could assign risk weights based on one or 
more ratios such as funding (for example, core deposits to total liabilities) and/or credit 
quality (for example, non-performing items to total assets).  This method also could be 
supplemented for banks with publicly traded securities with market-based information 
such as a banking organization’s unsecured bond spreads over comparable Treasury 
securities.   

Question 5: What are the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative 
methods for calculating risk-based capital requirements for bank exposures?   How can 
the agencies ensure consistent and transparent implementation?  Which financial and 
market indicators should the agencies consider?  What are the implications or potential 
for unintended consequences?  Are there other methods for assessing risk-based capital 
for bank exposures in a relatively risk sensitive manner that would meet the principles 
described in section III?  Commenters are asked to provide quantitative as well as 
qualitative support and/or analysis for proposed alternative methods.   

iv. Corporate Exposures 

Under the agencies’ general risk-based capital rules, corporate exposures 
generally26 receive a risk weight of 100 percent,27 whereas under the Basel standardized 
approach, banking organizations would be allowed to use credit ratings to assign risk 
weights to corporate exposures.28  The current market risk rule and the Basel modified 
market risk framework also use credit ratings for corporate exposures.    

One option for risk weighting corporate exposures would be to continue to use the 
treatment provided in the general risk-based capital rules and require banking 
organizations to risk weight all corporate exposures at 100 percent.  Another method 
would be to differentiate the credit risk of corporate exposures based on financial and 
economic measures appropriate to the borrower.  For example, the agencies could allow 
banking organizations to assign risk weights based on balance sheet or cash flow ratios, 
such as current assets to current liabilities, debt to equity, or some form of debt service to 
cash flow ratio (for example, current interest and maturities to current cash flow from 
operations).  Alternatively, some corporate exposures for publicly traded firms could be 
risk weighted on the basis of market-based measures, such as credit spreads, equity-price 
implied default probability, and measures of capital adequacy and liquidity.   

Finally, the agencies could allow banking organizations to assign risk weights 
based upon a more flexible set of objective criteria that the agencies would establish by 
rule.  As a part of their process for making credit-worthiness determinations and 
assigning risk weights, banking organizations would be allowed to consider external data, 
including credit analyses (but not credit ratings) provided by third parties, that met 
standards established by the agencies.

weight.
