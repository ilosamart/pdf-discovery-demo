Responsible REO Management 

In addition to the consideration of conversion strategies at significant scale, there 

are steps that all REO holders can take today to ensure that they are not contributing 

further to the problems.  They can and should make sure that they are adequately 

monitoring any third-party vendors with which they contract to maintain, market, or sell 

REO properties.  Certainly, the recent interagency review of servicers revealed the severe 

consequences that can result from failing to monitor third-party vendors.  Before 

converting REO properties to rental, REO holders could also consider “first look” types 

of programs to enable owner-occupants, public entities, and nonprofits windows of time 

to bid on available properties.  A number of institutions have used such programs with 

successful results.  And REO holders who sell large numbers of properties to investors 

should consider processes, such as those used by the GSEs, to screen and monitor bulk 

investors to reasonably assess their probable actions regarding maintenance and 

disposition after acquiring the properties. 

Low-Value Properties 

So far I’ve talked solely about REO-to-rental as a solution for REO properties.  

But that’s not going to work everywhere.  In particular, some properties are too damaged, 

or otherwise too low-value, to be sold as owner-occupied units or profitably converted to 

rental properties.  In fact, we estimate that about 5 percent of properties in the REO 

inventory of the FHA and the GSEs are appraised at less than $20,000, and in some 

markets the share is significantly higher.  In many of these cases, the cost to repair or 

demolish existing structures exceeds their fair market value, and a different type of 

solution may be needed.
