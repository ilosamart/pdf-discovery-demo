elevated asset valuations, which tend to boost downside risks to the economy.9  It is not hard to 

see why a high-pressure economy might be associated with elevated financial imbalances, 

especially late in the cycle.  As an expansion continues, the memory of the previous recession 

fades.  Profits tend to rise, experienced loss rates on loans are low, and people tend to project 

recent trends into the future, which leads financial market participants and borrowers to become 

overly optimistic.  Risk appetite rises, asset valuations become stretched, and credit is available 

on easier terms and to riskier borrowers than earlier in the cycle when memories of losses were 

still fresh. 

Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy 

heated up, which naturally prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  In turn, the 

interest rate increases would have the collateral effect of damping increases in asset prices and 

risk appetites.  With a flat Phillips curve, inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization 

tightens, and, accordingly, provides less necessity for the Federal Reserve to raise rates to 

restrictive levels.  At the same time, low interest rates along with sustained strong economic 

conditions are conducive to increasing risk appetites prompting reach-for-yield behavior and 

boosting financial excesses late in an expansion.   

With the forces holding down interest rates likely to persist, valuation pressures and risky 

corporate debt, such as leveraged lending, could well remain at elevated levels.  Elevated 

valuations and corporate debt could leave the economy more vulnerable to negative shocks.  The 

market volatility in December is a reminder of how sensitive markets can be to downside 

surprises.
