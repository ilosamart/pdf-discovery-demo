Moreover, we know not only from the fundamentals of finance theory but also from hard 

experience, that while leverage can boost earnings when times are good, leverage can also 

amplify losses.  There is a reason why, despite the evolution of risk-based capital frameworks 

over the years, the leverage ratio has remained a key part of the banking supervision toolbox.  

This was recognized by the U.S. Congress when it passed the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) in 1991.  FDICIA made the leverage ratio one of the 

key elements of the prompt corrective action framework for assigning capital categories to banks 

and taking supervisory action as appropriate and required by law.  As a matter of fact, U.S. 

supervisors felt that a leverage ratio was such an important factor in assessing capital adequacy 

that U.S. negotiators worked to make sure a leverage ratio was included in the Basel III 

framework for global banks, many of which were not subject to explicit leverage requirements.   

For all its strengths, however, a leverage ratio also has significant shortcomings if not set 

appropriately.  While its simplicity may be one of its greatest virtues, simplicity is also one of its 

biggest drawbacks.  Notably, leverage ratios typically only apply to assets held on the balance 

sheet.  This may be fine for institutions that primarily engage in on-balance-sheet deposit-taking 

and lending--like most community banks--but it can fail to capture the risks of banksâ€™ off-

balance-sheet activities, which have grown exponentially over the past several decades.  I 

mentioned previously that leverage tends to amplify losses, and I would suggest that many of the 

losses during the recent financial crisis, particularly at the largest firms, were a result of off-

balance-sheet leverage.   

So, given the various features of a simple leverage-based approach and a more complex 

and imperfect system of risk weighting, what is the right approach for community banks?  The 

right approach should not significantly increase the complexity of capital.  The risk-based capital
