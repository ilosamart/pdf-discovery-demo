Current Assessment 

That was the framework, now for the current assessment:  In the interest of time, 

my main focus will be on the four cyclical vulnerabilities--leverage, borrowing by 

households and non-financial firms, liquidity and maturity transformation, and asset 

valuations--but I will also briefly touch on the most salient structural vulnerabilities.  To 

summarize the assessment, overall, a range of indicators point to vulnerability that is 

moderate when compared with past periods:  Leverage in the financial sector is at 

historically low levels, and, following the reforms of money market mutual fund 

regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last fall, vulnerabilities 

associated with liquidity and maturity transformation appear to have decreased.  

However, the increase in prices of risky assets in most asset markets over the past six 

months points to a notable uptick in risk appetites, although this shift has not yet led to a 

pickup in the pace of borrowing or a sizable rise in leverage at financial institutions. 

Leverage 

To start with, leverage:  Regulatory capital at large banks is now at multidecade 

highs.  The largest banks have already met their fully phased-in capital requirements, 

including the conservation buffer and the capital surcharge for the global systemically 

important banks.  Also, the largest banks have been able to meet the post-stress capital 

requirements in the past couple of stress-test exercises run by the Federal Reserve.  

Measures of earnings strength, such as the return on assets, continue to approach pre-

crisis levels at most banks, although with interest rates being so low, the return on assets 

might be expected to have declined relative to their pre-crisis levels--and that fact is also 

a cause for concern.
