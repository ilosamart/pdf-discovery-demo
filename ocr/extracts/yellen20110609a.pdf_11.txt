whenever possible.  The consequences of not conducting modifications are simply too 

high--for borrowers, for lenders, for the local communities, and for the overall economy. 

 In the event that a borrower in default no longer wishes to remain in the home, we 

have urged lenders to make every effort to pursue alternatives to foreclosure, such as 

short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.12  These alternatives may help the borrower 

transition to a better housing situation as quickly and seamlessly as possible.  In addition, 

these alternatives may shorten the length of time that a property lies vacant.  The 

deterioration of a property while it lies vacant not only reduces the market value of the 

property, but also imposes considerable costs on the surrounding community by 

depressing the prices of neighboring homes, attracting crime, and creating financial 

burdens for local governments. 

 The effects of vacant homes on local communities are an example of what 

economists call a negative externality--that is, an action taken by one party that imposes 

an uncompensated burden on another.  In this case, the externality occurs because 

lenders, investors, and servicers typically do not bear the burdens resulting from the 

negative effects of foreclosures on neighborhood house prices, crime, and government 

budgets.  As a result, fewer short sales likely occur than would be best for communities 

overall.  This externality is one of the reasons why a government program that provides 

financial incentives to servicers and borrowers for pursuing short sales or deeds-in-lieu of 

foreclosure remains undersubscribed.13  Indeed, as of March 2011, only about 12,000

being released from the mortgage obligations.

Affordable program.
