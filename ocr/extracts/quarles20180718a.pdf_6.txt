Before I talk about the “other” factors, let me acknowledge the merits of size as 

one relevant factor to include on the list.  We know that the effect of a large bank’s 

failure on the economy is greater than when a smaller bank fails, even though the two 

banks might be engaged in similar business lines.  The recent financial crisis in 2008–09 

saw a much more severe recession than other financial crises, such as the savings and 

loan crisis in the late 1980s that preceded the relatively mild recession of 1990–91, and 

this appears at least in part related to the size of the affected institutions.  In fact, 

empirical research done at the Federal Reserve shows that stress among larger banks does 

more significant harm to the economy than stress at smaller banks, even after controlling 

for the aggregate size of bank failures.2  We also know that larger banks are more 

operationally complex--even when not engaged in complex business lines--with a broader 

geographic scope and more layers of management than smaller banks.  Therefore, it 

seems appropriate to me that a path forward for tailoring supervision and regulation of 

large banks should not ignore size, but consider it as one factor--although only one 

factor--along with other factors. 

Before the enactment of the recent legislation, we had begun work on considering 

additional factors that capture large firms’ degree of complexity and interconnectedness 

that--in conjunction with size--may provide a better basis for tailoring supervision and 

regulation than size alone.  The systemic effect of a bank’s failure or distress is positively 

correlated with that organization’s business, operational, and structural complexity.  

                                                 
2  Pending research to be published by Federal Reserve Board staff in the near future suggests that an 
increase in bank stress results in poorer economic performance in a way that scales with bank size. Put 
another way, staff estimate that stress at a single bank with $250 billion in deposits would result in roughly 
an 84 percent decline in quarterly GDP growth, while stress among five banks each with $50 billion in 
deposits would result in roughly a 24 percent decline in quarterly GDP growth. Although both scenarios 
have $250 billion in total failed deposits, the negative impact is greater when the largest bank is stressed.
