Corporate spending on research and development has also been strongly procyclical, 

which may have similar effects.10  

Turning to the recent U.S. experience, many economists now estimate that 

substantially more than half of the shortfall in gross domestic product relative to its pre-

crisis trend represents a reduction of potential output and not just a shortfall in demand.11  

U.S. labor force damage likely accounts for some part of the shortfall.12  The greater part 

appears to have resulted from lower trend labor productivity due to reduced capital 

investment and “multifactor productivity,” which is often thought of as capturing the 

effects of technological innovation.13  The employment rebound suggests that strong 

measures--such as those the Fed took during and after the crisis--can prevent even sharp 

job losses from becoming permanent.  But the productivity slowdown suggests that 

monetary policy cannot, by itself, avert all of the damage.

12 There is considerable debate about how much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio and 
labor force participation has been due to the recession, how much of that decline is reversible, and, 
relatedly, how much of the decline would have occurred regardless in the absence of a recession.  For the 
argument that much of the decrease in labor force participation would likely have occurred even in the 
absence of the recession, see Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig,

likely reversible, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and
