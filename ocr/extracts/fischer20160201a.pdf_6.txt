circumstances--and, in particular, on the outlook for employment and inflation and an 

assessment of the likely lags in the effects of monetary policy.   

My second topic is how best to integrate balance sheet policy with interest rate 

policy.  The Committee has indicated that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, 

hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and 

effectively.  But that statement leaves open the question of when we should begin to 

reduce the size of our balance sheet.  Because the tools I mentioned earlier--the payment 

of interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repurchase facility--can be used 

to raise the federal funds rate independent of the size of the balance sheet, we have the 

flexibility to adjust the size of our balance sheet at the appropriate time.  With the federal 

funds rate still quite low and expected to rise only gradually, I think there is some benefit 

to maintaining a larger balance sheet for a time.  Doing so should help support 

accommodative financial conditions and so reduce the downside risks to the economic 

outlook in the event of a future adverse shock to the economy.  Consistent with this view, 

the Committee has decided to continue to reinvest principal payments from its securities 

portfolio until normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way.  The decision 

about when to cease or begin phasing out reinvestment will depend on how economic and 

financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.6   

Thank you.  I would be happy to respond to some questions, starting with those 

from our moderator today, Tom Keene.
