in 2005 to 8.4 percent in 2015.  On-call workers expanded from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent 

of the workforce.5  

Over this same period, technological platforms have emerged that are 

transforming the way people identify, schedule, and engage in contingent work and are 

also helping people to monetize their assets to generate income.  These developments, 

under the rubric of the “gig,” “on-demand,” “platform,” or “sharing” economy, have the 

potential to be transformative.  Although the data are still relatively sparse, it appears that 

the number of workers using online platforms to secure gigs is still small but is growing 

quickly.6  Katz and Krueger found that workers who provide services through three 

online intermediaries accounted for only 0.5 percent of all workers in 2015.  Diana 

Farrell and Fiona Greig (2016) reach a similar conclusion, using a unique and rich data 

set.7 

The Federal Reserve Board fielded a survey to better understand the many ways 

adults are generating income, regardless of their employment status and the frequency of 

these activities.  The survey uses an expansive concept of contingent work, capturing all 

of the activity individuals are undertaking to generate income.  The Enterprising and 

Informal Work Activity survey, or EIWA, suggests that more than a third--36 percent--of 

the adult population undertook informal paid work activity either as a complement to, or 

as a substitute for, more traditional and formal work arrangements.8  Similarly, a survey

approximately one in four respondents--or more than half of informal work participants--say they earned 

money through informal work activities conducted online.  See Bracha, Burke, and Khachiyan (2015).
