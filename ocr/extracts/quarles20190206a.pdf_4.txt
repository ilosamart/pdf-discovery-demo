and regulation, with new details about our work.5 And across the Federal Reserve System, our 

staff publishes a wide range of economic and policy research and plays an active role in 

academic discourse. 

 Monetary policy itself shows the value of participation and transparency. U.S. monetary 

policy is the sole responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Yet some of the most important 

innovations in the field have come from outside the Reserve System. Since 1935, we have 

decided monetary policy by committee, a structure that has served us well because it is designed 

to capture different views of a wide and varied national economy. And over the past several 

decades, the FOMC has greatly increased its own transparency--from postmeeting 

announcements, to announcing an objective for inflation, to a published survey of economic 

projections, to postmeeting press conferences (which will now take place after every FOMC 

meeting).6 As many of you know, over the course of 2019, we will be reviewing our monetary 

policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, and we will hold a research conference on 

the subject with outside speakers, as well as “Fed Listens” events at a number of Reserve Banks, 

to hear from a broad range of constituencies. But these improvements are more than a simple 

matter of disclosure. They are an invitation to participate, and a way to provide the public with 

the means and opportunity to inform our work.

6 The FOMC’s “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” first issued in January 2012 and 
reaffirmed each January, specifies that the Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by 
the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run 
with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate and that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running 
persistently above or below this objective.
