As the report notes, minimizing the risk of future financial crises will require 

tougher prudential standards for financial firms, especially systemically important 

financial firms, as well as more intensive supervision.  Stronger capital and liquidity 

standards and more-stringent risk-management requirements for larger and more 

interconnected firms are necessary to reduce the probability that a systemic firm will 

experience financial distress and so harm the financial system and the economy.  

Enhanced prudential standards for the largest firms should also reduce the incentive of 

firms to grow or otherwise expand their systemic footprint in order to become perceived 

as too big to fail.   

At the Federal Reserve, we are already working both domestically and 

internationally to increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital that banks are 

required to hold, to better link capital standards to the risks that banks face, and to reduce 

the pro-cyclicality of the regulatory capital and accounting frameworks.  All of these 

changes will enable firms to better withstand adverse systemwide shocks.  To be sure, 

reasonable transition periods will be necessary to allow banks to meet these more 

demanding standards without unduly constricting credit or endangering the recovery.    

In addition to enhanced capital standards, we are also working with domestic and 

international colleagues on toughening liquidity requirements.  A prominent feature of 

the crisis was the inadequate liquidity risk-management practices of some major financial 

firms.  Some firms, notably the independent investment banks, relied excessively on
