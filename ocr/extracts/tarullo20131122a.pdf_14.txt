with little reliance on short-term funding is less susceptible to runs and, thus, to the need for 

engaging in fire sales that can depress capital levels.  A capital surcharge based on short-term 

wholesale funding usage would add an incentive to use more stable funding and, where a firm 

concluded that higher levels of such funding were nonetheless economically sensible, the 

surcharge would increase the loss absorbency of the firm.  Such a requirement would be 

consistent with, though distinct from, the long-term debt requirement that the Federal Reserve 

Board will be proposing to enhance prospects for resolving large firms without taxpayer 

assistance. 

The second kind of policy option is to address head-on the macroprudential concerns 

arising from large matched books of securities financing transactions.  A capital surcharge is in 

some respects an indirect response to the problem of short-term wholesale funding runs and, as 

earlier noted, current versions of capital and liquidity standards do not deal with matched book 

issues.  One might choose either to increase capital charges applicable to SFT assets or to modify 

liquidity standards so as to require firms with large amounts of these assets to hold larger 

liquidity buffers or to maintain more stable funding structures.  It is not clear how much appetite 

there may be internationally for revisiting agreements that have been completed, such as the 

LCR and the Basel III capital rules.  However, with the NSFR still under discussion, and with the 

Basel Committee in the process of reconsidering the standardized banking book risk weights and 

capital regulations associated with traded assets, there are opportunities to pursue these options. 

Requirements building on any of the foregoing options would by definition be directly 

applicable only to firms already within the perimeter of prudential regulation.  The obvious 

questions are whether these firms at present occupy enough of the market that standards 

applicable only to them would be reasonably effective in addressing systemic risk and, even if
