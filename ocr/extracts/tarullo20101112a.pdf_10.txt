With the agreements reached in July and September at meetings of the Governors and 

Heads of Supervision (GHOS) in Basel, the structure and basic elements of Basel III are clear.  

Details are still being worked out by the Basel Committee.  Then, of course, the U.S. banking 

agencies will need to implement Basel III through domestic capital regulations.   

Basel III is not a perfect agreement, of course.  There are things we would have done 

differently if we were writing a capital regulation on our own.  There will surely be some 

technical challenges in implementing it.  It does not really address some pre-crisis problems in 

capital regulation such as pro-cyclicality.  But it is a major step forward for capital regulation.  It 

will raise minimum requirements substantially, ensure that regulatory capital is truly loss 

absorbing, and discourage some of the risky activities for which the pre-crisis regime required 

far too little capital.   

Basel III was also a major step forward in international cooperation.  In all candor, as 

recently as this past spring I was concerned that we might be unable to agree in Basel on such 

key issues as a distinct common equity requirement.  However, under the strong leadership of 

Nout Wellink in the Basel Committee and Jean-Claude Trichet in the GHOS, we concluded a 

good agreement in timely fashion.  I believe that another factor in turning things around was that, 

unlike at some times in the past, the U.S. banking agencies spoke with a single, unified voice in 

Basel. 

 Obviously, the benefits of Basel III for financial stability will be realized only if they are 

implemented rigorously.  In this regard, it is important to draw a distinction between, on the one 

hand, implementation in the sense of enacting national regulations that incorporate the Basel 

standards and, on the other, implementation in the sense that firms are actually holding the 

amounts of capital called for by the internationally agreed rules.
