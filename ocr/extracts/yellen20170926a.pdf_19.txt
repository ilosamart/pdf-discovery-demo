Appendix:  PCE Inflation Model, Inflation Decomposition Procedure, and the ECI 
Growth Equation 

PCE Inflation Model 

The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations:  

an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE price inflation.  The 

identity is  

𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 = 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 + 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡
𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡, 

where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total 

and core PCE prices, respectively.  𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 and 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 are annualized growth rates for 

prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both 

expressed relative to core PCE prices, and 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 and 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡
𝑓𝑓are the weights of energy and food 

in total consumption.  The core inflation forecasting equation is 

𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 = .41𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 + .36𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑐𝑐 + .23𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2𝑐𝑐 − .08𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + .56𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡, 

where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization, 

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods, 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 

is a white-noise error term, and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates 

obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4.29 

For estimation purposes, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate 

less the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural 

rate.  From 2007 to the present, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 is approximated using the median forecasts of long-

                                                 
29 Although the data used in the decomposition analysis have been revised and extended, the specification 
of the model and the estimation period are the same as that discussed in a speech I gave two years ago 
(Yellen, 2015).  As a result, the estimated coefficients of the model are essentially unchanged.  Extending 
the estimation period through 2017:Q2 has little effect on the estimated coefficients and the decomposition 
estimates.
