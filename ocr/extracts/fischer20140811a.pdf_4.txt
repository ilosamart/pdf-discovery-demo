recoveries in the advanced economies have been well below average.3  In the emerging 

market economies, the initial recovery was more in line with historical experience, but 

recently the pace of growth has been disappointing in those economies as well.  This 

slowing is broad based--with performance in Emerging Asia, importantly China, stepping 

down sharply from the post-crisis surge, to rates significantly below the average pace in 

the decade before the crisis.  A similar stepdown has been seen recently for other regions 

including Latin America.  

These disappointments in output performance have not only led to repeated 

downward revisions of forecasts for short-term growth, but also to a general reassessment 

of longer-run growth.  From the perspective of the FOMC, even in the heart of the crisis, 

in January 2009, the central tendency of the Committee members’ projections for longer-

run U.S. growth was between 2-1/2 and 3 percent.  At our June meeting this year, these 

projections had fallen to between roughly 2 and 2-1/4 percent.  This downward revision 

is not unique to our institution or to the United States.  Indeed, the IMF’s expectation for 

long-run global growth is now a full percentage point below what it was immediately 

before the Global Financial Crisis.4  This reconsideration reflects lower projected growth 

for both the advanced and the emerging market economies. 

This pattern of disappointment and downward revision sets up the first, and the 

basic, challenge on the list of issues policymakers face in moving ahead: restoring 

growth, if that is possible.  In some respects, we should not have been surprised at the
