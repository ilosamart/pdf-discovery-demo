The Rationale for the Asset Purchase Program 

Macroeconomic Conditions 

To understand the rationale for our asset purchase program, it is helpful to review 

the evolution of macroeconomic conditions over the past several years.  The National 

Bureau of Economic Research has dated the recession as having begun in December 

2007, but the pace of economic contraction accelerated in the wake of the Lehman 

Brothers collapse in September 2008 and the ensuing disruption to global financial 

markets.  As shown in figure 1, the unemployment rate rose from around 5 percent in the 

spring of 2008 to about 10 percent by the autumn of 2009 and has stayed well above 

9 percent since then.  Most observers, including myself, judge this level of 

unemployment to be much higher than levels consistent with full employment and stable 

inflation.  For example, in a recent Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the median estimate of the current level of 

structural unemployment--often referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of 

unemployment (NAIRU)--stood at about 5-3/4  percent, implying that the unemployment 

gap is nearly 4 percentage points. 

In addition, a historically large fraction of the unemployed have been out of a job 

for a very long time.  For example, roughly 4 percentage points of todayâ€™s unemployment 

rate reflects individuals who have been unemployed for half a year or more.  Those who 

experience an extended period of unemployment face a risk of losing their ability to 

participate successfully in the workforce, lending additional urgency to the task of 

reviving the demand for labor.
