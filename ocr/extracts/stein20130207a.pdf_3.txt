credit is cheap when households extrapolate current good times into the future and 

neglect low-probability risks.

The primitives view is helpful for understanding some aspects of the behavior of 

the aggregate stock market, with the 1990s Internet bubble being one illustration.  It 

seems clear that the sentiment of retail investors played a prominent role in inflating this 

bubble.

  More generally, research using survey evidence has shown that when individual 

investors are most optimistic about future stock market returns, the market tends to be 

overvalued, in the sense that statistical forecasts of equity returns are abnormally low.

This finding is consistent with the importance of primitive investor beliefs. 

By contrast, I am skeptical that one can say much about time variation in the 

pricing of credit--as opposed to equities--without focusing on the roles of institutions and 

incentives.  The premise here is that since credit decisions are almost always delegated to 

agents inside banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds, and 

so forth, any effort to analyze the pricing of credit has to take into account not only 

household preferences and beliefs, but also the incentives facing the agents actually 

making the decisions.  And these incentives are in turn shaped by the rules of the game, 

which include regulations, accounting standards, and a range of performance-

measurement, governance, and compensation structures.  

At an abstract level, one can think of the agents making credit decisions and the 

rulemakers who shape their incentives as involved in an ongoing evolutionary process, in 

which each adapts over time in response to changing conditions.  At any point, the agents

 For example, Griffin and others (2011) document that during the run-up of the Internet bubble, from 

January 1997 to March 2000, individual investors were substantial net buyers of tech stocks, via both direct 

purchases as well as investments in tech-sector-specific mutual funds.
