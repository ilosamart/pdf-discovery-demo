strategy.20  To be sure, I would never advocate turning over monetary policy to a 

computer, but why shouldn’t the FOMC adopt such a rule as a guidepost to policy? 

The answer is that times are by no means normal now, and the simple rules that 

perform well under ordinary circumstances just won’t perform well with persistently 

strong headwinds restraining recovery and with the federal funds rate constrained by the 

zero bound.  A further simulation serves to illustrate that such rules would perform 

relatively poorly at the current time.  The red lines with squares labeled “Modified Taylor 

rule” show the economic outcomes that would be expected if the federal funds rate were 

set according to the prescriptions of a rule that is similar to the original Taylor rule, with 

the only difference being that it responds equally to deviations of unemployment and 

inflation from their respective longer-run values.   

 The figure shows that this rule would raise the federal funds rate substantially 

earlier than the optimal path and thereby leads to more protracted deviations of the 

unemployment rate above its longer-run normal level without any measurable gains in 

keeping inflation closer to the 2 percent target.  In contrast, the optimal policy results in 

better economic outcomes.  In effect, it compensates for the period of economic 

weakness induced by both the zero lower bound and the unusual persistence and severity 

of the headwinds now buffeting the economy by holding the federal funds rate lower for 

                                                 
20 The rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 1.0Yt.  In this expression, R is the federal funds rate, π is 
the percent change in the headline PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and Y is the output gap.  The 
output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.0(6-Ut), where 2.0 is the estimated value 
of the Okun’s law coefficient and 6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating inflation rate of 
unemployment, or NAIRU.  In a recent speech (see Janet L. Yellen (2012), “The Economic Outlook and 
Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, 
April 11, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm), I dubbed this rule “Taylor 
(1999),” as John Taylor described the rule in a paper published that year.  See John B. Taylor (1999), “A 
Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:  
University of Chicago Press), pp. 319-41.  As Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--
Taylor (1993)--I now refer to the later rule as the “modified Taylor rule.”  (The text of this footnote has
