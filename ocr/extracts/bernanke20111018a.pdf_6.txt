monetary policy should be conducted with reference to a longer horizon to take 

appropriate account of financial stability concerns.2   

 My guess is that the current framework for monetary policy--with innovations, no 

doubt, to further improve the ability of central banks to communicate with the public--

will remain the standard approach, as its benefits in terms of macroeconomic stabilization 

have been demonstrated.  However, central banks are also heeding the broader lesson, 

that the maintenance of financial stability is an equally critical responsibility.  Central 

banks certainly did not ignore issues of financial stability in the decades before the recent 

crisis, but financial stability policy was often viewed as the junior partner to monetary 

policy.  One of the most important legacies of the crisis will be the restoration of 

financial stability policy to co-equal status with monetary policy.  

Monetary Policy Tools 

 While central banks may have left their monetary policy frameworks largely 

unchanged through the Great Recession, they have considerably widened their set of 

tools for implementing those frameworks.  Following the crisis and the downturn in the 

global economy that started in 2008, central banks responded with a forceful application 

of their usual policy tools, most prominently sharp reductions in short-term interest rates.  

Then, as policy rates approached the zero lower bound, central banks began to employ an 

increasingly wide range of less conventional tools, including forward policy guidance and 

operations to alter the scale and composition of their balance sheets.

posed by cumulating financial imbalances may require a shift in the rhetoric of inflation targeters towards 
the longer term.”  See page 70 of Charles Bean (2003), “Asset Prices, Financial Imbalances and Monetary 
Policy:  Are Inflation Targets Enough?” in Asset Prices and Monetary Policy, proceedings of a conference
