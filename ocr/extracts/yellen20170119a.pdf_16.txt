The FOMC, for reasons that I have discussed, does not base its decisions on the 

prescriptions of any specific policy rule.  Nevertheless, the three benchmarks I have 

described--the Taylor rule, the balanced-approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately 

calibrated--have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in 

the general direction of monetary policy over time.  This guidance is illustrated by 

figure 9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the 

prescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment 

observed at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projections of the 

longer-run unemployment rate and R*.   

As the figure shows, the rules clearly signaled that a major reduction in the 

federal funds rate was appropriate in 2008 given the marked deterioration in economic 

conditions.  In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide 

more stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided 

by keeping short-term interest rates near zero.  For this reason, the Committee turned to 

asset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates.  The FOMC also sought to compensate for its inability to 

push the federal funds rate below zero by indicating that the funds rate would need to stay 

unusually low for longer than would otherwise be expected and simple policy rules 

would prescribe.21  Under this “make up” strategy, and taking into account the reasons 

for deviating from the Taylor rule that I discussed a moment ago, the Committee kept the 

                                                           
21 For example, the FOMC advised in the statement released after its December 2012 meeting that 
conditions would likely warrant keeping the funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate 
was above 6-1/2 percent--a threshold that was not passed until mid-2014.  As discussed by Reifschneider 
and Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower-for-longer guidance can 
help compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest 
rates.  Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) find that the FOMC’s guidance, together with its asset 
purchases, provided significant economic stimulus in the years following the financial crisis.
