published Promoting Pathways to Financial Stability, a handbook designed for 

community college personnel and others interested in helping students learn to manage 

their financial lives.32 

As the economic recovery continues to strengthen, it is important that we monitor 

the progress of young workers and their experience in the job market, their educational 

outcomes, their management of student debt, and their progress toward forming 

independent households and owning homes.  Understanding the interaction of various 

economic pressures on young workers is the first step.  The ultimate goal is to develop 

evidence-based policies and opportunities to support the generation that has come of age 

in the shadow of the Great Recession as they gain a foothold on the ladder to a better 

economic future.
