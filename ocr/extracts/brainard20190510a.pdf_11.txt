of black households in which the head had a bachelor’s degree ($271,200) was 26 percent 

less than that of white households in which the head did not attend college ($367,800).17   

This matters not least because disparities in wealth often are inherited.18  The 

prospects that a young person will reach the middle class often depend on attributes he or 

she inherits—such as the income, wealth, education, age, race, and ethnicity of his or her

ability to access information and social networks that help in obtaining jobs and taking
