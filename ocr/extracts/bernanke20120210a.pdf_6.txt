As I mentioned earlier, problems in the housing market have also restrained the 

broader economic recovery.  For example, by some estimates, declines in house prices 

have reduced homeowners’ equity by more than 50 percent in the aggregate since the 

peak of the housing boom, resulting in more than a $7 trillion loss of household wealth.

Indeed, about 12 million homeowners--more than 1 out of 5 with a mortgage--are 

underwater, meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.  One 

of the effects of declines in housing wealth is to reduce the ability and willingness of 

households to spend.  While estimates vary, homeowners are believed to spend 

somewhere between $3 and $5 per year less for every $100 of housing value lost.

  Based 

on those estimates, it appears that recent declines in housing wealth may be reducing 

consumer spending between $200 billion and $375 billion per year.  That reduction 

corresponds to lower living standards for many Americans.  And, importantly, lower 

sales of goods and services also reduce the incentives of firms to invest and hire, thereby 

slowing the recovery.  Of course, these consumer-related effects are on top of the direct 

consequences of low rates of home construction for job creation and income. 

 Low or negative equity creates additional problems for households.  It reduces 

financial flexibility:  Homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages cannot tap
