 The U.K. initiative in applying local liquidity requirements is wholly understandable in 

light of the difficulties encountered because of stress on foreign institutions, including the 

Lehman bankruptcy, during the crisis.  Because London is one of the world’s two largest 

financial center hosts, the United Kingdom is the only country other than the United States 

hosting numerous, very large broker-dealers that are owned by foreign banks and also a broad 

array of commercial bank subsidiaries and branches that are owned by foreign banks.  In fact, the 

six institutions headquartered outside the United States and the United Kingdom that are in the 

top three tiers of G-SIBs hold roughly 40 percent of their worldwide assets in those two 

jurisdictions.

  Thus the U.K. initiative on liquidity and its internal debates on matters such as 

structural supervision, the Vickers proposals, and stress testing have all been very instructive for 

the Federal Reserve Board.  Even where we have eventually adopted somewhat different 

approaches, we respect the motivation and scrupulousness of the U.K. banking authorities in 

addressing the systemic vulnerabilities posed by FBOs and in fulfilling their responsibility to the 

rest of the world to assure the stability of one of the world’s two most important financial 

centers. 

 Unlike the EU, the United States did not--prior to the financial crisis--require that all 

broker-dealers and investment banks meet Basel capital standards.  The legacy of the Glass-

Steagall Act, which had separated investment banking from commercial banking, meant that 

only commercial banks were subject to the prudential regulation of the federal banking agencies.  

In Europe, the dominance of universal banking, or variants thereon, led more naturally to 

application of capital and other prudential standards to all forms of banking activity.  Even after

resident banking entities of each banking group.  The U.S. data include all entities of each banking group.  Both 

U.K. and U.S. assets include intragroup claims on related affiliates.  Worldwide assets are calculated using the
