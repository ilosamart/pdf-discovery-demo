identify and assess alternative approaches for implementing safe, ubiquitous, faster 

payment capabilities in the United States. 

To support that mission, the task force developed a framework, called the 

“Faster Payments Effectiveness Criteria,” to provide guidance to the wider 

payments community on the desired attributes of a future payments system.  The 

framework identified 36 “effectiveness criteria” that a faster payments system 

should meet, covering six broad areas: ubiquity, efficiency, safety and security, 

speed, legal framework, and governance.  Task force members and others have 

widely embraced the effectiveness criteria. Our hope is that the criteria will serve 

as a lasting blueprint for payments service providers in designing innovative future 

products. 

The task force also established a process through which its members could 

submit proposals for faster payments capabilities and have them assessed against 

the effectiveness criteria by a qualified independent assessment team.  The task 

force encouraged members to submit proposals reflecting both products under 

development and conceptual designs.  There was overwhelming enthusiasm around 

the process, and the task force ultimately completed reviews of 19 faster payments
