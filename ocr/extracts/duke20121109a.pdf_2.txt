It is a real pleasure for me to have the opportunity to speak to community bankers at this 

annual Community Bankers Symposium sponsored jointly by the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Chicago, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  I know that many of you are concerned about the banking 

agencies’ recent proposals to revise the capital rules, the so-called Basel III proposals.1  So I will 

start my remarks with an update on those proposals.  Then I will move to a more detailed 

discussion of some data that I have found interesting as I have been thinking about the effect of 

regulations as they relate to residential mortgage lending.

including the Chairman, are concerned about the effect of regulation on community bank 

lending.  In fact, we have established a subcommittee of the Board, which I chair, to focus on the 

supervision and regulation of community and small regional banks.  In addition, we have 

established a Community Depository Institution Advisory Council (CDIAC) made up of 

community banks, thrifts, and credit unions to advise the Board about issues facing smaller 

institutions.2  But I want to also be clear that any opinions I express today are my own and may 

not reflect those of other members of the Board.

rulemaking, I want to emphasize that the feedback we have received during the comment period 

has been extremely valuable and that we will work very hard to address your concerns in the 

final rules.  Also, I would like to address the specific concern expressed by some bankers that
