host countries.  Obviously, countries without well-developed domestic banking systems will both 

benefit more and be at greater risk.  Yet even the most sophisticated domestic financial systems 

can be affected significantly.  For example, the risks can be exacerbated by funding patterns and 

currency mismatches, as happened in the United States during the financial crisis.  Foreign banks 

that had been using their U.S. branches to raise dollars in short-term markets for lending around 

the world were suddenly left without access to this funding and, as a result, made substantial 

and--relative to their assets--disproportionate use of the Federal Reserve’s discount window. 

Approaches to the Regulation of Internationally Active Banks 

 As I mentioned at the outset, international banking raises the question of who should do 

the regulating, as well as the question of what regulation is appropriate.  The two questions are 

related, of course.  As I will explain shortly, the nature of regulations in part depends upon the 

perspective and aims of the regulator.  There are essentially four models, each of which has 

benefits and shortcomings. 

 First, the home jurisdiction can have dominant or exclusive regulatory responsibility for 

all of its banks’ global operations through application of consolidated regulation and supervision.  

Second, host jurisdictions can have dominant regulatory responsibility for all foreign banking 

operations within their borders.  This approach requires foreign banks to charter locally and to 

meet the same regulatory and supervisory standards applicable to domestic banks.  Third, there 

can be shared authority between home and host jurisdictions, whereby host countries do some 

regulating and supervising of foreign banks within their borders but do not require all foreign 

banking activities to be locally chartered and subject to regulation identical to that of home 

banks.  Finally, there could be one global regulator to oversee all the operations of 

internationally active banks around the world.
