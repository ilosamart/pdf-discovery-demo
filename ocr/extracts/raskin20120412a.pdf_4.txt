downturn since the Great Depression, when the unemployment rate is estimated to have 

soared to above 20 percent and real GDP is measured to have plummeted by more than 

25 percent.  For comparison, the only other time since then when the national 

unemployment rate rose above 10 percent was the “double-dip” recession of the early 

1980s.  But even in that episode, real GDP contracted less than 3 percent and cumulative 

job losses were less than 3 million. 

The recent contraction in the housing sector has also been the most severe episode 

since the Great Depression.  National house prices have fallen 33 percent in nominal 

terms since their peak in 2006.  In contrast, home prices dipped only 2 percent in the 

early 1990s downturn, and they did not decline at all in the early 1980s recession.  The 

recent drop in housing market activity also has been dramatic.  Home sales plunged more 

than 50 percent from peak to trough, while housing starts plummeted more than 75 

percent.  Indeed, the decline in housing starts associated with the recent recession was 

nearly as large as that which occurred during the Great Depression.  

Here in Los Angeles, the recent recession was even deeper than for the nation as a 

whole.  The unemployment rate, which was about the same as the national average prior 

to the recession, rose to a peak of nearly 13 percent.  Moreover, the number of jobs in 

Los Angeles fell by a cumulative 9 percent, nearly half again as much as the decrease in 

national employment.  Those of you with a longstanding connection to the local economy 

certainly recall the prolonged downturn of the early 1990s, which followed a real estate 

crash, cuts in federal military spending in the region, and a sharp contraction in local 

industries such as aerospace manufacturing.    However, the increase in the 

unemployment rate was even larger during the recent recession than in the 1990s episode.
