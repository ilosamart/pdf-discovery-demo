Thank you to the International Monetary Fund for allowing me to take part in 

what I expect will be a very lively discussion.1 

Only five or six years ago, there wouldn’t have been a panel on the “many 

instruments” and “many targets” of monetary policy.  Before the financial crisis, the 

focus was on one policy instrument:  the short-term policy interest rate.  While central 

banks did not uniformly rely on a single policy target, many had adopted an “inflation 

targeting” framework that, as the name implies, gives a certain preeminence to that one 

objective.  Of course, the Federal Reserve has long been a bit of an outlier in this regard, 

with its explicit dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  Still, the 

discussion might not have gone much beyond “one instrument and two targets” if not for 

the financial crisis and its aftermath, which have presented central banks with great 

challenges and transformed how we look at this topic.   

Let me start with a few general observations to get the ball rolling.  In terms of the 

targets, or, more generally, the objectives of policy, I see continuity in the abiding 

importance of a framework of flexible inflation targeting.  By one authoritative account, 

about 27 countries now operate full-fledged inflation-targeting regimes.2  The United 

States is not on this list, but the Federal Reserve has embraced most of the key features of 

flexible inflation targeting:  a commitment to promote low and stable inflation over a 

longer-term horizon, a predictable monetary policy, and clear and transparent 

communication.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) struggled for years to 

formulate an inflation goal that would not seem to give preference to price stability over

System.
