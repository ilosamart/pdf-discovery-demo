each local council serves on the national council that will meet with the Board twice a year in 

Washington.  Local meetings have already begun, and the first meeting of the national council 

with the Board will take place soon.  Personally, I am looking forward to hearing more from 

community bankers about issues ranging from their local economies to regulatory reform. 

Community Banks and Regulatory Reform 

As you know, a key challenge for community banks in the years ahead will be to adapt to 

the changing regulatory environment, particularly the regulatory reforms contained in the Dodd-

Frank Act, as well as the changes that will be associated with the Basel III reforms.  We are 

certainly aware of and appreciate the concerns that community banks have about these regulatory 

changes, and, as I have just described, we have stepped up our efforts to understand those 

concerns and to respond to them as appropriate.  I think it is worth emphasizing that the changes 

we will be seeing in the financial regulatory architecture are principally directed at our largest 

and most complex financial firms, including nonbanks.  Consequently, one benefit of the reforms 

should be the creation of a more level playing field for financial institutions of all sizes. 

Focusing reform on our largest, most complex financial firms makes sense.  The recent 

financial crisis highlighted the fact that some financial firms had grown so large, leveraged, and 

interconnected that their failure could pose a threat to overall financial stability.  The sudden 

collapses of major financial firms were among the most destabilizing events of the crisis.  The 

crisis also demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing framework for supervising, regulating, 

and otherwise constraining the risks of major financial firms as well as of the toolkit the 

government had at the time to manage their failure.
