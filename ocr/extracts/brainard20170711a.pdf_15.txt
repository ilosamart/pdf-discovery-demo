whether interest rate movements are driven by conventional or unconventional policy:

The model is closed by specifying the behavior of the monetary authority.  We 

assume that the monetary authority can adjust either the interest rate associated with 

conventional policy (rc), or the interest rate linked to balance sheet actions (ru), or both, 

to affect output (its goal variable).  The conventional feedback rule is thus:

The system above contains 10 equations in 10 endogenous variables (y, y*, d, d*, 

nx, e, rc, rc*, ru, ru*), as well two shocks, u and u*, that can move GDP, its components, 

exchange rates, and interest rates. 

B.  Simulation Results 

Figures 1 and 2 show the results of simulating the model under alternative 

assumptions about the shocks and monetary policy reaction.  In each case, the economy 

starts in steady state with all variables at zero and experiences a demand shock in period 

1 that dies out with an autocorrelation ρ of 0.95.  All parameter values are reported in 

Table 1.
