invest in education and training.  The right amount of credit is a function of the financial 

system’s capacity to lend and potential borrowers’ capacity to repay.   

To understand where we are now and where we might be headed in the near- and 

medium-term, I am monitoring four conditions that seem most likely to determine the amount of 

credit that will support the recovery as we emerge from the recent financial crisis: 

 First, the condition of the banking system will certainly influence the capacity for 

lending.   

 Second, the regulatory environment that emerges will impact both the capacity 

and the confidence of banks to lend to businesses and consumers.   

 Third, the financial condition of borrowers will determine their capacity to repay 

as well as their appetite for adding more debt.    

 And finally, the strength of the economy will influence both the willingness to 

lend and the desire to borrow.   

Today, I would like to focus on these four factors.   

Condition of the Banking System 

 Let’s start with the condition of the banking system.  The banking sector continues to 

recover slowly.  Insured commercial banks as a group were modestly profitable during the first 

quarter, with a 4.8 percent return on equity.  Delinquency rates in credit cards and consumer 

loans began to level off, although at high rates, contributing to slightly lower credit costs.  

Nonperforming assets, which include foreclosed real estate, repossessed assets, and loans that are 

not accruing interest, remained high at more than 4 percent of loans, and the net charge-off rate, 

which represents the actual loan losses recorded, stayed near historic highs--at almost 3 percent 

of loans.
