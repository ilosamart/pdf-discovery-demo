although the share spiked to 40 percent in the 2007 survey.11  The households with high 

DTIs tended to have lower income, fewer financial assets, and higher mortgage loan-to-

value ratios than households with lower payment ratios.  Of course, some of these 

households may be able to reduce their DTIs by purchasing a less expensive house or by 

delaying home purchase for the time it takes to pay off some existing debt.  Nonetheless, 

the borrowers most affected by this aspect of the rule are likely also those who currently 

face tight access to credit, such as first-time or less-creditworthy borrowers. 

  The QM definition may also affect lenders’ ability to charge for the risks of 

originating loans to borrowers who are more likely to default.  For example, lenders 

might compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan.  However, if 

lenders originate a QM with an annual percentage rate (APR) that is 150 basis points or 

more above the rate available to the highest-quality borrowers (known as a higher-priced 

loan), lenders receive less protection against lawsuits claiming violation of the ability-to-

repay and QM rules.  The extent to which this lower level of legal protection (the 

“rebuttable presumption of compliance”) will affect lenders’ willingness to originate such 

loans is still unclear. 

Very few of these higher-priced loans are being originated currently, reflecting 

the weak mortgage demand and tight underwriting standards that I discussed earlier.  The 

HMDA data suggest that only 4 percent of mortgages originated in 2011 carried APRs 

this high.  However, as demand picks up and lending standards ease, the number of 

                                                 
11 Homeowner DTI is measured at the time of the survey, not at the time of loan origination, and may 
understate the number of affected households if household finances improve after the purchase of a home.  
A recent study by CoreLogic suggests that 25 percent of mortgages originated in 2010 had DTIs greater 
than 43 percent.  See Sam Khater (2013), “The Mortgage Market Impact of Qualified Mortgage
