Inc. (AIG), on its OTC structured finance and credit derivatives positions.  In the absence 

of government intervention, AIG’s failure would have exposed its counterparties to 

substantial losses at a time of significant financial stress and uncertainty for them and the 

financial system.  Indeed, for a time, the prospect of AIG’s failure exacerbated the 

already impaired functioning in important segments of the OTC market, and, as that 

happened, it became more costly or even impossible for firms to manage financial risks.  

Derivatives positions originally undertaken by some firms to hedge risk could not be 

unwound and instead became sources of risk.  AIG’s failure revealed, in stark and 

spectacular fashion, systemic problems inherent in the structure and functioning of OTC 

derivatives markets that had increased the fragility of the financial system, exposing the 

rest of the economy to unnecessary systemic risks.  Central clearing mandates, minimum 

margin standards, and data reporting requirements are among the tools that regulators 

now intend to use to mitigate counterparty risk and improve transparency, thus reducing 

uncertainty.   

The September 2009 commitment of the G-20 to require that standardized OTC 

derivatives be cleared through central counterparties is directly aimed at reducing 

systemic risk by changing the structure of the network of derivatives counterparty 

exposures.

  In the absence of a central counterparty, the network of counterparty 

exposures associated with a class of OTC contracts might look something like panel A in 

figure 3.  Each market participant has counterparty risk exposures to one or more other 

market participants.  Although each participant knows its own risk exposure, it is unlikely 

to have complete information on its counterparties’ exposures to others.  Such opacity 

can engender the kind of information-related gridlock that we observed in the fall of 2008
