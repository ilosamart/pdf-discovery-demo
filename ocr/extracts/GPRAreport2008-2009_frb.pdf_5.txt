year. After serving a full term, a Board member may

not be reappointed. If a member leaves the Board

MISSION, VALUES, AND GOALS
OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS

Mission

The mission of the Board is to foster the stability, integ-

rity, and e�ciency of the nation’s monetary, �nancial,

and payment systems so as to promote optimal macro-

economic performance.

Values

The following values of the Board guide its organiza-

tional decisions and its employees’ actions.

• Public interest. In its actions and policies, the Board

seeks to promote the public interest. It is accountable

and responsive to the general public, the U.S. govern-

ment, and the �nancial community.

• Integrity. The Board adheres to the highest standards

of integrity in its dealings with the public, the �nan-

cial community, and its employees.

• Excellence. The conduct of monetary policy, respon-

sibility for bank supervision, and maintenance of the

payment system demand high-quality analysis, high

performance standards, and a secure, robust infra-

structure. The pursuit of excellence drives the

Board’s policies concerning recruitment, selection,

and retention for Board employees.

• E�ciency and e�ectiveness. In carrying out its func-

tions, the Board is continually aware that its opera-

tions are supported primarily by public funds, and it

recognizes its obligation to manage resources e�-

ciently and e�ectively.

• Independence of views. The Board values the diversity

of its employees; input from a variety of sources; and

the independent professional judgment that is fos-

tered by the System’s highly valued regional struc-

ture. It relies on strong teamwork to mold indepen-

dent viewpoints into coherent, e�ective policies.

Goals

The Board has six primary goals with interrelated and

mutually reinforcing elements:

1. conducting monetary policy that promotes the

achievement of the statutory objectives of maxi-

mum sustainable longterm growth and the price sta-

bility that fosters that goal

2. promoting a safe, sound, competitive, and accessible

banking system and stable �nancial markets

3. developing regulations, policies, and programs

designed to inform and protect consumers, to

enforce federal consumer protection laws, to

strengthen market competition, and to promote

access to banking services in historically under-

served markets

4. providing high-quality professional oversight of the

Reserve Banks

5. fostering the integrity, e�ciency, and accessibility of

U.S. payment and settlement systems

6. fostering the integrity, e�ciency, and e�ectiveness of

Board programs

Role of Strategic Planning

Unlike most other government agencies, the Board’s

budget is not subject to the Congressional appropria-

tions process or to review by the administration

through the O�ce of Management and Budget. Rather,

the Board establishes its own budget formulation pro-

cedures, conducts strategic planning to identify changes

to its critical activities and the proper amount and allo-

cation of resources to support its mission, and provides

various reports and budget testimony to the Congress.

The Board, like the framers of the Federal Reserve

Act, considers its budgetary independence directly rel-

evant to independence in managing monetary policy.

That said, the Board believes that to maintain budget-

ary independence, it must demonstrate e�ective and

e�cient use of its �nancial resources. Resource man-

agement begins with a clear mission statement, identi�-

cation of goals, a review of factors that might a�ect the

long-term attainment of these goals, and consideration

of possible responses to those factors. By establishing

objectives to attain its goals and by identifying the

resources needed to accomplish them, the Board devel-

ops a budget necessary to implement its strategic plan.

Strategic planning is a critical factor in ensuring the

long-term e�ectiveness of Board operations and in

minimizing its costs. E�ectiveness is improved through

timely identi�cation of threats and through e�orts to

improve operational e�ciency. E�ciency is increased
