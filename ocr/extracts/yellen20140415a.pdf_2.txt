Good morning.  I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak to you today, even 

though I am unable to be with you in person.  I’d like to share a few thoughts about the 

important issues that the Financial Markets Conference (FMC) is addressing this year.  

Many of these issues, of course, are ones the FMC has grappled with every year since the 

crisis, an event which elevated the importance of this gathering and of the vital 

contributions made by the research and the policy discussion the FMC fosters.  

One of those issues is liquidity.  Maturity transformation is a central part of the 

economic function of banks and many other types of financial intermediaries.  But as we 

saw in the crisis, maturity transformation also exposes intermediaries to liquidity risk, 

particularly when intermediaries are heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding.  In 

2007 and 2008, short-term creditors ran from firms such as Northern Rock, Bear Stearns, 

and Lehman Brothers, and from money market mutual funds and asset-backed 

commercial paper programs.  Together, these runs were the primary engine of a financial 

crisis from which the United States and the global economy have yet to fully recover.   

In response to the crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s first task 

was to strengthen bank capital requirements through the adoption of the Basel III capital 

accord and, last summer, our domestic rule implementing the Basel III capital 

requirements in the United States.  Strong bank capital rules remain the foundation of 

bank regulation.  But capital requirements as currently constructed are generally based on 

credit and market risks from the asset side of the balance sheet and from off-balance-

sheet transactions.  They do not directly address liquidity risk.  

Thus, the Basel Committee’s second task was to develop new liquidity standards 

for global banking firms: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable
