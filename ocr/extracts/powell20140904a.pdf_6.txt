most market participants use LIBOR as the reference rate in their financial contracts.  

Because of the progression of this dynamic over time, and not because of some careful 

design, LIBOR has spread well beyond its intended uses and become an important pillar 

of the global financial system--perhaps too important. 

In recent years, two separate developments have called into question the wisdom 

of that arrangement.  I have already mentioned the first one--the emergence of a 

pervasive pattern of attempted manipulation of LIBOR dating back many years.  This 

misconduct was designed either to increase the potential profit of the submitting firms or 

to convey a misleading picture of the relative health of such firms.  Since 2012, seven 

financial institutions have settled related charges with the U.S. Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, and the cumulative penalties 

and fines paid in the United States now stand at more than $3 billion.8  Global penalties 

paid related to benchmark misconduct exceed $6 billion as investigations into reference 

rate manipulation continue.  Although these penalties and fines are themselves 

substantial, to my mind the longer-term damage to the publicâ€™s trust represents the greater 

cost of this misconduct. 

A second problem is that unsecured interbank borrowing has been in a secular 

decline that predates the global financial crisis.  Changes in bank behavior following the 

crisis exacerbated the decline and further weakened the foundation of LIBOR.  The result 

is a scarcity, or outright absence in longer tenors, of actual transactions that banks can use 

to estimate their daily submission to LIBOR.  Ongoing regulatory reforms and the shift 

away from unsecured funding raise the possibility that unsecured interbank borrowing

UBS) and two brokers (ICAP and RP Martin).
