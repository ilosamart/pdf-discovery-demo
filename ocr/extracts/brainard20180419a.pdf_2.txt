I am honored to be here today to participate in the Global Finance Forum.    

It is a good moment to take stock of the cyclical position of the economy and the health 

of the banking system.1  In many respects, where we are today is the mirror image of where we 

were just a decade ago.  The job market is strong, household balance sheets have improved, and 

business activity is solid.  Banks are doing well--credit growth is robust, profitability is strong, 

and capital and liquidity buffers have been fortified.  While this progress is heartening, we 

cannot afford to be complacent.  If we have learned anything from the past, it is that we must be 

especially vigilant about the health of our financial system in good times, when potential 

vulnerabilities may be building.  Safeguarding resilience through the cycle should be a critical 

consideration in our ongoing evaluation of the regulatory framework.  With that in mind, I will 

spend a few minutes describing current conditions and then outline our ongoing work to ensure 

the financial systemâ€™s buffers continue to sustain resilience over the cycle.  

Current Conditions 

 Cyclical conditions have been strengthening.  Our growth here at home has been 

bolstered by synchronized growth abroad as well as supportive financial conditions.  

Employment growth has been heartening, and we are seeing the strong labor market continue to 

draw prime age Americans back into the labor force from the sidelines.  Sizable fiscal stimulus is 

likely to reinforce cyclical pressures at a time of above-trend growth and tightening resource 

utilization.  There are few historical episodes of similar pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus to draw upon 

as we assess the outlook.  But in the few cases where resource utilization has been near the levels
