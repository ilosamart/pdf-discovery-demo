Committee’s (FOMC) target for the federal funds rate was 5-1/4 percent.  Sixteen months 

later, with the financial crisis in full swing, the FOMC had lowered the target for the 

federal funds rate to nearly zero, thereby entering the unfamiliar territory of having to 

conduct monetary policy with the policy interest rate at its effective lower bound.  The 

unusual severity of the recession and ongoing strains in financial markets made the 

challenges facing monetary policymakers all the greater. 

Today I will review the evolution of U.S. monetary policy since late 2007.  My 

focus will be the Federal Reserve’s experience with nontraditional policy tools, notably 

those based on the management of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and on its public 

communications.  I’ll discuss what we have learned about the efficacy and drawbacks of 

these less familiar forms of monetary policy, and I’ll talk about the implications for the 

Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a 

context of price stability. 

Monetary Policy in 2007 and 2008    

When significant financial stresses first emerged, in August 2007, the FOMC 

responded quickly, first through liquidity actions--cutting the discount rate and extending 

term loans to banks--and then, in September, by lowering the target for the federal funds 

rate by 50 basis points.1  As further indications of economic weakness appeared over 

subsequent months, the Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by a 

cumulative 325 basis points, leaving the target at 2 percent by the spring of 2008.
