Thus, it is important for monetary policy to ensure that underlying inflation is re-

anchored firmly at 2 percent.  At the same time, it is important for monetary policy to 

sustain full employment.   

It is difficult to know with precision how much slack remains in the labor market.  

If the unemployment rate were to continue to fall in the coming year at the same pace as in 

the past couple of years, it would reach levels not seen since the late 1960s.  On the other 

hand, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains more than 

1 percentage point below its pre-crisis level.  If substantially more workers could be drawn 

into the labor force, it would be possible for the labor market to firm notably further 

without generating imbalances.  But it is an open question as to what portion of the prime-

age Americans who are out of the labor force may prove responsive to tight labor market 

conditions because declining labor force participation among prime-age workers predates 

the crisis, especially for men.  In one encouraging development, the strong labor market has 

pulled some discouraged workers back into the labor force and into productive employment 

over the past few years.  Also encouraging, our Beige Book and workforce surveys indicate 

that employers are casting a wider net to find job candidates and investing more in on-the-

job training.  

Navigating Monetary Policy  

Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in 

the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full 

employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view.  With 

greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the 

federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.
