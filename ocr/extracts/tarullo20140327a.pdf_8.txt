  Today, 4 of the top 10 broker-dealers in the United States, and 12 of the top 20, are 

owned by foreign banks. 

Meanwhile, even the traditional branching model of large foreign commercial banks in 

the United States had changed.  Reliance on less stable, short-term wholesale funding increased 

significantly.  Many foreign banks shifted from the “lending branch” model to a “funding 

branch” model, in which U.S. branches of foreign banks were borrowing large amounts of U.S. 

dollars to upstream to their parents.  These “funding branches” went from holding 40 percent of 

foreign bank branch assets in the mid-1990s to holding 75 percent of foreign bank branch assets 

by 2009.  Foreign banks as a group moved from a position of receiving funding from their 

parents on a net basis in 1999 to providing significant funding to non-U.S. affiliates by the mid-

2000s--more than $600 billion on a net basis by 2008.

A good bit of this short-term funding was used to finance long-term, U.S. dollar-

denominated project and trade finance around the world.  There is also evidence that a significant 

portion of the dollars raised by European banks in the pre-crisis period ultimately returned to the 

United States in the form of investments in U.S. securities.  Indeed, the amount of U.S. dollar-

denominated asset-backed securities and other securities held by Europeans increased 

significantly between 2003 and 2007, much of it financed by the short-term, dollar-denominated 

liabilities of European banks.

 Just as regulatory systems did not, in the years preceding the crisis, address 

vulnerabilities such as reliance on short-term wholesale funding that were created by the
