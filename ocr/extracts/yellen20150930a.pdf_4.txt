economy since then has helped communities and community banks, but I am well aware 

that the challenges for this sector continue, and my Board colleagues understand this also.   

We know and appreciate these concerns because the Board makes it our business 

to regularly and extensively meet with and talk to community bankers and industry 

leaders.  The Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository 

Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks, 

thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.1  The Board also has 

a Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, headed by Governor 

Powell and including Governor Brainard.2   

Let me also say that the experiences, aspirations, and challenges of community 

banking are not new to me.  Before I became Chair of the Board of Governors and Vice 

Chair before that, I spent six years as president of the San Francisco Fed.  In this role, I 

was responsible for the supervision of a substantial number of community banking 

organizations in the nine states of the 12th District.   

Among the things I learned from that experience is that, when it comes to bank 

regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all.  To effectively promote safety and 

soundness and ensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden, 

rules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of institutions. 

That is why the Congress chose to exempt community banks from many aspects of new, 

post-crisis regulations and why financial regulators, including the Fed, have otherwise
