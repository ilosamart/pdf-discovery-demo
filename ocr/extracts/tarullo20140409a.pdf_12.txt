The Role of Monetary Policy 

As must be apparent, the challenges I have discussed are not susceptible to easy 

or rapid solution.  It is equally apparent that monetary policy cannot be the only, or even 

the principal, tool in addressing these challenges.  But that is not to say it is irrelevant.  

There is not as sharp a demarcation between cyclical and structural problems as is 

sometimes suggested.  Monetary policies directed toward achieving the statutory dual 

mandate of maximum employment and price stability can help reduce underemployment 

associated with low aggregate demand.  And, to the degree that monetary policy can 

prevent cyclical phenomena such as high unemployment and low investment from 

becoming entrenched, it might be able to improve somewhat the potential growth rate of 

the economy over the medium term.15   

More generally, reducing labor market slack can help lay the foundation for a 

more sustained, self-reinforcing cycle of stronger aggregate demand, increased 

production, renewed investment, and productivity gains.  Similarly, a stronger labor 

market can provide a modest countervailing factor to income inequality trends by leading 

to higher wages at the bottom rungs of the wage scale. 

The very accommodative monetary policy of the past five years has contributed 

significantly to the extended, moderate recoveries of gross domestic product (GDP) and 

employment.  To this point, however, there has not been a corresponding upturn in 

wages.  To be sure, there have been notable wage increases in specific areas of the 

country enjoying economic growth much higher than the national average.  And, as is
