help to reduce those costs.  Since the crisis, reforms have supported greater use of 

clearing for a wide range of products, and I believe that greater clearing in 

Treasury repo markets could be beneficial.   

  The conference will conclude tomorrow with a discussion of regulatory 

requirements in Treasury markets.  Many point to post-crisis regulation as a key 

factor driving any recent decline in liquidity.  Although regulation seems to have 

had little to do with the events of October 15, I would agree that it is one factor 

driving recent changes in market making.  The same regulations have also greatly 

strengthened the major banks and made another financial crisis far less likely.  In 

my view, we should be prepared to accept some increase in the cost of market 

making in order to improve our overall financial stability.  That said, these 

regulations are new, and we should be willing to learn from experience.  

Regulatory requirements for Treasury markets may need to change over time to 

reflect a rapidly evolving market environment.    

  Markets will adapt to new regulation and other developments. We all have a 

responsibility to make sure that market and regulatory incentives appropriately 

encourage an evolution that will enhance market liquidity and functioning.  Iâ€™ve 

been eagerly looking forward to this conference, in the belief that our discussions 

here can do just that.
