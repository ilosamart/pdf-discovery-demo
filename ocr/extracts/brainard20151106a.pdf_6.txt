policies by central banks across the globe in response to the depressed state of their 

economies. 

In contrast, in 2010 and 2011, when the Federal Reserve undertook its second 

round of large-scale asset purchases, the global reaction was mixed.  By that time, several 

emerging market economies were experiencing economic conditions close to full 

employment and strong credit growth.  For many of the countries with divergent 

economic conditions, the combination of a market-based exchange rate and a firmly 

anchored monetary policy framework oriented around domestic objectives was sufficient 

to offset spillovers.   

Others, however, saw the increased capital inflows associated with the divergence 

of conditions as presenting problems for the management of their own economies.  One 

country in this category was China, which was experiencing an investment-led expansion 

accompanied by credit expansion.   

Separately, several emerging market economies with relatively flexible exchange 

rates, particularly those experiencing expansions because of strong commodity prices, 

saw risks from the combination of capital inflows and upward pressure on exchange 

rates.  Elevated inflows of foreign capital can present challenges in circumstances where 

prudential oversight and control of financial markets are not fully developed.  Thus, 

countries such as Brazil worried that heavy capital inflows could lead to an undesirable 

loosening of credit conditions and leave the economy vulnerable to rapid reversals.   

In the past two years, we have seen these concerns play out in reverse.  During the 

“taper tantrum” in 2013 and again in recent months, an increase in expectations of policy 

divergence in the United States confronted economic policymakers in emerging markets
