bankers and our examiners the importance of careful analysis of the circumstances of individual 

borrowers. 

 While aggregate figures are useful to policymakers in assessing overall trends in the 

financial system, they do not tell the whole story.  Determining whether supervisory policies and 

practices are appropriately balanced also requires a close examination of specific circumstances--

for example, through evaluating particular loans that banks were discouraged from making.  

Ongoing outreach will thus be essential as the regulatory agencies and the industry continue to 

work through the many difficult issues brought about by the financial crisis.  Members of the 

Board and senior supervisory staff have met with bankers, including community bankers, to 

elicit examples of supervisory policies or actions that bankers believe may have inhibited 

prudent lending and to discuss in detail some examples of the supervisory agencies’ responses to 

specific lending situations.  It is important that we identify cases in which examiners may be too 

cautious and to further clarify our general guidance.  It is equally important that we reinforce 

those cautious instincts where the circumstances of an application for credit indicate excessive 

risk.  

 In addition to our outreach to banks and bank examiners, the Federal Reserve has 

conducted several forums in recent months to better understand the difficulties faced by small 

businesses.  In mid-November, the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in 

conjunction with the SBA, held small business forums in San Francisco and Los Angeles.  We 

are now conducting a series of meetings on small business access to credit hosted by the Reserve 

Banks.  The meetings will be followed by a capstone event at the Board of Governors.  These 

forums examine the evolving difficulties faced by small businesses and will inform additional 

efforts to help this important sector.  Meetings this week focused on minority entrepreneurship
