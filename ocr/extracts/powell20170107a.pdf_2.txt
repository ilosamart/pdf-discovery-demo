Thank you for this invitation to discuss low interest rates and the financial system.  

The framing of this topic raises the question of whether low interest rates have somehow 

undermined the stability and functioning of the financial system.  I will argue that “low 

for long” interest rates have supported slow but steady progress to full employment and 

stable prices, which has in turn supported financial stability.  Indeed, by many measures 

the U.S. financial system is much stronger than before the crisis.  That said, there are 

difficult tradeoffs to manage.  Over time, low rates can put pressure on the business 

models of financial institutions.  And low rates can lead to excessive leverage and 

broadly unsustainable asset prices--things that we watch carefully for and do not observe 

at this point.  I will begin by focusing briefly on the macroeconomic effects of low 

interest rates.  I will then turn to the condition of the financial system--in particular, its 

interplay with low rates.  As always, the views I express here today are mine alone. 

Highly Accommodative Monetary Policy 

The financial crisis and the Great Recession posed the most significant 

macroeconomic challenges for the United States in a half-century, leaving behind high 

unemployment and below-target inflation and calling for highly accommodative 

monetary policies.  Isolating the effects of these policies is challenging, but studies 

generally show that they lowered rates across the curve and moved other asset prices as 

well.1  It is even more challenging to evaluate their effects on aggregate demand.  Low 

rates and higher asset prices should support household and business spending and 

                                                 
1 Williams (2014) compiles the results from a range of studies estimating the effect of the Federal 
Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs).  While the exact numbers vary and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty, typical estimates of the effect of a representative $600 billion in Treasury LSAPs 
on long-term yields are in the range of 15 to 25 basis points, an effect roughly equivalent to that of three or 
four rate cuts of 25 basis points.
