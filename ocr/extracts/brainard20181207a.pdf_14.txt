implementing the CCyB described in the Board’s framework of September 2016 are 

calibrated so that the CCyB will be above its minimum value of zero about one-third of 

the time--when financial vulnerabilities are assessed to be in the upper one-third of their 

historical distribution.12   

There are several potential advantages to building additional resilience through 

the CCyB.  First, countercyclical capital requirements are intended to lean against rising 

risks at a time when the degree of monetary tightening needed to achieve the same goal 

could be inconsistent with sustaining the expansion.  And countercyclical capital 

requirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy.  Second, the banks that are subject 

to the CCyB could achieve a modest buffer simply by safeguarding the capital they have 

built up or by reducing payouts moderately.  Third, the CCyB is a simple, predictable, 

and slow-moving tool that applies equally across all large banks.  It does not single out 

shortfalls in particular banks or result in hard-to-predict volatility in individual banks’ 

stressed capital requirements.  Finally and critically, the additional capital implied by the 

CCyB across the system can be released when conditions deteriorate to ensure the ability 

of large banks to lend into a downturn.  A number of countries have raised their CCyB 

setting above zero, and we can learn from their experiences, which have generally been 

positive.13   

Conclusion 

Our job now is to sustain the expansion by maintaining the economy around full 

employment and inflation near target.  Recent history suggests that the business cycle and
