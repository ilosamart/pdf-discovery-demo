exports reducing GDP by almost 3/4 percentage point in the data, compared with an 

estimated fall of 1 percentage point in the model. 

Looking forward, given that the effects of the stronger dollar play through 

gradually to the economy, there is good reason to expect that the drag on GDP growth 

from the stronger dollar will persist well into next year and likely spell continued 

weakness in the traded-goods-producing sectors of the economy that are especially 

exposed to the exchange rate.  Indeed, the more export-oriented manufacturing sector has 

already taken a hit during the past year and has experienced weaker growth than the 

broader economy.  

Turning now to inflation, consumer price inflation has been running well below 

the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, and the strong dollar has played an appreciable 

role in this shortfall.  One way in which the stronger dollar depresses inflation is by 

putting downward pressure on import prices.  Figure 4 uses an econometric model 

discussed in a recent speech by Chair Yellen to illustrate how a 10 percent appreciation 

of the dollar might play through to core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 

inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components.8  This particular 

model implies that core PCE inflation dips about 0.5 percent in the two quarters 

following the appreciation before gradually returning to baseline, which is consistent with 

a four-quarter decline in core PCE inflation of about 0.3 percent in the first year 

following the shock.  While the Board staff uses a range of models to gauge the effect of 

shocks, the model employed in figure 4--as well as other models used by staff--suggests 

that the dollar’s large appreciation will probably depress core PCE inflation between 

                                                   
8 This econometric model is described in the appendix to Yellen (2015).
