Lost and Stolen Securities Reporting
and Inquiry Requirements—
17 CFR 240.17F-1

A branch with deposits insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (reporting insti-
tution) must register with the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s designee, Securities
Information Center, Inc. (SIC) and report lost,
missing, stolen, or counterfeit securities to the
SIC. Each insured branch is responsible for
contacting the SIC to determine if securities
coming into its possession, whether by pledge,
transfer or some other manner, have been pre-
viously reported as missing, lost, stolen,
or counterfeit, except in certain limited
circumstances.

All functions within a branch that handle or
process securities are subject to the reporting
requirements. Only the transfer agent function is
exempt from the inquiry requirements. Accord-
ingly, all branch departments likely to be
affected, including the trust, investment, transfer
agent, custody or dealer departments, and the
lending operations as relating to margin loans,
should be familiar with the requirements set out
in 17 CFR 240.17F-1.

Securities exempt from the reporting require-
ments are:
