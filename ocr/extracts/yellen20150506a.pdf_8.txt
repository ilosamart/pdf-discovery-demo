(known as Single Point of Entry) to resolve a systemically important institution in an 

orderly manner.   

The crisis also revealed that risk management at large, complex financial 

institutions was insufficient to handle the risks that some firms had taken.  Compensation 

systems all too frequently failed to appropriately account for longer-term risks 

undertaken by employees.  And lax controls in some cases contributed to unethical and 

illegal behavior by banking organizations and their employees.  The Federal Reserve has 

made improving risk management and internal controls a top priority.  For example, the 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which includes the stress tests that I 

mentioned, also involves an evaluation to ensure firms have a sound process in place for 

measuring and monitoring the risks they are taking and for matching their capital levels 

to those risks.  Also, supervisors from the Fed and other agencies have pressed firms to 

improve their internal controls and to make their boards of directors more directly 

responsible for compensation decisions and employee conduct. 

Changes to Regulatory and Supervisory Focus 

As I noted, the financial crisis revealed weaknesses in our nation’s system for 

supervising and regulating the financial industry.  Prior to the crisis, regulatory agencies, 

including the Federal Reserve, focused on the safety and soundness of individual firms--

as required by their legislative mandate at the time--rather than the stability of the 

financial system as a whole.  Our regulatory system did not provide any supervisory 

watchdog with responsibility for identifying and addressing risks associated with 

activities and institutions that were outside the regulatory perimeter.  The rapid growth of 

the “shadow” nonbank financial sector left significant gaps in regulation.
