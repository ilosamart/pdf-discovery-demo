noncore sources of funding.  We have observed the increasing pressure on community 

banks to compete for deposits; however, we still see many community banks overcoming 

this challenge and effectively competing for deposits in their communities.  

Another key component of all community bank examinations is a focus on asset 

quality.  Financial indicators for agriculture banks remain at manageable levels as 

highlighted by the nonperforming agricultural loans to total loans ratio of 1.36 percent as 

of September 2018.   

In addition to the traditional focus on the financial factors related to agricultural 

lending, the Federal Reserve has provided examiners with helpful insights into the 

appropriate treatment of agricultural carryover debt.  We understand that bankers need to 

work constructively with borrowers when problems arise.  And this is particularly true for 

highly concentrated agricultural banks, where maintaining enhanced agricultural credit 

risk-management practices to facilitate prudent underwriting, early detection of problems, 

and well-thought-out restructuring plans for agricultural borrowers are imperative to 

limiting losses and maintaining a sound banking institution.   

In 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued guidance to the industry on key risk 

factors in agricultural lending and supervisory expectations for a financial institution’s 

risk-management practices.7  This guidance applies in all economic environments, but it 

is especially important in periods of economic stress, because it reminds bankers that the 

identification of a troubled borrower does not prohibit a banker from working with the 

borrower.
