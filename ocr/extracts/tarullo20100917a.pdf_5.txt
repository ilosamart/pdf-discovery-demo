mismatched entities like structured investment vehicles or financial institutions engaged in 

capital arbitrage under Basel II, not those held by end investors. 

A variant on this initial question is how much the legal environment for securitization 

should be changed in order to provide a source of stable short-term liquidity in wholesale 

funding markets.  Limiting securitization purchases to NFBs will surely result in some tailoring 

of ABS to the business models of NFBs, an outcome that might not be identical to a 

securitization market tailored to the funding needs of lenders providing credit to businesses and 

consumers.  Also, as I will explain later, the G-M proposal would require non-trivial changes in 

bank regulatory policy, as well as the significant extension of discount window access to a new 

kind of institution.  All this would be in pursuit of a mechanism for generating large amounts of 

liquidity.  A cost-benefit discussion is probably needed at the outset, with careful specification of 

the benefits of the repo market that G-M are trying to save, weighed against the likely impact  

on--among other things--the securitization market and regulatory system. 

A second set of questions concerns how the NFBs would operate in practice.  As a 

threshold matter, it is worth noting that policymakers may find the proposal to have a certain 

binary quality.  That is, it would structurally change the entire securitization market and a large 

portion of the repo market essentially overnight.  In effect, G-M put all securitization eggs into 

one basket.  If the new system worked well, the benefits presumably would be significant, and 

perhaps quickly realized.  Indeed, the new system might succeed in helping to restart, on a 

sounder basis, various ABS submarkets that remain largely dormant three years after the crisis 

began to unfold.3  If, on the other hand, the new system encountered major difficulties, there 

might be materially reduced adaptive capacity in other financial actors, possibly for a 

considerable period.
