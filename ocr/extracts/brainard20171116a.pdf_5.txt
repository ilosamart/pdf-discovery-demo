2008.12  Over 11 percent of student debt is more than 90 days delinquent or in default--and 

researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimate that this figure may understate 

the problem by as much as half.13   

Today, consumers navigate numerous weighty financial responsibilities for themselves 

and their dependents.14  It seems fair to assume they could use some help managing this 

complexity. In the Federal Reserve Board’s annual Survey of Household Economics and 

Decisionmaking (SHED), more than half of respondents reported that their spending exceeded 

their income in the prior year.15  Indeed, 44 percent of SHED respondents reported that they 

could not cover an emergency expense costing $400 without selling something or borrowing 

money.16 

New Tools to Help Consumers Manage Their Finances 

Given the complexity and importance of these decisions, it is encouraging to see the fast-

growing development of advanced, technology-enabled tools to help consumers navigate the

(“Student borrowers today owe $1.3 trillion, more than double the $611 billion owed nearly nine years ago. About 

one in 10 student borrowers is behind on repaying the loans, the highest delinquency rate of any type of loan tracked 

by the New York Fed’s quarterly household debt report.”); Jesse Bricker, Lisa J. Dettling, Alice Henriques, Joanne

rates for student loans are likely to understate effective delinquency rates because about half of these loans are 

currently in deferment, in grace periods or in forbearance and therefore temporarily not in the repayment cycle. This 

implies that among loans in the repayment cycle delinquency rates are roughly twice as high.” Id. n.2 ).
