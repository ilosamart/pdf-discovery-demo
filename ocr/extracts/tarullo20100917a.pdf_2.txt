 Broadly speaking, threats to financial stability can arise in two ways: first, through the 

rapid deterioration or failure of a large institution with leverage sufficient to have widespread 

knock-on effects and, second, through the breakdown of a significant market in which large 

numbers of leveraged actors depend upon similar sources of liquidity and, importantly, backup 

liquidity in periods of stress.  These two sources of systemic risk can be, and usually are, related.  

In fact, the severity of the recent crisis might be explained as an explosive combination of the 

two.  But the different origins of risk call for different or, perhaps more precisely, 

complementary, policy responses.1 

 To date, reform in financial regulation and supervision has focused mainly on large 

regulated institutions: Three examples are the just-announced Basel III capital rules, much of the 

Dodd-Frank Act, and the Federal Reserve’s revamping of its large holding company supervision.  

Of course, attention has also been paid to the second source of systemic risk, notably in Dodd-

Frank’s provisions for prudential supervision of payments, clearing, and settlement systems.  But 

more will need to be done in this area, particularly as new constraints applicable to large 

regulated institutions push more activity into the unregulated sector. 

This paper by Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick, “Regulating the Shadow Banking 

System” (G-M), fits squarely within this enterprise.  It builds on two important insights from 

work Gorton had pursued well before the financial crisis began:  First, that the enormous growth 

of the shadow banking system generally, and the repurchase agreement, or “repo,” market 

specifically, depended on the engineering of AAA-rated securities that led participants to believe 

they did not need to inquire into the soundness of the underlying collateral.  This financial 

engineering largely succeeded in insulating participants from idiosyncratic risk.  But when the 

value of whole classes of the underlying collateral was drawn into serious question, initially by
