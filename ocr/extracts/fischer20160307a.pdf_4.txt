(3) Monetary policy is described by a money supply or interest rate rule; 

(4) The credit markets and financial intermediation are built off links between the 

policy interest rate and the rates of return on, and/or demand and supply 

functions for, other assets; 

(5) The balance of payments and the exchange rate enter through the balance of 

payments identity, namely that the current account surplus must be equal to 

the capital account deficit, corrected for official intervention; 

(6) Dynamics of stocks:  There are dynamic equations for the capital stock, the 

stock of government debt, and the external debt. 

When I was an undergraduate at the London School of Economics (LSE) between 

1962 and 1965, we learned the IS-LM model, which combined the aggregate demand 

equation (1) with the money market equilibrium condition set out in (3).  That was the 

basic understanding of the Keynesian model as crystallized by John Hicks, Franco 

Modigliani, and others, in which it was easy to add detail to the demand functions for 

private-sector consumption, C; for investment, I; for government spending, G; and for net 

exports.  The Keynesian emphasis on aggregate demand and its determinants is one of the 

basic innovations of the Keynesian revolution, and one that makes it far easier to 

understand and explain what factors are determining output and employment.   

Continuing down the list, on price and wage dynamics, the Phillips curve has 

flattened somewhat since the 1950s and 1960s.3  Further, the role of expectations of 

inflation in the Phillips curve has been developed far beyond what was understood when 

A.W. Phillips--who was a New Zealander, an LSE faculty member, and a statistician and
