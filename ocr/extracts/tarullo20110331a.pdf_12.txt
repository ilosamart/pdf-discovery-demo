second half of 2008.  In future supervisory exercises of this sort, we will need to find additional 

ways to take account of co-movement effects. 

The Unfinished Agenda 

  Even this brief and selective sketch of some elements of a regulatory regime for systemic 

risk reveals important issues that have yet to be tackled in the reform agenda.  Mindful of my 

time constraints, I will limit myself to identifying two. 

 The first issue arises from my suggestion that, to a considerable extent, potential 

contagion effects are best contained by directly addressing them, rather than by trying to 

indirectly address them through designating large numbers of nonbank-affiliated institutions 

under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  This direct approach would, I believe, yield maximum 

financial stability benefits at the lowest cost to financial intermediation, financial firms, and 

financial supervisors.  But these benefits obviously depend on these better targeted forms of 

regulation actually being developed and implemented. 

 In this regard, it is noteworthy that while the term “shadow banking system”6 has taken 

its place in the lexicon of policymakers alongside “systemic risk” and “financial stability,” 

comparatively little has been done to regulate the channels of capital flows in which one or both 

transacting parties lie outside the perimeter of prudentially supervised institutions.  This despite 

the often considerable degree of leverage and maturity transformation associated with many of 

these channels.  In part, the relative lack of reform directed at the shadow banking system is a 

result of the fact that it was substantially disrupted by the financial crisis, and that some of its 

more unstable parts have fortunately disappeared.  Yet there are certainly significant pieces that 

have survived and that serve important purposes in financial markets.  I have already mentioned
