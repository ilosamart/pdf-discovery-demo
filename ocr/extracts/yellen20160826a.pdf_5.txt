to adjust.  What we do know, however, is that we want a policy toolkit that will allow us 

to respond to a wide range of possible conditions.  

The Pre-Crisis Toolkit   

Prior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit was 

simple but effective in the circumstances that then prevailed.  Our main tool consisted of 

open market operations to manage the amount of reserve balances available to the 

banking sector.3  These operations, in turn, influenced the interest rate in the federal 

funds market, where banks experiencing reserve shortfalls could borrow from banks with 

excess reserves.  Before the onset of the crisis, the volume of reserves was generally 

small--only about $45 billion or so.4  Thus, even small open market operations could 

have a significant effect on the federal funds rate.  Changes in the federal funds rate 

would then be transmitted to other short-term interest rates, affecting longer-term interest 

rates and overall financial conditions and hence inflation and economic activity.  This 

simple, light-touch system allowed the Federal Reserve to operate with a relatively small 

balance sheet--less than $1 trillion before the crisis--the size of which was largely 

determined by the need to supply enough U.S. currency to meet demand.5    

The global financial crisis revealed two main shortcomings of this simple toolkit.  

The first was an inability to control the federal funds rate once reserves were no longer 

                                                 
3 Open market operations at the time were primarily repurchase agreements based on Treasury securities, 

with primary dealers as counterparties. 
4 Reserves of depository institutions include vault cash and balances maintained with Federal Reserve 

Banks.  Excess reserves are the reserves held over and above required reserves.  See the Board’s webpage 

“Reserve Requirements” at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm.  
5 Prior to the financial crisis, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was about $900 billion.  Assets consisted 

almost entirely of Treasury securities.  Liabilities included currency held by the public and a relatively 

small volume of reserve balances.  For more on the Fed’s balance sheet, see
