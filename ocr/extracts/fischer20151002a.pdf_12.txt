believe we need more research into the question.  I also struggle in trying to find 

consistency between the certainty that many have that higher interest rates would have 

prevented the Global Financial Crisis and the view that the interest rate should not be 

used to deal with potential financial instabilities.  Perhaps that problem can be solved by 

seeking to distinguish between a situation in which the interest rate is not at its short-run 

natural rate and one in which asset-pricing problems are sector specific. 

Of course, we should not exaggerate.  It is one thing to say we have no 

macroprudential tools and another to say that having more macroprudential measures--

particularly in the area of housing finance--could provide major financial stability 

benefits.  It also seems likely that monetary policy should be used for macroprudential 

purposes with an eye to the tradeoffs between reduced financial imbalances, price 

stability, and maximum employment.  In this regard, a number of recent research papers 

have begun to frame the issue in terms of such tradeoffs, although this is a new area that 

deserves further research.17   

It may also be fruitful for researchers to continue investigating the deployment of 

new or little-used monetary policy tools.  For example, it is arguable that reserve 

requirements--a traditional monetary policy instrument--can be viewed as a 

macroprudential tool.  In addition, some research has begun to ask important questions 

about the size and structure of monetary authority liabilities in fostering financial 

stability.18
