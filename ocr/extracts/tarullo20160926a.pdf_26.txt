First, of course, is the elimination of the qualitative portion of CCAR for nearly all the 

firms with less than $250 billion in assets, along with some record keeping and reporting 

requirements.   

The second key feature is the differential impact the better alignment of CCAR with our 

capital regulations will have on the roughly 30 firms that are covered.  Let me note at the outset 

that the precise effects on the capital requirements of individual firms cannot be determined 

because of the very nature of the stress test regime.  The scenarios vary from year to year, and 

the resulting projected effects on losses and revenues may also vary materially depending on the 

composition of a firmâ€™s balance sheet and activities.  However, to provide some idea of what the 

impact may be, we assessed how the various changes I have mentioned would have affected 

capital requirements in the two most recent CCAR cycles.  On average for the eight GSIBs, 

integration of the surcharge with the post-stress requirements would have been somewhat less 

than half offset by the simplifying changes in the prefunding of capital distributions and balance 

sheet assumptions.  The impact on capital requirements will likely be greater for firms with 

larger GSIB surcharges. 

For the other CCAR firms, for which there are no capital surcharges, these simplifying 

assumptions will result in some reduction of post-stress capital requirements.  We estimate that 

the aggregate impact of these changes for the CCAR firms as a whole should be a modest 

increase in the total amount of required capital.  But this increase will be totally due to the 

impact on the eight GSIB firms, whose increased capital requirements will more than offset the 

reductions for the other firms. 

 In short, the GSIBs will see their capital requirements rise.  All other CCAR firms will 

see some reduction in their capital requirements.  And firms that have less than $250 billion in
