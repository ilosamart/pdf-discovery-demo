In fact, observation of the stress test results over time has given the banks--as well as 

analysts and other outside parties--a reasonable idea of the loss functions and other elements of 

the supervisory model.  And the Federal Reserve has increased over time the amount of 

information it discloses about its stress test models.  But there are very good reasons not to 

publish the model itself.  In the first place, remember why this exercise is called a stress test.  

This is not a case of using a model to set a regulation that stands on its own as a constraint, and 

then testing to see if there is compliance with the rule.  There, the model is essentially the 

reasoning by which the regulation was set.  Even in a case where the test is independent of the 

regulatory end, risks exist, as we saw in the Volkswagen case, where the company is said to have 

designed its cars to pass the required emissions test but not to actually achieve the regulatory 

goal of reduced emissions.   

In the financial area, the dangers of disclosure are much greater.  We are trying to 

evaluate what may happen to a bankâ€™s assets under stress.  If a bank has the model, it will be able 

to optimize its balance sheet for the day on which the stress test is to apply by shifting into assets 

for which relatively lower loss functions apply.  But it can then shift those assets back over 

succeeding days or weeks.  Thus, the test will give a misleading picture of the actual 

vulnerabilities of the firm.  In this and other ways, banks would use the models to guide changes 

in their behavior that do not change the risk they pose to financial stability, but do change the 

measured results of the stress test.  Regulators and academics have long recognized that this type 

of behavior by banks, known as regulatory capital arbitrage, has been a persistent threat to 

financial stability.  Additionally, giving the firms the model will likely encourage increased
