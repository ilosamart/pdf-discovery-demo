outside the perimeter of prudential regulation.  The breaking of the buck by the Reserve Primary 

Fund following Lehmanâ€™s collapse triggered a run on the shadow banking system that required 

unprecedented support by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.   

 The process established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 

Act for designation of systemically important non-bank firms has provided a means for ensuring 

that the perimeter of prudential regulation can be extended as appropriate to cover large shadow 

banking institutions.  The proposals of the Securities and Exchange Commission on money 

market fund regulation are a response to continuing vulnerabilities as well as to the run in the fall 

of 2008.  These are important initiatives that will contribute to a safer system of funding 

throughout the financial system.  Yet the risk of contagious runs would persist even in the 

absence of individually systemic institutions.  And with less vulnerable money market funds, 

other cash-rich entities could emerge as a source of inexpensive funding for the shadow banking 

system.  Finally, as I have noted, the systemic risks associated with short-term wholesale funding 

in prudentially regulated institutions have not fully been countered by the important capital and 

liquidity standards adopted since the crisis.  My purpose today has been to reinforce the point 

that a sounder, more stable financial system requires a more comprehensive reform agenda.
