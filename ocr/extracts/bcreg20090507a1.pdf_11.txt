Figure 2 shows the ratio of total estimated two-year losses to year-end 2008 risk-weighted 

assets (RWA) in the more adverse scenario for the 19 participating BHCs. Clearly, there is substantial 

variation across firms in the size of estimated losses rates, reflecting differences in business lines and 

asset quality. The median loss-to-RWA ratio equals 7.5 percent, and the ratio ranges from 3.0 percent 

to 11.8 percent across the firms. These estimates are not forecasts of expected losses, but are 

estimates of losses that would occur under economic conditions more stressed than anticipated. Higher 

loss estimates do not necessarily imply a need for more capital to meet the SCAP buffer, as some firms 

will also have higher estimated resources and capital.

The next five charts illustrate selected loss rates by loan type across the 19 BHCs. Loss rates are 

calculated as cumulative, two-year losses divided by beginning-of-period loan balances. The loss rates 

do not reflect adjustments to recognize write-downs of loan portfolios acquired during mergers. The 

charts also show the median loss rate across the firms. 

As with overall losses, there are significant differences in loss rates by loan type across BHCs. 

For example, while the median two-year loss rate on first-lien mortgages was 8 percent across the 15 

BHCs with a material amount of mortgages, the rates varied f rom a low of 3.4 percent to a high of nearly 

12 percent. For second and junior lien mortgages, the range among 14 BHCs was 6 percent to 21 

percent, and a median rate of about 13 percent. Such variation reflects substantial differences in the 

portfolios across the BHCs, by borrower characteristics such as FICO scores, and loan characteristics such 

as loan-to-value ratio, year of origination, and geography. These differences result in significant 

variation in loss estimates at the f irm level as compared with applying a single loss rate per asset 

category to all BHCs.
