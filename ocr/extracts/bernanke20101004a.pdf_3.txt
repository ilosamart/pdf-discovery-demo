national income for the fiscal years 2005 to 2007, prior to the onset of the recession and 

financial crisis.  The recent deterioration was largely the result of a sharp decline in tax 

revenues brought about by the recession and the subsequent slow recovery, as well as by 

increases in federal spending needed to alleviate the recession and stabilize the financial 

system.  As a result of these deficits, the accumulated federal debt measured relative to 

national income has increased to a level not seen since the aftermath of World War II. 

For now, the budget deficit has stabilized and, so long as the economy and 

financial markets continue to recover, it should narrow relative to national income over 

the next few years.  Economic conditions provide little scope for reducing deficits 

significantly further over the next year or two; indeed, premature fiscal tightening could 

put the recovery at risk.  Over the medium- and long-term, however, the story is quite 

different.  If current policy settings are maintained, and under reasonable assumptions 

about economic growth, the federal budget will be on an unsustainable path in coming 

years, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising at an 

increasing pace.2

Term Budget Outlook (Washington:  CBO, June (revised August)), available at 
www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11579&zzz=40884.  Stabilizing the ratio of federal debt to national income 
requires that spending on everything other than interest payments on the debt be brought into rough 
alignment with tax revenues over time.  Equivalently, the so-called primary budget deficit (the budget 
deficit exclusive of interest payments) must be reduced to zero. 

  Moreover, as the national debt grows, so will the associated interest 

payments, which in turn will lead to further increases in projected deficits.  Expectations 

of large and increasing deficits in the future could inhibit current household and business 

spending--for example, by reducing confidence in the longer-term prospects for the 

economy or by increasing uncertainty about future tax burdens and government 

spending--and thus restrain the recovery.  Concerns about the governmentâ€™s long-run
