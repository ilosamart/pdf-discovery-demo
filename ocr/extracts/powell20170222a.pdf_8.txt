policy is a factor in holding down longer-term yields.  But longer-term rates have been 

declining for more than 30 years, for several reasons.  Much of the decline is due to 

significantly lower long-term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term 

premiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored 

inflation expectations, nominal bonds have become an attractive hedge against market 

risk.  Regulatory changes have raised demand for safe assets.  Lower potential growth 

implies lower returns and therefore lower rates.  Changes in savings and investment 

demand owing to demographics and other factors have put downward pressure on yields 

as well. 

As a result, the real federal funds rate that is neither contractionary nor 

expansionary when the economy is operating near its potential--the so-called neutral real 

rate or r*--has declined significantly.  We cannot directly observe the neutral rate but can 

only infer it from the evolution of the economy--it “is seen by its works.”10  The neutral 

rate changes significantly over time, and estimates of its level entail substantial 

uncertainty.11  Before the crisis, the longer-run neutral real rate was generally thought to 

be roughly stable at around 2.25 percent.  Since the crisis, estimates have declined 

steadily.  For example, the median estimate implied by FOMC participants stood at 1.0 

percent in the December 2016 SEP.  Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even
