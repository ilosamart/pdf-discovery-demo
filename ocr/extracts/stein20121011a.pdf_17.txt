The current cheapness of long-term debt contrasts with the pre-crisis 

configuration, where there was frequently a pronounced premium favoring issuers not at 

the long end of the yield curve, but at the very short end.  In other words, the fact that the 

yield curve often tended to be steeply upwards sloping at the front end gave financial 

firms a strong incentive to issue overnight paper.  The bottom line is that I suspect that 

LSAPs have, by changing the structure of term premiums in the market, helped 

encourage an extension of debt maturity by both financial and nonfinancial firms.  All 

else being equal, this development is a good thing from a financial stability perspective.21 

To conclude, I believe that our recently announced policy of MBS purchases, 

coupled with the change in our forward guidance, are strong positive steps.  I am hopeful 

that these actions by the Federal Reserve will help to give economic growth a much 

needed boost.  At the same time, I am keenly aware of the many uncertainties we still 

have about the workings of nonconventional policies, and of LSAPs in particular.  As I 

have tried to explain, LSAPs really are a different animal, and it is important for us to try 

to better understand these differences, and to do our best to take them into account when 

making policy judgments.  In short, there is a lot left for us to learn.  Thank you very 

much. 


                                                                                                                                                 
tendency in historical U.S. data:  When government debt maturity is low, expected returns (that is, term 
premiums) on long-term bonds are low as well, and private firms fill in the gaps by lengthening their own 
debt maturity. 
21 Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein (2012) make a similar argument in the context of Treasury debt maturity, 
and its potential effect on financial stability goals.
