Other indicators from the labor market have also shown some improvement 

recently.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have declined since last summer, 

and the number of job openings appears to be increasing.  I hope these indicators mean 

we are turning the corner on some of the painful costs associated with being unemployed 

or underemployed in America.     

Turning to inflation, recent data show that price pressures have remained 

subdued.  Both total and core inflation were only about 1 percent over the 12 months 

ending in March, below the FOMCâ€™s long-run objective of 2 percent.  Inflation is being 

restrained by the continued slack in labor and product markets, while stable inflation 

expectations have offset disinflationary pressures to some extent.  Moreover, the increase 

in gasoline prices that we saw earlier in the year appears to have fully reversed, and the 

path of oil futures prices is downward-sloping, suggesting that energy prices are likely to 

hold down headline inflation rates in the years ahead.   

The Economic Outlook 

Let me now turn to the outlook.  As my Federal Reserve colleagues and I have 

noted in the past, the pace of the economic recovery has been restrained by lingering 

effects of the financial crisis.  Assessing the current strength of the headwinds related to 

these lingering effects is an important determinant of the economic outlook for the 

coming years.   

Unfortunately, current federal fiscal policy is one headwind to the recovery that 

has intensified this year.  In fact, federal fiscal policy has been tightening since 2011, 

after having been quite expansionary during the recession and early in the recovery.
