contingent workers have increased by roughly one-half and now make up 16 percent of 

the workforce.  This rapid increase is in marked contrast to the preceding decade, when 

contingent workers remained at a relatively stable 10 percent of the workforce, according 

to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) CWS.3  They conclude that all of the net growth 

in aggregate employment in the decade leading up to 2015 can be accounted for by 

contingent work arrangements, which means there has been no net employment growth in 

traditional work arrangements.  Given that this period spanned the Great Recession and 

the first five years of a slow recovery, it naturally raises the question of how much of the 

large recent shift toward contingent work is attributable to cyclical factors, as opposed to 

structural forces that may be here to stay.4  

Long before the advent of firms such as Uber and TaskRabbit, many individuals 

worked in contingent arrangements, such as freelancing and contracting, and it is these 

groups that have increased their share of the workforce most notably over the past 

decade.  The largest increase in contingent work over this time has been among workers 

whose services are contracted out by another company, which rose from 0.6 percent to 

3.1 percent of the workforce.  There was also a large increase in workers who are 

independent contractors, consultants, or freelancers, whose share grew from 6.9 percent

4 The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) study of the contingent workforce shows an increase 

of 5 percentage points in the share of contingent work arrangements, although this shift took place from 

2006 to 2010.  The GAO’s definition of contingent work covers a much larger share of the workforce, 

40.4 percent in 2010, than the CWS.  See U.S. Government Accountability Office (2015). 

     In the same vein, a 2014 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that roughly 44 percent of 

its survey’s respondents participated in some informal paid work activity during the previous two years.
