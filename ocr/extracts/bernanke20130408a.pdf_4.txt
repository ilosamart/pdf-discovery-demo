situation that prevailed at that time.  The economy was in deep recession, with the 

unemployment rate having risen 4 percentage points, from 5 percent to 9 percent, over 

the preceding 12 months.  The prices of real estate and equities had plummeted, interest 

rate spreads--such as the spread between rates on mortgages and Treasury securities--had 

widened to unprecedented levels, and securitization markets had frozen.  Write-downs 

and losses continued to deplete banks’ capital, unnerving investors and counterparties and 

exacerbating the severe funding pressures faced by many institutions.  In the face of this 

instability, in 2008 and 2009 policymakers had taken a range of extraordinary measures:  

The Federal Reserve supplied liquidity to banks and other financial institutions, helping 

to calm the panic and begin the process of restoring the flow of credit to households and 

businesses; the Treasury Department guaranteed money market funds and injected capital 

into banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Congress expanded deposit 

insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and the FDIC 

guaranteed banks’ issuance of long-term debt.  And, as I noted, the SCAP helped to 

increase confidence in the banking system and restore banks’ access to private capital 

markets.  Ten of the 19 large bank holding companies that underwent the SCAP were 

required to raise equity capital--by $75 billion in total. 

 Today the economy is significantly stronger than it was four years ago, although 

conditions are clearly still far from where we would all like them to be.  Because bank 

credit for households and businesses is critical to continued economic expansion, it is 

positive for the recovery that banks are also notably stronger than they were a few years 

ago.  For example, premiums on bank credit default swaps have fallen by more than half 

of their 2009 levels, and other measures of bank risk have also declined substantially.
