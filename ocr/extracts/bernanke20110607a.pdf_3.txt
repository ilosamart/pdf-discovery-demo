largely reflecting gains in equity values--and lower debt burdens have also increased 

consumersâ€™ willingness to spend.  On the negative side, households are facing some 

significant headwinds, including increases in food and energy prices, declining home 

values, continued tightness in some credit markets, and still-high unemployment, all of 

which have taken a toll on consumer confidence.  

 Developments in the labor market will be of particular importance in setting the 

course for household spending.  As you know, the jobs situation remains far from normal.  

For example, aggregate hours of production workers--a comprehensive measure of labor 

input that reflects the extent of part-time employment and opportunities for overtime as 

well as the number of people employed--fell, remarkably, by nearly 10 percent from the 

beginning of the recent recession through October 2009.  Although hours of work have 

increased during the expansion, this measure still remains about 6-1/2 percent below its 

pre-recession level.  For comparison, the maximum decline in aggregate hours worked in 

the deep 1981-82 recession was less than 6 percent.  Other indicators, such as total 

payroll employment, the ratio of employment to population, and the unemployment rate, 

paint a similar picture.  Particularly concerning is the very high level of long-term 

unemployment--nearly half of the unemployed have been jobless for more than six 

months.  People without work for long periods can find it increasingly difficult to obtain 

a job comparable to their previous one, as their skills tend to deteriorate over time and as 

employers are often reluctant to hire the long-term unemployed. 

 Although the jobs market remains quite weak and progress has been uneven, 

overall we have seen signs of gradual improvement.  For example, private-sector payrolls 

increased at an average rate of about 180,000 per month over the first five months of this
