information, including measures of labor market conditions, 

indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 

readings on financial and international developments.  The 

Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target 

range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further 

improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that 

inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium 

term. 

Can the Committee be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 

percent objective over the medium term”?  As I have discussed, given the apparent 

stability of inflation expectations, there is good reason to believe that inflation will move 

higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further.  While some effects of the 

rise in the dollar may be spread over time, some of the effects on inflation are likely 

already starting to fade.  The same is true for last year’s sharp fall in oil prices, though the 

further declines we have seen this summer have yet to fully show through to the 

consumer level.  And slack in the labor market has continued to diminish, so the 

downward pressure on inflation from that channel should be diminishing as well. 

In addition, with regard to expectations of inflation, it is possible to consult the 

results of the SEP, the Survey of Economic Projections, which FOMC participants 

complete shortly before the March, June, September, and December meetings.  In the 

June SEP, the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for core PCE inflation 

was 1.3 percent to 1.4 percent this year, 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent next year, and 1.9 

percent to 2.0 percent in 2017.  There will be a new SEP for the forthcoming September 

meeting of the FOMC.
