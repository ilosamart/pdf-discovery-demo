Third, Basel III makes extensive changes to the risk weights assigned to a financial 

institution’s traded assets and counterparty exposures.  As I mentioned earlier, the market-risk 

requirements of the pre-crisis capital regime were woefully inadequate.  In many instances, they 

simply did not reflect the actual risk assumed by an institution.  They also created an invitation to 

arbitrage credit risks by turning them into traded assets with lower risk weights.  It is also 

noteworthy that the changes in risk weights incorporate some elements of a macroprudential 

perspective as, for example, in higher capital requirements on equity investments in other 

financial firms and credit exposures to large financial firms   

Fourth, Basel III provides for a minimum leverage ratio, roughly similar to requirements 

already applicable under national law in the United States and Canada.  While the terms of this 

leverage requirement have been agreed to, there will be a supervisory monitoring period and then 

a parallel run to assess its impact, particularly in countries with no history of such a requirement, 

and to provide for adjustments if warranted. 

Finally, Basel III has a rather lengthy and complicated transition period, with the new 

requirements to be phased in between January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2019.  We favored a 

significant transition period, so as to allow firms flexibility in adjusting to the new regime 

through such means as running off higher risk-weighted assets, adjusting their business models 

gradually, or using retained earnings to add any new capital that might be required under the new 

rules.  To be honest, however, we did not think the transition period needed to stretch over eight 

years.  In fact, it appears that most U.S. banking entities expect to meet the new requirements 

considerably sooner.  However, the lengthy transition period was an important inducement for 

some countries to agree to the new, much stronger standards.
