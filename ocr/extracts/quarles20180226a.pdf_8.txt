that new investment is a necessary step for the spread of new technologies, especially if 

technology is embodied in capital equipment.  Spending on research and development, an 

important input for technological advances, has been fairly subdued following the crisis.  

Also, the aftermath of the crisis has been associated with a decrease in business 

dynamism--for example, the rate at which new start-up firms are being created has 

declined.9 

Have We Reached a Turning Point? 

Having laid out the standard explanations for the slow pace of growth, I will now 

speculate on what a shift to a higher growth path might look like and what I think we may 

want to watch for.   

One factor that has certainly turned is fiscal policy.  After subtracting from 

growth over much of the period from 2011 onward, the impetus from fiscal policy has 

turned distinctly positive with the passage of recent tax and budget legislation.10  Fiscal 

policy is likely to impart considerable momentum to growth over the next couple of years 

not only by increasing demand, but also by boosting, to some degree, the potential 

capacity of the economy. 

Of course, while stimulative in the near run, deficit spending--and the associated 

large and growing federal government debt--can have negative effects on the economy 

over the longer term, in part by claiming a larger share of the nation’s savings, driving up 

long-term interest rates, and crowding out productive private investment.  These effects 

will require attention and difficult decisions at some point.
