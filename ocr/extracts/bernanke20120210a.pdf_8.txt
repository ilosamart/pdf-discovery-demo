short, housing problems affect the homebuilding industry, of course, but also have much 

broader effects--on neighborhoods and communities, on homeowners, on the financial 

system, and on the vitality of the economy as a whole.  This observation underscores the 

importance of efforts to improve the condition of the housing market. 

Availability of Mortgage Credit    

So why has the recovery in housing been so slow?  One important factor is 

restraints on mortgage credit.  Since its peak in 2007, U.S. home mortgage credit 

outstanding has contracted about 13 percent in real terms.  In prior recoveries, mortgage 

credit had begun to grow four years after the business cycle peak--but not this time 

around.

One reason for the very slow recovery in mortgage credit, despite monetary 

policy actions that have helped drive mortgage rates to historically low levels, is that 

many lending institutions have tightened underwriting conditions dramatically, relative to 

the pre-recession period.

  Given the lax standards during the credit boom, some 

tightening was doubtless appropriate to protect consumers and ensure lenders’ safety and 

soundness.  However, current lending practices appear to reflect, in part, obstacles that 

are limiting or preventing lending even to creditworthy households.

nonfinancial business credit--around business cycle peaks since 1952, see Diana Hancock and Rochelle M.

 For example, bank responses to the Federal Reserve Board’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion 

Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicate net tightening in lending standards for mortgage originated 

from 2007 through 2009.  Surveys since then have yet to provide evidence of unwinding that tightness even 

for prime mortgages that can be backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal 

Housing Administration.
