Additionally, in a dynamic economy in which job requirements are evolving more 

rapidly than ever, individuals already in the workforce need opportunities to improve 

their skills throughout their lives.  There are many ways to provide such opportunities.  

For example, community colleges and vocational schools train and retrain workers, often 

in close collaboration with private employers, and in many cases they perform this 

function at a relatively low cost.  Although helping workers acquire up-to-date skills is 

always important, it is especially critical now, when long spells of unemployment are 

threatening the longer-term employability and productivity of many. 

Conclusion 

Tonight I have highlighted some of the fiscal challenges faced by elected 

officials, both in New York and in other regions.  In the past few years, the weak 

economy has significantly reduced government revenues, which in turn has forced 

governments to make difficult decisions on spending and taxes.  An improving economy 

should help, but state and local finances will remain under pressure for some time.  

Moreover, states and localities are facing difficult longer-run issues related to pension 

and health-related expenses for their retired employees.  These challenges are daunting 

indeed, but meeting them will be essential to ensuring that our resilient and dynamic 

economy delivers rising living standards to the citizens of New York and to our nation as 

a whole.
