currently operates inevitably leads to misaligned incentives and a propensity to defer 

costly investments, a more significant re-thinking of the basic business model must also 

be undertaken if we are to avoid repeating prior mistakes. 

 I realize that Iâ€™m painting a rather gloomy picture.  But be assured that I do 

believe that we can make real progress on the ground through coordinated public and 

private action.  Let me conclude by talking a little bit about what the Federal Reserve and 

others are doing to address these issues.   

Although foreclosure practices have traditionally been--and rightfully should 

remain--a domain of the states, the Federal Reserve has been expanding its expertise in 

working with the industry--first, in a review of non-bank subsidiaries in conjunction with 

other state and federal regulators, and, currently, with a review of loan modification 

practices by certain servicers.  As the current servicing issues began to emerge more 

clearly, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies initiated an in-depth 

review of practices at the largest mortgage servicing operations.  The review focuses on 

foreclosure practices generally, but with a concentration on the breakdowns that seem to 

have led to inaccurate affidavits and other questionable legal documents being used in the 

foreclosure process.  When the interagency review is completed, we will have more 

information about the extent and significance of these very troubling practices, as well as 

an understanding of what must be done to prevent them in the future.  We have also 

solicited information and input from other knowledgeable sources, including NCLC, to 

help us better direct our actions to detect possible systematic problems at specific 

servicers or within the industry at large.
