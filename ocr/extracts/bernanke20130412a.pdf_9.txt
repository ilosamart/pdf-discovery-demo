Accelerating Transformative Development in Communities 

These examples illustrate the benefits of broad-based collaboration for 

rejuvenating communities that, in some cases, have been in decline for decades.  

Research is helping sharpen this approach and give more insight into what works.  For 

example, in 2009, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston researchers evaluated the effects of 

concentrated poverty in Springfield, Massachusetts, as part of a larger study conducted by 

the Federal Reserve System.  Intrigued by the results, the Boston Fed researchers turned 

their attention to trying to identify the factors that make it possible for some cities to 

adjust to changing economic conditions while others languish.  To do this, the researchers 

identified 25 midsize manufacturing cities around the country that were similar to 

Springfield in 1960, when that city was at the height of its prosperity, and asked what 

accounted for the differences in the economic trajectories experienced by this group of 

cities over the past 50 years.  Remarkably, their analysis indicated that industry mix, 

demographic makeup, and geographic location made less difference to success than the 

presence of a community leader and collaboration around a vision for the future.  In some 

cases, leadership came in the form of an energetic mayor, but not always.  In fact, the 

study found that leadership could come from almost anywhere.  The successful leader

 Researchers found that each 1 percent increase in 90-day mortgage delinquencies over a one-year period 

was associated with a 3 percent increase in hospital admissions due to child physical abuse and a 5 percent 

increase in admissions due to traumatic brain injury suspected to be caused by child abuse.
