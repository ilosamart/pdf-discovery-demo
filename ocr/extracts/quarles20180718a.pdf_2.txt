I want to thank the American Bankers Association for inviting me to speak.1  This 

is an era of relatively rapid evolution in banking regulation, an area of human endeavor 

that is not commonly known for its speedy metamorphoses.  But in the time since I 

became the Vice Chairman for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, we have seen 

agreement on the final pieces of the international framework for post-crisis regulation--

the so-called Basel III endgame.  The Federal Reserve has issued a number of proposed 

rule changes that would improve our capital and stress testing regime.  And in late May, 

the Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection 

Act (EGRRCPA), which, among other things, directs us to further tailor our supervision 

and regulation of large banks with more than $100 billion in assets.  In other words, the 

Congress wants to see action and has, to a certain degree, specified some of the steps we 

need to take.  How we respond to that task, especially as it applies to large banks, will be 

the focus of my remarks today.  

But before I delve into those details, I want to provide an overview of what I hope 

you’ll take away.  

First, I want to underscore that I believe tailoring of financial regulation is good 

public policy.  The Federal Reserve Board is a firm adherent of the recent legislation’s 

underlying principle that regulation should be tailored to risk.  To an extent, as I will later 

describe, this principle is already embedded in several aspects of our supervisory 

framework.

Reserve System.
