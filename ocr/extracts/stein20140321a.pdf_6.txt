non-operational.  So I will turn to measurement in a moment.  But it is worth noting one 

useful qualitative observation that emerges just from the logic and from the nature of a 

quadratic loss function.  In making the tradeoff I just described, the marginal benefit of 

using easier policy to reduce the expected unemployment gap is greater when the gap 

itself is large--that is, when unemployment is far above target.  In this case, even a quite 

high level of financial vulnerability may not imply a much different stance of monetary 

policy than would fall out of a more traditional analysis.  However, as the unemployment 

gap shrinks, financial stability risks loom larger in relative terms, so an analysis that takes 

them on board may lead to more of an adjustment in the stance of policy. 

Okay, But How Do You Measure Financial Market Vulnerability? 

Financial Sector Leverage 

At an abstract level, the framework that I have sketched corresponds closely to 

that in Woodford’s work, although his model is much more fully articulated.  When it 

gets down to implementation, Woodford suggests that the most natural measure of 

financial market vulnerability is a variable that captures “leverage in the financial sector.”  

In other words, faced with unemployment above target, he would have monetary policy 

be less accommodative, all else being equal, when financial-sector leverage is high.  This 

recommendation rests on three key premises.  First, when financial-sector leverage is 

high, the probability of a severe crisis in which multiple large intermediaries become 

insolvent is elevated--that is, we are more likely to have a replay of what happened in 

2008 and 2009.  Second, easy monetary policy is asserted to increase the incentives for 

the financial sector to lever up.  And, third, focusing on leverage as opposed to asset 

prices avoids putting the central bank in the position of having to “spot bubbles”:  Even if
