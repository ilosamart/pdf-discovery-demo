But the reduction in the availability of credit is not the whole story.  There is also less 

demand for credit by sound firms.  As businesses reduced inventory levels and capital spending, 

they tended to pay down debt and build cash positions.  Indeed, in the most recent NFIB study, 

34 percent of businesses reported lower sales as their biggest problem while only 3 percent cited 

lack of credit.  And while some potential borrowers seek less credit, others are no longer 

qualified to borrow.  Weakened balance sheets, reduced income, falling real estate collateral 

values, and in some cases, a recent history of payment problems have made it difficult for some 

businesses and consumers to qualify for loans, especially under the current stricter standards. 

Other factors unique to the current financial environment may also be weighing on the 

ability of small businesses to borrow.  A significant portion of small businesses rely on the 

owners’ personal assets and credit to fund their operations.  As a result, small businesses are 

affected by tight consumer credit conditions, in addition to an unfavorable business credit 

climate.  Many small business owners rely on their homes or business real estate to secure their 

business loans.  As collateral values have declined, their borrowing capacity has been reduced. 

Finally, small business lending often is based on relationships that are solidified over time. 

Sometimes those relationships are broken as a result of the bank’s inability to lend, such as when 

the bank fails or when it reduces lending because of strains on or concentrations in its own 

portfolio.  Small businesses may then find it quite difficult to establish similar arrangements with 

a new bank.  

Given the challenges facing small businesses, the Federal Reserve has sought to ease the 

flow of credit and better understand the nuances of the credit tightening.  Ultimately, the most 

effective way for policymakers to improve credit availability to small businesses, as well as other 

businesses and households, is to undertake efforts that support a sustainable economic recovery.
