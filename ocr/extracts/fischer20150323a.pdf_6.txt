Nonetheless, a number of potential costs might be associated with unconventional 

tools.  When interest rates are extremely low, risks to financial stability might grow.  In 

addition, elevated securities holdings could reduce the Fed’s income and remittances to 

the U.S. Treasury when rates eventually rise.10   

Further, the Fed’s quantitative easing appeared significantly to affect foreign asset 

markets, and to have contributed to a surge of capital inflows to emerging-market 

economies (EMEs).11  Our asset purchase programs were even called a “currency war.”  

However, eventually, most EMEs seemed glad to receive those flows.  Interestingly, the 

asset purchases recently announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) appear to be 

putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates in the United States.  In addition, 

the ECB’s policy should increase growth in Europe, which will be beneficial for U.S. 

exports.  Although some of these benefits may be offset by the recent appreciation of the 

dollar, much of that increase likely reflects other factors including the relatively strong 

performance of the U.S. economy.   

Looking back, there is ample evidence that supports the view that the Fed’s asset 

purchases contributed to a stronger U.S. recovery, by raising the prices of the assets 

purchased and close substitutes, as well as those of riskier assets.12  Our experience also 

10 For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s remittances, see Yellen (2013).  Though it is likely that 
remittances to the Treasury will decline later in the decade as interest rates increase, such developments 
would not impair the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy, and it is highly likely that average 
annual remittances over the period affected by our asset purchases will be higher than pre-crisis norms.  In 
addition, the asset purchases also affect Treasury revenue by lifting economic activity and thereby tax 
revenue, as well as by lowering interest rates and thereby debt service costs. 
11 Regarding the effects on foreign asset markets, see Neely (2011); Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub 
(2013); and Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014).  Regarding the effects on EMEs, it appears that both 
conventional and unconventional policies in the United States--among other factors--have driven capital 
flows into EMEs.  See, for example, Ahmed and Zlate (2014) and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014).
