III. The Fed’s Responsibility to the Global Economy 

So far, I have focused on the immediate spillovers of U.S. monetary policy abroad 

and the feedback of those effects to the U.S. economy.  More tacitly than explicitly stated 

has been my view that the United States is not just any economy and, thus, the Federal 

Reserve not just any central bank.  The U.S. economy represents nearly one-fourth of the 

global economy measured at market rates and a similar share of gross capital flows.  The 

significant size and international linkages of the U.S. economy mean that economic and 

financial developments in the United States have global spillovers.  It is, therefore, 

important to ask, what is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to the global economy?   

First and foremost, it is to keep our own house in order.  Economic and financial 

volatility in any country can have negative consequences for the world, but sizable and 

significant spillovers are almost assured from an economy that is large.  There is no 

question that sharp declines in U.S. output or large deviations of U.S. inflation from its 

target level would have adverse effects on the global economy.  Conversely, strong and 

stable U.S. growth in the context of inflation close to our policy objective has substantial 

benefits for the world.  Thus, as part of our efforts to achieve our congressionally 

mandated objective of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, the Federal 

Reserve will also seek to minimize adverse spillovers and maximize the beneficial effect 

of the U.S. economy on the global economy.   

As the recent financial crisis showed all too clearly, to achieve this objective, we 

must take financial stability into account.  For half a decade, we have been working to
