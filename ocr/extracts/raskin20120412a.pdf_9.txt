Alternatively understood, this research finding suggests that monetary policy alone may 

be insufficient to promote a more robust and sustainable improvement in household net 

worth. 

Besides the substantial direct losses in the wealth of households through losses in 

home equity, other housing-related issues have likely been holding back the economic 

recovery.  The collapse of house prices coincided with a sharp increase in mortgage 

defaults and foreclosures, leaving financial institutions with large holdings of residential 

real estate, or REO.  As these properties were put up for sale on the market, they 

contributed to the already-bloated supply of vacant homes available for sale and put 

further downward pressure on house prices.  In Los Angeles, for example, more than one 

out of every four homes sold in 2011 were REO properties.  And the inventory of 

mortgages that are more than 90 days delinquent or somewhere in the foreclosure process 

amounts to more than five times the current stock of REO, illustrating the large “shadow 

inventory” of properties that might be put up for sale sometime in the future. 

Concerns about future defaults and foreclosures have caused lenders to tighten 

their lending standards considerably--raising down-payment requirements, requiring 

extensive documentation, and charging substantial fees to all but those with the highest 

credit scores.  This marked change in mortgage credit standards has restricted access to 

mortgage credit for many potential borrowers, limiting both home purchases and 

refinancing.  In addition, it doesn’t take extensive forays into many neighborhoods here 

to see that the foreclosure process imposes less quantifiable but heavy costs on 

homeowners and communities.
