The first-difference rule is the most hawkish in figure 2:  It raises the federal 

funds rate more rapidly than the other three rules whose results are shown.  

Correspondingly, in the panels to the right of figure 2, the unemployment rate is higher 

on the broken green line than on the other paths for unemployment that are associated 

with lower interest rates.  And you can figure out why the broken green line for core PCE 

inflation is lower than for the other paths in the panel on the right-hand side of figure 2. 

How does the FOMC choose its interest rate decision?  Fundamentally, it uses 

charts like those shown in figure 2 as an important input into the discussion.  And in their 

discussion, members of the FOMC explain their policy choices, and try to persuade other 

members of the FOMC of their viewpoints. 

One Monetary Policy Decision:  August 2011 

As an example of such a process, I want to discuss the important decision taken at 

the August 2011 meeting.  At the time policymakers gathered in Washington for the 

meeting, the FOMC’s target for the federal funds rate had been set to nearly zero for 

more than 2-1/2 years.  And although the economy had improved from the depths of the 

Great Recession, the unemployment rate was still above 9 percent. 

Over the summer, the economic outlook darkened considerably.  In response, in 

August, the staff’s Tealbook forecast projected that the federal funds rate would remain 

near zero three quarters longer than what the staff had expected in June.  Figure 3, taken 

from the August 2011 Tealbook, illustrates how the change in the economic outlook 

affected FRB/US simulations of optimal monetary policy.19  As you know, an optimal 

policy is a path for the policy instrument that minimizes the shortfalls in economic 

                                                 
19 I rely on optimal policy simulations here because the August 2011 Tealbook did not include a figure like 

that shown in figure 2.
