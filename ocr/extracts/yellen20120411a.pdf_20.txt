only raise the federal funds rate sooner than our current guidance suggests but would also 

begin to remove other forms of accommodation and draw down the balance sheet sooner 

than in the baseline.  In contrast, in the weaker scenario, the Taylor (1999) rule calls for 

the liftoff to be delayed until the first half of 2016.  The model’s recommendation for a 

later liftoff in this scenario could alternatively provide an argument for additional policy 

accommodation through other means, including additional asset purchases. 

The current economic outlook is associated with significant risks in both 

directions.  In particular, we know that recoveries from financial crises are commonly 

prolonged, and I remain concerned that the headwinds that have been restraining the 

recovery could lead to a longer period of sluggish growth and high unemployment than is 

embodied in the consensus forecasts.  One specific risk is that elevated uncertainty about 

prospective fiscal policy adjustments could weigh on the spending plans of households

Potential upside surprises to the outlook include the possibility that the recovery 

has greater underlying momentum than is incorporated in consensus forecasts.  As I 

noted, the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate could conceivably indicate that 

GDP has been rising significantly faster than now estimated.  Alternatively, the
