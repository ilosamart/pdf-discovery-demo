Good afternoon.  It is a particular honor for me be here to address the Utah Bankers 

Association, which is like coming home in two ways: First, to Sun Valley, which is our 

family’s deeply rooted second home--my wife’s great grandfather established the first 

sawmill in the Wood River Valley near Hailey almost 150 years ago--and second, to 

Utah, the place that, like all of you, I dearly love and where I have always lived, despite a 

career that seems determined to keep taking me elsewhere.  

One of those elsewheres is Washington, and as a Utahan who has spent most of 

his career in the private sector advising and investing in the banking industry, I think I 

have a pretty good idea of how things look, from your vantage point, when someone from 

Washington shows up to give a speech.

and the largest institutions were relevant to how they fund their businesses and in turn 

finance the aspirations of families, farmers, ranchers, and other entrepreneurs. 

I’ll start today by trying to address those questions and provide a brief update on 

steps the Congress and the Federal Reserve are taking related to financial regulation.  A 

decade after the crisis, implementation of the major post-crisis reforms is largely 

complete, and we have entered a new phase that is aimed at reviewing and improving 

regulations to ensure that they are achieving their aims in the most effective and efficient 

manner.  I will explain more about that approach, and, relevant to your businesses, efforts 

to tailor regulation so it is appropriate for the size and business model of different 

institutions.  I will also briefly describe pending regulatory changes passed last month by
