2).  In recent months, there have been glimmers of hope seen in the job market.  For 

example, payroll employment rose 200,000 in December and the unemployment rate, 

which had hovered around 9 percent for most of the year, fell to 8.5 percent, a rate that 

while still far too high was the lowest in 2-1/2 years (chart 3).  That said, other 

economic data have improved more modestly, and the bulk of the evidence, including 

help-wanted advertising and surveys of employers’ hiring plans, suggests that the job 

market is not poised for marked improvement in the months ahead.  Indeed, my own 

expectation is that while the trend in unemployment will be gradually lower, the path 

to get there might be choppy.  

 On a brighter note, consumer spending looked a bit stronger in the latter part of 

last year after an anemic first half (chart 4).  The pickup in consumer spending was 

fairly widespread through November and, although we don’t yet have a full set of 

December data in hand, sales of motor vehicles remained solid at an annual rate of 

13.5 million units last month, and reports of holiday spending were upbeat.  That said, 

there are some reasons not to get too optimistic about this sector of the economy:  

Many of the underlying forces that typically support consumer spending are still quite 

weak, including the high unemployment rate, sluggish income growth, sentiment that 

remains relatively low despite recent improvements (chart 5), and the lingering effects 

of the earlier declines in household wealth. 

  Housing markets--which I will discuss in more detail shortly--have shown only 

slight signs of improvement:  Housing demand and homebuilding (chart 6) continue to 

be restrained by weak income and sentiment, tight lending standards, and a large 

overhang of vacant properties (chart 7).
