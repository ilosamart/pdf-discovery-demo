Good morning. Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board and today’s conference, 

“Small Business and Entrepreneurship during an Economic Recovery.”  Let me begin by 

thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Ewing Marion Kauffman 

Foundation, both of which have cooperated closely with the Board of Governors in 

organizing this event.  This meeting is indeed an eclectic one, bringing together small 

business owners, lenders, technical assistance providers, government officials, and 

members of the academic community to explore the challenges faced by today’s 

entrepreneurs and to identify promising approaches to addressing their needs.  Events 

such as this one are particularly valuable because they allow us to draw on a broad range 

of experiences and evidence.  We are keenly interested in hearing your insights and look 

forward to sharing results from the Federal Reserve’s continued small business outreach 

and research efforts.    

Some of you may have attended a forum here last year that focused on credit 

access for small businesses.1  We hope to advance that discussion today by exploring not 

only the financing needs of creditworthy small businesses, but also the role these firms 

could play in creating jobs during these difficult economic times.  We will also discuss 

the unique challenges faced by women- and minority-owned firms.  We hope to be as 

concrete and practical as possible; for example, several conference papers assess the 

extent to which training, technical assistance, and other resources are available to support 

these and other small firms.  The ultimate goal of this meeting is to learn more about how 

best to support both small businesses and their communities--to understand what works 

and what doesn’t.
