view that many of the factors that have been weighing on potential growth since the 

financial crisis could be lifting.  So, have we reached the turning point?  While I believe 

the issue remains unresolved, the recent evidence is encouraging. 

Have We Reached a Turning Point? 

Why am I optimistic about the economyâ€™s supply potential?  The growth of 

potential can, at the most basic level, be broken down into two factors:  the supply of 

labor and the productivity of that labor.  Productivity, in turn, is importantly affected by 

changes in the stock of capital--that is, machines and factories--as well as technological 

advances and improved production methods.  I see reasons to be hopeful about both 

factors. 

Let us start with labor.  For some time, the contribution of the labor force to 

potential growth has been held down by the predictable drag of baby boomers moving 

into retirement.  However, the decline in labor force participation following the financial 

crisis exceeded even what might be expected given this long-standing downward trend-- 

in particular, as the participation of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 

54) fell and teenagers exited the workforce in droves.  The reasons behind the fall in 

participation among non-retirement-age workers have been the subject of much debate.  

However, I see little reason to assume that it will be permanent, and we have already seen 

some signs of a turnaround.  Thus, I think there is some potential for labor force 

participation to move up, perhaps as workers respond to the incentives of plentiful job 

opportunities and higher wages, thereby adding to the productive capacity of the 

economy and pushing back the constraints on growth.
