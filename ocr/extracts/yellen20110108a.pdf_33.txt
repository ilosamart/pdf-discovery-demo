     Note: The bars denote net private capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) in Asia and Latin America as a share  
of the aggregate gross domestic production (GDP) of those economies, and the solid line denotes the cumulation of these capital  
flows since 2000 divided by the share of aggregate GDP of those economies.  The 16 EMEs are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, 
Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and 
Venezuela.  Source: Country sources via Haver.
