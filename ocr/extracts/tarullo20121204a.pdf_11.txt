U.S. financial firms, nondeposit liabilities today are highly correlated with the systemic 

risk measures used at the Federal Reserve Board to measure interconnectedness and 

complexity for purposes of evaluating the financial stability effects of mergers. 

Another attraction of this form of proposal is that, even as it places constraints on 

the potential size and composition of a firm’s balance sheet, it allows relative flexibility 

to the firm in meeting that constraint, particularly when compared with proposals for 

prohibitions on commercial bank affiliations with other financial firms.  A firm could 

shrink its balance sheet by shedding less profitable assets of its choosing.  It could also 

shift its funding model more toward deposits (assuming, of course, it does not exceed 

applicable deposit caps).  There are also ways to refine the proposal further, such as by 

weighting the nondeposit liabilities in the numerator of the ratio based on their duration.  

In short, as I have previously noted, there is considerable conceptual appeal in these 

proposals.9 

Nonetheless, there are several important questions raised by the nondeposit cap 

idea.  Foremost among these is the decision about the appropriate percentage of GDP that 

would constitute the cap.  The determination of this limit would presumably be based on 

a number of considerations, including an evaluation of the capacity of the U.S. economy 

and financial system to absorb the losses resulting from the failure of a large firm.  

Several salient considerations are also suggested by a combined IO-finance perspective.  

First, of course, is the key issue of how the functioning of funding markets is affected by 

the participation of very large counterparties using very large amounts of short-term 

wholesale funding, particularly under conditions of financial stress.  This issue falls more
