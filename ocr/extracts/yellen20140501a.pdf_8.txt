developed and continue to enhance our industry training efforts.  In particular, we have 

developed two programs--Ask the Fed and Outlook Live--that have become quite popular with 

community bankers who are interested in learning more about topics that are of importance to 

both banks and supervisors.  Ask the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, bank 

and thrift holding companies, and state bank commissioners.  Outlook Live, which is a 

companion program to the Federal Reserveâ€™s quarterly Consumer Compliance Outlook 

publication, is a webinar series on consumer compliance issues that is led by Federal Reserve 

staff.12   

We are also now using periodic newsletters and other communication tools to highlight 

information that community bankers may be interested in knowing and to provide information on 

how examiners will assess compliance with Federal Reserve policies.  In addition to Consumer 

Compliance Outlook, in 2012 the Federal Reserve System established a Community Banking 

Connections website and quarterly newsletter to focus on safety-and-soundness issues that are of 

practical interest to community bankers and bank board members.13  The Federal Reserve also 

launched a series of special-purpose publications called FedLinks.14  These publications 

highlight key elements of specific supervisory topics and discuss how examiners will typically 

address the topic.  The common goal for all of these outreach efforts is building and sustaining 

an ongoing dialogue with community bankers.
