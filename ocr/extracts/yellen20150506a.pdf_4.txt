shows that, across countries and over time, financial development, up to a point, has 

disproportionately benefited the poor and served to alleviate economic inequality.6  

Distorted Incentives in the Financial Sector  

Despite these benefits, as we have seen, actions by financial institutions have the 

potential to inflict harm on society.  Instead of promoting financial security through 

prudent mortgage underwriting, the financial sector prior to the crisis facilitated a bubble 

in the housing market and too often encouraged households to take on mortgages they 

neither understood nor could afford.  Recent research has raised important questions 

about the benefits and costs of the rapid growth of the financial services industry in the 

United States over the past 40 years.7 

A combination of responses to distorted incentives by players throughout the 

financial system created an environment conducive to a crisis.  Excessive leverage placed 

institutions at great risk of insolvency in the event that severe, albeit low-probability, 

problems materialized.  Overreliance on fragile short-term funding by many institutions 

left the system vulnerable to runs.  And excessive risk-taking increased the probability 

that severe problems would, in fact, materialize.  Moreover, regulators--and the structure 

of the regulatory system itself--did not keep up with changes in the financial sector and 

were insufficiently attuned to systemic risks.  Once concerns began to develop about 

escalating losses at large firms, insufficient liquidity and capital interacted in an adverse

in a study examining evidence across countries. 
7Zingales (2015) raises a number of questions regarding ways in which distortions in the financial sector 
may contribute to “rent seeking” activity that may promote inefficiency.  Philippon and Reshef (2012) 
examine trends in compensation in the financial sector and the contribution of such trends to the increase in 
income inequality in the United States in recent decades.  Philippon and Reshef (2013) and Cecchetti and 
Kharroubi (2012) revisit the links between financial development and economic growth, focusing 
particularly on these relationships around periods of rapid growth in the financial sector or among 
economies with a large financial sector.
