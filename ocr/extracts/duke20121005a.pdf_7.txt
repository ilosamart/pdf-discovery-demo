The second category of high long-term vacancy census tract has a large share of older 

housing stock built before 1960, low median income, a high poverty rate, a high unemployment 

rate, and a large share of residents with less than a high school degree.  These tracts can be called 

“low demand” locations because these characteristics are frequently associated with areas 

suffering from persistent job loss and a decline in housing demand.  Metropolitan areas with a 

large number of tracts in this category include Detroit, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; St. Louis, 

Missouri; and Baltimore, Maryland.   

The third and final category of high long-term vacancy census tract has a low density of 

housing units per square mile, high shares of owner-occupied and single-family housing units, 

and a high fraction of white non-Hispanic residents.  We can think of these neighborhoods as 

“traditional suburban” areas.  Examples of metropolitan areas with a large number of tracts in 

this category are Charleston, West Virginia; Des Moines, Iowa; Peoria, Illinois; and Oklahoma 

City, Oklahoma-- locations not often mentioned in national media coverage about the housing 

crisis.

As I mentioned earlier, we should endeavor to achieve full recovery in all of the many 

diverse housing markets around the country.  The private market will likely drive recovery in 

many locations and, in those locations, the appropriate role of government may be to monitor 

local activity and ensure that the actions of the private markets improve neighborhoods and 

provide opportunity for all families, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, or housing tenure.   

However, some neighborhoods likely will not recover without the assistance of 

government, and in this time of scarce resources, it is critical that the public sector has the 

information and tools necessary to ensure that any assistance that is provided is effective and
