I’m very pleased to participate in this conference honoring my good friend 

Mervyn King.  As Mervyn noted in a recent speech in New York, we had adjoining 

offices at MIT as young academics and never imagined that 30 years later we still would 

be colleagues--as central bankers.1  Now, as then, I value his advice and insight. 

The topic of this session is lessons learned from the financial crisis.  For me, 

perhaps the central insight is that the recent crisis, despite its many exotic features, was in 

fact a classic financial panic--a systemwide run of “hot money” away from assets whose 

values suddenly became uncertain.  In that respect, the crisis was akin to many other 

financial crises faced by governments and central banks--including that most venerable of 

central banks, the Bank of England--over the centuries.  The response to the crisis 

likewise followed the classic prescriptions of liquidity provision, liability guarantees, 

asset evaluation and disposition, and recapitalization where necessary.  Although the 

crisis had classic features, to a significant extent it took place in a novel institutional 

context, making diagnosis and response more challenging:  For example, in the United 

States, collateralized wholesale funding rather than conventional bank deposits 

constituted the hot money, and run pressure was experienced not only by banks but by 

diverse other institutions, such as structured investment vehicles.  In addition, the scale 

and complexity of globalized financial institutions and markets made it difficult to predict 

how the crisis might spread or to coordinate the response.  One of the few positive 

aspects of this episode was the extraordinary degree of international cooperation achieved 

among policymakers, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, in 

responding to the crisis.
