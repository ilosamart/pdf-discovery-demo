been historically underserved--low-income and low-wealth families, including 

disproportionate numbers of minorities and households headed by females. 

These longer-term questions are critical.  But before we get to the longer-term 

solutions, we need to deal with the unprecedented number of loans in or still entering the 

foreclosure pipeline, the disposition of properties acquired through foreclosure, and the 

effect of a high percentage of distressed sales on home prices.  Regardless of how we got 

here, we, as a nation, currently have a housing market that is so severely out of balance 

that it is hampering our economic recovery.  

 To many, the story of the recent financial crisis and its aftereffects for the 

housing market is one mainly attributed to subprime lending.  Although problems were 

concentrated initially in subprime mortgages, today about two-thirds of underwater 

mortgages and loans in foreclosure are actually prime or Federal Housing Administration 

(FHA) mortgages.  This fact suggests that solutions aimed at righting the wrongs of 

previous reckless lending in the subprime market are not sufficient to tackle the scale of 

current problems. 

Clearly, the market is not functioning as it should.  Despite near-record-low 

interest rates, credit conditions remain tight for many consumers and investors interested 

in buying or refinancing residential real estate.  Moreover, the lack of sufficient numbers 

of buyers and sellers may limit price discovery, which heightens uncertainty about the 

“right” price for a given piece of real estate and further limits activity.  In addition, the 

large number of foreclosures and a protracted foreclosure process have led to an 

unprecedented level of bank-owned homes, a level that is likely to persist for some time. 

 So how do we move forward in these difficult circumstances?
