Indeed, quite apart from political considerations, there may be good reasons not to do so.  For 

one, a single global regulator of internationally active banks would presumably be something 

close to a regulatory monopolist, whose policies and practices could be inappropriately uniform 

across quite different national markets and slow to adapt to changing conditions.  Also, as with 

dominant or exclusive reliance on home country consolidated supervision, it seems unlikely that

financial risks posed to regulated institutions across national markets. 

A limited exception to the general disinclination to cede financial sovereignty, as in 

various other areas, lies within the European Union or, more precisely, the euro zone.  With the 

creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in the European Central Bank and a 

freestanding Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), there have been important transfers of 

authority, though national regulators continue to play a supporting role.  Interesting and 

important as this regional initiative is, however, the unique European arrangement of shared 

sovereignty makes it less a model for the world as a whole than an extension of the single

The Shared Model and Lessons of the Crisis 

  The shortcomings of each conceptually “pure” model explains why some version of a 

shared home/host model has prevailed over time.  Given the range of variations in this model, 

however, it is useful to bear in mind the relative advantages and disadvantages of the cleaner 

models in choosing the elements of a specific shared approach.  In considering recent
