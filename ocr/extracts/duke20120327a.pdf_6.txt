Reserve has identified and shared a number of promising practices for dealing with 

foreclosed and vacant homes.3  While some cities are pioneering with land banks, others, 

such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Baltimore, are using data to plan for the future in ways 

that city governments wouldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.  Partnering with local 

foundations, universities, and community organizations, these cities are collecting 

extensive property data to identify neighborhood assets and build on those strengths.4  In 

Phoenix, local officials and non-profits are partnering with local realtors to match 

families with affordable homes for sale. 

Unemployment 

The foreclosure crisis that resulted from unsustainable subprime lending has 

persisted largely because of high unemployment rates.  Thus, in order to be successful, 

any effort to stabilize and revitalize lower-income neighborhoods will need to consider 

housing through the lens of access to jobs and educational opportunities.  The Federal 

Reserve System currently has an initiative underway to better understand the relationship 

between community development activities and successful workforce development 

strategies.  We anticipate that this research will provide valuable information for bankers 

and their community partners as they address the needs of their communities. 

                                                                                                                                                 
activities that meet the “eligible uses” criteria in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and are 
conducted in designated target areas identified in NSP plans approved by the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development.
