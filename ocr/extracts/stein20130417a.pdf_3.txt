the probability of a SIFI finding itself at the point of failure.  And, if, despite these measures, a 

SIFI does fail, the orderly liquidation authority (OLA) in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act now offers a mechanism for recapitalizing and 

restructuring the institution by imposing losses on shareholders and creditors.  In the interests of 

brevity, I won’t go into a lot of detail about OLA.  But my Board colleague Jay Powell talked in 

depth about this topic in a speech last month, and I would just register my broad agreement with 

his conclusion--namely that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) so-called 

“single point of entry” approach to resolution is a promising one.

  The Federal Reserve 

continues to work with the FDIC on the many difficult implementation challenges that remain, 

but I believe this approach gets the first-order economics right and ultimately has a good chance 

to be effective. 

 Perhaps more to the point for TBTF, if a SIFI does fail I have little doubt that private 

investors will in fact bear the losses--even if this leads to an outcome that is messier and more 

costly to society than we would ideally like.  Dodd-Frank is very clear in saying that the Federal 

Reserve and other regulators cannot use their emergency authorities to bail out an individual 

failing institution.  And as a member of the Board, I am committed to following both the letter 

and the spirit of the law.   

 Still, we are quite a way from having fully solved the policy problems associated with 

SIFIs.  For one thing, the market still appears to attach some probability to the government 

bailing out the creditors of a SIFI; this can be seen in the ratings uplift granted to large banks 

based on the ratings agencies’ assessment of the probability of government support.  While this
