resolution mechanisms for their large banking organizations.  This task entails the 

implementation of the Financial Stability Board’s principles for effective resolution regimes, 

including establishing a resolution authority with adequate legal powers to manage the process in 

an orderly fashion without injection of public capital.

 It also includes requiring each such 

institution to have total loss absorption capacity sufficient to recapitalize the firm even if its 

substantial equity buffer is lost in an extreme tail event.  Home and host countries should work 

together toward international standards that will ensure that an appropriate amount of this 

capacity would be available to host authorities faced with the potential insolvency of large FBOs 

in their jurisdiction or with the consequences for their market of the failure of parent banks. 

 In this regard, I think that capital requirements for FBOs of the sort now required by the 

EU and the United States are very likely to reduce the considerable strains that have traditionally 

accompanied financial distress at global banking firms.  In most cases, including both 

internationally and within the EU itself in recent years, stress has resulted in the demand by host 

authorities for ex post ring fencing of capital, liquidity, or both, often in the absence of any ex 

ante requirements.  The existence of FBO capital and liquidity standards, particularly if 

supplemented with the total loss absorbency measures to which I just referred, should mitigate 

the need for such demands, which of course come at the worst possible time for the firm trying to 

meet them. 

 Third, we--by which I mean both home and major host banking regulators--need to find 

better ways of fostering genuine regulatory and supervisory cooperation.  Particularly at the most 

senior levels of the agencies that actually supervise globally active banks, our interactions with 

our counterparts from other countries have become almost exclusively focused on developing
