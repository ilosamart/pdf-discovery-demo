Treasury and agency securities, including agency mortgage-backed securities, helped to 

lower rates on mortgages and other instruments. 

The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) has helped to facilitate a 

resumption of activity in securitization markets for consumer auto and credit card loans.  

In addition, the TALF has supported small business lending through equipment loans, 

floor plan financing for automobiles and boats, fleet financing, financing of small 

business insurance premiums, and receivables for independent mortgage servicers,

480,000 loans to small businesses and millions of credit card accounts.  TALF loans also 

have been used to fund purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), 

and recently appear to be providing a catalyst for the new- issue CMBS market.

banks have continued to rise, and the decline in bank loans outstanding has been stark.  

For example, our data show that total loans on banksâ€™ books fell at an annual rate of more 

than 11 percent during the third quarter of 2009, with all major loan categories 

contributing to the decline.  In addition, unused credit lines at commercial banks have 

dropped almost 25 percent from their peak at the end of 2007; unused credit card lines, 

the biggest category, are nearly $1 trillion below their peak.  

 A number of factors are at work in explaining the reduction in bank loans.  For 

instance, for most commercial banks, the quality of existing loan portfolios continues to 

deteriorate as levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans are still rising.  In response,
