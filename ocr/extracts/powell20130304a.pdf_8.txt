Under single point of entry, the FDIC will be appointed receiver of only the top-tier 

parent holding company of the failed financial group.  Promptly after the parent holding 

company is placed into receivership, the FDIC will transfer the assets of the parent company 

(primarily its investments in subsidiaries) to a bridge holding company.  Equity claims of the 

failed parent company’s shareholders will be wiped out, and claims of its unsecured debt holders 

will be written down as necessary to reflect any losses in the receivership that the shareholders 

cannot cover.  To capitalize the bridge holding company and the operating subsidiaries, and to 

permit transfer of ownership and control of the bridge company back to private hands, the FDIC 

will exchange the remaining claims of unsecured creditors of the parent for equity and/or debt 

claims of the bridge company.  If necessary, the FDIC would provide temporary liquidity to the 

bridge company until the “bail-in” of the failed parent company’s creditors can be accomplished. 

It is crucial to recognize how this approach addresses the problem of runs.  Single point 

of entry is designed to focus losses on the shareholders and long-term debt holders of the failed 

parent and to produce a well-capitalized bridge holding company in place of the failed parent.  

The critical operating subsidiaries would be well capitalized, and would remain open for 

business.  There would be much reduced incentives for creditors or customers of the operating 

subsidiaries to pull away, or for regulators to ring-fence or take other extraordinary measures.  If 

the process can be fully worked out and understood by market participants, regulators, and the 

general public, it should work to resolve even the biggest institution without starting or 

accelerating a run, and without exposing taxpayers to loss. 

Single point of entry has important features in common with Chapter 11 bankruptcy 

reorganization.  The principal differences in favor of OLA are the greater speed at which a firm
