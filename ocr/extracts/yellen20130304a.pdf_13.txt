unemployment is more likely to signal genuine improvement in the labor market when it 

is combined with a healthy pace of job gains.   

The payroll employment data, however, also have shortcomings.  In particular, 

they are subject to substantial revision.  When the Labor Department released its annual 

benchmarking of the establishment survey data last month, it revised up its estimate of 

employment in December 2012 by 647,000.   

In addition, I am likely to supplement the data on employment and unemployment 

with measures of gross job flows, such as job loss and hiring, which describe the 

underlying dynamics of the labor market.  For instance, layoffs and discharges as a share 

of total employment have already returned to their pre-recession level, while the hiring 

rate remains depressed.  Therefore, going forward, I would look for an increase in the rate 

of hiring.  Similarly, a pickup in the quit rate, which also remains at a low level, would 

signal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are good--in other words, that 

labor demand has strengthened.   

I also intend to consider my forecast of the overall pace of spending and growth in 

the economy.  A decline in unemployment, when it is not accompanied by sufficiently 

strong growth, may not indicate a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  

Similarly, a convincing pickup in growth that is expected to be sustained could prompt a 

determination that the outlook for the labor market had substantially improved even 

absent any substantial decline at that point in the unemployment rate.   

The Efficacy of Asset Purchases  

Let me turn next to the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases, a topic 

discussed at recent FOMC meetings and that I suspect will be discussed at succeeding
