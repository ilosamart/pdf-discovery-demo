Thank you for the opportunity to join you.  I am grateful for the chance to speak with 

such a diverse and distinguished group of academics, industry leaders, and colleagues in 

regulation and central banking.  Conversations like these always remind me that, while we all 

approach our roles in the financial sector differently, we share a deeper commitment to a 

common goal: a safe, stable, and resilient financial system, capable of supporting strong and 

sustainable economic growth.  

A decade ago, that common goal became an imperative.  The financial regulatory 

community worked frantically to repair the vulnerabilities that the global financial crisis exposed 

and to address a set of financial risks that failed to respect national borders.  The financial system 

we have today bears the imprint of our response a decade ago.  Basel III is now final.  

Derivatives markets are now safer and better regulated.  Levels of capital and liquidity at the 

largest banks are now higher, and with reforms to recovery and resolution, the risks and potential 

costs of a catastrophic failure of a major institution are lower.  These are profound 

accomplishments of international cooperation, which returned the global financial system from 

the brink of collapse to stability and health.  But health does not make cooperation or vigilance 

any less necessary.  On the contrary, as the G20 leaders said in creating the Financial Stability 

Board (FSB), “a sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency.”1  

The FSB exists to help sustain the common efforts made in the throes of the crisis--to 

identify and address systemic vulnerabilities, to develop stronger regulatory and supervisory 

policies, and to create a more resilient global financial system.  It is a platform, and a place for its 

24 members and 73 representatives to coordinate their work; to identify and address issues that 

span financial products, intermediaries, and markets; and to avoid the pre-crisis regulatory
