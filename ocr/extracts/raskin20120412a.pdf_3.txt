generally, how the path of the economy in a recovery may depend on the path of the 

economy in a recession. 

To rewind and review:  The U.S. economy recently endured a financial crisis 

rivaling the one that triggered the Great Depression, and a severe recession ensued.  The 

effects of the recent recession were pronounced in Los Angeles.  Although the recession 

was declared to have ended nearly three years ago, the recovery--both at the national 

level and here in Los Angeles--has been extraordinarily slow compared with other 

recoveries.  Should we be surprised by this sluggish pace of recovery?  Let’s compare the 

view of the recent national economic downturn with a view of the economic downturn in 

Los Angeles.  And then, moving from recession to recovery, let’s ask how the contours of 

this recovery differ from the contours of other recoveries.  More generally, does the path 

of a recovery depend on the path of a downturn?  Let’s see what the experience of Los 

Angeles can teach us.  Of course, I note that this perspective is my own perspective and 

not necessarily that of others in the Federal Reserve System. 

The Economy in the United States and in Los Angeles 

 The overall U.S. economy had started to contract by the beginning of 2008 and 

entered the severe phase of the recession during the late summer of that year with the 

near-collapse of the financial system.  By any measure, the cumulative decline in 

economic activity was large.  Nationally, employment decreased by nearly 9 million, 

while the unemployment rate climbed from roughly 5 percent to 10 percent.  As 

measured by real gross domestic product (GDP), aggregate economic output contracted 5 

percent during the recession, and the purchasing power of household after-tax income 

declined by about the same amount.  This recession was the most severe economic
