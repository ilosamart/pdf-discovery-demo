I’d like to thank the National Bureau of Economic Research for organizing this 

conference in recognition of the Federal Reserve’s centennial, and I’m glad to have the 

opportunity to participate.  In keeping with the spirit of the conference, my remarks today 

will take a historical perspective.  I will leave discussion of current policy to today’s 

question-and-answer session and, of course, to my congressional testimony next week. 

  Today, I’ll discuss the evolution over the past 100 years of three key aspects of 

Federal Reserve policymaking:  the goals of policy, the policy framework, and 

accountability and communication.  The changes over time in these three areas provide a 

useful perspective, I believe, on how the role and functioning of the Federal Reserve have 

changed since its founding in 1913, as well as some lessons for the present and for the 

future.  I will pay particular attention to several key episodes of the Fed’s history, all of 

which have been referred to in various contexts with the adjective “Great” attached to 

them:  the Great Experiment of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the Great Depression, the 

Great Inflation and subsequent disinflation, the Great Moderation, and the recent Great 

Recession. 

The Great Experiment 

In the words of one of the authors of the Federal Reserve Act, Robert Latham 

Owen, the Federal Reserve was established to “provide a means by which periodic panics 

which shake the American Republic and do it enormous injury shall be stopped.”

  In 

short, the original goal of the Great Experiment that was the founding of the Fed was the

 See Owen (1919, p. 24).  The Treasury carried out some central banking functions before the creation of 

the Federal Reserve.  In addition, the United States had experimented with central banking before, with the 

First and Second Banks of the United States.  By 1913, however, it had been about 75 years since the latter 

institution had ceased fulfilling that purpose.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve operated somewhat 

differently from the prior institutions, and, in that respect, its creation amounted to an experiment.
