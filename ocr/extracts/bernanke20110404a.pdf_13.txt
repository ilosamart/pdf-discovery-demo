financial market utilities that would be supervised by the Board under title 8.  These 

standards track the existing standards published in the Boardâ€™s Payment System Risk 

Policy, which in turn are based on existing international standards.     

 For the longer term, the Federal Reserve is working closely with the SEC and the 

CFTC as well as securities regulators and central banks from more than 20 other 

countries to revise and strengthen the existing international standards for the major types 

of financial market utilities.  This work is being carried out by the Committee on 

Payment and Settlement Systems and by the Technical Committee of the International 

Organization of Securities Commissions.  These two committees published new 

international standards for public consultation in March.  We hope that the regulatory 

agencies in the United States, and those in other major countries, can adopt a single set of 

enhanced risk-management standards that will apply to all systemically important 

financial market utilities globally.   

Coordination among regulators, both within and between countries, is especially 

important in light of the increasing interdependencies among financial market utilities 

around the world.15  What was once a landscape of numerous, separate clearinghouses 

that operated largely independently from one another has now become dominated by 

fewer and larger clearinghouses supporting more integrated markets and consolidated, 

global financial firms.  Moreover, the same globally active banks participate in all of the 

major clearinghouses, and the major clearinghouses often rely on similar sets of banks for 

payment services, funding, settlement, and emergency liquidity.  In such a world, 

                                                 
15 Reflecting on these changes, a 2008 report by the Bank for International Settlements Committee on 
Payment and Settlement Systems noted the extensive scope of interdependencies among these financial 
market utilities.  See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2008), The Interdependencies of 
Payment and Settlement Systems (Basel, Switzerland: BIS, June), www.bis.org/publ/cpss84.pdf.
