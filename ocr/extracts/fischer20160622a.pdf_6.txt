I want to end by briefly addressing several criticisms that have been made of the 

Dodd-Frank Act’s orderly liquidation authority and the Board’s TLAC proposal.  One 

criticism is that there is no need for the backup orderly liquidation authority because the 

Bankruptcy Code provides an adequate framework for the resolution of any financial 

company.  As Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act recognizes, however, the Bankruptcy Code 

may not be adequate to minimize the systemic impact of the resolution of a systemically 

important financial firm.  The Bankruptcy Code does not direct the judge to take financial 

stability into account in making decisions, and it does not provide other important 

stabilizing features of the orderly liquidation authority, such as government liquidity 

support and stay-and-transfer treatment for qualified financial contracts. 

A related line of criticism holds that the orderly liquidation authority enshrines 

“too big to fail” and provides for taxpayer bailouts of systemically important firms 

through the orderly liquidation fund.  However, under the Board’s proposed TLAC rule, a 

failed GSIB would be recapitalized by its private-sector long-term creditors (whose debt 

claims would be converted into equity), not by the government.  The orderly liquidation 

fund would be used only to provide liquidity support, not to inject capital, and in the 

unlikely event that the fund does incur losses, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that these 

losses would be covered by assessments on major financial companies and would not be 

passed on to taxpayers.  I also note that credit rating agencies have recognized public-

sector efforts to end the too-big-to-fail phenomenon.  The rating agencies no longer 

assume that the U.S. government will take extraordinary actions to prevent the failure of 

systemically important U.S. financial firms.
