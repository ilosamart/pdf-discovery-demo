further as life expectancies continue to increase.  Overall, the projected fiscal pressures 

associated with Social Security are considerably smaller than the pressures associated 

with federal health programs, but they still present a significant challenge to 

policymakers.  

The same underlying trends affecting federal finances will also put substantial 

pressures on state and local budgets, as organizations like yours have helped to 

highlight.4  In Rhode Island, as in other states, the retirement of state employees, together 

with continuing increases in health-care costs, will cause public pension and retiree 

health-care obligations to become increasingly difficult to meet.  Estimates of unfunded 

pension liabilities for the states as whole span a wide range, but some researchers put the 

figure as high as $2 trillion at the end of 2009.5  Estimates of states’ liabilities for retiree 

health benefits are even more uncertain because of the difficulty of projecting medical 

costs decades into the future.  However, one recent estimate suggests that state 

governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits.6

It may be scant comfort, but the United States is not alone in facing fiscal 

challenges.  The global recession has dealt a blow to the fiscal positions of most other 

advanced economies, and, as in the United States, their expenditures for public health 


These health benefits have usually been handled on a pay-as-you-go basis and therefore 

could impose a substantial fiscal burden in coming years as large numbers of state 

workers retire.
