The Federal Reserve has a statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and 

price stability, and explaining how we are working toward those goals plays a crucial role 

in our monetary policy strategy.  It is evident that neither of our dual objectives can be 

taken in isolation:  On the one hand, a central bank that aimed to achieve the highest 

possible level of employment in the short run, without regard to other considerations, 

might well generate unacceptable levels of inflation without any permanent benefits in 

terms of employment.  On the other hand, a single-minded focus by the central bank on 

price stability, with no attention at all to other factors, could lead to more frequent and 

deeper slumps in economic activity and employment with little benefit in terms of long-

run inflation performance.   

Recognizing the interactions between the two parts of our mandate, the FOMC 

has found it useful to frame our dual mandate in terms of the longer-run sustainable rate 

of unemployment and the mandate-consistent inflation rate.  The longer-run sustainable 

rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the economy can maintain 

without generating upward or downward pressure on inflation.  Because a healthy 

economy must allow for the destruction and creation of jobs, as well as for movements of 

workers between jobs and in and out of the labor force, the longer-run sustainable rate of 

unemployment is greater than zero.  Similarly, the mandate-consistent inflation rate--the 

inflation rate that best promotes our dual objectives in the long run--is not necessarily 

zero; indeed, Committee participants have generally judged that a modestly positive 

inflation rate over the longer run is most consistent with the dual mandate.  (The view 

that policy should aim for an inflation rate modestly above zero is shared by virtually all 

central banks around the world.)  Several rationales can be provided for this judgment,
