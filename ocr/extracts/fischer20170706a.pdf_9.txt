a college degree.15  More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse 

this trend, and government funding could likely assist the effort.  More broadly, programs 

to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster 

the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole. 

Concluding remarks 

To conclude, we return to the basic question:  How much does productivity 

growth matter?  The basic answer: simple arithmetic says it matters a lot.  If labor 

productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year, average living standards for our 

childrenâ€™s generation will be twice what we experienced.  If labor productivity grows an 

average of 1 percent per year, the difference is dramatic:  Living standards will take two 

generations to double.16   

But fortunately, when it comes to productivity, we are not simply consigned to 

luck or to fate.  Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid 

productivity growth.  Broadly speaking, government policy works best when it can 

address a need that the private sector neglects, including investment in basic research, 

infrastructure, early childhood education, schooling, and public health.  Reasonable 

people can disagree about the right way forward, but if we as a society are to succeed, we 

need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth.  That is easier 

said than done.  But it can be done.
