question the solvency of a firm, and to provide a solid basis for LOLR extensions of liquidity by 

insulating the central bank from credit risk. 

It is surely important to maintain strong capital standards.  And it is true that the 

prudential supervisory role of a central bank may at times give it greater insight into the balance 

sheet of regulated institutions, such as through well-developed supervisory stress tests.  In 

practice, however, the line between illiquidity and insolvency can be very blurry.  Particularly in 

periods of stress, when the value of important asset classes may be quite volatile and very 

difficult to determine, the central bank cannot always easily disentangle illiquidity and 

insolvency risks. 

For the same reasons that an expansive LOLR can create the risk of central banks 

assuming more than small amounts of credit risk, it can also create moral hazard.  Models in 

economic literature that conclude the socially optimal policy is for the central bank to backstop 

aggregate liquidity risk generally assume that credit risk is negligible (or can be priced perfectly) 

and the only source of risk is that related to liquidity.  In this abstract world, there is no moral 

hazard, at least in the sense that the firm with access to the LOLR will hold an insufficient 

quantity of liquid assets.  This is because all assets are effectively liquid, since the central bank 

can always lend against assets that may be illiquid in private markets.  

Outside the world of theory, however, moral hazard is a significant problem.  The central 

bank will sometimes be asked to lend to a financial institution precisely because its creditors are 

pulling back out of concern that the institution may not be able to meet its obligations.  Even if 

the central bank were appropriately reluctant to increase moral hazard by stepping in for private 

funding when an institution is in fact insolvent, the prospect of a rapid, disorderly default could 

still motivate LOLR lending.  The reasoning would be that central bank lending in such a
