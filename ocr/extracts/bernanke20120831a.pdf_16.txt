Economic Prospects  

The accommodative monetary policies I have reviewed today, both traditional and 

nontraditional, have provided important support to the economic recovery while helping 

to maintain price stability.  As of July, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.3 percent 

from its cyclical peak of 10 percent and payrolls had risen by 4 million jobs from their 

low point.  And despite periodic concerns about deflation risks, on the one hand, and 

repeated warnings that excessive policy accommodation would ignite inflation, on the 

other hand, inflation (except for temporary deviations caused primarily by swings in 

commodity prices) has remained near the Committee’s 2 percent objective and inflation 

expectations have remained stable.  Key sectors such as manufacturing, housing, and 

international trade have strengthened, firms’ investment in equipment and software has 

rebounded, and conditions in financial and credit markets have improved.     

Notwithstanding these positive signs, the economic situation is obviously far from 

satisfactory.  The unemployment rate remains more than 2 percentage points above what 

most FOMC participants see as its longer-run normal value, and other indicators--such as 

the labor force participation rate and the number of people working part time for 

economic reasons--confirm that labor force utilization remains at very low levels.  

Further, the rate of improvement in the labor market has been painfully slow.  I have 

noted on other occasions that the declines in unemployment we have seen would likely 

continue only if economic growth picked up to a rate above its longer-term trend.28  In 

fact, growth in recent quarters has been tepid, and so, not surprisingly, we have seen no 

net improvement in the unemployment rate since January.  Unless the economy begins to
