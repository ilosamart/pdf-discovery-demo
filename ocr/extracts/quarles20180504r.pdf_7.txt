How Does the LCR Interact with the Size of the Fed’s Balance Sheet? 

With this backdrop, a relevant question for monetary policymakers is, what 

quantity of central bank reserve balances will banks likely want to hold, and, hence, how 

might the LCR affect banks’ reserve demand and thereby the longer-run size of the Fed’s 

balance sheet?  Let me emphasize that policymakers have long been aware of the 

potential influence that regulations may have on reserve demand and thus the longer-run 

size of the Fed’s balance sheet.  And, of course, regulatory influences on banks’ behavior, 

my focus today, is just one of many factors that could affect policymakers’ decisions 

regarding the appropriate long-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet.7  In particular, in 

augmenting its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the FOMC stated in June 2017 

that it “currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a 

level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial 

crisis” and went on to note that “the level will reflect the banking system’s demand for 

reserve balances and the Committee’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy 

most efficiently and effectively in the future.”8     

With that said, it is useful to begin by examining banks’ current reserve holdings.  

Figure 1 plots the aggregate level of reserve balances in the U.S. banking system, starting 

well before the financial crisis.  As you can see, the current level of reserves--at around 

                                                 
7 For example, a separate factor that is relevant for policymakers in this regard is the FOMC’s choice of 
long-run framework for monetary policy implementation.  For policymakers’ discussions of this factor, see
