The financial crisis exposed fault lines in the financial system that had to be addressed 

immediately, comprehensively, and vigorously.  The body of post-crisis regulation that resulted 

was founded on the work of academics, including important papers published in the JMCB, and 

involved the energy and efforts of many standard setters, regulators, supervisors, and central 

banks.  It was an exemplary feat of cooperation and coordination, and it has unquestionably 

made the financial system safer and more resilient.  

Today, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed.  Basel III is final, the 

largest global banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter derivatives 

markets are safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-fail institutions.  

Through greater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from nonbank 

financial intermediation.  And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and 

unglamorous task of establishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSBâ€™s 

clearly defined principles.  While we must still work to ensure full, timely, and consistent 

implementation of the agreed reforms, it is time for the FSB to turn more of its energy and 

attention to the future. 

In my time with you today, I would like to do two things.  First, I would like to share 

with you my view on how the work of the FSB must evolve if we are to merit that future 

celebration and some of the core principles that I think should inform that work.  After 

discussing those principles, I want to focus your attention on some of the work priorities that the 

FSB will be addressing throughout 2019 and beyond, including nonbank financing, fintech, and 

evaluating the too-big-to-fail reforms.
