Korea.16  But such interventions can be double-edged swords.  The experience of many 

decades tells us that industrial policies are far from a sure-fire development strategy, as 

they require that the government be adept at picking winners.  One example, the role of 

government intervention in promoting ethanol production in Brazil, illustrates the 

vagaries of industrial policies.  After being introduced over the mid- to late 1970s, for 

several years the program was generally viewed as a failure.  More recently, however, the 

sustained upward trend in world oil prices has turned ethanol production in Brazil into a 

profitable venture.17  But in many cases, similar interventions have failed or crowded out 

the development of other, potentially more profitable industries.  

Lessons and Implications for the Future  

What implications can we draw for longer-term prospects for growth in the 

emerging market economies?  Notwithstanding the recent impressive growth, output per 

person in the emerging market economies generally remains much lower than in the 

advanced economies.  This fact suggests that the emerging market economies should be 

able to maintain relatively high growth rates for some years to come, as they continue to 

catch up to the advanced economies.  But over time, as the emerging market countries 

become wealthier and technologically more sophisticated, they will gradually lose the 

advantages of starting from behind.  Even with continued strong policies, their growth 

will slow as returns to capital investments diminish and the most profitable opportunities 

are exploited. 18  For example, over time, rising wages in manufacturing should make

17 After 1989, ethanol subsidies in Brazil were removed, but other forms of indirect government support 
were maintained.  
18 Recent research by Eichengreen and others (2011) draws on cross-country evidence to show that the pace 
of a country’s economic growth tends to slow once its level of real per capita income crosses a certain 
threshold.
