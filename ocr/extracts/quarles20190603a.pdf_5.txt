It is incumbent on the official sector to take these requests seriously, and we are.  

For example, the Federal Reserve is working with the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission and other U.S. prudential regulators to provide greater clarity on the 

treatment of margin requirements for legacy derivatives instruments.  Agency staff are 

developing proposed changes to the margin rules for non-cleared swaps to ensure that 

changes to legacy swaps to incorporate a move away from LIBOR, including adherence 

to the ISDA protocol, would not affect the grandfathered status of those legacy swaps 

under the margin rules.  This has been a key request of the ARRC, and we will look 

forward to public comment on the proposal.   

The Federal Reserve’s supervisory teams have already included a number of 

detailed questions about plans for the transition away from LIBOR in their monitoring 

discussions with large firms.  The Federal Reserve will expect to see an appropriate level 

of preparedness at the banks we supervise, and that level must increase as the end of 2021 

grows closer.  Our supervisory approach will continue to be tailored to the size of 

institution and the complexity of LIBOR exposure, but the largest firms should be 

prepared to see our expectations for them increase.  As we consider the answers we have 

received from these firms, we will assess how our supervisory expectations for them 

should evolve in the coming year.    

Let me address one additional point relating to our supervisory stress tests, in an 

effort to provide further clarity.  Some have recently claimed that the Federal Reserve’s 

supervisory stress tests would penalize a bank that replaces LIBOR with SOFR in loan 

contracts by lowering projections of net interest income under stress.  As can be seen in 

our recently published enhanced descriptions of the supervisory stress-test models, the
