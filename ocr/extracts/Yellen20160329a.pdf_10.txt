channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky assets, causing 

financial conditions to tighten.  But at the same time, we should not ignore the welcome 

possibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favorable than we now 

expect.  The improvement in the labor market in 2014 and 2015 was considerably faster 

than expected by either FOMC participants or private forecasters, and that experience 

could be repeated if, for example, the economic headwinds we face were to abate more 

quickly than anticipated.  For these reasons, the FOMC must watch carefully for signs 

that the economy may be evolving in unexpected ways, good or bad. 

Risks to the Inflation Outlook

the year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth.  To the 

extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further 

slowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling, and the dollar could start rising 

again.  And if foreign developments were to adversely affect the U.S. economy by more 

than I expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower, 

which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices.  But even if such 

developments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to

Unfortunately, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken 

for granted.  During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal 

Reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic 

disruptions--a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and 

employment.  With considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in
