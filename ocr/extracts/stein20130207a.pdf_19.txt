instabilities.   Moreover, as illustrated by the mortgage REIT sector that I described 

earlier, the economic appeal of maturity transformation hinges on the shape of the yield 

curve--in that particular case, on the spread between the yield on agency MBS and the so-

called general collateral (GC) repo rate at which these securities can be funded on a 

short-term basis.  And it would appear that our policies have at times put pressure on this 

spread from both sides.  Our purchases of long-term Treasury securities and agency MBS 

have clearly helped reduce long-term yields, and a number of observers have suggested 

that an unintended byproduct of our MEP--and the associated sales of short-term 

Treasury securities--was to exert an upward influence on GC repo rates.   

This sort of compression of term spreads is the twist in Operation Twist.  And you 

can see the financial stability angle as well as a possible response to concerns over 

numbers of instruments.  Suppose that, at some point in the future, once we are away 

from the zero lower bound, our dual mandate objectives call for an easing in policy.  Also 

suppose that, at the same time, there is a general concern about excessive maturity 

transformation in various parts of the financial system, and that we are having a hard time 

reining in this activity with conventional regulatory tools.  It might be that the right 

combination of policies would be to lower the path of the federal funds rate--thereby 

effectuating the needed easing--while at the same time engaging in MEP-like asset swaps 

to flatten the yield curve and reduce the appeal of maturity transformation.   

Conclusion 

I hope you will take this last example in the spirit in which it was intended--not as 

a currently actionable policy proposal, but as an extended hypothetical meant to give 

some tangible substance to a broader theme.  That broader theme is as follows:  One of
