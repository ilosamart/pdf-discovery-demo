So, how many more reserve balances can be drained, and how small will the 

Fed’s balance sheet get?  Let me emphasize that this question is highly speculative--we 

have not decided ex ante the desired long-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet, nor, as I 

noted earlier, do we have a definitive handle on banks’ long-run demand for reserve 

balances.  Indeed, the FOMC has said that it “expects to learn more about the underlying 

demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization.”10  Nonetheless, 

let me spend a little time reflecting on this challenging question. 

How banks respond to the Fed’s reduction in reserve balances could, in theory, 

take a few different forms.  One could envision that as the Fed reduces its securities 

holdings, a large share of which consists of Treasury securities, banks would easily 

replace any reduction in reserve balances with Treasury holdings, thereby keeping their 

LCRs roughly unchanged.  According to this line of thought, because central bank 

reserve balances and Treasury securities are treated identically by the LCR, banks should 

be largely indifferent to holding either asset to meet the regulation.  In that case, the 

reduction in reserves and corresponding increase in Treasury holdings might occur with 

relatively little adjustment in their relative rates of return.   

Alternatively, one could argue that banks may have particular preferences about 

the composition of their liquid assets.  And since banks are profit-maximizing entities, 

they will likely compare rates of return across various HQLA-eligible assets in 

determining how many reserves to hold.  If relative asset returns are a key driver of 

reserve demand, then interest rates across various types of HQLA will adjust on an
