points prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis.  (Prior to 1991:Q4, this 

series is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.)  The 

relative import price term, 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡, is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price 

index for core imported goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and 

semiconductors), less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied 

by the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.36 

To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the 

series used in the inflation model--for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in 

most cases--are first extended through the end of 2015.  In the case of inflation, the 

extensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total 

and core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the 

September FOMC meeting.37  Similarly, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 over the second half of 2015 is defined 

to be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment 

rate, less the CBO’s estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the 

CBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most 

recent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  For changes 

in the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based 

on regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude 

oil prices and exchange rates.  This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at 

annual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import
