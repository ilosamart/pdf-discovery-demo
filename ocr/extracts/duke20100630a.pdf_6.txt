also can continue to make loans that are safe and sound.  I’m sure you’re aware of what we have 

done, but I wanted to briefly discuss the lending guidance the Federal Reserve issued in 

collaboration with the other regulators:  

 In November 2008, regulators issued guidance stressing the importance of continuing to 

make prudent loans to creditworthy customers.1  

 In October 2009, the agencies issued guidance covering commercial real estate (CRE) 

loans and workouts.2  

 And in February of this year, we issued guidance regarding loans to small businesses.3  

All three pieces of guidance are intended to be accessible and easy to use by both banks 

and examiners and to provide clarity and consistency about the supervisory treatment of new 

loans, problem loans, and different loan workout approaches.  In particular, the CRE guidance 

includes a number of examples drawn from common loan situations and specifies classification 

treatment for alternate scenarios that depend on actions taken by the bank and the borrower.  To 

test my understanding of the specifics and to be sure our intentions were clearly communicated, 

as we were finalizing the guidance, I sat down with our supervision staff and went through each 

of the examples just as if we were in a loan closing conference.   

Importantly, at the Federal Reserve we have complemented these issuances with training 

programs for examiners and outreach to the banking industry to underscore the importance of 

sound lending practices.  In January, Federal Reserve staff instituted a Systemwide examiner 

training initiative that is reaching Federal Reserve and state examiners all across the United
