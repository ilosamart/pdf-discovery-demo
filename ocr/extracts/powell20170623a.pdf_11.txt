forced each link of the payments chain to operate sequentially.  Payments slowed, with the 

unintended consequence that uncovered positions grew larger and stayed open for even longer.  

Without credit, some customers were unable to meet their margin calls and were forced to 

liquidate their positions.  This gridlock sparked fears that a clearing member or even a CCP 

would be forced to default.  The Federal Reserve reacted to this threat by encouraging banks to 

continue to extend credit and by injecting funds into the system to help ensure that credit was 

available.  The 1987 stock market crash did not leave much lasting impact on the economy, but if 

these liquidity problems had been allowed to cause the default of a major clearing member or 

even a CCP then it could have had a much more serious impact.  While this might seem like 

simply an interesting bit of history, the payments chains involved in central clearing are still very 

similar today.   To guard against the same sorts of liquidity risk today, we need to make sure that 

every link in these chains will work as it is intended to under stress.  

While neither Brexit nor the October 1987 crash involved a clearing member default, 

these incidents do point to the potential complications of such a default.  I have already discussed 

the steps that a CCP might need to take in the event of a default to meet its liquidity needs.  

Some of those needs, such as committed lines of credit or repo agreements, could involve 

tapping financial resources at the same banks that are clearing members.  Thus, clearing 

members may need to juggle several different liquidity exposures simultaneously in the event of 

a default.  They may face draws on committed sources of liquidity, and if there are market 

stresses around the default, which seems a near certainty, they may at the same time face a
