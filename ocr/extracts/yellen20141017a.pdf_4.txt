affordable higher education.  The second two may come as more of a surprise:  business 

ownership and inheritances.  Like most sources of wealth, family ownership of 

businesses and inheritances are concentrated among households at the top of the 

distribution.  But both of these are less concentrated and more broadly distributed than 

other forms of wealth, and there is some basis for thinking that they may also play a role 

in providing economic opportunities to a considerable number of families below the top.   

In focusing on these four building blocks, I do not mean to suggest that they 

account for all economic opportunity, but I do believe they are all significant sources of 

opportunity for individuals and their families to improve their economic circumstances.  

Income and Wealth Inequality in the Survey of Consumer Finances 

I will start with the basics about widening inequality, drawing heavily on a trove 

of data generated by the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), 

the latest of which was conducted in 2013 and published last month.4  The SCF is broadly 

consistent with other data that show widening wealth and income inequality over the past 

several decades, but I am employing the SCF because it offers the added advantage of 

specific detail on income, wealth, and debt for each of 6,000 households surveyed.5  This 

detail from family balance sheets provides a glimpse of the relative access to the four 

sources of opportunity I will discuss. 

                                                 
4 Asset questions in the SCF are based on the value at the time of the survey.  Since most interviews were 

completed between April and December 2013, some of the asset values do not reflect price increases 

experienced in late 2013, and none reflect increases in 2014.  Income questions in the SCF refer to the prior 

calendar year, so the 2013 survey reports 2012 income.  See Jesse Bricker, Lisa J. Dettling, Alice 

Henriques, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, John Sabelhaus, Jeffrey Thompson, and Richard A. Windle

Finances,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 100 (September), pp. 1-41,

5 “Households” and “families” are used interchangeably in these remarks because the SCF uses both 

interchangeably to describe its respondents.
