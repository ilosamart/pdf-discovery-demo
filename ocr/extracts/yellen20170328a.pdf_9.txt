on the knowledge and experience of our staff.  In discussing the examples, I would like to 

make five points.  

First, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to 

employment early in their work lives.  The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young 

Workers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to 

emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19  Other studies have found that 

students who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher 

wages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs 

improved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic 

aspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20  The findings point to some of the 

reasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called 

Pocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-

olds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and 

reinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.  

In its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of 

them in jobs.  The results of this modest program indicate the promise of efforts that 

                                                 
19 The survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a 
permanent job--4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined.  See Board of Governors of the

20 Baum and Ruhm (2016) do observe, however, that these gains from employment during the 
senior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts.  See Charles L. 
Baum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience,” 
Southern Economic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343-63.
