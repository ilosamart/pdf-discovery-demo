many participants in the stress tests now must address how they would respond to the 

failure of their largest counterparty. 

Our stress tests demonstrate that banks have now built enough capital to withstand 

a severe recession.  The capital-building phase of the post-crisis era is now complete, but 

as part of CCAR, stress testing continues to contribute to the significant and ongoing 

improvement since 2009 in risk management by banks.  The original reason for the 

qualitative objection aspect of stress testing was to provide incentives for banks to 

address the risk-management shortcomings that the Federal Reserve had observed during 

the financial crisis.  For example, many firms supervised by the Federal Reserve had 

substantial deficiencies in their ability to measure, monitor, and manage their risks.  

These shortcomings made it difficult for banks to accurately report their risk exposures to 

the Board, and consequently, threatened to undermine the credibility of the stress tests, 

which were, and remain, dependent on data from the banks.   

Since the beginning of CCAR in 2011, large banks have significantly improved 

their risk-management and capital-planning processes. The qualitative assessment 

conducted as part of the 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles found that most firms either meet 

or are very close to meeting the Federal Reserveâ€™s supervisory expectations for capital 

planning.  Large banks have improved the methods they use to identify their unique risks, 

now use sound practices for identifying and addressing model weaknesses, and have 

strong processes in place to evaluate their capital positions on a forward-looking basis.  

While we continue to perform a qualitative assessment and ensure that progress is 

retained, the improvements led the Federal Reserve to conclude that for most banks this 

assessment can be incorporated into our regular supervisory practices.  The evolution of
