even as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment

mentioned.  During that period, the FOMC and most private forecasters generally 

lowered their assessments of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate.  

Indeed, at our October 2015 meeting, the FOMC had a comprehensive discussion of 

neutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that 

those rates had declined both here and abroad, and that the decline had been going on for
