in the major advanced economies would be designed to provide accommodation targeted 

to supporting domestic demand, which would in turn support global demand--in contrast 

to classical demand-sapping beggar-thy-neighbor policies designed to shift demand by 

weakening the exchange rate.  The agreement to use domestic policy instruments to 

support domestic output and inflation objectives is likely, on net, to be an important 

constraint against beggar-thy-neighbor policies, especially in the less charted territory of 

unconventional policy. 

Implications for the United States

traditionally the United States is viewed more as a source than a recipient of cross-border 

spillovers, recent events have demonstrated that U.S. economic and financial conditions 

can be sensitive to spillovers from advanced economies as well as from major emerging 

market economies.  Over the past two years, we have seen divergences emerge among 

major economies in domestic growth prospects and the expected direction of monetary 

policy.  Earlier in this period, the focus was on heightened deflationary risks in Japan and 

the euro area.  The policy response to these pressures and the anticipated divergence 

between the policy trajectories in these economies and the United States contributed to a 

10 percent real appreciation in the dollar against a basket of currencies through the spring 

of this year.   

More recently, growth projections have been marked down for emerging market 

economies, which previously had been an important source of global growth.  Increased 

recognition of the risks to the outlook for major emerging market economies pushed the 

dollar up further to 15 percent above its level last summer and contributed to a more
