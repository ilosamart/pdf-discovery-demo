before the recent financial crisis and recession, however, the enforcement mechanisms 

for these rules did not prevent these targets from being breached, and fiscal problems in 

several euro-area countries have recently been a source of financial and economic stress.  

European leaders are working to strengthen their tools for enforcing fiscal discipline.   

 Although fiscal rules have not been panaceas in the United States or the euro area 

as a whole, a number of other economies, in Europe and elsewhere, seemed to have found 

fiscal rules to be helpful in achieving greater budget discipline.  For example, 

Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands all realized improvements in their 

fiscal situations after adopting rules that limit spending.  Canada saw improvement in its 

deficit after it implemented spending  limits in the early 1990s, and its ratio of public debt 

to national income fell substantially after 1998 when it put in place a “balanced budget or 

better” rule.  A number of emerging market nations, such as Chile, have also applied 

fiscal rules with some success.  According to the International Monetary Fund, about 80 

countries currently are subject to national or supranational fiscal rules.10

Clearly, a fiscal rule does not guarantee improved budget outcomes; after all, any 

rule imposed by a legislature can be revoked or circumvented by the same legislature.  

However, although not all countries with fiscal rules have achieved lower deficits and 

debt, the weight of the evidence suggests that well-designed rules can help promote 

improved fiscal performance.

their effectiveness.
