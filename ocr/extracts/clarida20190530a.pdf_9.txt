have had an important influence on the path for the policy rate actually implemented in 

recent years.   

In addition to u* and r*, another important input into any monetary policy 

assessment is the state of inflation expectations.  Indeed, I believe price stability requires 

that not only actual inflation be centered at our 2 percent objective, but also that expected 

inflation be equal to our 2 percent inflation objective.  Unlike realized inflation, inflation 

expectations themselves are not directly observable; they must be inferred from 

econometric models, market prices, and surveys of households and firms.  As I assess the 

totality of the evidence, I judge that, at present, indicators suggest that longer-term 

inflation expectations sit at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our 

price-stability mandate.  

Where does this leave us today?  As I already noted, the U.S. economy is in a 

very good place, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, inflationary pressures 

muted, expected inflation stable, and GDP growth solid and projected to remain so. 

Moreover, the federal funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer-run neutral 

level, and the unemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u*.  Plugging these 

inputs into a 1993 Taylor-type rule produces a federal funds rate between 2.25 and 

2.5 percent, which is the range for the policy rate that the FOMC has reaffirmed since our 

January meeting.  Most recently, the Committee judged at our May meeting that the 

current stance of policy remains appropriate, and that decision reflects our view that some 

of the softness in recent inflation data will prove to be transitory.  This judgment aligns 

with some private-sector forecasts, which now project PCE inflation to return to 2 percent 

by 2020.  However, if the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation
