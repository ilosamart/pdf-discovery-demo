Reducing the Probability of Default of Systemic Financial Firms 

Much has been done since the crisis to strengthen the regulation of large banking 

organizations.  The highlights would begin with the Basel III capital and liquidity reforms, 

including the graduated risk-based capital surcharges for globally systemic financial firms.  

These reforms are in the process of implementation in the United States and elsewhere.   In 

addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) 

imposes on the largest financial institutions enhanced prudential standards and also requires 

central clearing of derivatives.   And banking regulators have implemented enhanced supervisory 

measures such as stress testing and recovery planning.

collectively constitute a broad and well-structured agenda to strengthen the resilience of the 

financial system.  The Federal Reserve and the rest of the regulatory community are working 

diligently to implement that agenda.   

Today, risk-based capital and leverage ratios for banks of all sizes have improved 

materially since 2009 and are significantly above their levels in the years preceding the crisis.  

The banking sector overall also has substantially improved its liquidity position over the past few 

years.  The system is undeniably stronger than before the crisis.
