Good morning.  I want to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak 

to you today.1  It is an honor and a pleasure to be part of this unique annual event that 

brings together bankers, bank supervisors, and researchers to discuss the latest 

community banking research, recent trends in community banking practices, and policy 

issues that are on the minds of conference attendees.   

I want to start, first, by conveying my own perspective on the importance of 

community banks.  Community banks have a long history of providing essential financial 

services to households, small businesses, and small farms in communities across the 

United States.  Their ability to effectively provide these services speaks to the strength of 

the community banking business model--that is, establishing and maintaining local 

relationships, and offering customers a face-to-face interaction with a local banker.   

And it is something I have observed firsthand, especially for community banks in 

rural communities.  Growing up in rural Colorado and Utah, I saw the importance of 

community bankers having local knowledge and being personally invested in the same 

communities that they serve.  That local knowledge, and the relationship-based lending 

that is the hallmark of community banking, can stem losses during downturns, as 

community banks may be able to work with borrowers to avoid losses.  Indeed, research 

has shown that small business lending at small banks declined less severely than at large 

banks during the last recession.2  At the same time, I have seen the challenges that many 

                                                 
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System. 
2 While small banks reduced small business lending by roughly 13 percent between 2009 and 2011, large 
banks reduced lending by nearly 30 percent.  See Rebel A. Cole (2012), How Did the Financial Crisis 
Affect Small Business Lending in the United States? report developed under contract with the U.S. Small
