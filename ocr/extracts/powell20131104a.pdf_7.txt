although the gap has diminished more recently as growth in the EMEs has slowed.  

Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved 

their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth 

differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.  As is evident in the right-hand 

chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems 

to be quite strong.  In particular, the rise in capital flows following the global financial 

crisis coincided with stronger relative growth performance in EMEs.  And in 2011, 

capital inflows diminished along with the growth differential.   

Another key driver of EME capital flows is global attitude toward risk.  Swings in 

sentiment between “risk-on” and “risk-off” have led investors to reposition across asset 

classes, resulting in corresponding movements in capital flows.9  Indeed, as shown in 

chart 3, the most common measure of uncertainty and the market price of volatility--the 

VIX--is strongly correlated with net inflows into EMEs.  Although the causes of 

movements in global risk sentiment are uncertain, the ebb and flow of potential crises and 

policy responses, such as we experienced during the European crisis, are clearly 

important.  Of course, movements in risk sentiment may not be fully independent of 

monetary policy.  An interesting line of research has begun to consider how changes in 

monetary policy itself may affect risk sentiment.  For example, some studies indicate that 

an easing of U.S. monetary policy tends to lower volatility (as measured by the VIX), 

increase leverage of financial intermediaries, and boost EME capital inflows and 

currencies.10
