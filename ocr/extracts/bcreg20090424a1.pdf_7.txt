To conclude the process, projected losses, revenues, and changes in reserves were combined to 

evaluate the amount and quality of capital that each firm should have at the end of 2010. Calculations 

were done on a post-purchase accounting basis and considered taxes, including deferred tax assets, and 

dividends on preferred stock. Under the more adverse scenario, if any firm is found to have less capital 

than the need projected by the SCAP assessment, supervisors will request those firms to take deliberate 

actions to augment their capital so that they will remain in an appropriately strong financial position and 

be able to lend and support financial intermediation. Thus the capital needs determined by this 

supervisory exercise should be viewed as a capital buffer designed to be drawn down as losses 

materialize should the economy be weaker than expected, and still be substantial enough at the end of 

2010 for firms to be considered sufficiently capitalized. If the economy recovers more quickly than 

specified in the more adverse scenario, firms could find their capital buffers at the end of 2010 more 

than sufficient to support their critical intermediation role and could take actions to reverse their capital 

build-up. 

II.C. Initial Guidance on Macroeconomic Scenarios 

For implementation of the SCAP, the supervisors provided assumptions for two alternative 

macroeconomic scenarios. BHCs were encouraged to consider the broader macroeconomic conditions 

and adapt the assumptions to reflect their specific business activities when projecting their own losses 

and resources over 2009 and 2010. For example, local residential house prices would be expected to be 

a significant determinant in projected loan loss rates given their prominent role in mortgage and 

consumer lending in recent years. Projections under two alternative scenarios also allow for analysis of 

the sensitivity of a firm's business to changes in economic conditions. 
The baseline assumptions for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate for 2009 and 2010 
were assumed to be equal to the average of the projections published by Consensus Forecasts, the Blue 
Chip survey, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters. The projections were based on forecasts 
available in February 2009 just before the commencement of the SCAP. The baseline scenario was 
intended to represent a consensus view about the depth and duration of the recession. The supervisors 
developed an alternative "more adverse" scenario to reflect the possibility that the economy could turn 
out to be appreciably weaker than expected under the baseline outlook. By design, the path of the U.S. 
economy in this alternative more adverse scenario reflects a deeper and longer recession than in the 
baseline. However, the more adverse alternative is not, and is not intended to be a "worst case" 
scenario. To be most useful, stress tests should reflect conditions that are severe but plausible.3 [Footnote 3. 
The "more adverse" scenario was constructed from the historical track record of private forecasters as well as their 
current assessments of uncertainty. In particular, based on the historical accuracy of Blue Chip forecasts made since 
the late 1970s, the likelihood that the average unemployment rate in 2010 could be at least as high as in the 
alternative more adverse scenario is roughly 10 percent. In addition, the subjective probability assessments provided 
by participants in the January Consensus Forecasts survey and the February Survey of Professional Forecasters 
imply a roughly 15 percent chance that real GDP growth could be at least as low, and unemployment at least as 
high, as assumed in the more adverse scenario. End footnote 3.]. 

The assumptions for house prices in the baseline economic outlook are consistent with the path 
that was implied by futures prices for the Case-Shiller 10-City Composite index in late February and the 
average response to a special question on house prices in the Blue Chip survey. For the more adverse 
scenario, house prices are assumed to be about 10 percent lower at the end of 2010 relative to their
