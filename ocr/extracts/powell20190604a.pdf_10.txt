important policy message may be about how the central bank will respond to the 

unexpected rather than what it will do if there are no surprises.  Unfortunately, at times 

the dot plot has distracted attention from the more important topic of how the FOMC will 

react to unexpected economic developments.  In times of high uncertainty, the median 

dot might best be thought of as the least unlikely outcome.  

Let me conclude by saying that I look forward to our discussions here and to the 

ongoing work of the review that lies ahead.  We need the best tools and strategies 

possible for dealing with the challenges we now face, and we must communicate them in 

a clear and credible way.  My colleagues and I welcome your best thinking on these 

issues.
