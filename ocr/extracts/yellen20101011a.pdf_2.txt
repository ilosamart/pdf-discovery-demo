 

 Thank you for that very kind introduction.  When I look at the roster of previous 

recipients of the Adam Smith Award, it is very august company indeed.  It’s a 

tremendous honor to appear before you this year, and I am very grateful.1  

 I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those 

of my Federal Reserve colleagues.  Today I would like to cover a subject that is of 

surpassing importance for economic policy:  the implications of financial market 

excesses for the supervision of the financial system, and beyond that, for the formulation 

of monetary policy.  

Just two years ago, we lived through an almost unimaginable catastrophe--the 

near collapse of a global financial system that many economists had come to believe was 

impervious to the sort of panic that could bring on a worldwide recession.  The prevailing 

view was that modern economic policymaking, and central banking in particular, had 

mastered the management of the business cycle, and that the application of modern risk-

management tools had greatly increased the stability of the financial system.  Financial 

markets were not held to be perfect, of course.  But they were viewed as self-correcting 

systems that tended to return to a stable equilibrium before they could inflict widespread 

damage on the real economy.  

That view lies in tatters today as we look at tens of millions of unemployed and 

the trillions of dollars of lost output and lost wealth around the world.  These events 

should have convinced any doubters that our financial system is vulnerable to the kinds 

of catastrophic breakdowns that can wreck the overall economy.  An inescapable 

conclusion is that a first-order priority must be to engineer a stronger, more robust system

Francisco, for assistance in preparing these remarks.
