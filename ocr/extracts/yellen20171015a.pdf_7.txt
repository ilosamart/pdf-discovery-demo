implying that the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral 

policy stance.  But we expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat 

over time, and, as a result, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over 

the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Indeed, FOMC participants have 

built such a gradual path of rate hikes into their projections for the next couple of years. 

Of course, policy is not on a preset course.  I have spoken about some of the 

uncertainties associated with the inflation outlook in particular, and we will be paying 

close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead.  But uncertainty about the 

outlook is by no means limited to inflation.  As always, the Committee will adjust the 

stance of monetary policy in response to incoming economic information and the 

evolution of the economic outlook to achieve its objectives of maximum employment and 

stable prices.  Moreover, we are mindful of the possibility that shifting expectations 

concerning the path of U.S. policy can lead to spillovers to other economies via financial 

markets and the value of the dollar.  We remain committed to communicating as clearly 

and effectively as possible to help mitigate the risk of sudden changes in the policy 

outlook among market participants that could spur unintended effects in global financial 

markets.
