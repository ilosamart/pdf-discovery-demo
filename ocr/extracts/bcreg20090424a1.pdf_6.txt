downs on securities held in the trading and in the investment accounts, and discounts on assets 

acquired in acquisitions of distressed or failed financial institutions. 

II.B. General Description of the Exercise 

The BHCs were asked to estimate their potential losses on loans, securities, and trading 

positions, as well as pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) and the resources available from the allowance 

for loan and lease losses (ALLL) under two alternative macroeconomic scenarios. Each participating f i rm 

was instructed to project potential losses on its loan, investment, and trading securities portfolios, 

including off-balance sheet commitments and contingent liabilities and exposures over the two-year 

horizon beginning with year-end 2008 financial statement data. Firms were provided with a common 

set of indicative loss rate ranges for specific loan categories under conditions of the baseline and the 

more adverse economic scenarios. Firms were allowed to diverge f rom the indicative loss rates where 

they could provide evidence that their estimated loss rates were appropriate. In addition, firms with 

trading assets of $100 billion or more were asked to estimate potential trading-related market and 

counter-party credit losses under a market stress scenario provided by the supervisors, based on market 

shocks that occurred in the second half of 2008. 

The BHCs also were asked to project the resources they would have available to absorb losses 

over the two-year horizon under both scenarios. These resources consist of PPNR - net interest income, 

fees and other non-interest income, net of non-credit-related expenses - and reserves already 

established for probable incurred losses at December 31 , 2008. PPNR and the ALLL, combined with 

existing capital above the amount sufficient to exceed minimum regulatory capital standards, are 

resources that the f i rm would have available to absorb some of their estimated losses under the 

scenarios. 

Teams of supervisors and analysts composed of members f rom each of the agencies reviewed 

and assessed the firms' submissions. Some teams had special expertise in particular asset classes, or in 

revenues, reserves, and capital, and other teams had special expertise in the specific participating firms. 

At the outset of the process, teams dedicated to evaluating particular categories of assets, revenues, 

and reserves evaluated the firms' submissions and actively engaged with the firms for several weeks to 

obtain additional information necessary to support the firms' estimates. Some firms were asked to 

provide additional information on the risk characteristics of their portfolios to supplement their initial 

submission. Examiners also reviewed and evaluated the quantitative methods that firms used to project 

losses and resources, and support for key assumptions. The supervisory analyses of losses built on 

individual firm-specific information about the risk characteristics of the portfolio, underwrit ing practices, 

and risk management practices. 

These teams applied across-firm, comparative analysis to support their assessments. To 

facilitate this horizontal comparison, supervisors applied independent quantitative methods using f i rm-

specific data to estimate losses and loss absorption resources. The quantitative methods were applied 

to all the firms to provide consistency in evaluating firms' estimates. The results of these analyses were 

then evaluated in the context of previous examination work and in the context of the indicative loss 

rates and macroeconomic scenarios provided by the supervisors to the BHCs at the beginning of the 

exercise.
