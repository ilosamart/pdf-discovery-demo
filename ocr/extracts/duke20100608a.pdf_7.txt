ways in order for “normal” lending activity—whatever that will mean in the coming months and 

years—to reemerge.    

 Essential to jumpstarting market activity is rebuilding consumer confidence.  Over the 

last few years, the Federal Reserve has been just as aggressive in providing safeguards for 

consumers as it was in making liquidity available to institutions.  We have created a blanket of 

new protections for consumers that we think will go far toward avoiding the excesses of the 

recent past.  I’d like to take a few minutes to remind you of some of these changes. 

Subprime Mortgage Lending 

 First, to deal with the subprime mortgage market, changes have been made under the 

Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, adding layers of defenses for borrowers of higher-

cost mortgages.2  The new rules, most of which went into effect in October, target higher-priced 

loans where borrowers are most vulnerable to abuse.  For these “riskier” mortgages, our new 

rules require that lenders verify borrowers’ abilities to repay the loans at a fully indexed rate, ban 

prepayment penalties if payments may increase in the loan’s early years, require escrows for 

taxes and insurance, and prohibit a range of misleading advertising practices.  

Mortgage Disclosure Reform 

 Currently, the Federal Reserve Board is engaged in a comprehensive revision of the 

mortgage disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act to improve the effectiveness of 

mortgage disclosure forms for all loans.  These new forms were developed through consumer 

testing, including focus groups and detailed surveys, to ensure that they provide information that 

is useful and understandable to consumers.  These disclosures are designed to better focus 

consumer attention on mortgage features, such as variable rates, that might be appropriate for 

                                                 
2 See Regulation Z (12 CFR Part 226), www.federalreserve.gov/reportforms/formsreview/RegZ_20080730_ffr.pdf, 
which implements the Truth in Lending Act and the Home Ownership and Protection Act.
