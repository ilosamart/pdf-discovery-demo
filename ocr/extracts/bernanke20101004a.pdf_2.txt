The recent deep recession and the subsequent slow recovery have created severe 

budgetary pressures not only for many households and businesses, but for governments 

as well.  Indeed, in the United States, governments at all levels are grappling not only 

with the near-term effects of economic weakness, but also with the longer-run pressures 

that will be generated by the need to provide health care and retirement security to an 

aging population.  There is no way around it--meeting these challenges will require 

policymakers and the public to make some very difficult decisions and to accept some 

sacrifices.  But history makes clear that countries that continually spend beyond their 

means suffer slower growth in incomes and living standards and are prone to greater 

economic and financial instability.  Conversely, good fiscal management is a cornerstone 

of sustainable growth and prosperity. 

Although state and local governments face significant fiscal challenges, my 

primary focus today will be the federal budget situation and its economic implications.1

Fiscal Challenges 

  I 

will describe the factors underlying current and projected budget deficits and explain why 

it is crucially important that we put U.S. fiscal policy on a sustainable path.  I will also 

offer some thoughts on whether new fiscal rules or institutions might help promote a 

successful transition to fiscal sustainability in the United States.   

The budgetary position of the federal government has deteriorated substantially 

during the past two fiscal years, with the budget deficit averaging 9-1/2 percent of 

national income during that time.  For comparison, the deficit averaged 2 percent of
