ability of central banks to perform their traditional functions to stabilize the financial system in a

borrowing for households and businesses, thereby encouraging them to keep spending.  

 After short-term rates reached the effective zero bound in December 2008, the Federal 

Reserve also acted to shape interest rate and inflation expectations through various

guidance than usual about the likely path of interest rates and to help financial markets form 

more accurate expectations about policy in a highly uncertain economic and financial 

environment.  By noting that the federal funds rate was likely to remain at “exceptionally low”
