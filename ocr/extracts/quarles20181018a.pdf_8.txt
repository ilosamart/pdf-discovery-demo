Something along these lines could be happening to inflation, especially given the 

important role of expected inflation in the behavior of actual inflation.  Perhaps inflation 

is just sending a signal of people’s trust in the Fed’s ability to meet its inflation objective.  

If so, no complaints here.  That is a good thing.  However, a problem does arise if the Fed 

remains reliant on inflation as our only gauge of the economy’s position relative to its 

potential.  There are risks in pushing the economy into a place it does not want to go if 

we limit ourselves to navigating by what might be a faulty indicator.  Anchored inflation 

expectations might mask the inflation signal coming from an overheated economy for a 

period, but I have no doubt that prices would eventually move up in response to resource 

constraints.  The ultimate price, from the perspective of the dual mandate, would be an 

unanchoring of inflation expectations.   

Of course, I view this more as a risk than my baseline expectation.  As I have 

said, I am optimistic about potential growth, and I expect that even relatively strong 

growth can be met without running into economic constraints.  However, I also think that 

we should pay attention to other indicators of tightness and overheating in addition to 

inflation.  There are other signs of potential besides inflation, including, but not limited 

to, direct measures of labor utilization or indications of shortages and bottlenecks in 

production.     

Policy Considerations 

How should these thoughts affect monetary policy?  I began my remarks by 

noting that there may be reason to think that the productive capacity of our economy 

could be accelerating, which would allow a more gradual withdrawal of accommodation 

without overheating.  But I have noted as well that there may be reason to think that
