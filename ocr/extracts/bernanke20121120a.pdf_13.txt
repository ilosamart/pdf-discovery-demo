Even as fiscal policymakers address the urgent issue of longer-run fiscal 

sustainability, they should not ignore a second key objective:  to avoid unnecessarily 

adding to the headwinds that are already holding back the economic recovery.  

Fortunately, the two objectives are fully compatible and mutually reinforcing.  Preventing 

a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy early next year will support the transition 

of the economy back to full employment; a stronger economy will in turn reduce the 

deficit and contribute to achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.  At the same time, a 

credible plan to put the federal budget on a path that will be sustainable in the long run 

could help keep longer-term interest rates low and boost household and business 

confidence, thereby supporting economic growth today. 

Coming together to find fiscal solutions will not be easy, but the stakes are high.  

Uncertainty about how the fiscal cliff, the raising of the debt limit, and the longer-term 

budget situation will be addressed appears already to be affecting private spending and 

investment decisions and may be contributing to an increased sense of caution in 

financial markets, with adverse effects on the economy.  Continuing to push off difficult 

policy choices will only prolong and intensify these uncertainties.  Moreover, while the 

details of whatever agreement is reached to resolve the fiscal cliff are important, the 

economic confidence of both market participants and the general public likely will also 

be influenced by the extent to which our political system proves able to deliver a 

reasonable solution with a minimum of uncertainty and delay.  Finding long-term 

solutions that can win sufficient political support to be enacted may take some time, but 

meaningful progress toward this end can be achieved now if policymakers are willing to 

think creatively and work together constructively.
