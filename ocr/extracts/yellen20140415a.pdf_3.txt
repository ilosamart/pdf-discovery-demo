Funding Ratio (NSFR).  The LCR is designed to improve a bankâ€™s ability to withstand 

severe short-term liquidity stress events by requiring banking firms to hold a buffer of 

highly liquid assets to cover net cash outflows in a 30-day stress scenario.  The NSFR is 

meant to promote resilience over a one-year horizon by requiring banks that hold less 

liquid assets to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding.  

As others have observed, the new Basel liquidity standards address financial 

stability risks associated with excessive maturity transformation through at least two 

channels.   

First, the new standards insulate banks from liquidity shocks.  In the case of the 

LCR, requiring firms to hold a buffer of highly liquid assets will help to ensure that they 

have a means of generating liquidity in the event of creditor runs.  In the case of the 

NSFR, requiring firms to use higher levels of stable funding for less liquid assets reduces 

the vulnerabilities of a firm to structural maturity mismatches.  Banking firms that self-

insure against liquidity risk in these ways are less likely to need government liquidity 

support in times of stress. 

Second, the new standards provide an incentive for firms to move to more stable 

funding structures.  Under the LCR and NSFR, firms that engage in unstable forms of 

maturity transformation will be required to maintain buffers of highly liquid assets and 

use stable funding, both of which will impose costs for the firms.  Reducing the amount 

of maturity transformation they engage in will help firms minimize these costs.  

While the LCR and NSFR are important steps forward, they do not fully address 

the financial stability concerns associated with short-term wholesale funding.  These 

standards tend to focus on the liquidity positions of firms taken in isolation, rather than
