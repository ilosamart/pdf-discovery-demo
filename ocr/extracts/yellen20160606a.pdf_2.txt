I am delighted to be with you today.  I will discuss recent economic 

developments, the outlook, and their implications for monetary policy.  My message will 

be largely favorable, although recent developments have been mixed.  Most importantly, 

the economy has registered considerable progress over the past several years toward the 

Federal Reserveâ€™s goals of maximum employment and price stability, and, as I will 

explain, there are good reasons to expect that we will advance further toward those goals.  

The news from the labor market over the past year has been generally good, with 

significant job gains, the unemployment rate declining below 5 percent, rising household 

incomes, and tentative signs of faster wage growth.  At the same time, recent signs of a 

slowdown in job creation bear close watching.  Inflation has been lower than our 

objective of 2 percent, but I expect it to move up over time for reasons that I will 

describe.  If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and 

inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual 

increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to 

meeting and maintaining those objectives.  However, I will emphasize that monetary 

policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy 

would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy.  

In particular, an important theme of my remarks today will be the inevitable 

uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the economy.  Unfortunately, all economic 

projections are certain to turn out to be inaccurate in some respects, and possibly 

significantly so.  Will the economic situation in Europe or China take a turn for the worse 

or exceed expectations?  Will U.S. productivity growth pick up and allow stronger 

growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes or instead continue to stagnate?
