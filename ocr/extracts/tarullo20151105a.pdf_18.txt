foreign banks.  If they see the rigor of home consolidated oversight waning, they will have a 

chance to intensify their own supervision.  But with the prospect of a failed bank, there will be 

no time for such adjustments or, as a practical matter, the capacity to impose new requirements 

may become limited by the time the prospect of failure is looming.  The imposition of 

requirements in the midst of a crisis would in any event likely exacerbate stress.  Even with the 

best of intentions, today’s home country regulators cannot effectively bind their successors’ 

response to the insolvency of one of their globally important banks when political and economic 

pressures are likely to be high.   

The gone-concern loss absorbency requirement for FBO intermediate holding companies 

proposed by the Federal Reserve Board on October 30 should enhance the prospects for an 

orderly firmwide global resolution of an FBO by its home country resolution authority through 

increasing confidence that the U.S. operations of the FBO will obtain their appropriate share of 

the loss absorbency capacity of the consolidated foreign bank.  Past experience suggests that host 

supervisors are most likely to ringfence assets when there is doubt that the local customers and 

counterparties of foreign banks will be adequately taken into account.  Yet if, for any reason, the 

home jurisdiction resolution is unsuccessful, the internal long-term debt will be available to U.S. 

authorities for orderly resolution and recapitalization of the intermediate holding companies.   

We have calibrated our proposed internal TLAC requirements slightly below our 

proposed external TLAC requirements for U.S. GSIBs.  This slightly lower calibration for 

internal TLAC recalls the difference between local going-concern capital requirements and the 

GSIB surcharge, but the gap is somewhat smaller, reflecting the concerns I mentioned a moment 

ago.  The proposal thus balances support for the preferred resolution strategy of the home
