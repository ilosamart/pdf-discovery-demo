to instrument-rule specification has been found to produce good macroeconomic 

outcomes across a wide range of macroeconomic models.  Moreover, in a broad class of 

both closed and open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, 

models, Taylor-type rules can be shown to be optimal given the underlying micro 

foundations of these models.  

In original formulations of Taylor-type rules, r* was treated as constant and set 

equal to 2 percent, and potential output was set equal to the Congressional Budget Office 

(CBO) estimates of potential output, or, in specifications using the unemployment rate as 

the activity variable, u* was set equal to the CBO’s estimate of the natural unemployment 

rate.  These assumptions were reasonable at the time, and I myself wrote a number of 

papers with coauthors in the years before the Global Financial Crisis that incorporated 

them.7 

A Dive into Data Dependence 

Fast-forward to today.  At each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

meeting, my colleagues and I consult potential policy rate paths implied by a number of 

policy rules, as we assess what adjustments, if any, may be required for the stance of 

monetary policy to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate objectives.8  A presentation 

and discussion of several of these rules has been included in the semiannual Monetary 

Policy Report to the Congress since July 2017.9  One thing I have come to appreciate is

8 For the FOMC’s description of its mandate, see the FOMC’s (2019) Statement on Longer-Run Goals and 
Monetary Policy Strategy.  The FOMC first adopted this statement in January 2012 and has reaffirmed the 
statement at the start of each subsequent year (including this year, when all 17 FOMC participants 
supported it).   
9 The box “Monetary Policy Rules and Systematic Monetary Policy” in the Board’s February 2019 
Monetary Policy Report (MPR) describes how simple policy rules are used in theory and in practical 
policymaking.  See Board of Governors (2019).  The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the 
July 2018 MPR discusses how shifts in r* complicate monetary policy decision making.  See Board of
