4 percent from the year before.  Like larger banks more recently, this result was the 

product of particularly strong loan activity, with recent year-over-year loan growth of  

7.7 percent, which was substantially above the increase last year in the banking industry 

as a whole. 

Turning to recent regulatory developments, the big news, of course, is the 

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act sponsored by Senator 

Crapo, passed by Congress at the end of May and signed by the President.  Before I get to 

that, let me briefly mention some things the Federal Reserve and other agencies have 

done--in some cases presaging steps taken in the new legislation--to reduce the regulatory 

burden on community and regional banks.  

One supervisory improvement is a Federal Reserve program called Bank Exams 

Tailored to Risk, or the BETR program.  It uses financial metrics to differentiate the level 

of risk between banks before examinations and assist examiners in tailoring examination 

procedures to minimize the regulatory burden for firms that engage in low-risk activities, 

while subjecting higher-risk activities to more testing and review.  Another initiative has 

been to shift a significant amount of the Federal Reserve’s examination activity offsite.   

Additionally, the Federal Reserve, along with other agencies, took action to 

simplify the reporting responsibilities of smaller banks with a new streamlined Call 

Report form in 2017.  Based on feedback from community banks, we and other regulators 

also increased the threshold for requiring an appraisal on commercial real estate loans 

from $250,000 to $500,000.  Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is developing a revised 

approach to determining “control” under the Bank Holding Company Act that could help 

banks raise capital and facilitate nonbank investments.
