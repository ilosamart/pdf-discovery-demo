 First, though, I want to describe how Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States 

are dealing with the vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations, and thus are 

fulfilling their responsibilities as host-country supervisors.  I discuss the United Kingdom 

separately from the EU both because it is outside the euro zone and because, as a host 

jurisdiction, it is more similar to the United States than to other EU member states or, indeed, to 

any other country in the world. 

 The EU has not, since the crisis, specifically adjusted the structure of regulation of 

foreign banks by its member states in their role as host supervisors.  For more than a decade 

before the crisis, EU member states had prudently required that not only commercial banking, 

but also investment banking subsidiaries of foreign (non-EU-based) banking organizations, be 

subject to Basel capital requirements in the same way as EU-based firms.  With the adoption of 

CRD IV,
11

 the directive implementing the new EU capital requirements, Basel III will now be 

applied to all EU firms, including EU bank and investment bank subsidiaries of non-EU banking 

organizations.  Branches of non-EU banks are generally not subject to local requirements.   

Before the crisis and the subsequent development of Basel III, there was no leverage ratio 

requirement in EU capital directives.  Insofar as a new leverage ratio is part of the Basel III 

package agreed upon internationally, one would anticipate that it will be applied to commercial 

banking and investment banking firms in the EU, again including local subsidiaries of non-EU 

firms.  Likewise, one would anticipate that the Basel III liquidity requirements will be 

implemented in the EU in accordance with the internationally agreed timeline and, again, that it 

will apply to EU subsidiaries of FBOs.

 The European CRD IV package, which implemented the global Basel III capital standards into EU law, entered 

into force on July 17, 2013.  See http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/regcapital/legislation_in_force_en.htm.
