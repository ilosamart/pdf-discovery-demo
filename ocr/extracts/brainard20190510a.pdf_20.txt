stabilized in early 2009, middle-income households did not see their wealth begin to 

recover until 2010, when the unemployment rate began to decline (figure 13).   

Even as we welcome the many benefits of the current strong job market, longer-

term trends raise concerns.  Labor market disparities by race have been an enduring 

feature of the labor market for decades.  The unemployment rate of blacks, while near its 

historical low, remains at about 7 percent, twice the unemployment rate of whites.  

Recent research suggests that the strong labor market may be helping to narrow some of 

the long-standing disparities for some racial minorities and women, although the results 

are tentative and very modest.43   

The progressive long-term decline in the share of national income that goes to 

workers through wages is concerning for middle-income households.  The share going to 

workers—which economists call the labor share—translates into how much of our 

economic output shows up in people’s paychecks.  The decline in the labor share goes to 

the heart of the rising inequality of wealth and the unequal sharing of prosperity.  

Several explanations have been put forward for the decline in the labor share.  

The increasing concentration of industries into the hands of a few firms has likely 

reduced the bargaining power of workers.44  Increasing automation in the workplace is
