insulated from the run risk that can lead to the adverse feedback loop and contagion 

possibilities discussed earlier. 

A more interesting approach would be to tie liquidity and capital standards 

together by requiring higher levels of capital for large firms unless their liquidity position 

is substantially stronger than minimum requirements.  This approach would reflect the 

fact that the market perception of a given firm’s position as counterparty depends upon 

the combination of its funding position and capital levels.  It would also supplement the 

Basel capital surcharge system, which does not include use of short-term wholesale 

funding among the factors used to calculate the systemic “footprint” of each firm, and 

thus determine its relative surcharge.   

 While there is decidedly a need for solid minimum requirements for both capital 

and liquidity, the relationship between the two also matters.  Where a firm has little need 

of short-term funding to maintain its ongoing business, it is less susceptible to runs.  

Where, on the other hand, a firm is significantly dependent on such funding, it may need 

considerable common equity capital to convince market actors that it is indeed solvent.  

Similarly, the greater or lesser use of short-term funding helps define a firm’s relative 

contribution to the systemic risk latent in these markets.  

If realized, this approach would allow a firm of systemic importance to choose 

between holding capital in greater amounts than would otherwise be required, or 

changing the amount and composition of its liabilities in order to reduce the contribution 

it could make to systemic risk in the event of a shock to short-term funding channels.  

The additional capital requirements might be tied, for example, to specified scores under 

an NSFR that had been reworked significantly so as to take account of the
