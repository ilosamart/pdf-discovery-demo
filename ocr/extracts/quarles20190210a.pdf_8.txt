that it will be flexible enough to handle a financial system that will continue to evolve over time.  

This will not be easy--developments like the emergence of crypto-assets may challenge any 

framework--but that makes the goal of a robust framework all the more important.  

Evaluating the Effects of Reform 

Finally, let me turn to the FSBâ€™s evaluation of the effects of reforms that have been 

implemented.  In the past few years, we have reached a point where many of the reforms have 

been in place for long enough to have effects that we can measure and analyze.  For those 

reforms, we need to ask several key questions.  First, to what extent are those reforms having the 

intended effects and building a more resilient financial system?  Second, have those reforms had 

any unintended, adverse effects that we can address?  These first two questions are, perhaps, 

apparent.  We should also ask a third question, however, that is equally important:  can we 

achieve a strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient, simple, 

transparent, and tailored?  If so, we owe it to everyone affected by the policies recommended by 

the FSB to try, because there is a strong public interest in the efficiency of the financial sector, 

just as there is in its safety and soundness.  If reforms are unnecessarily burdensome and we can 

achieve strong resiliency more efficiently and simply, we should be able to boost sustainable 

financial and economic activity, thus benefitting everyone.  

Evaluating reforms in light of these questions requires rigor--in terms of the selection of 

evaluation topics, the choice of analytical methods, the assessment of effects, and the 

development of policy conclusions.  This rigor is critical for the quality and credibility of the 

evaluation work.  For this reason, the FSB developed a clear Evaluation Framework, under 

which the evaluations are based, as much as possible, on quantitative data to measure the costs 

and benefits of reforms.  Equally critical to a successful review is a truly open mindset with
