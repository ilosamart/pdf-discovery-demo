current reform agenda is designed to accomplish just that, through two channels.  First, it is 

intended to substantially reduce the likelihood of failure through a broad range of stronger 

regulation, including higher capital and liquidity standards, stress tests and recovery planning 

among other reforms.  Second, it is intended to minimize the externalities from failure by making 

it possible to resolve a large financial institution without taxpayer exposure and without 

uncontainable disruption.  If these reforms achieve their purpose, in my view they would be 

preferable to a government-imposed break-up, which would likely involve arbitrary judgments, 

efficiency losses, and a difficult transition.   

Conclusion 

Today, few ideas can be less controversial than ending too big to fail.  The question is 

“How?”, and there are differing opinions on that.  In Titles I and II of Dodd-Frank, Congress has 

given the regulators a game plan for ending too big to fail.  The regulators, including the Federal 

Reserve, are forcefully implementing the plan we have been given.     

My own view is that the framework of current reforms is promising, and should be given 

time to work.  In any case, too big to fail must end, even if more intrusive measures prove 

necessary in the end. 

Thank you very much.
