do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and 

improve estimates of r* and u*.  As indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, 

FOMC participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their 

estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well 

below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would 

have predicted (figures 1 and 2).  And these revisions to u* and r* appeared to have had 

an important influence on the path for the policy rate actually implemented in recent 

years.  One could interpret any changes in the conduct of policy as a shift in the central 

bank’s reaction function.  But in my view, when such changes result from revised 

estimates of u* or r*, they merely reflect an updating of an existing reaction function.  

In addition to u* and r*, another important input into any monetary policy 

assessment is the state of inflation expectations.  Since the late 1990s, inflation 

expectations appear to have been stable and are often said to be “well anchored.”  

However, inflation expectations are not directly observable; they must be inferred from 

models, other macroeconomic information, market prices, and surveys.  Longer-term 

inflation expectations that are anchored materially above or below the 2 percent inflation 

objective present a risk to price stability.  For this reason, policymakers should and do 

study incoming data to extract signals that can be used to update and improve estimates 

of expected inflation.  In many theoretical rational expectations models, expected 

inflation is anchored at the target level by assumption.  From a risk-management 

perspective, it makes sense, I believe, to regularly test this assumption against empirical 

evidence.
