1970, was a major factor in sustaining growing family incomes.  Making fuller use of the talents 

and efforts of women in the workplace has made us more productive and prosperous.      

If I were to apply this lesson, I would hope that our nation continues to reap the benefits 

of greater participation by women in the economy and that we do everything that we can to 

foster that participation.  Women have made great progress in many occupations and professions, 

but lag in others.  In my own profession, there has been a gradual increase in the share of women 

in economics, but women still remain underrepresented at the highest levels in academia, in 

government and in business.  There are doubtless numerous reasons for this, and in fact 

economists themselves are among those engaged in trying to understand the factors that explain 

why more women aren't rising to higher levels.     

I hope we continue to seek this understanding, in my field and others where women are in 

the minority, because the benefits of greater participation for women, it seems to me, are clear 

and substantial.  As we continue to make progress in recovering from the Great Recession, our 

country is going to need the best efforts, ideas and talent it can muster to succeed in an 

increasingly competitive global economy.   If womenâ€™s history can shape the future, I hope that it 

inspires America to take those steps we can take to draw forth these contributions from all 

Americans.
