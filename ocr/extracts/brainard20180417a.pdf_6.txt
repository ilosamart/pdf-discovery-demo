new set of regulations are to eliminate such market distortions and to avoid creating new ones.  

No matter how we define a bank’s assessment area in the future, new regulations need to be 

designed and implemented in a way that encourages banks to spread their community investment 

activities across the areas they serve.  

Third, revised regulations should be tailored, recognizing that banks vary widely in size 

and business strategy and serve communities with widely varying needs.  Banks seek clearer, 

simpler rules that result in more CRA activity with less burden.  We believe this can be done 

while retaining the flexibility to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance in light of its size, business 

strategy, capacity, and constraints as well as its community’s demographics, economic 

conditions, and credit needs and opportunities.  We should not adopt a set of evaluation criteria 

that would be appropriate for large banks and assume that smaller community banks would be 

able to meet them without substantial additional burden.  We should also be sensitive to the ways 

in which a bank’s business strategy, no matter its size, influences the types of activities it 

undertakes to meet its CRA obligations.  Regulatory revisions that do not contemplate evaluating 

CRA performance in context risk undermining CRA’s greatest attribute--its recognition that 

banks are uniquely situated to be responsive to the most impactful community and economic 

development needs in communities.    

  Fourth, we should seek greater consistency in examinations and ratings across the 

agencies as well as within each agency.  Clarity about the activities that qualify for CRA 

consideration, the area in which those activities will be considered, and the type of demographic 

and economic information examiners evaluate will go a long way toward promoting consistency.  

In addition to regulatory revisions, however, the agencies can promote consistency in other, non-

regulatory ways.  For example, we can improve the way in which examiners present their
