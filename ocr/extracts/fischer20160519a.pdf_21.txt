developed the links between fluctuations of output and inflation around their 

natural21 or long-run equilibrium values and economic welfare--a point22 

made clear by the discussion above of his analysis of the optimal goals of 

monetary policy.   

Many Fed researchers--among them more than a dozen Woodford 

students--have attempted to measure the natural rates of interest and the 

natural output gap.  Early work on these topics using DSGE models produced 

very volatile estimates of these concepts, leading to the development of DSGE 

models with more realistic features, including important roles for financial 

frictions, which fit the data better--and which bear some resemblance to more 

traditional estimates of the output gap.  As a result, these models are now 

routinely used in monetary policy discussions. 

One key lesson from these models is that measuring the natural rate 

of interest or the output gap is hard.  However, estimates of the natural rate of 

interest from a collection of structural models across the Federal Reserve 

System indicate that the natural rate fell considerably during the financial 

crisis, became quite negative in its aftermath, and has subsequently recovered 

only slowly.23   

                                                 
21 In Woodford’s and Wicksell’s analyses, natural values are those that would prevail in the absence of 

nominal rigidities.
