available to households and businesses, while providing longer-term credit to these same 

entities.  This role, however, makes banking firms vulnerable to the potential for rapid, 

broad-based outflows of their funding (a so-called run), and these institutions must 

therefore balance the extent of their profitable maturity transformation against the 

associated liquidity risks.3  Leading up to the 2007-09 financial crisis, some large firms 

were overly reliant on certain types of short-term funding and overly confident in their 

ability to replenish their funding when it came due.  Thus, during the crisis, some large 

banks did not have sufficient liquidity, and liquidity risk management at a broader set of 

institutions proved inadequate at anticipating and compensating for potential outflows, 

especially when those outflows occurred on a rapid basis.4   

In the wake of the crisis, a combination of regulatory reforms and stronger 

supervision was needed to promote increased resilience in the financial sector.  With 

regard to liquidity, the prudential regulations and supervisory programs implemented by 

the U.S. banking agencies have resulted in significant improvements in the liquidity 

positions and in the risk management of our largest institutions.  And, working closely 

with other jurisdictions, we have also implemented global liquidity standards for the first 

time.  These standards seek to limit the effect of short-term outflows and extended overall 

funding mismatches, thus improving banks’ liquidity resilience.

this risk.  For a discussion of this vulnerability, see Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983),
