adjustment and creating spillover effects that would not exist if exchange rates better 

reflected market fundamentals.  In addition, differences in the degree of currency 

flexibility impose unequal burdens of adjustment, penalizing countries with relatively 

flexible exchange rates.  What should be done? 

The answers differ depending on whether one is talking about the long term or the 

short term.  In the longer term, significantly greater flexibility in exchange rates to reflect 

market forces would be desirable and achievable.  That flexibility would help facilitate 

global rebalancing and reduce the problems of policy spillovers that emerging market 

economies are confronting today.  The further liberalization of exchange rate and capital 

account regimes would be most effective if it were accompanied by complementary 

financial and structural policies to help achieve better global balance in trade and capital 

flows.  For example, surplus countries could speed adjustment with policies that boost 

domestic spending, such as strengthening the social safety net, improving retail credit 

markets to encourage domestic consumption, or other structural reforms.  For their part, 

deficit countries need to do more over time to narrow the gap between investment and 

national saving.  In the United States, putting fiscal policy on a sustainable path is a 

critical step toward increasing national saving in the longer term.  Higher private saving 

would also help.  And resources will need to shift into the production of export- and 

import-competing goods.  Some of these shifts in spending and production are already 

occurring; for example, China is taking steps to boost domestic demand and the U.S. 

personal saving rate has risen sharply since 2007. 

In the near term, a shift of the international regime toward one in which exchange 

rates respond flexibly to market forces is, unfortunately, probably not practical for all
