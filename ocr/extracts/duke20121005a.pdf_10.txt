professionals should continue to collaborate to ensure that prospective homeowners are given a 

fair chance to bid on available properties.   

However, most prospective homebuyers and local nonprofits cannot bid on a property if 

they cannot access mortgage credit.  Results from the Federal Reserveâ€™s Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey suggest that banks are less willing to provide mortgage credit now than in 2006

(www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/snloansurvey/201205/fullreport.pdf)  In response to a special set of questions 
on residential real estate lending practices, banks reported that they were less likely than in 2006, to varying degrees, 
to originate mortgages to any borrowers apart from those with the strongest credit profiles.
