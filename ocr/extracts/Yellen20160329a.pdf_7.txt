(PCE), which excludes food and energy.  Thus, the current stance of monetary policy 

appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential 

growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 

Looking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a 

lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which 

include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has 

not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and 

productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the 

end of the recession.  If these headwinds gradually fade as I expect, the neutral federal 

funds rate will also rise, in which case it will, all else equal, be appropriate to gradually 

increase the federal funds rate more or less in tandem to achieve our dual objectives.  

Otherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the 

economy strengthened.5 

Implicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key 

reason for the FOMCâ€™s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over 

time will likely be appropriate.  That said, this assessment is only a forecast.  The future 

path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and 

inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways.  For example, no one can be certain 

about the pace at which economic headwinds will fade.  More generally, the economy 

                                                 
4 Assuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about 
125 basis points, simulations of the FRB/US model under vector-autoregression-based expectations suggest 
that maintaining this interest rate gap for the next couple of years would lower the unemployment rate 
1/2 percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed.  
Under rational expectations, the predicted effect would be smaller.  For further information, see Brayton, 
Laubach, and Reifschneider (2014). 
5 Of course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be 
closed in order to stabilize inflation at 2 percent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy 
growing in line with its potential rate.
