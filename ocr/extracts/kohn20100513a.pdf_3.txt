My discussion today will focus on innovations in both our role as liquidity provider and in our 

monetary policy tools:  their motivation, their effectiveness, and their lessons for the future. 1

The Federal Reserve’s Liquidity Tools 


Before the crisis, the implementation of monetary policy was fairly straightforward, and 

our approach minimized its footprint on financial markets.  The Federal Reserve adjusted the 

liquidity it provided to the banking system through daily operations with a relatively small set of 

broker-dealers against a very narrow set of collateral--Treasury and agency securities.  These 

transactions had the effect of changing the aggregate quantity of reserve balances that banks held 

at the Federal Reserve, and that liquidity was distributed by interbank funding markets through 

the banking system in the United States and around the world.  In addition, the Federal Reserve 

stood ready to lend directly to commercial banks and other depository institutions at the 

“discount window,” where, at their discretion, banks could borrow overnight at an above-market 

rate against a broad range of collateral when they had a need for very short-term funding.  

Ordinarily, however, little credit was extended through the discount window.  Banks were able to 

obtain their funding and reserves in the open market and generally turned to the window only to 

cover very short-term liquidity shortfalls arising from operational glitches or transitory 

marketwide supply shortfalls, as opposed to more fundamental funding problems. 

During the financial crisis, however, market participants became highly uncertain about 

the financial strength of their counterparties, the future value of assets (including any collateral 

they might be lending against), and how their own needs for capital and liquidity might evolve.  

They fled to the safest and most liquid assets, and as a result, interbank markets stopped 

functioning as an effective means to distribute liquidity, increasing the importance of direct
