significant economic and financial instability, as we have seen in a number of countries 

in recent decades. 

Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which 

government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability.  But given the 

significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should 

soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time.  

Doing so earlier rather than later will not only help maintain the U.S. government’s 

credibility in financial markets, thereby holding down interest costs, but it will also 

ultimately prove less disruptive by avoiding abrupt shifts in policy and by giving those 

affected by budget changes more time to adapt.  

Conclusion 

The path forward contains many difficult tradeoffs and choices, but postponing 

those choices and failing to put the nation’s finances on a sustainable long-run trajectory 

would ultimately do great damage to our economy.  I thank the members of the 

commission for their willingness to serve and urge them to demonstrate to the American 

people that serious, well-intentioned citizens can come together to craft credible and 

sustainable solutions to our budgetary challenges.
