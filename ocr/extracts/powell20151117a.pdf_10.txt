segment, although modest in size compared to the overall market, is a key source 

of financing for smaller dealers, particularly in times of financial stress.  The 

availability of repo funding for a diverse range of participants supports market 

liquidity by enabling them to make markets in Treasury and agency securities.  

CCPs themselves also rely on these markets, often using repo to earn interest on 

cash collateral and counting on access to repo markets in their liquidity planning.     

The FSB has called on authorities to “consider the pros and cons of 

broadening participation in repo clearing arrangements.”8 What are the potential 

benefits of greater clearing in this market?  In addition to the potential netting 

benefits I mentioned earlier, a CCP typically performs three other beneficial 

economic functions: 1) a reduction in the potential cost of counterparty default 

coming from the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member’s positions, 2) greater 

transparency and a reduction in operational risk from enhanced reporting 

requirements and standardization of data, and 3) the sharing of risk among 

members of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of a counterparty’s 

default.  I’ll discuss each of these in turn.  

Orderly liquidation
