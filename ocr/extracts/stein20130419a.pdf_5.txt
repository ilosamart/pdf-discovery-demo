probably not a coincidence that these two products--demand deposits and credit lines--are 

offered under the roof of the same institution; the underlying commonality is that both 

require an ability to accommodate unpredictable requests for cash on short notice.4  A 

number of other financial intermediary services, such as prime brokerage, also embody a 

significant element of liquidity provision. 

Without question, these liquidity-provision services are socially valuable.  On the 

liability side, demand deposits and other short-term bank liabilities are safe, easy-to-value 

claims that are well suited for transaction purposes and hence create a flow of money-like 

benefits for their holders.5  And loan commitments are more efficient than an 

arrangement in which each operating firm hedges its future uncertain needs by “pre-

borrowing” and hoarding the proceeds on its own balance sheet; this latter approach does 

a poor job of economizing on the scarce aggregate supply of liquid assets.6 

At the same time, as the financial crisis made painfully clear, the business of 

liquidity provision inevitably exposes financial intermediaries to various forms of run 

risk.  That is, in response to adverse events, their fragile funding structures, together with 

the binding liquidity commitments they have made, can result in rapid outflows that, 

absent central bank intervention, lead banks to fire-sell illiquid assets or, in a more severe 

case, to fail altogether.  And fire sales and bank failures--and the accompanying 

contractions in credit availability--can have spillover effects to other financial institutions

against liquidity shocks, as argued in Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983), “Bank Runs, 
Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91 (June), pp. 401-19.
