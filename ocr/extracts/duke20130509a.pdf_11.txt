  Lenders who prefer to price for risk through points and fees face the constraint 

that points and fees on a QM loan may not exceed 3 percent of the loan amount, with 

higher caps available for loans smaller than $100,000.  The extent to which these rules 

regarding rates, points, and fees will damp lender willingness to originate mortgages to 

borrowers with lower credit scores is still unclear. 

To summarize, the housing market is improving, but mortgage credit conditions 

remain quite tight for borrowers with lower credit scores.  And the path to easier credit 

conditions is somewhat murky.  Some of the forces damping mortgage credit availability, 

such as capacity constraints and concerns about economic conditions or house prices, are 

likely to unwind through normal cyclical forces.  However, resolution of lender concerns 

about putback risk or servicing cost seems less clear.  These concerns could be reduced 

by policy changes.  For example, the structure of liability for representations and 

warrantees could be modified.  Or servicing compensation could be changed to provide 

higher compensation for the servicing of delinquent loans.  Or lenders might find ways to 

reduce their exposure to putback risk or servicing cost by strengthening origination and 

servicing platforms.  New mortgage regulations will provide important protections to 

borrowers but may also lead to a permanent increase in the cost of originating loans to 

borrowers with lower credit scores.  It will be difficult to determine the ultimate effect of 

the regulatory changes until they have all been finally defined and lenders gain 

familiarity with them. 

The implications for the housing market are also murky.  Borrowers with lower 

credit scores have typically represented a significant segment of first-time homebuyers.
