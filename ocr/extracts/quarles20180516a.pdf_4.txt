local prepositioning of capital and liquidity to ensure a firm can satisfy local claimants under 

stressful conditions, helps to promote cooperation in the context of a cross-border resolution and 

avoid incentives for more drastic action by host authorities.   

One’s assessment of the optimal balance, as I alluded to earlier, can depend significantly 

on where one sits in the regulatory constellation.  The home regulator, by nature, will logically 

prefer flexibility in a resolution; consolidated capital and liquidity requirements are most 

effective if resources can be freely allocated around the consolidated firm where and when they 

are needed.  Flexibility also helps offset the uncertainty in forecasting the location within the 

consolidated firm where stress may arise.  Yet I would also argue that home regulators should 

recognize host jurisdictions may take action to restrict the flow of resources, or worse yet, 

demand resources in the moment of crisis, even if the stress does not originally emanate from 

their location.  Such actions tend to both limit the flexibility of the home regulator and 

undermine cooperation in times of stress.  

The host regulator, by nature, will prefer the certainty that resources will be available to 

satisfy local customers and counterparties under stressful conditions.  This is particularly the case 

if the risk of default or the potential local loss given default of a foreign firm is high, and the 

tolerance for a government-assisted intervention for foreign banks is low.  However, the host 

regulator should also recognize that it is ultimately in its interest for the SPOE resolution of the 

foreign bank to be successful and, given the uncertainty of the circumstances or location of 

losses that emerge in an actual stress, adequate flexibility for the parent to deploy resources 

where needed is likewise in the host regulator’s interest.   

A global bank has other stakeholders who have preferences regarding flexibility or 

certainty and can take actions that can potentially destabilize the firm.  For instance, parent
