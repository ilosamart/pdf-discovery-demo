Thank you for the opportunity to take part in today’s “Developments in Empirical 

Macroeconomics” conference.  I would like to use my time here to talk about a topic of 

interest to many central bankers and macroeconomists:  the interaction of monetary 

policy and financial stability.  As you well know, monetary policy has powerful effects 

on financial markets, the financial system, and the broader economy.  Conversely, 

financial instability, by impairing the provision of credit and other financial services, can 

depress economic growth, cause job losses, and push inflation too low.  Accordingly, 

financial stability, through its effects on the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate goals of 

maximum employment and stable prices, must be a consideration in the setting of 

monetary policy.   

Against this backdrop, a natural—yet quite complex—question is whether 

monetary policy should be used to promote financial stability.  This question is hotly 

debated in a large and growing academic literature, and any serious answer has to be 

subject to considerable nuance.  At the same time, my sense is that the balance is clearly 

tilted toward the conclusion that macroprudential policies—through-the-cycle resilience, 

stress tests, and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)—may be better targeted to 

promoting financial stability than monetary policy.1   

Before I wade into the lessons from past research and experience, I would like to 

highlight that this question is not just academic.  As you know, the economy, monetary 

policy, and financial stability are intertwined.  For example, the past three recessions 

were preceded by some combination of elevated asset prices, rapid increases in 

borrowing by businesses and households, and excessive risk-taking in the financial
