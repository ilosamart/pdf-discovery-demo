the financial sector has appeared resilient to recent episodes of market stress, supported 

by strong capital and liquidity positions.  

Last but definitely not least, a very low natural rate of interest is worrisome 

because it may reflect more deep-seated economic problems.  For instance, economic 

theory--along with some empirical evidence--suggests that real interest rates and the 

growth of real GDP tend to move together over the long run.10  Thus, a decline in longer-

run equilibrium real rates--as suggested by my observations today and by the careful 

work of Laubach and Williams--could be yet another indication that the economy’s 

growth potential may have dimmed considerably.  This deeply concerning conjecture--

which suggests that the slowdown of productivity growth that we have experienced in 

recent years could be long lasting--has played an important role in Larry Summers’s 

revival of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis.11 

Given what a fall in the natural rate of interest might mean for economic 

performance for years to come, we should reflect on the forces that may have caused that 

decline--my third question--and on what, if anything, can be done to reverse them--my 

fourth and last question.   

Ultimately, the level of the natural interest rate reflects businesses’, households’, 

and governments’ saving and investment decisions over the medium to longer run.  

Indeed, the saving-investment channel provides a useful framework for thinking about 

the relationship between the natural rate and the growth rate of potential GDP.  For 

instance, a lasting slowing in the pace of technological innovation--a key determinant of 

potential growth--may result in fewer profitable opportunities for businesses, which could
