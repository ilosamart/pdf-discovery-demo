exposure better than individual members.  As I noted earlier, we have relatively 

little information on bilateral repo activity, so greater clearing in this segment 

could have significant benefits in helping to aggregate market information.  CCPs 

also provide participants with central confirmation of trades and netting of 

positions, allowing their members to reduce operational risk of post-trade 

processing.  



Risk sharing  

In terms of risk sharing, when a CCP clearing member defaults, any 

resulting losses are shared among the surviving members and the CCP itself 

according to pre-agreed rules.  Members of a CCP contribute to a default fund that 

can be used to absorb these losses.  The degree of risk sharing depends on the 

design of the CCP, but transparent rules help to create an orderly, predictable 

process for managing a default.9  

Finding a way forward 

The potential benefits of proposals for expanded central clearing of repo in 

U.S. markets are undergoing a period of evaluation by regulatory authorities and 

                                                           
9 While details vary, in a waterfall, to cover losses resulting from a defaulting member, a CCP typically first uses the 
financial resources of the defaulting member, including margin and default fund contributions. If losses still exist, 
then the CCP uses its capital (skin in the game), followed by the default fund contributions of surviving members. 
Further losses could be absorbed by additional assessments on surviving members.
