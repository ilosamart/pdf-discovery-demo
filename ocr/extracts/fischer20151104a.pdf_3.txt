will stop at three.  While we were having dinner in a Washington, D.C. restaurant 

sometime in 1984, Herb asked me what was happening in the Israeli economy.  I replied 

with an excellent exposition of monetary and fiscal policies, the accelerating inflation 

rate, all of the mistakes that were being made, who was doing what to whom, and more.  

If I had been a graduate student, I would certainly have received an A.  Herb’s response 

was not to congratulate me on the excellence of my analysis, but to ask gently, “Yes, but 

what do we want them to do?”  That is a question one should always remember to ask 

when trying to advise a policymaker. 

In brief, I learned an enormous amount from working with Herb and soon came to 

admire him as a man of strong but softly stated principles and immense decency, with 

whom it was a pleasure and privilege to be able to work and to talk--and, of course, to 

joke, for he had a great sense of humor.  If you want to know more about him, go to 

Google, look up Herbert Stein, and find the speech that his son Ben delivered at the first 

Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture, in 2012.  And I’m very happy indeed that Herb and 

Mildred’s two children, Rachel and Ben, are here tonight.   

Central Bank Independence over the Past 20 Years 

The modern academic literature on central bank independence developed largely 

in the late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.  The world of central banking was very 

different then--a fact brought home by recalling that, in the early 1990s, the interest rate 

in the United Kingdom was still set by the Treasury and not the Bank of England.  At its 

tercentenary celebration in 1994, the Bank of England organized a symposium on central 

banking, motivated in part by its desire for independence from the Treasury and the 

modernization of its legal structure.
