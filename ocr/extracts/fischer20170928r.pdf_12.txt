window was not used for macroeconomic stabilization; and depository institutions were 

the users of the discount window, typically on a short-term basis.27

In 1978, Rudi Dornbusch and I noted that the lender-of-last-resort function should 

imply that “the central bank steps in to ensure that funds are available to make loans to 

firms which are perfectly sound but, because of panic, are having trouble raising 

funds.”28 In the financial crisis that started in 2007, wide-ranging measures were taken 

along these lines.  In order to improve the functioning of U.S. credit markets, the Federal 

Reserve made numerous changes to its lending arrangements:  The spread of the discount 

rate over the policy rate was lowered, lending was extended to include loans to 

nondepository financial institutions, and facilities were created allowing longer maturity

of, and broader collateral for, loans than was usual for the central bank.29

After its own experience during the financial crisis, the Bank of England 

permanently widened lender-of-last-resort access to include not only commercial banks, 

but also other systemically important financial institutions.30 In the United States, the 

discount rate has for several years been back to its normal relationship with the policy 

rate, and the special lending facilities have long since been wound up.  Emergency 

lending facilities of the type seen during the financial crisis remain feasible, if needed, 

though their usage has not been incorporated into the Federal Reserve’s routine lender-of-

last-resort powers, along the lines of the changes seen in the United Kingdom.  Instead,

29 This is a very brief and simplified discussion of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve with regard to 
the discount window during the crisis.  See, among others, Cecchetti (2009) and Madigan (2009) for 
detailed discussions.  For reasons of space, I will not recount the United Kingdom’s policy response in this 
area during the crisis.

central counterparties. See Carney (2014) and Bank of England (2015b).
