difficult to recover.  The results of the 2016 SHED show that nearly one-fourth of all 

households are unable to pay their current month’s bills in full, nearly one-third would 

rely on borrowing or selling something to cover a $400 emergency expense, and one in 

eight would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense by any means.  Over half of 

households lack savings to cover three months’ expenses if they lost their main source of 

income.17  This finding corroborates the evidence found in the financial diaries of low- to 

moderate-income families that show it is all too common for households to have no short-

term savings to cover emergencies.  According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, on 

average from 1989 to 2013, about 80 percent of households in the bottom quintile of the 

income distribution had less than $3,000 adjusted for inflation in liquid assets (cash, 

checking, or savings accounts).  Even among households in the middle quintile of 

income, about half do not meet this threshold for liquid assets.  

In addition, the financial crisis demonstrated that household financial imbalances 

can have important consequences for overall financial stability in extreme circumstances.  

The rapid and widespread rise in poorly underwritten mortgage debt prior to the Great 

Recession is widely viewed as a key contributor to the financial crisis.18  This suggests 

the potential value of better understanding the specific patterns in household finances that 

would give an early warning of a crisis.  In carrying out our responsibilities to monitor 

and safeguard the stability of the financial system, although much of the work has

18 See, for example, Rajan (2010); Dynan (2012); and Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) on how high levels of 
mortgage debt may have made the Great Recession more severe and slowed the recovery. While low-
income households were particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the collapse in house prices, rise in 
unemployment, and tightening of credit in the Great Recession, the preceding rise in mortgage debt was 
widespread, also including higher-income households, as documented by Bhutta (2015) and Adelino, 
Schoar, and Severino (2016).
