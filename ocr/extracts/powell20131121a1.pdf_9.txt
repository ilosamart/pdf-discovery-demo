An important lesson from the financial crisis is that liquidity is extremely 

important in ensuring ongoing viability and resilience during a period of financial stress.  

No amount of resources can guarantee that a CCP will be able to meet its payment and 

settlement obligations, unless those resources can be converted to cash with certainty and 

within a very short time frame.  CCP liquidity is especially important, since a failure to 

meet required payment obligations could undermine market confidence at precisely the 

moment when it is most fragile and trigger run-like behavior as financial institutions seek 

to reduce their exposure to the CCP and its members. 

To measure and manage its liquidity risks, the PFMIs require a CCP to have 

effective methodologies to estimate its funding exposures under a variety of stressed 

conditions, to identify available cash resources, and to establish mechanisms for 

converting its noncash collateral to cash.  The need to assure adequate liquidity presents a 

number of challenges.  CCPs will need to mobilize cash within a matter of hours on the 

day of a large clearing memberâ€™s default.  Cash balances on deposit at a bank can be 

quickly accessed, but CCPs often put their cash resources in overnight investments to 

earn a return.  The nature and mechanics of such investments, as well as prevailing 

market conditions, can critically affect the ability of a CCP to unwind those investments 

quickly enough to meet its cash needs.  A similar challenge will arise with the need to 

convert noncash collateral, such as initial margin collateral, to cash.  The PFMIs require 

CCPs to have in place prearranged and highly reliable funding sources to address this 

need. 

Managing credit and liquidity risks requires effective governance.  One important 

aspect of CCP governance is a commitment to transparency.  Clearing members bear
