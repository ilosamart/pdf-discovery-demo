credit currently available in terms of additional lines, and greater credit risk are somewhat 
less likely to opt out. 

These findings lend themselves to more than one interpretation. One possibility is that 
those individuals with more credit accounts or exhibiting lower credit risk choose not to 
receive additional prescreened solicitations because they believe that they have enough 
credit sources available. At the same time, those with less credit currently in use or 
exhibiting higher measures of risk may be less interested in cutting off their access to 
more credit. Alternatively, those with more credit and who are better risks may have 
reviewed so many prescreened solicitations that they are simply more likely to have 
observed the opt-out notice and to have acted on it. Of course, these hypotheses are not 
necessarily incompatible; both may be correct to some degree. Furthermore, only a 
minority of individuals in any grouping have placed their names on the opt-out lists 
maintained by the national CRAs (table 3). 

CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO OPT OUT 

Factors related to whether a consumer may opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations 
include the following: number of credit accounts, credit limits and outstanding balances, 
credit scores, presence of a mortgage, collection items and public records, and creditor 
and insurer inquiries. 

Number of Credit Accounts 

Most individuals with credit records have at least one credit account of some type in good 
standing, and more than 40 percent of those with credit accounts have four or more such 
accounts (table 3). Nearly 11 percent of the individuals in the sample with six or more 
active credit accounts have chosen to opt out of receiving prescreened solicitations, 
compared with about 3 percent of those with just one active account and only 1 percent of 
those with no active accounts. A similar pattern is evident with regard to credit card 
accounts. About 11 percent of the individuals with seven or more credit card accounts 
have opted out of further prescreened solicitations compared with about 2 percent of 
those with only one such account and only 1 percent of those with no credit card 
accounts. 

Credit Limits on Revolving Accounts 

The same pattern is again evident when considering the total size of revolving credit 
lines. The similarity is not surprising because the number of credit card accounts, which 
constitute the bulk of revolving-credit lines, is correlated with total credit lines. Issuers 
of credit cards and unsecured personal lines of credit typically restrict the size of the 
credit line to limit the credit risk posed by any given account. Creditors normally report
