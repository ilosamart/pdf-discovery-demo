For over six years, the federal funds rate has, effectively, been zero.  However it 

is widely expected that the rate will lift off before the end of this year, as the 

normalization of monetary policy gets underway.   

The approach of liftoff reflects the significant progress we have made toward our 

objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The extraordinary monetary 

policy accommodation that the Federal Reserve has undertaken in response to the crisis 

has contributed importantly to the economic recovery, though the recovery has taken 

longer than we expected.  The unemployment rate, at 5.5 percent in February, is nearing 

estimates of its natural rate, and we expect that inflation will gradually rise toward the 

Fed’s target of 2 percent.  Beginning the normalization of policy will be a significant step 

toward the restoration of the economy’s normal dynamics, allowing monetary policy to 

respond to shocks without recourse to unconventional tools.   

I would like to take this occasion to look back on some lessons learned during our 

time at the effective lower bound on the interest rate, and also to look forward.1 

Monetary Policy since the Crisis  

Let me first take a step back in time.  Prior to the crisis, the financial system was 

more fragile than we realized.  Key vulnerabilities included excessive leverage, 

overdependence on short-term funding, and deficiencies in credit ratings, underwriting 

standards, and risk management.  Importantly, interconnections across financial 

institutions heightened the risk of contagion through cascading losses.  Some of these 

interconnections emerged from the use of complicated financial instruments that created 

seemingly safe and liquid assets.  At the time, it was common to say that risk was being
