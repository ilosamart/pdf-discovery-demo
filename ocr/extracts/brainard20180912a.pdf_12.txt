neutral interest rate is likely to move up somewhat further, and it may well surpass the 

longer-run equilibrium rate for some period.  Beyond the near term, how much the 

neutral rate is likely to rise and whether it flattens or moderates further out will depend on 

a variety of developments--such as whether fiscal stimulus is extended or expires, 

whether foreign and trade risks grow or recede, and whether financial system 

vulnerabilities extend.  As such, the gradual pace of rate increases implicit in the SEPâ€™s 

median policy path incorporates a degree of caution, which is appropriate, in my view.
