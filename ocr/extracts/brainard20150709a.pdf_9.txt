more would have to be deferred over a period of at least three years, and the deferred amounts 

would need to be adjusted for actual losses that are realized during the deferral period.8  

Beyond this, for systemic banking institutions, I would like to see consideration given to 

changing the structure of deferred compensation so that it better balances the interests of the full 

set of the firm’s stakeholders over the longer term.  In particular, when evaluating risky 

activities, senior executives should internalize not only the upside risk faced by stockholders, but 

also the downside risk borne by bondholders, especially as that better aligns with the public 

interest in reducing the likelihood of material financial distress or failure at the systemic banking 

institutions.9  This set of considerations should help to inform ongoing deliberations regarding 

implementation the Dodd-Frank Act incentive compensation provisions.  

Making Failure Safe 

 You can see now why I argue we are reaching a key moment in our efforts to build a 

more resilient financial system.  In combination, these more stringent standards, several of which 

are still in train, should prove powerful in inducing systemic banking institutions to reduce the 

risks they pose to the system. Beyond this, Congress sought to address too big to fail by 

requiring systemic institutions to plan and prepare for failure, and by creating a new “orderly 

liquidation authority.” Under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, large bank holding 

companies are required to submit credible plans for their rapid and orderly resolution under the 

U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the orderly liquidation authority created under title II of the
