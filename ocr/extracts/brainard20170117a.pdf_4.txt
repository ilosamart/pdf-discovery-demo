forecast of inflation and 47 percent had raised their forecast of gross domestic product 

(GDP) growth because of the recent U.S. election results, although on average forecast 

changes were modest.  Markets have also reacted, and many have interpreted these 

changes as reflecting expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the coming years 

than previously expected.   

In thinking about fiscal scenarios, forecasters have several historical episodes on 

which to draw.  For example, following the 1980 elections, tax cuts were enacted, and 

defense spending rose.  Federal fiscal deficits, adjusted for the cyclical state of the 

economy, increased by roughly 2-1/2 percentage points of GDP from the period before 

the elections to six years following the elections, federal debt held by the public increased 

from about 25 percent of GDP to nearly 40 percent, and the current account deficit 

widened.4  Following the 2000 elections, similar fiscal changes resulted in an increase in 

the fiscal deficit of close to 3 percentage points of GDP over the first six years of the new 

Administration on a cyclically adjusted basis.  Of course, there are important differences 

in today’s conditions relative to these historical settings, including the economy’s cyclical 

position, current and projected levels of indebtedness, the relative position of the global 

economy, and monetary policy settings.   

As of today, there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude, timing, and 

composition of any possible change in the stance of fiscal policy.  It is instructive to 

contemplate the important dimensions along which fiscal policy and its effects might 

                                                 
4 Annual data on cyclically adjusted federal deficits can be found in table C-2 of the Congressional Budget 
Office (2016, p. 126) report The Budget and Economic Outlook:  2016 to 2026.  The analysis takes a three-
year centered moving average of the CBO’s estimates of the cyclically adjusted federal deficit, which can 
be quite volatile from year to year, and compares this average for the year prior to the new Administration 
to the average in the sixth year of the new Administration.
