One obvious source of difficulty is the possibility, well recognized by G-M, that the 

business model mandated for NFBs might not be viable and stable.  As with all forms of narrow 

banks proposed over the years, NFBs as a group would seem likely to generate relatively low 

revenues, given the low risk of the securities in which they would have to invest.  G-M propose 

to counter this problem by granting franchise value through the statutory monopoly on 

securitization mentioned earlier and through access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.  

Picking up on their analogy to the creation of deposit insurance in the 1930s, the monopoly on 

securitization is intended to help offset the regulatory costs imposed on NFBs in the same way 

that the monopoly on the “business of banking” was intended to offset the regulatory costs 

imposed on insured depository institutions. 

Unlike the business environment for banks in the 1930s, however, securitization and repo 

lending are national--if not international--activities, with little to suggest that any advantage 

would be derived from local knowledge.  It seems quite possible that the economies of scale 

associated with the NFB model are sufficiently high that the industry structure would tend 

toward oligopoly, or even monopoly.  That is, too much franchise value might be created.  In that 

event, there would be significant additions to the cost side of the proposal’s ledger, in the form of 

the price and quantity effects that result from non-competitive industry structures.   

Regardless of the eventual structure of the industry, NFBs essentially would be 

monolines, with highly correlated risk exposures.  They could be particularly vulnerable to 

funding difficulties in times of deteriorating credit conditions.  Yet by the terms of the G-M 

proposal, they apparently would not be able to hedge interest rate or other risks.  G-M propose 

giving NFBs access to the discount window to forestall liquidity problems and runs on the NFBs, 

presumably in the same way that deposit insurance stopped runs on traditional banks.  Here again
