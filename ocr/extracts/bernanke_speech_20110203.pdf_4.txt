have improved.  Even so, with output growth likely to be moderate for awhile and with 

employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls, it will be several years before 

the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level.  Until we see a sustained 

period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established. 

 On the inflation front, we have recently seen significant increases in some highly 

visible prices, notably for gasoline.  Indeed, prices of many commodities have risen 

lately, largely as a result of the very strong demand from fast-growing emerging market 

economies, coupled, in some cases, with constraints on supply.  Nevertheless, overall 

inflation remains quite low:  Over the 12 months ending in December, prices for all the 

goods and services purchased by households increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 

2.4 percent over the prior 12 months.1  To assess underlying trends in inflation, 

economists also follow several alternative measures of inflation; one such measure is so-

called core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components and 

therefore can be a better predictor of where overall inflation is headed.  Core inflation 

was only 0.7 percent in 2010, compared with around 2-1/2 percent in 2007, the year 

before the recession began.  Wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly 

earnings increasing only 1.8 percent last year.  These downward trends in wage and price 

inflation are not surprising, given the substantial slack in the economy.  

Monetary Policy 

 In sum, although economic growth will probably increase this year, we expect the 

unemployment rate to remain stubbornly above, and inflation to remain persistently 

below, the levels that Federal Reserve policymakers have judged to be consistent over the 

longer term with our mandate from the Congress to foster maximum employment and
