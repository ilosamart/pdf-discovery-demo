in the current crisis, instability can be generated by small institutions as well as by large 

ones--as occurred in the Great Depression or in the thrift crisis, to cite two particularly 

dramatic examples.  Additionally, as a lender through our discount window to community 

banks and other depository institutions, we rely on information and expertise obtained 

from our supervisory responsibilities to lend safely, particularly in times of stress. 

For all these reasons, our supervisory relationships with the state-chartered banks 

that have joined the Federal Reserve System are immensely valuable, as is the range of 

contacts we have with community banks. 

Conclusion 

I know that community banks, with their special strengths, can flourish in a 

system that provides fair competition; indeed, many of you have stepped up during a 

difficult time to provide credit to support the economic recovery.  To create a more 

competitive system, as well as a safer one, we need to end the too-big-to-fail problem 

once and for all.  We will continue to focus on this issue, and we welcome constructive 

ideas from all quarters. 

We at the Federal Reserve look forward to maintaining our long-standing 

relationships with community bankers.  You bring us insights into the banking industry 

and the economy that we can obtain nowhere else.  And as the recovery progresses, we 

expect that you will continue to aid the nationâ€™s return to prosperity by making good 

loans to creditworthy borrowers in your communities.  We want to continue to work with 

you to help you play this important role.  In doing so, together we will help ensure a 

bright future both for our economy and for community banking.
