presence for lenders to get to know borrowers and the communities in which they live, lend, and 

invest.  As our Community Advisory Council recently emphasized, “[f]or many rural and LMI 

populations, bank branches remain critical for the provision of bank loans, investments, and 

services.”10  

Recent studies measuring the impact of branch closures on credit availability in 

neighborhoods demonstrate that branches still matter, particularly with respect to accessing small 

business credit.11 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that access to small business 

credit declines and the rates for small business loans increase as the distance between the bank 

and the borrower grows.12  Similarly, the large majority of mortgage lending continues to be 

located in one or more of a bank’s delineated assessment areas--that is, near a physical branch.   

This research also found that people in low-income census tracts were more than twice as 

likely to live in a banking desert--an area without a branch within 10 miles--than those in higher-

income tracts.13  When they are cut off from mainstream banking institutions, some consumers 

rely on more expensive alternatives that include payday loans, auto title loans, pawn shops, and 

check cashing services. 

 Banks vary widely in terms of the types of services they offer and the mechanisms they 

use for reaching their customers.  On one end of the spectrum, many community banks still rely

11 See Hoai-Luu Q. Nguyen, Do Bank Branches Still Matter? The Effect of Closings on Local Economic Outcomes, 
October 2015. The reason is the information-intensive nature of the underwriting process. Even in areas with plenty 
of bank branches, declines in small businesses lending because of the loss of the relationship between a small 
business owner and their loan officer were significant.  Once broken, the study found that those relationships take 
years to replace. The impact of branch closures were found to be more severe in tracts with lower median income, a 
higher fraction of minority households, and where firms were, on average, closer to their lending.

13 See, again, Morgan, Pinkovskiy, and Yang, March 7, 2015; between 2009 and 2014, the fraction of low-income 
tracts that were also banking deserts increased 0.17 percentage points compared to a 0.06 percentage point increase 
in higher-income tracts.
