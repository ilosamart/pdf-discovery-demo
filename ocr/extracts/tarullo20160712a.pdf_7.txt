Obvious forms of safe assets include currency itself (though that has its well-known 

limitations for large-value transacting), government-insured demand deposits, and obligations of 

highly creditworthy sovereigns such as U.S. Treasuries.  But numerous commentators have 

observed that, for a variety of reasons, demand for safe assets in recent decades has been 

growing substantially faster than the supply of these most obvious and truly safe forms of 

government-backed assets.4  In these circumstances, they note, the demand for privately created 

safe assets has increased.  One problem, of course, is that the privately created assets may be 

treated as safe in normal times but, as seen in 2008, not in periods of high stress.  Hence the 

phenomenon of runs.  Another consideration is that the private creation of putatively safe assets 

is, at least to some degree, the creation of money outside of the operations of central banks or of 

depository institutions subject to reserve requirements and other regulations. 

With that background, here are my last two questions.  Fourth, as a factual matter, to 

what extent is the supply of short-term funding a response to a persistent demand for more safe 

assets?  If the answer is “considerable,” then further constraints on the creation of currently used 

safe assets might result in further financial engineering in search of assets that approximate the 

attributes of truly safe assets even less well, but are the best the demanders of these assets can do.   

And so, fifth, to what extent does a comprehensive regulatory approach to shadow 

banking need to include mechanisms--involving the government directly or indirectly--for the 

creation of more genuinely safe assets, as well as limitations on the runnable varieties that can 

precipitate or exacerbate financial stress?  This is clearly a big question that runs well beyond the 

scope of even the most far-reaching financial regulatory debates and initiatives of the post-crisis

the Financial Crisis,” remarks delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Conference on Challenges in
