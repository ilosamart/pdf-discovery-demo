A portion of the productivity slowdown is undoubtedly due to low levels of 

investment by businesses.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession left firms with 

excess capacity, reducing incentives to invest.  If businesses expect slower growth to 

continue, that will also hold down investment.   

The other important factor is the decline in what economists call total factor 

productivity, or TFP, which is the part of productivity that is not explained by capital 

investment or increases in the skills of the labor force.  TFP is thought to be mainly a 

function of technological innovation and efficiency gains.   

There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity.5  The pessimists 

argue that the big paradigm-changing innovations, such as electrification or the advent of 

computers, are behind us.  If that is so, then our standard of living will increase more 

slowly going forward.  The optimists think that this slowdown is only a passing phase 

and that the age of robots and machine learning will transform our economy in coming 

decades.  Still others argue that we are currently underestimating productivity and output 

because of the real difficulties we face in measuring GDP in a modern economy.  For 

example, how do we measure the value-added of free digital services like Facebook or 

Twitter?6 

The future is, as always, uncertain.  But I would sum up the growth discussion as 

follows.  Growth in the labor force has slowed, and we can estimate it with reasonable 

                                                 
5 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon, The Rise and Fall of 
American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton University Press, 2016).  
Among the optimists are Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age:  Work, 
Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton & Company, 2014).
