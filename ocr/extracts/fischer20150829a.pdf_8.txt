Reflecting all these factors, the Committee has indicated in its post-meeting 

statements that it expects inflation to return to 2 percent.  With regard to our degree of 

confidence in this expectation, we will need to consider all the available information and 

assess its implications for the economic outlook before coming to a judgment.   

In addition, the July announcement set a condition of requiring “some further 

improvement in the labor market.”  From May through July, non-farm payroll

those working part-time for economic reasons; we are interested also in the participation 

rate.  And in the case of the inflation rate we look beyond the rate of increase of PCE 

prices and define the concept of the core rate of inflation.

inflation, we are mainly looking for a good indicator of future inflation, and for better 

indicators than we have at present.   

In making our monetary policy decisions, we are interested more in where the 

U.S. economy is heading than in knowing whence it has come.  That is why we need to
