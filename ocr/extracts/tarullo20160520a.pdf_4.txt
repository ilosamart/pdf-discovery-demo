and soundness of federally insured depository institutions affiliated with any kind of holding 

company.  With the Dodd-Frank Act’s transfer of SLHC oversight to the Federal Reserve, that 

statutory responsibility now includes insurance holding companies.  While the particulars are 

somewhat different than for bank holding companies, the aim and many of the tools to achieve 

this aim are the same. 

Second, the Dodd-Frank Act sharpened our statutory mandate to make clear that the 

Federal Reserve is to regulate and supervise holding companies with a view to the safety and 

soundness of not only the holding company itself, but also its functionally regulated subsidiaries, 

including affiliated insured depository institutions.  Again, while the particulars differ, this 

mandate applies to SLHCs as well as to bank holding companies.5  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley 

Act of 1999 had, at the least, rendered ambiguous the question of whether the Federal Reserve 

could take supervisory measures that involved a functionally regulated subsidiary of a holding 

company unless a specific threat to an affiliated depository institution could be established.  The 

financial crisis underscored the importance for safety and soundness of not waiting until 

problems in the holding company were manifestly affecting the depository institution. 

Third, the Dodd-Frank Act also changed our statutory mandate to require that we regulate 

holding companies so as to promote the stability of the financial system as a whole.  This means 

paying attention to interconnections among financial firms, correlations of asset holdings, and 

other characteristics that could endanger the nation’s financial stability during periods of stress.  

One of the most notable differences between the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial legislation 

over the preceding half century is the frequency with which the phrases “financial stability” and 

“systemic risk” occur, either as the specific goal of certain new provisions or as a consideration
