Finally, in circumstances where a major central bank is continuing to expand its 

balance sheet or maintaining a large balance sheet over a sustained period, this policy 

would likely exert downward pressure on term premiums around the globe, especially in 

those foreign economies whose bonds were perceived as close substitutes.  Indeed, until 

very recently, it had been notable how little long yields moved up in the United States 

even as discussions of balance sheet normalization have moved to the forefront.  This 

likely reflects at least in part the expectation that ongoing asset purchase programs in 

other advanced economies would continue holding down long-term yields globally.  The 

tide seems to have turned in recent weeks, as long yields in the U.S. have increased 

notably on market perceptions that foreign officials are beginning to deliberate their own 

normalization strategies.   

I have used a simple stylized model to illustrate circumstances in which the 

choice of normalization strategies adopted by major central banks can potentially be quite 

consequential.  If anything, the analysis presented here serves to highlight the importance 

of research assessing this question from both an empirical and theoretical perspective.      

Let me conclude by returning to the policy choices facing central banks.  The 

Federal Reserve chose to remove accommodation initially through increases in the 

federal funds rate.  In light of recent policy moves, I consider normalization of the federal 

funds rate to be well under way.  If the data continue to confirm a strong labor market 

and firming economic activity, I believe it would be appropriate relatively soon to 

commence the gradual and predictable process of allowing the balance sheet to run off.   

Once that process begins, I will want to assess the inflation process closely before 

making a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate in light of the
