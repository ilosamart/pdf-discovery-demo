I’m delighted to be speaking to this group; it’s really an honor.  Given the 

audience--and because I may never again have so many economists in front of me at one 

time--I thought that rather than giving a policy-oriented speech, I would test-drive a new 

research project.  The project is ongoing joint work with Samuel Hanson and Andrei 

Shleifer of Harvard and with Robert Vishny of the University of Chicago.  We haven’t 

quite finished writing up the paper, but we have most of the raw material and a pretty 

good idea of where we are trying to go, so I figured I would give it a shot.

Our aim is primarily positive, as opposed to normative:  We’re interested in better 

understanding the economic role played by commercial banks, as well as the interplay 

between the traditional commercial banking sector and the so-called shadow-banking 

sector, which includes various non-bank intermediaries such as broker-dealers, money-

market funds, and hedge funds.   

It would be an understatement to say that the literature on the role of banks is 

vast.  Without attempting to do it justice, let me just note three prominent classes of 

theories.  The first focuses on the liability side of banks’ balance sheets--that is, their 

deposit-taking role.  In this view, what is most important about banks is that they create 

safe claims which, precisely because of their safety and immunity from adverse-selection 

problems, are useful as a transactions medium.

  In other words, banks are special 

because they are the institutions that create private, or “inside,” money.  Although it does 

not necessarily follow as a logical matter, this view has led some observers to advocate

Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee.

 See Gorton and Pennacchi (1990) for an early articulation of the idea that bank liabilities are designed to 

minimize adverse-selection problems and hence facilitate exchange between uninformed parties.
