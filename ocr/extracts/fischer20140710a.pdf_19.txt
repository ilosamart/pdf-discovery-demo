because until now, bond holders in large banks rarely have lost significantly in crises--

rather, for fear of contagion, they ended up being protected by the government.   

Almost certainly, TBTF is central to the debate about financial crises because 

financial crises are so destructive of the real economy.  It is also because the amounts of 

money involved when the central bank or the government intervenes in a financial crisis 

are extremely large, even though the final costs to the government, including the central 

bank, are typically much smaller.  In some cases, governments and central banks even 

come out slightly ahead after the crisis is over and the banks have been sold back to the 

private sector.  Another factor may be that the departing heads of some banks that failed 

or needed massive government assistance to survive nonetheless received very large 

retirement packages. 

One can regard the entire regulatory reform program, which aims to strengthen 

the resilience of banks and the banking system to shocks, as dealing with the TBTF 

problem by reducing the probability that any bank will get into trouble.  There are, 

however, some aspects of the financial reform program that deal specifically with large 

banks.  The most important such measure is the work on resolution mechanisms for 

SIFIs, including the very difficult case of G-SIFIs.  In the United States, the Dodd-Frank 

Act has provided the FDIC with the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA)--a regime to 

conduct an orderly resolution of a financial firm if the bankruptcy of the firm would 

threaten financial stability.  And the FDICâ€™s single-point-of-entry approach for effecting 

a resolution under the new regime is a sensible proposed implementation path for the 

OLA.
