Examination Procedures
Effective date July 1997 Section 5050.3

1. Complete or update the Internal Control
Questionnaire if selected for implementation.

2. Review applicable statutes, regulations,
and/or supervisory requirements for asset
maintenance.

3. Review IBF ledgers to determine that IBF
accounts are clearly segregated from the
establishing entity’s books. (Note: IBF led-
gers may be integrated with the establishing
entity’s general ledger or may be main-
tained as a separate general ledger. If the
ledgers are included with the establishing
entity’s regular accounts, the IBF accounts
must be clearly labeled. IBF assets need not
balance with IBF liabilities.)

4. Determine the adequacy of the internal
audit procedures used to check compliance
with applicable regulations. Obtain a list of
any deficiencies noted in the latest review
performed by the internal auditors and deter-
mine if corrections have been made.

5. In addition to verifying application of the
branch’s standard review, analysis, and/or
documentation of IBF-booked credits and
deposits, evaluate the adequacy of proce-
dures by reviewing a sample of accounts to
ensure that:
a. All deposits, extensions of credit, and

off-balance-sheet items are extended to
or accepted from qualified customers,
i.e., foreign residents, other IBFs, and
offices of the branch establishing the
IBF.

b. Nonbank extensions of credit are used
only to finance the non-U.S. operations
of the customer.

c. Nonbank deposits are used only to sup-
port the non-U.S. operations of the
customer.

d. Nonbank customers are provided written
notice of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors’ policy statement at the time
the deposit or credit relationship is first
established advising of the requirement
regarding the non-U.S. use of deposits
and credit extensions.

e. In the case of loans to or deposits from
foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations,

verify that written confirmation is
obtained acknowledging receipt of the
Board of Governors’ policy. (Note: IBF
transactions with foreign governments
and official institutions are treated in the
same manner as IBF transactions with
foreign banks, i.e. written notice of the
non-U.S. use of funds is not necessary.)

f. Nonbank deposits meet the minimum
maturity or required notice period for
withdrawal of two business days.

g. Nonbank time deposits and withdrawals
(except for account closings and with-
drawals of accumulated interest) meet
the minimum size transaction amount of
$100,000.

h. Deposit confirmations state that funds
are being placed in an IBF and that the
depositor must abide by IBF restrictions
as defined by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System.

6. Review all intrabank transactions for an
appropriate time period to determine that:
a. All transactions with the U.S. offices of

the IBF’s own branch are clearly
identifiable.

b. Eurocurrency liabilities are properly
reported by the IBF’s establishing branch.

7. Review IBF purchases from and sales to
third parties to determine that:
a. Such assets are IBF eligible assets, and

appropriate notices and acknowledg-
ments have been provided and uses of
proceeds documented.

b. The transactions are at arms length, with-
out recourse.

c. The transactions are not conducted with
affiliates, other than the branch establish-
ing the IBF.

8. Review all IBF-related regulatory reports,
e.g., the FFIEC-002 and FR 2951, if appli-
cable, to determine their timely submission
and accuracy.

9. Discuss apparent violations and procedural
deficiencies with appropriate officer(s).

10. Prepare comments in appropriate report form
for all violations and deficiencies noted.
