addition, policymakers could have less ability to cut short-term interest rates in the future 

than the simulations assume.  By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close 

to zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow 

productivity growth and high global saving.23  If so, then the average level of the nominal 

federal funds rate down the road might turn out to be only 2 percent, implying that asset 

purchases and forward guidance might have to be pushed to extremes to compensate.24  

Moreover, relying too heavily on these nontraditional tools could have unintended 

consequences.  For example, if future policymakers responded to a severe recession by 

announcing their intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero for a very long time 

after the economy had substantially recovered and followed through on that guidance, 

then they might inadvertently encourage excessive risk-taking and so undermine financial 

stability.     

Finally, the simulation analysis certainly overstates the FOMC’s current ability to 

respond to a recession, given that there is little scope to cut the federal funds rate at the 

                                                 
changes in long-term interest rates, whether driven by shifts in term premiums or shifts in the expected path 

of short-term interest rates, have the same influence on real activity, as there is some empirical evidence 

that the estimated sensitivity of spending to movements in term premiums alone may be relatively small; 

see Michael T. Kiley (2014), “The Aggregate Demand Effects of Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates,” 

International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (December), pp. 69-104, 

www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q4a3.pdf.  On the other hand, the effectiveness of forward guidance in the 

FRB/US model is materially less than it is in some other models, implying that the FRB/US simulation 

results could potentially understate the stimulus provided by the announcement of a lower-for-longer 

policy.  See Hess Chung (2015), “The Effects of Forward Guidance in Three Macro Models,” FEDS Notes 

(Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 26),

23 In principle, the federal funds rate in the longer run could also turn out to be lower than currently 

predicted if inflation were to remain persistently below 2 percent.  However, because a higher rate of 

inflation can arguably be achieved over time through a sufficiently tight labor market, this risk seems low 

to me as long as the Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its inflation objective. 
24 In the simulations reported by Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond to Future 

Recessions,” in note 8, overcoming the effects of the zero lower bound during a severe recession would 

require about $4 trillion in asset purchases and pledging to stay low for even longer if the average future 

level of the federal funds rate is only 2 percent.
