Chairman for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, I see innovation as something that can and 

should be fostered, but of course I must also scrutinize these innovations from a different 

perspective.  That is to say, it is appropriate not only to evaluate the potential of innovations to 

improve on existing services, but also to judge their ramifications for the safety and soundness of 

the institutions we supervise and for financial stability--the topic of this conference.  Although 

many of these technologies are still nascent, it is important to have an eye on the potential 

financial stability implications both in the short- and long-run.  Payment systems need to be 

resilient during adversity.  Without that resilience, we could face a sudden loss of public 

confidence and the seizing up of systems and critical activities.   

With the Cash Roomâ€™s perspective on history and daily financial operations in mind, I 

would like to concentrate my remarks on the U.S. payment system, which is a critical foundation 

on which financial transactions and the conduct of business take place.  New technologies are 

being proposed that could alter the design of our payment system.  Today, I will talk about the 

necessary trust and confidence that the system requires, the tension between the need for 

financial stability and the need to innovate, and the challenges that digital currencies, in 

particular, present relative to the current system.  These considerations highlight the need for a 

prudent approach to innovation in payment systems.        

Payment Systems, Networks, and Trust   

Payment systems are both financial networks and technical networks.  In simple terms, 

there is an asset that functions as money that can be transferred by households and businesses to 

buy goods and services, which, along with their financial institutions, make up the bulk of the 

financial network.  Today, the predominant forms of money used in payment systems are Federal 

Reserve notes and reserve balances as well as transaction balances at depository institutions.
