work for a long time also tend to lose touch with former co-workers in their previous 

industry or occupation--contacts that can often help an unemployed worker find a job.  

Long-term unemployment can make any worker progressively less employable, even 

after the economy strengthens. 

 A factor contributing to the high level of long-term unemployment in the current 

recovery is the relatively large proportion of workers who have permanently lost their 

previous jobs, as opposed to being laid off temporarily.  For example, in past recessions, 

a considerable share of jobs lost in construction has been temporary, but that isn’t the 

case this time.  Construction employment fell from its peak of 7.7 million in 2006 to a 

low of 5.4 million in 2011.  Only about 300,000 of those 2.3 million jobs have returned 

and most won’t, at least for many years.  

In general, individuals who permanently lose their previous jobs take longer to 

become reemployed than do those on temporary layoff, are more likely to have to change 

industries or occupations to find a new job, and earn significantly less when they become 

reemployed.11   

The greater amount of permanent job loss seen in the recent recession also 

suggests that there might have been an increase in the degree of mismatch between the 

skills possessed by the unemployed and those demanded by employers.  This possibility 

and the unprecedented level and persistence of long-term unemployment in this recovery 

have prompted some to ask whether a significant share of unemployment since the 

recession is due to structural problems in labor markets and not simply a cyclical
