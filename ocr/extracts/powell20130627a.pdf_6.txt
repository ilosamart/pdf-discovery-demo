attachment to the labor force, permanently damaging the economy’s dynamism and 

potential output.  

To summarize, although inflation is below target, it is expected by most observers 

to return over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  The Committee will continue 

to carefully monitor inflation developments.  But we are still far from full employment.  

The case for continued support for the economy from monetary policy is strong. 

Implications for Monetary Policy 

The federal funds rate has been near zero since late 2008, and since then the 

FOMC has been providing accommodation through two relatively new policy tools.  

These tools are “forward guidance” about the future level of the federal funds rate, which 

is the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks, and large-scale asset 

purchase programs (“asset purchases,” or LSAPs).   

In part, the forward-guidance tool is embodied in the thresholds the FOMC 

adopted last December.  The Committee indicated its intention to hold short-term rates 

near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, provided inflation 

one- to two-years ahead is projected to be no higher than 2.5 percent.4  And under the 

current flow-based LSAP program, adopted last year, we are purchasing $85 billion a 

month in long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  

Although the level of purchases may vary depending on economic conditions, the 

program will continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor 

market, in a context of price stability.
