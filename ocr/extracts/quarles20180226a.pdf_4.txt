2010 and 2011.2  Even more notable is that the IMF has revised up global growth in its 

recent projections.  These upgrades follow a prolonged period of depressingly regular 

serial downgrades in the IMF’s outlook as the post-crisis recovery dragged on longer than 

many commentators and forecasters had anticipated.  Stronger foreign growth has in turn 

supported U.S. growth, with exports in 2017 growing at the fastest pace in four years.  

Inflation has run at a low and relatively stable rate throughout the crisis and the 

recovery.  Recently, the low level of inflation has attracted considerable attention, as it 

continues to run on the soft side notwithstanding the apparent tightness of the labor 

market.  Headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) prices increased 1.7 percent 

in the 12 months ending in December, a few tenths of 1 percentage point below the 

Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.  

That inflation has remained low even as activity has picked up and the labor market has 

tightened has led a number of commentators to question the relevance of the Phillips 

curve analytical framework that ties inflation to the strength of the economy.   

In my view, it is premature to write off the Phillips curve.  Indeed, I think it is 

likely that tightness in labor markets will eventually show up in wages and prices.  I tend 

to agree with the view that the recent softness of inflation mostly reflects idiosyncratic 

and transitory factors, and I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent over the next year 

or so.  Overall, I would characterize the recent weakness of inflation as something that 

should be expected to fade rather than as an enduring mystery that necessitates a change 

in our framework for assessing inflation.
