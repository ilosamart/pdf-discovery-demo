will be measured.  To further advance the goals of transparency and predictability, we will 

continue to work within the Basel Committee to ensure that the indicators used to determine the 

systemic risk ranking of a firm are clear and based upon publicly available information sources.  

If additional information is needed by firms to allow for effective capital planning, the Basel 

Committee should be prepared to develop and release additional guidance. 

Next Steps for the Reform Agenda 

As I stated earlier, strong capital and liquidity standards are central to an effective 

financial regulatory system.  Well-crafted capital standards provide a buffer against loss from 

any activities of a bank, while good liquidity standards help provide assurance that a firm will 

have breathing space during a period of financial stress, whether idiosyncratic or systemic.  But 

we cannot rely solely on these standards, important as they are, to provide a stable financial 

system.   

Basel 2.5, Basel III, and the G-SIB surcharges can only reduce the chances of highly 

disruptive failure, not eliminate them.  A necessary supplement is a strong resolution mechanism 

for systemically important firms, both to counter too-big-to-fail perceptions and to contain the 

harm to the financial system that would be caused by the failure of one of these firms.  Thus, my 

first candidate for a priority area of work in 2012 is to take concrete steps to advance the useful 

analytic work that has been done in the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 

on the resolution of financial firms with substantial international presence.   

Here in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for an orderly liquidation 

process.  Some other jurisdictions have, or are planning to, put in place comparable special- 

resolution mechanisms.  But the co-existence of internationally active firms with nationally 

based insolvency regimes means that there can be potentially important transborder legal
