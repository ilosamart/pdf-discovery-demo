Although existing empirical work is again scant, one often hears the suggestion that 

complexity and agency problems may lead to diseconomies for financial firms under 

certain circumstances, a proposition that should be considered alongside the hypotheses 

for positive scale and scope effects.6 

The second point is that the size and composition of a financial firm’s balance 

sheet play a complicated role in producing economies of scope and scale.  To be sure, a 

large trading book or custody business might produce social benefits by allowing a bank 

to match or clear both sides of transactions at lower cost.  And large balance sheets would 

appear to enable banks to diversify or hedge their positions and to access a variety of 

funding sources, thereby reducing their cost of capital.  But conventional IO-type 

analysis, which would tend to interpret lower funding costs as evidence of scale 

economies, is potentially misleading.   

Consider, in this regard, my observation of a moment ago that a large balance 

sheet may reduce a bank’s cost of capital.  If lower funding costs do result from the 

diversification of risks and funding sources made possible by a large balance sheet, they 

would indeed suggest the existence of scale economies.  But they may also result from 

the belief of some counterparties that a firm with a very large balance sheet is TBTF, and 

thus at least some liabilities of that firm will be backed by the government in a time of 

financial stress.  In this instance, lower funding costs actually suggest a market failure 

                                                 
6 There is some research that could provide useful starting points for more focused IO work.  For example, 
a 2010 paper by Klein and Saidenberg finds a discount on profitability and market value for more complex 
banks.  Because the authors control for bank size, the paper does not squarely address scale and scope 
issues, but it pursues the kinds of questions that could usefully be asked in that context.  Peter G. Klein and 
Marc R. Saidenberg (2010), “Organizational Structure and the Diversification Discount:  Evidence from 
Commercial Banking,” Journal of Industrial Economics, vol. 58 (March), pp. 127-55. 
  “Agency problems” refers in this context to divergences in the incentives of management and 
shareholders that create possibilities for management to make decisions in their own, rather than 
shareholders’, interests, as well as for potentially expensive monitoring mechanisms for shareholders 
seeking to limit agency costs.
