Indeed, while average wages have continued to increase (albeit slowly) on an 

annual basis for persons who have remained employed, the average wage for new hires 

has declined since 2010.16  Although it is too early to state with certainty what the long-

term effect of this recession will be on the earnings potential of those who lost their jobs, 

given the severity of the job loss and sluggishness of the recovery--with nearly 9 million 

jobs lost and still almost 2½ million jobs below pre-recession employment levels--it is 

very likely that, for many households, future labor earnings will be well below what they 

had anticipated in the years before the recession. 

Implications for Our Thinking about the Macroeconomy 

I have focused most of my remarks on the experiences of households at the lower 

ends of the income and wealth distributions, those households whose incomes improved 

the least in the years prior to the financial crisis and that suffered disproportionately as a 

result of the crisis and ensuing recession.   

To be clear, my approach of starting with inequality and differences across 

households is not a feature of most analyses of the macroeconomy, and the channels I 

have emphasized generally do not play key roles in most macro models.  The typical 

macroeconomic analysis focuses on the general equilibrium behavior of “representative” 

households and firms, thereby abstracting from the consequences of inequality and other 

heterogeneity across households and instead focusing on the aggregate measures of 

spending determinants, including current income, wealth, interest rates, credit supply, and 

confidence or pessimism.  In certain circumstances, this abstraction might be a reasonable 

simplification.  For example, if the changes in the distribution of income or wealth, and
