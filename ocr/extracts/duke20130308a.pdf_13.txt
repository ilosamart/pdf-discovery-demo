protections and lenders take into account the costs that imprudent mortgage lending can 

impose on communities, the financial system, and the economy.  The accompanying 

effect, however, may be tighter credit standards, especially for lower-credit-quality 

borrowers, than prevailed during most of the past decade.  It will be up to policymakers 

to find the right balance between consumer safety and financial stability, on the one hand, 

and availability and cost of credit, on the other. 

The CFPB took an important step toward resolving regulatory uncertainty when it 

released a host of rules in January, including rules on ability-to-repay requirements, the 

definition of a qualified mortgage (QM), loan officer compensation, and servicing 

standards.  

The Federal Reserve and other agencies are in the process of moving forward on 

proposed rulemakings that would implement revised regulatory capital requirements and 

the requirements for risk retention mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which include an exemption for mortgages that meet 

the definition of qualified residential mortgages (QRMs).  These and other prudential 

rules, taken together with the CFPB rules, will further shape the economics of mortgage 

lending.  For example, bank capital rules will specify the amount of capital a bank must 

hold against certain mortgages.  The risk retention rule will specify which loans in the 

QM universe qualify as QRM loans and therefore are not subject to risk retention when 

securitized.  The risk retention rules will also define how securitizers must meet the risk 

retention requirement for mortgages that are not QRMs, and the cost associated with this 

requirement may affect mortgage costs.  I wonâ€™t comment today on the rulemakings that 

are still under way.  However, I believe that, as we layer on additional requirements, it is
