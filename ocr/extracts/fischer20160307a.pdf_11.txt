extremely interesting and pessimistic book that argues we will have to accept 

the fact that productivity will not grow in future at anything like the rates of 

the period before 1973.  Others look around and see impressive changes in 

technology and cannot believe that productivity growth will not move back 

closer to the higher levels of yesteryear.7  A great deal of work is taking place 

to evaluate the data, but so far there is little evidence that data difficulties 

account for a significant part of the decline in productivity growth as 

calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.8 

3. The ZLB and the effectiveness of monetary policy:  From December 2008 to 

December 2015, the federal funds rate target set by the Fed was a range of 

0 to 1/4 percent, a range of rates that was described as the ZLB (zero lower 

bound).9  Between December 2008 and December 2014, the Fed engaged in 

QE--quantitative easing--through a variety of programs.  Empirical work done 

at the Fed and elsewhere suggests that QE worked in the sense that it reduced 

interest rates other than the federal funds rate, and particularly seems to have 

succeeded in driving down longer-term rates, which are the rates most 

relevant to spending decisions.  

Critics have argued that QE has gradually become less effective over the 

years, and should no longer be used.  It is extremely difficult to appraise the 

effectiveness of a program all of whose parameters have been announced at 

the beginning of the program.  But I regard it as significant with respect to the

9 Inside the Fed, the range of 0 to Â¼ percent is generally called the ELB, the effective lower bound.
