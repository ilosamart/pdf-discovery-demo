Thank you for welcoming me to a meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee.1   

The overall profitability and balance sheet strength of large U.S. enterprises is impressive 

at this stage of recovery.  Equity prices and credit terms in liquid markets corroborate these 

improved fundamentals.  And for these firms, financial market conditions appear quite 

supportive of economic growth. 

Still, significant economic challenges persist.  While recent trends in personal 

consumption and business investment trends are positive, the underlying strength of the economy 

over the medium term is less clear.  Unemployment remains high, and stubbornly so.  Small and 

medium-sized enterprises, which have tended to lead recoveries, are still hesitant to expand--

revenue growth is tepid, costs are uncertain, and credit conditions remain more difficult than for 

large firms. 

  Increases in government expenditures around the world--ostensibly instituted as a 

bulwark against further economic weakness--are raising fiscal deficits significantly.  

Unsustainable, projected fiscal debt loads--including large and growing implicit guarantees 

bestowed upon large financial firms by governments--are raising concerns in sovereign debt 

markets. 

Taking account of the broad range of economic and financial conditions, there is no 

wonder that the electorate--in the United States and abroad--is unnerved.  The uncomfortable 

juxtaposition of financial and economic realities has caused some fundamental precepts of the 

so-called Anglo-American economic model to be attacked.  

Allow me to join your discussion on an increasingly questioned foundation of our 

economic system, the independent status of central banks.
