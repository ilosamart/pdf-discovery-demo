have now been answered.  We anticipate that some firms with high capital levels that have been 

retaining solid earnings for several quarters will be interested in increasing or resuming 

dividends.  In response to these anticipated requests, we will soon be issuing supervisory 

guidelines applicable to such requests from the largest holding companies for the first quarter of 

next year.   

Although the details of these guidelines are still being finalized, I can say that our 

approach to considering such requests will be a conservative one.  We will expect firms to 

submit convincing capital plans that demonstrate their ability to absorb losses over the next two 

years under an adverse economic scenario that we will specify, and still remain amply 

capitalized.  We also expect that firms will have a sound estimate of any significant risks that 

may not be captured by the stress testing, such as potential mortgage putback exposures, and the 

capacity to absorb any consequent losses.  The firms will also be asked to show how, even with 

their proposed capital distributions, they will readily and comfortably meet the Basel III 

requirements as they come into effect, as well as to accommodate any business model changes 

that might be necessitated by Dodd-Frank. 

Conclusion 

The final set of major Dodd-Frank regulations will not be completed until early 2012.  A 

year from now we will be in the midst of a regulatory process implementing Basel III, and there 

will likely be an active debate over the future of the government-sponsored enterprises.  So I see 

little risk that the third annual conference on financial regulatory reform at George Washington 

Law School will be entitled “The End of the Road.”  Maybe, just maybe, I have given you a title 

for the fourth.  Then again, maybe not.
