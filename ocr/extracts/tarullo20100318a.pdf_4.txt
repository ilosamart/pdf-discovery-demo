device could better tie the supervisory and resolution processes together.

As compelling as the case for such a process is, the debate around resolution 

proposals has highlighted the challenge of crafting a workable resolution regime for 

large, interconnected firms.  The basic design problem is that such a regime must advance 

the goals of both financial stability and market discipline.  While these goals are usually 

complementary, they can at times be competing--especially in periods of high financial 

stress, when time consistency problems can loom large.  In the midst of a crisis, 

governments fearful of financial upheaval can be tempted to provide assistance to 

supposedly uninsured creditors, even at the cost of increasing moral hazard in the post-

crisis period.  Despite the consequent design difficulties, I think there are certain essential 

features of any special resolution process.  

First, any new regime should be used only in those rare circumstances where a 

firm’s failure would have serious adverse effects on financial stability.  That is, the 

presumption should be that generally applicable bankruptcy law applies to nonbank 

financial firms--even large, interconnected ones.  One way to help ensure that the regime 

is invoked only when necessary to protect the public’s interest in systemic stability is to 

use a “multi-key” approach--that is, one that requires the approval of multiple agencies 

and a determination by each that the high standards governing the use of the special 

regime have been met.  

Second, once invoked, the government should have broad authority to wind down 

the company in an orderly way.  This authority should include--among other things--
