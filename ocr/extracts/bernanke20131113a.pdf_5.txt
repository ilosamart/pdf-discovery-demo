institution.  Indeed, the complex challenges we face as a nation are best addressed in an 

environment of informed public discourse, which is only possible when policy decisions 

are made in as transparent a way as possible.  The centennial may be just an accident of 

the calendar, but any time is a good time to help more people learn about the Fed and 

what it does to enhance the economic well-being of Americans. 

It is often said--alas, accurately--that teaching is a thankless profession, so let me 

close by thanking you for what you give to your students.  Our country and our economy 

need informed citizens who can think independently and critically.  More pertinent to 

today’s meeting, let me also thank you for your interest in teaching your students about 

the history and role of the Federal Reserve.  As many of you have discovered, the Federal 

Reserve has a variety of classroom tools available through our education portal, 

FederalReserveEducation.org.  Notably, the System’s economic and financial education 

staff is introducing today a set of three lesson plans that examine the past 100 years of 

central banking.  I hope they will provide practical help in your classes.  

Thank you for participating in today’s event.  I look forward to your questions 

and to an interesting discussion of the Federal Reserve’s past, present, and future.
