A recent example illustrates the risk of unwittingly introducing bias into an AI model.  It 

was recently reported that a large employer attempted to develop an AI hiring tool for software 

developers that was trained with a data set of the resumes of past successful hires, which it later 

abandoned.  Because the pool of previously hired software developers in the training data set was 

overwhelmingly male, the AI developed a bias against female applicants, going so far as to 

exclude resumes of graduates from two women’s colleges.24  

Importantly, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act 

(FCRA) include requirements for creditors to provide notice of the factors involved in taking 

actions that are adverse or unfavorable for the consumer.25  These requirements help provide 

transparency in the underwriting process, promote fair lending by requiring creditors to explain 

why they reached their decisions, and provide consumers with actionable information to improve 

their credit standing.  Compliance with these requirements implies finding a way to explain AI 

decisions.  However, the opacity of some AI tools may make it challenging to explain credit 

decisions to consumers, which would make it harder for consumers to improve their credit score 

by changing their behavior.  Fortunately, AI itself may play a role in the solution:  The AI 

community is responding with important advances in developing “explainable” AI tools with a 

focus on expanding consumer access to credit.26  I am pleased that this is one of the topics on 

your agenda today.
