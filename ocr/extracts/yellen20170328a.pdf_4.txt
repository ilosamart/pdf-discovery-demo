income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higher-

income communities.4   

The challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater.  The 

average unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority 

of the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015.  Also, a much smaller 

share of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent 

during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with 

smaller minority populations.5  These elevated unemployment rates and depressed 

employment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce 

development options for these communities.  

Education as a Workforce Development Strategy 

Probably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the 

quality of general education.  The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century, 

facilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the 

century and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed 

enormously to the broad-based economic gains associated with that period.6  But, 

unfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk, 

education levels have historically lagged in low- and moderate-income communities, 

                                                 
4 Low- and moderate-income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percent 
of the area median income.  Higher-income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80 
percent of the area median income or greater.  Statistics represent the average of census tract 
unemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined. 
5 Prime-age workers are those who are aged 25 to 54.  Statistics are from the American Community Survey 
(ACS) data releases from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at
