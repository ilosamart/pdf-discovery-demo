Although prompt and innovative actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped 

prevent a severe economic downturn from turning into something even worse, our experience 

also highlighted a number of areas we need to study further to see whether we can improve the 

conduct of monetary policy.  I’ve titled my presentation “Homework Assignments” because I 

don’t think the answers are clear, though I will venture some tentative thoughts.  I have four 

assignments on my list; I could easily have more.  And others would have yet a different list.  I 

recognize that the complexity of these questions could keep us profitably engaged for a whole 

semester, but let’s see if I can outline some of the challenges and possible responses in an 

evening.   

 The first two assignments concern the policy actions the Federal Reserve and other 

central banks took during the financial crisis.  A key part of the Federal Reserve’s response was 

to fulfill its traditional role of providing backup liquidity to sound institutions during times of 

financial turmoil.  In a break with tradition, we had to provide that liquidity to nonbank financial 

institutions as well as to banks.  One assignment is to evaluate the implications of the changing 

character of financial markets for the design of the liquidity tools the Federal Reserve has at its 

disposal when panic-driven runs on banks and other key financial intermediaries and markets 

threaten financial stability and the economy.  In addition to providing liquidity on an 

unprecedented scale, we reduced our policy interest rate (the target for the rate on overnight 

loans between banks) effectively to zero, and then we continued to ease financial conditions and 

cushion the effect of the financial shock on the economy by making large-scale purchases of 

several types of securities.  My second assignment involves improving our understanding of the 

effects of those purchases and the associated massive increase in bank reserves.
