Longer-term Considerations: Potential output, productivity, labor market fluidity, 

and business dynamism 

I would like to take a step back from the current context and explore an issue that 

ought to receive more attention--the longer-run potential growth rate of our economy.  

One reason for the low neutral rate of interest is that potential growth appears to have 

slowed.  Since the crisis ended, forecasters have broadly reduced their estimates of longer 

run growth by a full percentage point--from about 3 percent to about 2 percent.3 This 

seemingly modest reduction implies dramatically smaller increases in living standards 

over time.  A growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by 

severe financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4  One recent analysis 

suggests that in about one-third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one-third of 

the time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its 

subsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of 

potential output and in the growth rate.5  Unfortunately, many economies are currently in 

danger of falling into the third category, including the U.S. economy. 

Output growth can be broken down into increases in hours worked and changes in 

output per hour, or productivity.  Most of the decline in estimated potential U.S. growth 

appears to be from lower productivity.  Labor productivity growth began to slow around 

2005--before the crisis--and been only 1/2 percent annually since 2011--the slowest five

Economic Indicators moved down from 2.9 percent in March 2007 to 2.1 percent in March 2016.
