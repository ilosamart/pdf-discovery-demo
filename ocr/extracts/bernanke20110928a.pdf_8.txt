framework, nor did it touch on a variety of institutional arrangements--central bank 

independence being one familiar example--that have been shown to promote economic 

stability and growth.10 

Amending the Washington Consensus 

Overall, some key elements of the Washington Consensus appear well supported 

both by basic economic logic and by their successful application by a number of 

countries.  However, the experience of the past two decades also suggests some lessons 

that augment or modify what we thought we knew about economic development in 1990.  

I will highlight three specific lessons. 

First, the implementation of the Washington Consensus recommendations is 

important and not so straightforward in practice.  In particular, as I alluded to earlier, the 

sequencing of reforms matters.  For example, some developing countries, following the 

principles of liberalization and deregulation, removed controls on the inflows of foreign 

capital, and foreign investors responded by pouring in funds.  However, the banking 

systems and the associated regulatory and supervisory agencies in these countries were 

not always well prepared to manage these capital inflows.  Consequently, some of the 

foreign capital was badly invested, which in turn contributed to emerging-market 

financial crises, like those in Mexico and emerging Asia in the 1990s.  This experience 

suggests that measures to strengthen banks and bank regulation should be put in place 

before the domestic market is opened to capital flows from abroad.

(2011).  On the benefits of central bank independence, see, for example, Alesina and Summers (1993) and 
Cukierman and others (2002).
