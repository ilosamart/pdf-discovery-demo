Today’s Challenges 

These reforms represent movement in the right direction, but leave us well short of where 

we need to be.  Despite the GSEs’ significant role in this key market, there is no clarity about 

their future.  When they were put into conservatorship, Treasury Secretary Paulson noted that 

“policymakers must view this next period as a ‘time out’ where we have stabilized the GSEs 

while we decide their future role and structure.”5  Almost nine years into this time out, the federal 

government’s domination of the housing sector has grown and is actually greater than it was 

before the crisis.  Fannie, Freddie, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and U.S. 

Department of Veterans Affairs have a combined market share of about 80 percent of the 

purchase mortgage market, with the remaining 20 percent held by private financial institutions.  

After reaching nearly 30 percent of the market before the crisis, private-label securitization has 

dwindled to almost nothing today.   

The two GSEs remain in government conservatorship, with associated contingent 

liabilities to US taxpayers.6  Fannie and Freddie have remitted just over $270 billion of profits to 

the Treasury, more than paying back the government’s initial investment.  However, under 

current terms of the contracts that govern their access to Treasury funds, their capital will decline 

to $0 by January 1, 2018.  Today, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have more than $5 trillion of 

MBS and corporate debt outstanding, which is widely held and receives various forms of special

Financial Markets and Taxpayers, September 7, 2008, www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-

6 The size of these contingent liabilities is potentially quite large. FHFA’s stress test results published in August 
2016 found that under its severely adverse scenario the two GSEs could need to draw up to $125.8 billion from the 
U.S. Treasury.  See www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/ReportDocuments/2016_DFAST_Severely-Adverse-
Scenario.pdf.
