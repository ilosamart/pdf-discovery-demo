of the Presidency and Congress, and especially with the Center’s fellows.  Doubtless your 

participation in the fellowship program as undergraduate and graduate students--writing

particularly regarding the responses of policymakers.  I draw four relevant lessons from 

the financial collapse of the 1930s; I will first list these lessons, then briefly elaborate.  

First, economic prosperity depends on financial stability; second, policymakers must
