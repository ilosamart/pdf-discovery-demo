than others.  Even assuming, as I think reasonable, that most or all the economies I have 

identified would hold up to empirical assessment, the crucial questions would remain as 

to how big or how integrated financial firms need to be in order to attain these economies.  

The relative dearth of work that would help answer these questions can be attributed to a 

number of factors.5  First, the sample size of the very largest firms is obviously small, 

limiting the ability of researchers to derive precise statistical relationships between cost, 

on the one hand, and firm scale and scope, on the other.  This problem of sample size is 

exacerbated by the fact that there has been tremendous growth in the size, complexity, 

and concentration of the financial sector over the past 15 years or so.  Second, there are 

serious limitations on the data available to researchers, and thus any useful discussion of 

an analytic agenda for research on financial industry structure must include an agenda for 

overcoming proprietary and other constraints on developing appropriate data sources.  

For example, data on the use of a variety of financial services by specific customers is 

generally unavailable to researchers.  Third, even if appropriate data become available, it 

may be quite difficult to isolate costs for particular banking activities, given the number 

of products and activities offered by even moderately complex financial institutions. 

Two additional considerations bear mentioning in mapping out the issues 

associated with scale and scope economies in the financial sector.  The first is a well-

known qualification to the proposition that scale and scope can be beneficial--the 

possibility that firms may grow so large as to face diseconomies of scope and scale.  

                                                 
5 A recent study conducted on behalf of The Clearing House tackles some of these questions.  This study 
makes a useful effort to estimate separately scale and scope economies for a variety of financial activities, 
rather than inferring such economies from firm-level consolidated data.  However, the study exemplifies 
some of the challenges mentioned in this speech, relying as it does on proprietary data for a small sample of 
firms, as well as case studies and interviews, for the empirical analysis.  The Clearing House (2011),
