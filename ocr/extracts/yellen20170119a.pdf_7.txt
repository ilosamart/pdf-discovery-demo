2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year.7  Second, economic 

growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the 

ongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned, 

particularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually 

less accommodative.  Finally, figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several 

decades between labor market pressures and core inflation.  Note that during periods 

when the unemployment rate fell below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of its 

normal long-run level, shown by the yellow shaded regions, core inflation, the solid red 

line, rose little, if at all.  This stability is especially marked since inflation expectations 

became anchored during the mid-to-late 1990s.8    

That said, I think that allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently 

“hot” would be risky and unwise.  Waiting too long to remove accommodation could 

cause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up, driving actual inflation higher and 

making it harder to control.  The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong 

labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other 

financial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge.9  Finally, 

                                                           
7 Many other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the 
prior two years, including the U-6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits, 
survey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of 
unemployment.  A notable exception to this general pattern is the labor force participation rate, which 
declined fairly steadily from 2007 through 2015 but then flattened out last year despite continuing 
downward pressure from the aging of the population and other factors.  However, improvements in labor 
market conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are 
probably not a source of inflationary pressures.  
8 During the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the 
unemployment rate moved below its longer-run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did 
not adequately check persistent movements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing 
inflation expectations to drift.  This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations 
anchored through systematic policy actions. 
9 The Federal Reserve closely monitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability, which currently 
provide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit.  However, some asset
