competitive advantage relative to larger banks through knowledge of their local communities and 

their individual borrowers.  As a result, community banks play a unique role in their local 

economies, particularly with regard to lending to small- and medium-sized businesses.  The 

relationships these institutions have with their customers oftentimes mean they can look beyond 

traditional credit factors to consider unique borrower characteristics when making credit 

decisions and to reduce information failures about borrowers’ willingness and capacity to repay 

loans.  Numerous studies have documented these advantages and their value to economic 

development.  One recent study found that loans extended by rural community banks to small 

businesses default less frequently than similar loans granted by their urban counterparts, and that 

the performance advantage is greater when the bank and the borrower are located in the same 

county.2 

The traditional intermediation provided by community banks, along with the relatively 

small scale on which each community bank provides these services, suggests that the principal 

relevant prudential aim should be the equally traditional one of protecting the deposit insurance 

fund.  A second aim should be to help protect the availability of credit in geographic areas or to 

particular classes of borrowers unlikely to be served by larger banks.  It is important to note that 

this second aim implies not only that we want community banks to be operated in a safe and 

sound manner, but that we want them to be able to operate successfully.  Just as rural customers 

would be denied credit if their bank fails, they would also be denied credit if their bank’s costs 

make it an unviable business proposition.
