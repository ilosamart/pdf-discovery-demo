and controlled move to an inflation rate sustainably around our 2 percent goal.  Of 

course, there are a variety of alternative explanations for the current surprising 

relationship between inflation and unemployment, and perhaps all of them are part of a 

full account.  We should also be wary of a material and durable downward drift in 

inflation expectations below our objective, were we to see that develop, perhaps due to 

secular changes in the formation of prices or perceived constraints on the ability of 

monetary policy to react to future downturns.  Either way, as a matter of prudent risk 

management, we must conduct policy in a manner consistent with keeping inflation near 

target, validating the public’s trust in our commitment to our inflation objective and 

keeping inflation expectations anchored. 

In regard to policy, I am very comfortable remaining patient at this point and 

monitoring the incoming data.  That said, my sense is that further increases in the policy 

rate may be necessary at some point, a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic 

view of the economy’s growth potential and momentum.  In the language of central 

banking, my estimate of the neutral policy rate remains somewhat north of where we are 

now. 

Communicating a data-dependent policy framework can be challenging, 

especially if we do not want to appear to be overly discretionary.  It would probably be 

clearest if we defined what data we are dependent on and how we depended on those 

data--that is to say, if we adopted a monetary policy rule.  Strict rules, however--to 

achieve their valuable heuristic benefit--are as much about ignoring some data as they are 

about paying attention to other specific data.  Indeed, while rules provide useful and 

important benchmarks, the complexity and evolving nature of the economy at the current
