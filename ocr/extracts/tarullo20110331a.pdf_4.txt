consistency problems and credibly binds itself not to rescue these institutions, their growth 

would presumably be somewhat circumscribed.  But it is possible, perhaps likely, that some 

combination of scale and scope economies, oligopolistic tendencies, path dependence, and 

chance would nonetheless produce a financial system with a number of firms whose failure could 

bring about the very serious negative consequences for financial markets described by the 

domino and fire-sale effects.   

In contrast to these first two effects, the contagion effect is not necessarily a function of 

size at all.  The run on money market mutual funds began in September 2008 after the “breaking 

of the buck” by the Reserve Primary Fund, less because of its size than because of what its 

vulnerability told investors about the balance sheets of other funds.  Earlier that year, stress on 

the British banking system had increased significantly following the failure and subsequent 

nationalization of Northern Rock, a mid-sized bank heavily concentrated in residential mortgage 

activity.  The stress arose not from the direct effects of Northern Rock’s failure, but because it 

focused attention on the problems in British mortgage markets. 

This distinction is very important, since the contagion effect can plausibly originate in a 

very large number of firms, depending on circumstances in financial markets as a whole.  Indeed, 

the failure of almost any financial firm could bring about systemic problems if markets believe 

that failure reveals heretofore unrecognized problems with one or more significant classes of 

assets held by many financial actors, especially where the assets are associated with considerable 

degrees of leverage, maturity transformation, or both.  That is, the broader economic and 

financial environment interacts with the new knowledge produced by a firm’s failure to 

determine whether a contagion effect develops.
