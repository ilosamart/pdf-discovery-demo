called inside money).14 For all of these reasons, as a practical matter at least for 

the United States, it seems highly unlikely that the constraints associated with the 

ZLB could be meaningfully addressed by steps to encourage a transition to a 

cashless economy.

None of these options for dealing with the difficulties of the ZLB suggest that it 

will be easy either to raise the equilibrium real rate or to mitigate the constraints 

associated with the ZLB. But when the real rate is close to zero, even small effects can 

make a noticeable difference.  And, of course, such issues are clearly worthy of 

additional research.

How Should Central Banks Incorporate Financial Stability Considerations in the 

Conduct of Monetary Policy?

The challenges associated with the ZLB and the potential risks resulting from an 

environment of extremely low rates for a prolonged period of time bring me to the third 

question: How should central banks incorporate financial stability considerations in the 

conduct of monetary policy?  Or, put another way, can we conduct monetary policy in a 

way that reduces the likelihood of financial instability?15

The first response of policymakers to the question of whether monetary policy--

defined as the short-term policy interest rate--should be used to support financial stability 

is to say that macroprudential tools, rather than adjustments in short-term interest rates,

should be the first line of defense.

14 As an alternative to eliminating currency, a number of authors--including Goodfriend (2000), Buiter 
(2003), Agarwal and Kimball (2015), McAndrews (2015), and Rogoff (2014)--have discussed various 
mechanisms that could effectively implement a Gesell tax on physical currency.
