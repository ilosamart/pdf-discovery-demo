Despite the recovery I noted in home prices and a greater number of home sales, 

residential construction activity remains quite low.  I mentioned the ongoing issues with 

mortgage credit, but more generally, many years of a weak job market and slow wage 

gains seem to have induced many people to double-up on housing, and many young 

adults continue to live with their parents.  Population growth is creating a need for more 

housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that continuing job and wage gains 

will encourage more people to form new households.  Nevertheless, activity in the 

housing sector is likely to improve only gradually. 

The pace of business investment has also been only modest during this recovery, 

and some of the reasons might persist a while longer.  Businesses seem not to have had 

sufficient confidence in the strength and durability of the recovery to undertake 

substantial capital expenditures.  Moreover, some analysts have suggested that 

uncertainty, not only about the strength of the recovery but also about economic policy, 

could be a significant factor.  And the fact that many businesses seem to be holding large 

amounts of cash may suggest that risk aversion is playing a role.   

Weak investment in the energy sector is also likely to persist.  This represents the 

negative side to the fall in oil prices, one being felt by the oil-producing regions of the 

country.  New domestic oil drilling has plunged over the past few months, and we have 

also seen a slowdown in activity in sectors that supply oil production companies, 

including steel and certain types of machinery.  I would add, however, that, on balance, 

the plusses for energy consumers from the fall in oil prices almost surely outweigh the 

minuses.  Remember that we are still a net importer of oil.
