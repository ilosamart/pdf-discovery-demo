 There is certainly something to this explanation.  “Rich” is a relative term.  When 

I was a kid, having a color television was a major status symbol.  Now, most households 

have color TVs, often more than one.  Your sense of how well off you are economically 

depends a great deal on your expectations and aspirations, which in turn are largely 

formed by the community in which you live. 

 Easterlin’s research and interpretation, I think, has some personal application.  We 

all know that getting a better-paying job is one of the main reasons to go to college, and 

achieving economic security for yourself and your family is an important and laudable 

goal.  But if you are ever tempted to go into a field or take a job only because the pay is 

high and for no other reason, be careful!  Having a larger income is exciting at first, but 

as you get used to your new standard of living, and as you associate with other people in 

your new income bracket, the thrill quickly wears off.  Some interesting studies of 

winners of large lottery prizes, even in the millions of dollars, found (as you would 

expect) that they were happy and excited on learning that they had won.  But only six 

months later they reported being not much happier than they were before they won the 

lottery.  The evidence shows that, by itself, money is not enough.  Indeed, taking a high-

paying job only for the money can detract from happiness if it involves spending less 

time with your family, stress, and other such drawbacks. 

 Human adaptability, which I mentioned earlier, also helps to explain the Easterlin 

paradox.  Rich or poor, you tend to get used to your circumstances.  Lottery winners get 

used to being wealthier, and their psychological state may ultimately be not much 

different than it was before buying the winning ticket.  Have you ever said, “If I can just 

do or get X, I’ll be happy”?  “X” might be to graduate, get a promotion, or be named to
