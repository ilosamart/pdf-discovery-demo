With respect to the too-big-to-fail problem, as I noted earlier, actual capital levels 

are substantially higher than before the crisis, and requirements to extend and maintain 

higher levels of capital are on the way.  The regularization and refinement of rigorous 

stress testing may be the single most important supervisory improvement to strengthen 

the resilience of large institutions.  The creation of orderly liquidation authority and the 

process of resolution planning advance prospects for increasing market discipline.  But 

questions remain as to whether all this is enough to contain the problem.  The enduring 

potential fragility of a financial system substantially dependent on short-term wholesale 

funding is especially relevant in considering the impact of severe stress or failure at the 

very large institutions with very large amounts of such funding.   

Concern about the adequacy of policy responses to date is supported by some 

recent research that attempts to quantify the implicit funding subsidy enjoyed by certain 

institutions by looking to such factors as credit ratings uplifts, differentials in interest 

rates paid on deposits or in risk compensation for bank debt and equity, and premia paid 

for mergers that would arguably place the merged firm in the too-big-to-fail category.

The calculation of a precise subsidy is difficult, and each such effort will likely occasion 

substantial disagreement.  But several measures provide at least directionally consistent 

results.

 See, for example, Kenichi Ueda and Beatrice Weder di Mauro (2012), “Quantifying Structural Subsidy 

Values for Systemically Important Financial Institutions,” International Monetary Fund Working Paper 

(May); Stefan Jacewitz and Jonathan Pogach (2013), “Deposit Rate Advantages at the Largest Banks,” 

FDIC Working Paper (April 16);  Dale Gray and Andreas A. Jobst (2010),  “New Directions in Financial 

Sector and Sovereign Risk Management,” Journal of Investment Management, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 23-38; and 

Elijah Brewer II and Julapa Jagtiani (2013), “How Much Did Banks Pay to Become Too-Big-To-Fail and 

to Become Systemically Important?” Journal of Financial Services Research, vol. 43, pp. 1-35.  Estimating 

the exact size of this funding advantage depends on a number of assumptions as well as contemporaneous 

market conditions and is difficult to quantify robustly.  Estimates must consider a number of factors, 

including market participants’ beliefs about the likelihood of an institution’s failure, the value of a 

government bailout of debt holders were it to occur, and the likelihood that the government would actually 

choose to bail out debt holders in the event of a failure.
