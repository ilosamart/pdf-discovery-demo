skill at tracking down the information you don’t have, will be among your most valuable 

assets.  Remember that, sometimes, asking the right questions is just as important as 

knowing the right answers.  And if you get a chance to teach others, take it.  Nothing 

solidifies your understanding of a subject like having to communicate it clearly to others.  

Use everything you have learned so far, take advantage of any educational opportunity 

that comes along, and apply what you learn.  It is one investment that I can guarantee will 

yield an enormous return.
