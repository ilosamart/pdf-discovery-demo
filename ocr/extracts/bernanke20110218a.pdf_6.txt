was, of course, ultimately exposed, at great cost to financial stability and the global

for the past several decades. 

The global financial crisis is receding, but capital flows are once again posing 

some notable challenges for international macroeconomic and financial stability.  These 

capital flows reflect in part the continued two-speed nature of the global recovery, as
