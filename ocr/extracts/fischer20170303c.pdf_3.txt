Friedman.More recently, John Taylor has moved the research agenda forward with his 

eponymous rule, and a large number of academic papers have been written examining the 

effectiveness and robustness of policy rules.4  In contrast, as noted, study of the role of 

committees in making monetary policy has been fairly light, notwithstanding the 

insightful work of Alan Blinder and others.5     

Committees and rules may appear to be in opposition as approaches to 

policymaking.  One might even argue that if a central bank ever converged on a single 

monetary rule, there would be no need for a monetary policy committee.  In practice, the 

Fed operates through a committee structure and considers the recommendations of a 

variety of monetary rules as we make monetary policy decisions.  Our decision is 

typically whether to raise or reduce the federal funds rate or to leave it unchanged.  

Committees can aggregate large amounts of diverse information--not just data, but also 

anecdotes and impressions that would be hard to quantify numerically.  Good committees 

also offer a variety of perspectives and underlying economic models for interpreting the 

economy.  In contrast, a policy rule, strictly defined, is numerical and constrained to a 

single perspective on the economy. 

Committees and rules each have their advantages.  Committees embody a wider 

range of information and have a capacity for innovation.  Rules can simplify central bank 

communications, a particularly important feature in forward-looking models of the 

economy.  In contrast, the diversity of views that makes a committee work can sometimes

monetary policy rules include Orphanides and Williams (2002), Walsh (2009), and Williams (2003).
