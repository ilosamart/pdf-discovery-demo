He concludes the chapter (p.50) by saying that 

the Quantity Theory cannot just be thrown overboard.  …. It 

must be put up with, in the hope that a more intimate analysis of 

the underlying facts might remove the blemishes from which it 

undoubtedly suffers. 

3. The Natural Rate of Interest on Capital and the Rate of Interest on Loans (the 

cumulative process).  We come here to a central and famous part of 

Wicksell’s contribution to monetary economics and policy: 

There is a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in 

respect to commodity prices, and tends neither to raise nor to 

lower them.  This is necessarily the same as the rate of interest 

which would be determined by supply and demand if no use 

were made of money and all lending were effected in the form of 

real capital goods.  It comes to much the same thing to describe it 

as the current value of the natural rate of interest on capital.  

(p.102) 

. . . . . . . . . . . 

At any moment … there is a certain level of the average rate of 

interest which is such that the general level of prices has no 

tendency to move either upwards or downwards.  This we call 

the normal rate of interest.  Its magnitude is determined by the 

current level of the natural capital rate, and rises and falls with it. 


If, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and 

maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap, 

prices will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in 

process of falling, they will fall more slowly and eventually 

begin to rise. 


If, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter 

how little above the current level of the natural rate, prices will 

fall continuously and without limit.  (p.120) 

4. International Price Relationships.  Wicksell explains in Chapter 10 that while 

it would be desirable to subject the theory of policy set out immediately above
