Precisely because of the uncertainty around the course inputs, the right strategy 

was to set a course based on your knowledge of the destination, winds, and performance 

of your plane; communicate that course clearly to air traffic control so everyone knew 

what you were doing; and then stick to that course steadily even as the course needle 

might waver from side to side across your instrument.  If the needle moved to one side 

substantially and stayed there pretty consistently, then you would make a small, firm 

correction--but even then, only gradually and with clear communication about what you 

were doing.  In a world where you had great confidence in the sensitivity of your 

instrument, such as in today’s GPS-based avionics, you could respond immediately to 

moment-to-moment changes in your course readings, but in the world of radio beacons 

and sunspots, “chasing the needles” would at best lead to inefficient fishtailing across the 

sky, and at worst to a substantial deviation from your destination. 

Today uncertainty around many of the macroeconomic inputs to monetary policy 

decisions argues for just the same approach to navigation.  Rather than meaning that 

policy will drift because of this uncertainty, it means that policymakers should chart a 

course that is stable, gradual, and predictable; communicate it clearly; and then follow 

that course through the temporarily shifting and sometimes conflicting signs from the 

economy unless some strong and steady signal requires a firm but moderate correction.  

Given that the economy has performed fundamentally as I expected at the outset of this 

year, the right strategy is to maintain the gradual course that I have thought appropriate 

for some time now.  Put another way, while I think that there is enough reason to think 

that the productive capacity of our economy might be increasing so that we should not 

feel compelled to accelerate our pace, I also think there is enough doubt about current
