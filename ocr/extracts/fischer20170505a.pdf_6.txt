Taylor rule was that it described U.S. monetary policy patterns well over a certain period, 

one that was associated with a reasonable degree of economic stability. 

Nevertheless, central bankers who are aware of the merits of the arguments for 

policy rules have on occasion deviated substantially from the prescriptions of standard 

policy rules.  Further, while the implications of different monetary rules are described in 

the Tealbook and typically referred to in the presentations by several FOMC participants, 

the overall discussion in FOMC meetings is not generally cast in terms of how it relates 

to one version or another of the Taylor or any other rule.  The other set of rules 

mentioned frequently in FOMC discussions are Wicksellian, for there is often a 

discussion of r*, which in some formulations of the Taylor rule is also the constant term. 

The period since 2008 bears testimony to central bankers’ willingness to depart 

from the prescriptions of a pre-specified rule.  In the wake of the financial crisis, 

policymakers found it necessary to follow a more accommodative monetary policy that 

was appropriate for the new economic conditions.12  In addition, structural changes in the 

U.S. economy have apparently lowered the value of the interest rate--that is, 

r*--consistent with neutral policy.13 

Such structural changes were not anticipated in advance.14  Of course, once a 

structural change has occurred and been ascertained by policymakers, they will know 

                                                 
12 See especially Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).  Because the federal funds rate was at its 
effective lower bound from late 2008 to late 2015, policy choices about that rate largely involved decisions 
concerning the forward guidance provided by the FOMC.  These decisions in turn rested on judgments 
regarding the period over which the rate should remain at its lower bound, as well as about the pace and 
magnitude of the subsequent policy firming.

14 Indeed, Milton Friedman’s advocacy of a policy rule consisting of constant monetary growth rested in 
part on the existence of uncertainty, as he suggested that economists lacked the knowledge about economic 
relationships required to improve on that simple rule.  See Friedman (1972) for a concise version of his 
case for the rule and Dornbusch and Fischer (1978, pp. 278-80, 516) for a textbook account of Friedman’s 
rule that emphasized the uncertainty aspect of his argument for the rule.  Of course, the fact that a policy
