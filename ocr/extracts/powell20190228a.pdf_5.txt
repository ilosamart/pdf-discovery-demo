From the standpoint of future Americans, if the slower growth persists for a half-century, 

incomes will end up roughly half of what they would have been.  

Why has growth slowed, and what can we do about it?  To understand the causes 

of the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components:  (1) growth in the 

cumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of 

output derived, on average, from each hour of work.  We refer to output per hour of work 

as “labor productivity.”  From 1991 through 2007, when the economy expanded at a 

3 percent average rate, hours worked increased about 1 percent a year and economy-wide 

productivity grew about 2 percent (figure 5).3  Since 2007, both of these growth factors 

have slowed by about half, with hours worked annually increasing only 0.5 percent from 

2008 to 2018 and productivity rising just 1 percent on average.4   

Growth in hours worked has slowed, in part, because of slower U.S. population 

growth.  Birth rates have edged down, and immigration has slowed.  Not only is the total 

population growing more slowly, but the share of the population in their prime working 

years is falling steadily as the very large baby-boom generation is moving into retirement.  

Demographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise 

in the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now 

contributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy.   

There is another factor contributing to the slower growth in hours, however, and 

this factor is more surprising and more troubling.  To be counted as “in the labor force,” a
