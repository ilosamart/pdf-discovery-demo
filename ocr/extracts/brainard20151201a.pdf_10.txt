against extended periods of below-target inflation, which may lead inflation expectations 

to drift lower. 

 It is thus notable that inflation has been below our 2 percent target for 3 years.   

Current below-target levels of inflation in part reflect disinflationary pressures from 

abroad, including lower import prices and lower commodity prices, which are likely to 

fade over time.  However, inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy 

prices.  Over the 12 months ending in October, core personal consumption expenditures, 

or PCE, prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of food and energy, increased 

1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 

percent since the beginning of 2013.  The persistent weakness in core price inflation 

deserves continued vigilance.  

In determining the outlook for inflation, the gravitational force of long-term 

inflation expectations is especially important.  Some survey measures of inflation 

expectations have declined recently.  For example, the University of Michigan Surveys of 

Consumers median measure of inflation expectations at a 5-to-10 year horizon was 2.6 

percent in November and has averaged 2.7 percent over the past year, slightly below the 

average reading over the past decade of 2.9 percent.  Projections from the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters also suggest that 10-year-ahead inflation expectations edged 

lower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of 

2012.   

Market-based measures of inflation compensation at longer-term horizons, such 

as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury 

bond yields, have declined more noticeably over the past year and a half.  Although it is
