I would like to thank the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia for the 

opportunity to discuss the future of community banking at this annual conference for bank 

officers and directors.  Community banks play an important role in our nation’s financial system, 

and I believe that the future of community banking is bright.  But that is not to say that it will be 

easy.  Success, as always, will require energetic and engaged managers and board members who 

are sensitive to the financial needs of their communities, vigilant to economic conditions, and 

adaptive to changing regulatory requirements.  

I hear from a lot of community bankers who are concerned that the community banking 

model might not survive.  Many paint a picture so bleak that they see only personal retirement or 

sale of the bank as viable strategies.  I completely understand how tiring it is to fight a financial 

crisis and survive a deep recession followed by a weak recovery only to confront what seems to 

be a tsunami of new regulations.   

I felt all of those same emotions in 1991.  I was a community banker then.  We had 

survived the savings and loan crisis with some bruises, but we were still standing.   The Financial 

Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) had been followed by 

the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) in 1991.  I had more new 

regulations stacked on my desk than I had employees in the bank.  My bank had just reached the 

$100 million mark in total assets through the purchase of two branches from a failing thrift.  

Even more daunting for me personally, was the sudden death of my bank’s chief executive 

officer (CEO), leaving me as the new CEO.  Frankly, I didn’t know how I was going to tackle all 

that lay in front of us.  But those dark days in 1991 were followed by 15 years of exceptionally 

strong performance for all banks, including my own.  And those experiences--the good and the 

bad--give me confidence in predicting a bright future for community banking today.
