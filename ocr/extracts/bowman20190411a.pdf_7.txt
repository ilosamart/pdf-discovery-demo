What can the Federal Reserve do to foster prudent community bank innovation? 

I believe that if a bank has not started thinking about how innovation may impact its 

business, it is very late to the game. This does not mean that every bank has to run out this 

afternoon and partner with a fintech firm—there may be all kinds of thoughtful reasons not to 

engage with them. What matters is that banks, particularly community banks, have gone through 

the process of thinking about the relevant issues.18  

But there are many questions about how community banks are adjusting to the changing 

environment. For instance, about 40 percent of community banks say that they do not currently 

offer online loan applications and have no immediate plans to do so.19 That 40 percent may 

represent bankers who have not gone through the process of thinking about the way innovation 

impacts their business. But it could just as easily include bankers who have looked at the issue 

carefully and concluded that online loan applications do not fit within their business model. Most 

importantly, though, it may indicate that some community banks may feel that they are simply 

not able to leverage new technology.  

Most small banks are dependent on partnerships with third parties to make use of new 

technologies.20 I am concerned that some banks are not innovating because they feel they lack 

the ability to navigate the complex regulatory and compliance issues that may arise. Among 

                                                 
18 The National Risk Committee at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) warns that, “[f]ailure to 
appropriately consider innovation and the responsible adoption of technology could pose strategic risk to some 
banks.” See also Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Semiannual Risk Perspective (Washington: OCC, Fall 
2018), https://www.occ.gov/publications/publications-by-type/semiannual-risk-perspective/pub-semiannual-risk-
perspective-fall-2018.pdf.  
 
The OCC has long raised concerns that the strategic risks are particularly acute for community banks as compared to 
large banks that have the resources to fund innovation labs or even purchase mature fintech firms. See, for example,

20 More than two-thirds of respondents to the Conference of State Bank Supervisor’s annual survey of community 
banks reported that they rarely or never rely on in-house technology for online loan applications and other digital 
products. See also CSBS Community Bank Survey in note 5.
