1990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long-run inflation rate, 

which has remained very close to 2 percent.  Remarkably, this stability is estimated to 

have continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the 

unemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981-82 downturn, 

when the trend did shift down markedly.4  As I will discuss, the stability of this trend 

appears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations--measures of 

which appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an 

improvement in the conduct of monetary policy.  In any event, this empirical analysis 

implies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has been much more predictable over the 

longer term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was 

predicted to return no longer moved around appreciably.  That said, inflation still varied 

considerably from year to year in response to various shocks. 

As figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on 

average since the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has 

proven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy.  Overall inflation (shown as the 

dashed red line) has averaged only about 1-1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is 

currently close to zero.  This result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as 

core inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average over this period.

In 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer-run inflation 

objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE price index.5  (Other central banks, 

                                                 
4 Trend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent 
years; see Clark and Bednar (2015).

numerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment.  As discussed in its
