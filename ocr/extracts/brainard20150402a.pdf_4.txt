resulted in the underemployment of others.2  In 2012, roughly 45 percent of college 

graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were underemployed, up by one-third relative to 

2001 and the highest underemployment rate since the early 1990s.3  Moreover, a recent 

study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the Great 

Recession is prolonging the time it takes for a college graduate to settle into a career.4   

Recently, the labor market prospects for young people have started to improve, 

with the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds falling about one-third relative to its 

peak and inflation-adjusted earnings starting to rise.  Nevertheless, even with this recent 

improvement, there is a risk that the high rates of unemployment, low labor force 

attachment, and stagnant wages experienced by those who have come of age in the years 

surrounding the Great Recession may have long-lasting consequences.  A number of 

studies have found that graduating from college during a recession can have a lasting 

effect.  If past studies hold true today, the employment rate of those graduating from 

college during the Great Recession may recover relatively soon, but their earnings may 

be reduced for up to a decade or longer as this cohort initially secures lower-quality jobs 

and then only gradually works its way back up to the normal earnings trajectory.5  To the 

extent that these lost earnings translate into reductions in lifetime resources, they could 

affect life-cycle spending and investment decisions, topics that I will turn to next.
