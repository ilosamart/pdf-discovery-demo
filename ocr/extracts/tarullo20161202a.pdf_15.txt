Moreover, as important as capital is to promoting systemic stability, it is not the only 

relevant consideration.  The relative presence or absence of other regulations that mitigate risk in 

banks should affect minimum capital levels.  To my mind, the most important of these are 

regulations limiting dependence of financial firms on runnable funding sources.16  If a firm is not 

vulnerable to runs, it is far more likely to weather a financial storm without resorting to fire sales 

or cutting off customers from credit, and thus far less likely to wreak havoc on the financial 

system. 

In short, I think it healthy that discussion continues over the right type and levels of 

capital requirements and, more generally, over whether we have the right mix of policies.  To 

that end, here are a few relatively near-term steps that we at the Federal Reserve can take to 

further advance financial stability goals.  First is to continue focused work on making the largest, 

most systemically important firms resolvable in order to minimize both moral hazard and any 

harm that may befall the economy if such a firm were to fail.  This means continued work by the 

Federal Reserve and the FDIC to require these firms to develop their resolution plans and, more 

importantly, modify their organizational structures and day-to-day practices such as liquidity 

management so as to enable an orderly resolution, should it become necessary.  Along these 

lines, I would hope that Congress will move forward with a set of changes to the bankruptcy 

code to facilitate the resolution of large financial firms and, thereby, limit the number of 

instances in which the government would need to use the Title II procedures of Dodd-Frank.  

In the very short term, we will also finalize our rule requiring the most systemically 

important firms to hold a sizeable amount of long-term debt, which would be available to the
