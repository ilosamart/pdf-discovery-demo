financial and informational barriers, and those who do start college are more likely to 

drop out.33   

For many middle-income families, affording post-secondary education means 

taking on a sobering amount of student debt.  Total student loan debt, in inflation-

adjusted terms, more than doubled from 2006 to 2018 (figure 11).34  Repayment of 

student loans can be challenging.  In 2018, 2 in 10 middle-income adults with education 

debt were behind on their payments, and those who did not complete a degree were 

nearly twice as likely to be behind.35  Repayment status also differs by the type of 

institution attended.  Among middle-income adults with education debt, 30 percent who 

attended for-profit institutions were behind on student loan payments, compared with 17 

percent of those who attended public institutions and 12 percent who attended not-for-

profit private institutions. 

Investing in higher education may come at the cost of deferring or forgoing other 

investments.  For example, higher tuition costs—reflected in increasing student loan 

debt—together with the rising costs of homeownership, have left many middle-income 

households in a poor position to save for a down payment or handle a mortgage.  

Researchers at the Fed have estimated that roughly 20 percent of the decline in 

homeownership among young adults can be attributed to their increased student loans
