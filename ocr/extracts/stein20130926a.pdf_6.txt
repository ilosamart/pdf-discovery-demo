degree of confidence.  But I think there is a promising research agenda here, and one that 

owes much to Raghu’s insights.  

With these observations in mind, let me now turn to the events of the past few 

months in the bond market.  A brief summary goes as follows:  Long-term real and 

nominal rates and term premiums in the United States were very low as of early May, 

with the 10-year Treasury yield bottoming out at 1.63 percent at the beginning of the 

month, with an associated term premium estimated to be on the order of negative 

0.80 percent.

  The 10-year TIPS yield reached negative 0.72 percent around the same 

time.

  However, following Chairman Bernanke’s May 22 testimony to the Joint 

Economic Committee and after our June 18-19 FOMC meeting, yields rose sharply, with 

the nominal and real 10-year rates reaching 2.61 percent and 0.60 percent, respectively, 

as of June 25.

In the absence of a significant shift in policy fundamentals, a number of observers 

have highlighted the role of a variety of market dynamics in driving the observed changes 

in yields.  These factors include the unwinding of carry trades, tightening of risk limits in 

the face of higher volatility, convexity hedging by holders of mortgage-backed securities, 

and large outflows from bond funds.  I believe these factors to have been important

The 10-year nominal rate hit 1.63 percent on May 2, 2013.  The Kim-Wright term premium was estimated 

to be negative 0.78 percent on this day.  (For more information on the term premium, see Don H. Kim and
