Good morning.  Itâ€™s a great pleasure to be with you, and I want to thank the 

Center for Financial Policy at the Robert H. Smith School of Business for inviting me to 

participate in this forum.  Indeed, I am delighted to see that the Center for Financial 

Policy is already thriving.  Back in 2008, when I was the Commissioner of Financial 

Regulation for the State of Maryland, two of the founders of the center talked with me 

about its inception and asked for my ideas about what it might accomplish.  And I am so 

glad to see that--despite the formidable challenges facing all such new projects--the 

center is now fully engaged in addressing financial policy issues that are critically 

important to our nation.   

Today I want to discuss how monetary policy can promote the objective of 

maximum employment in a context of price stability.

jargon, but feel free to correct me if I lapse back into it--my children certainly do.  Of 

course, it goes without saying that these remarks are intended to express my views only 

and not necessarily the opinions of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

downward sharply in the autumn of 2008 when the financial crisis intensified, resulting in 

the worst recession in many decades.  By the end of 2009, the unemployment rate
