based capital requirements.  The agencies’ rules also incorporate other methods for 
assessing risk-based capital requirements, including the use of NRSRO ratings. 

 The agencies are considering a wide range of approaches of varying complexity 
and risk-sensitivity for developing credit-worthiness standards for the risk-based capital 
standards.  These include developing risk weights for exposure categories based on 
objective criteria established by regulators, similar to the current risk-bucketing approach 
of the general risk-based capital rules.  The approaches also include developing broad 
qualitative and quantitative credit-worthiness standards that banking organizations could 
use, subject to supervisory oversight, to measure the credit risk associated with exposures 
within a particular exposure category.  These general approaches present certain 
advantages and disadvantages.  In considering these approaches, the agencies will 
evaluate the extent to which the alternatives meet the principles described above. 

 Risk Weights Based on Exposure Category:  One way to eliminate references to 
credit ratings in the risk-based capital standards would be for the agencies to delete all of 
the sections in their risk-based capital regulations that refer to credit ratings and retain the 
remainder of the general risk-based capital rules.  Under this approach, all non-
securitization exposures generally would receive a 100 percent risk-weight unless 
otherwise specified.  For example, certain sovereign and bank exposures would be 
assigned a zero percent or a 20 percent risk weight, respectively.  Alternatively, the 
agencies could revise the risk-weight categories for exposures by considering the type of 
obligor, for example, sovereign, bank, public sector entity (PSE),18 as well as considering 
other criteria, such as the characteristics of the exposure, which could increase the risk 
sensitivity of the risk-based capital requirements by providing a wider range of risk-
weight categories.  

 Exposure-Specific Risk Weights:  Under this approach, banking organizations 
could assign risk weights to individual exposures using specific qualitative and 
quantitative credit risk measurement standards established by the agencies for various 
exposure categories.  Such standards would be based on broad credit-worthiness metrics.  
For instance, exposures could be assigned a risk weight based on certain market-based 
measures, such as credit spreads; obligor-specific financial data, such as debt-to-equity 
ratios; or other sound underwriting criteria.  Alternatively, banking organizations could 
assign exposures to one of a limited number of risk weight categories based on an 
assessment of the exposure’s probability of default or expected loss.   

 As part of an exposure-specific approach, the agencies are considering whether 
banking organizations should be permitted to contract with third-party service providers 
to obtain quantitative data, such as probabilities of default, as part of their process for 
making credit-worthiness determinations and assigning risk weights.  While this method 
could increase risk sensitivity, consistent application across exposure categories and 
across banking organizations could be more difficult to achieve.   

                                                 
18 A PSE exposure is an exposure to a state, local authority, or other government subdivision below the 
sovereign entity level.
