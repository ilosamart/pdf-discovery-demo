This consideration raises the question I mentioned a moment ago.  Should we 

think of this supply-side damage as permanent or temporary?  In many previous episodes 

around the world, post-crisis reductions in output have proved permanent.  Nonetheless, 

it seems plausible that at least part of the damage can be reversed.  As business 

confidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with 

an extended spell of unemployment.  A stronger job market and rising wages may 

encourage more potential workers to join the labor force.14  Over a longer period, 

stronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity.  A 

long expansion could also produce higher productivity as companies strive to get more 

out of every dollar of capital and hour of work and as the strong economy encourages 

entrepreneurship and innovation.   

To give us the best chance to recover lost ground, we need policies that support 

labor force participation, business and household confidence, hiring and investment, and 

productivity growth--policies, I hasten to add, that are, for the most part, outside the remit 

of the Federal Reserve.  Monetary policy also has a role to play by continuing to support 

the expansion as long as inflation expectations remain stable and realized inflation stays 

close to our 2 percent objective.  Indeed, in the current circumstances, accommodative 

policy may not only help restore some of our economyâ€™s potential, but should also help 

return inflation to our 2 percent objective more expeditiously.   

There is no risk-free path for monetary policy.  The biggest risk of tightening too 

early or too fast is that the economy may weaken more than expected, forcing the central 

bank to reverse course.  The record of central banks lifting off from the zero lower bound 

14 In fact, as the recovery has progressed, the labor force participation rate and other broad indicators have 
moved back toward their longer-run trends.
