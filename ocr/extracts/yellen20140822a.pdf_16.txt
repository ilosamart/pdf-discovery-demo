grappling with as the recovery continues.  There is no simple recipe for appropriate 

policy in this context, and the FOMC is particularly attentive to the need to clearly 

describe the policy framework we are using to meet these challenges.  As the FOMC has 

noted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our 

assessments of how far we are from our objectives of maximum employment and 

2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress toward those 

objectives.   

At the FOMC’s most recent meeting, the Committee judged, based on a range of 

labor market indicators, that “labor market conditions improved.”20  Indeed, as I noted 

earlier, they have improved more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated.  

Nevertheless, the Committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains 

significant.  Given this assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will 

gradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view 

“that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds 

rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if 

projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and 

provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”21  But if progress 

in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated by the Committee or if 

inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward 

our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than 

the Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter.  Of course, if
