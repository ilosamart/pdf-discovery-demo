lower bound.  This is the point where “many instruments” enters the discussion.  The 

main tools for the FOMC have been forward guidance on the future path of the federal 

funds rate and large-scale asset purchases.   

The objective of forward guidance is to affect expectations about how long the 

highly accommodative stance of the policy interest rate will be maintained as conditions 

improve.  By lowering private-sector expectations of the future path of short-term rates, 

this guidance can reduce longer-term interest rates and also raise asset prices, in turn, 

stimulating aggregate demand.  Absent such forward guidance, the public might expect 

the federal funds rate to follow a path suggested by past FOMC behavior in “normal 

times”--for example, the behavior captured by John Taylor’s famous Taylor rule.  I am 

persuaded, however, by the arguments laid out by our panelist Michael Woodford and 

others suggesting that the policy rate should, under present conditions, be held “lower for 

longer” than conventional policy rules imply.   

I see these ideas reflected in the FOMC’s recent policy.  Since September 2012, 

the FOMC has stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain 

appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  Since 

December 2012, the Committee has said it intends to hold the federal funds rate near zero 

at least until unemployment has declined below 6-1/2 percent, provided that inflation 

between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point 

above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations 

continue to be well anchored.  I believe that the clarity of this commitment to 

accommodation will itself support spending and employment and help to strengthen the 

recovery.
