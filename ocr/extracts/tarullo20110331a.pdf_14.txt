Given the surprisingly small number of studies on this issue, one might reasonably be reluctant 

to draw conclusions in either direction. 

While proposals to break up large, complicated financial firms did not win the day, the 

issue of what economies and, possibly, diseconomies of scope and scale attach to these 

institutions remains very relevant today.  Consider, for example, that measures designed to 

contain systemic risk associated with these firms will create incentives and disincentives for 

them.  Agencies will be much better positioned to make cost-benefit assessments of different 

regulatory approaches if they have a solid foundation of analytic work that helps them 

understand when and why firms do or do not need a certain size or scope to serve useful capital 

allocation roles.  There is also need for more study of the dynamics by which stress at large, 

interconnected institutions can have negative effects on national and global financial systems.  In 

fact, what may be needed is a new subdiscipline that combines the perspectives of industrial 

organization economics with finance.  Without work of this sort, it may be difficult to fashion the 

optimally strong, sensible, post-crisis regulatory regime. 

Conclusion 

 Even when the crisis was at its apex, students of history recognized that the momentum 

for reform of the financial system that was then so strong could fade quickly.  Legislators and 

officials move on to other issues, as does the public.  There is some reason to believe this waning 

of interest and support has already occurred.  The reform agenda that variously includes Basel 

III, administrative implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other initiatives continues, to be 

sure.  But, particularly with respect to the shadow financial system, there is much that remains to 

be done.
