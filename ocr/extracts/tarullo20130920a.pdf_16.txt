3.  Time-Varying Measures Will Play a More Limited Role.  Some discussions of 

macroprudential policy appear to contemplate a somewhat regular adjustment – up and 

down – of both resiliency and lean-against-the-wind measures.  The idea is to proceed in 

an intentionally countercyclical fashion by attempting to restrain rapid, unsustainable 

increases in credit extension or asset prices and to relax those restraints as economic 

conditions deteriorate.  This is a conceptually appealing approach, but, as various 

commentators on macroprudential policy options have noted, one that raises a fair 

number of significant issues: the reliability of measures of excess or systemic risk, the 

appropriate officials to be making macroprudential decisions, the speed with which 

measures might realistically be implemented and take effect, and the right calibration of 

measures that will be effective in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing 

well-underwritten credit flows in the economy.   

If the measures are designed to be targeted, questions of efficacy may be raised by 

those who believe that suppression of excess credit or asset price increases in one sector 

will likely result only in the redirection of credit and speculation to other sectors until 

underlying macroeconomic and financial conditions have ceased enabling such activities.  

If, on the other hand, the measures are designed to be fairly broad-based, the more basic 

question of the appropriate role of monetary policy may be raised by those who are 

focused on reactive policies that “get in all the cracks” of the financial system, not just 

the heavily regulated portion occupied  by large financial firms. 

Finally, we should probably be skeptical as to how effective a macroprudential 

relaxation of regulatory requirements can be on the downside of economic cycles.  

Market discipline, which may have been lax in boom years, tends to become very strict
