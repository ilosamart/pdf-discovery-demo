perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17  Although these factors may 

help explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, our 

understanding of the forces driving long-run trends in interest rates is nevertheless 

limited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain.18   

Would an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed’s ability to 

fight recessions?  Based on the FOMC’s behavior in past recessions, one might think that 

such a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness.  As shown in the 

first column of the table in the handout, during the past nine recessions, the FOMC cut 

the federal funds rate by amounts ranging from about 3 percentage points to more than 

10 percentage points.  On average, the FOMC reduced rates by about 5-1/2 percentage 

points, which seems to suggest that the FOMC would face a shortfall of about 

2-1/2 percentage points for dealing with an average-sized recession.  But this simple 

comparison exaggerates the limitations on policy created by the zero lower bound.  As 

shown in the second column, the federal funds rate at the start of the past seven 

recessions was appreciably above the level consistent with the economy operating at 

potential in the longer run.  In most cases, this tighter-than-normal stance of policy before
