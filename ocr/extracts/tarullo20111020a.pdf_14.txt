In sum, I do not think arguments suggesting that structural factors account for 

most of the increase in unemployment are persuasive, either individually or collectively.  

Our efforts to quantify the increase in structural unemployment since the onset of the 

recession find that it accounts for less than one-fourth of the difference between todayâ€™s 

unemployment rate and that which prevailed in the pre-crisis years.  

Before leaving this subject, I want to mention a different version of the structural 

unemployment argument, which is the concern that high unemployment today will result 

in an increase in structural unemployment in the future--a form of the phenomenon 

known as hysteresis.  The unusually long duration of unemployment spells and high 

fraction of the labor force unemployed for more than six months raise the prospect that 

the long-term unemployed will become progressively less employable as their skills, 

reputations, and networks deteriorate.  That is, the distinction between cyclical and 

structural unemployment may begin to blur.  In the aggregate, such effects could result in 

a persistently higher level of structural unemployment, a persistently lower rate of labor 

force participation, and a concomitant decline in the level of potential output of the entire 

economy.  Whole cadres of workers, whether younger people leaving school at a time of 

high unemployment or older workers losing long-time jobs, might never regain the career 

trajectory on which they were headed. 

In the past, such effects do not appear to have been very significant in the United 

States, and there is little evidence that they have taken hold today.  But the current 

unprecedented durations of unemployment may reduce the relevance of historical 

experience.  Even if the rise in structural unemployment is relatively modest to date, the 

longer the labor market remains weak, the greater the risk that structural unemployment
