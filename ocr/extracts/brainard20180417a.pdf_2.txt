Good afternoon everyone.  I want to take a moment to thank you for giving us such great 

insights into all the important work that is taking place here in the neighborhoods of Baltimore.1  

Every few months, I try to get out to some of the areas of the country where our Reserve Banks 

are engaged with community members, community development institutions, businesses, banks, 

and schools in efforts to create more vibrant communities.  I last had the pleasure of visiting 

Baltimore with community development staff from the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank in 2015.  

Each visit teaches me so much more about the complexity of the challenges you face, the 

creativity of the solutions you devise, and ultimately the determination you all demonstrate to lift 

up the lives of all community members in this city.  Collectively, as community development 

professionals, concerned residents, and community partners, I can see the considerable progress 

you are making in the neighborhoods of Baltimore, although of course there is still plenty of 

work to be done.   

We, at the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, recognize 

the unique challenges Baltimore faces, and we are committed to remaining focused on this city 

and to partnering where that can be helpful.  Baltimore and its residents deserve a more 

prosperous and equitable future.  I am pleased that the Federal Reserveâ€™s Community 

Development team has been supporting your work and helping to convene collaborative 

endeavors, such as the Symposium on Workforce Transportation that occurred in February, and 

cross-state learning exchanges that connect community development leaders from Maryland and 

the Carolinas.
