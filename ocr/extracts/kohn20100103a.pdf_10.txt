have no experience with most of the sorts of actions the Federal Reserve has taken to 

counter the shock.  The calibration of our exit from these policies is complicated by a 

paucity of evidence on how unconventional policies work.  We will need to be flexible 

and adjust as we gain experience.  

 Financial stability and asset prices.  The past few years have illustrated two 

lessons about the relationship between macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  

First, macroeconomic stability doesnâ€™t guarantee financial stability; indeed, in some 

circumstances, macroeconomic stability may foster financial instability by lulling people 

into complacency about risks.  And second, some shocks to the financial system are so 

substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries, that decreases 

in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or easily remedied by 

conventional monetary policy.   

 Given the heavy costs that have resulted from the financial crisis, the question 

naturally arises as to whether the circumstances that caused the crisis could have been 

avoided.  Among other crucial policy issues, we now need to reexamine, with open 

minds, whether conventional monetary policy should be used in the future to address 

developing financial imbalances as well as the traditional medium-term macroeconomic 

goals of full employment and price stability.  The key question is whether we are likely to 

know enough about asset price misalignments and the likely effects of policy adjustments 

to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away for a time from exclusive pursuit of 

fostering aggregate price stability and high employment.  Obviously preventing situations 

like the current one would be very beneficial.  But against this important objective we 

need to balance the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary
