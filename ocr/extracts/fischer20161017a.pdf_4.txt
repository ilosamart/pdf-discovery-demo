issue warnings--successful warnings--about the dangers of excessive leveraged lending, 

and concerns about financial stability are clearly on the minds of some members of the 

Federal Open Market Committee, FOMC.     

Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than 

current rates.  But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because 

of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our 

dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the 

rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) being at 

our target level of 2 percent. 

That the actual federal funds rate has to be so low for the Fed to meet its 

objectives suggests that the equilibrium interest rate--that is, the federal funds rate that 

will prevail in the longer run, once cyclical and other transitory factors have played out--

has fallen.2  Let me turn now to my main focus, namely an assessment of why the 

equilibrium interest rate is so low. 

To frame this discussion, it is useful to think about the real interest rate as the 

price that equilibrates the economy’s supply of saving with the economy’s demand for 

investment.  To explain why interest rates are low, we look for factors that are boosting 

saving, depressing investment, or both.3  For those of you lucky enough to remember the 

economics you learned many years ago, we are looking at a point that is on the IS curve--

                                                 
2 More formally, my Federal Reserve colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003) have 
developed a statistical procedure that decomposes the movement in interest rates into the contribution of 
long-run and short-run factors.  They conclude that the long-run component of the level of the real federal 
funds rate is currently very low--around 1/4 percent--compared with a pre-2000 average of 2-1/2 percent. 
Other assessments have reached similar conclusions.  See Holston, Laubach, and Williams (forthcoming); 
Johannsen and Mertens (2016); and Kiley (2015).  However, it is important to note that there is a great deal 
of statistical uncertainty around all of these estimates. 
3 While the analysis that follows relates to interest rates in the long run, these factors are also important 
determinants of interest rates in the short run.
