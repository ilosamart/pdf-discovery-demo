less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low.  This limitation is a 

potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may 

require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full 

employment at a satisfactory pace.10  For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation 

objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent 

with the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11 

An unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly 

because it increases the debt burdens of borrowers.  Consider homeowners who take out a 

conventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to 

2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year.  If the economy 

were instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining 

nominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more 

difficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated.  

Moreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected, 

then the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated.  This situation, 

which is sometimes referred to as “debt deflation,” would also confront all households 

with outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that 

                                                 
10 For example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession 
would have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison, 
the average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009.  Of 
course, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional 
downward pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however, 
those policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest 
rate policy.  See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford 
(2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates 
have on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns.  In addition, see 
English, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based 
analyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance in 
mitigating the effects of the zero lower bound.  Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of 
employing large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013).
