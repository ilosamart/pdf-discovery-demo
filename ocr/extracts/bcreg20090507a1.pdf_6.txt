evidence that their estimated loss rates were appropriate.

The indicative loss rate ranges were derived using a variety of methods for predicting loan 

losses, including analysis of historical loss experience at large BHCs and quantitative models relating the 

performance of loans or groups of loans to macroeconomic variables. Supervisors viewed these 

indicative ranges as useful indicators of industry loss rates and in that way they can serve as a general 

guide, but recognized that they might not adequately capture differences across individual firms that 

could affect the performance and losses in significant ways. Thus, supervisors asked firms to provide 

granular data about the particular characteristics of their portfolios in order to make more tailored 

quantitative assessments of loss. Loss estimates for the SCAP thus relied ultimately on firm-specific 

information about factors such as past performance, origination year, borrower characteristics, and 

geographic distribution. 

II.B. Aggregate Loss Estimates 

The two-year loss estimates total close to $600 billion in the more adverse scenario for the 19 

BHCs (table 2). Estimated SCAP losses on residential mortgages are substantial over the two-year 

scenario, consistent wi th the sharp drop in residential house prices in the past two years and their 

projected continued steep fall in the more adverse scenario. Expected loss rates on first-liens and 

second/junior liens are well outside the historical experience of commercial banks. The effects of 

reduced home prices on household wealth and the indirect effects through reduced economic activity, 

also push up estimated losses on consumer credit, including losses on credit cards and on other 

consumer loans. Together, residential mortgages and consumer loans (including credit card and other
