education course, taught by the staff of San Diego City College, to younger enlisted 

soldiers--mostly men in their early 20s.  We surveyed them about their financial history 

and activities at the time of the course, and we did follow-up surveys in 2008 and 2009 of 

both servicemembers who had participated in the course and soldiers who had not.  We 

found that soldiers who had taken the course were more likely to make smart financial 

choices, such as comparison shopping for major purchases, saving for retirement, and 

educating themselves about money management.  They were less likely to make 

questionable financial decisions, like paying overdraft fees, taking out car title loans, and 

continually running credit card balances.  Making good, well-thought-out financial 

decisions can make all the difference to your financial future.
