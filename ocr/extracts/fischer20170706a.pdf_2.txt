I want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth.  Labor productivity is the 

amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job.  Increases in labor 

productivity--again, thatâ€™s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the 

job--are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows, and how fast 

the average standard of living grows.  And productivity growth can be influenced by 

government policy, about which I also want to say a few words.1   

Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year, but it is possible to 

discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth, as shown in 

figure 1.  For example, labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3-1/4 percent 

from 1948 to 1973, whereas in the period 1974 to 2016, the average growth rate of 

productivity was about 1.7 percent.  That is to say that, with the important exception of 

the information technology (IT) boom beginning in the mid-1990s, the U.S. economy has 

been in a low-productivity growth period since 1974.  The record for the past five years 

has been particularly dismal.   

How much does productivity growth matter?  A great deal.  The person who made 

that clear, in an article published in 1957, 60 years ago, Professor Robert Solow, is here 

tonight.  That is a pleasure, an honor, a joy, and something of a difficulty for anyone 

wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master.   

The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic 

determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods.2  To

2 One needs also to recognize that changes in either the average workweek or the employment to population 
ratio may damp or augment the effect of labor productivity on GDP per capita.
