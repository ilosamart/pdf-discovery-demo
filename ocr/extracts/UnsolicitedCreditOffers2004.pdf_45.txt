database characterized about 8 percent of the total of cases received as “new account” 
credit card fraud.31 This smaller number is closer to the narrow definition of identity 
theft used by financial institutions. 

Another study released by the FTC contains some estimates of the absolute magnitude of 
identity theft.32 Using a nationwide consumer survey, the FTC found that about 1.5 
percent of respondents said that they had been victims of new-account and other sorts of 
identity fraud in the past year. The cases included misuse of identifying information 
when someone is charged with a crime, for renting an apartment, or when obtaining 
medical care, and excluded the misuse of credit card numbers on existing accounts. 
However, the incidence of fraud rose to 4.7 percent of respondents when the previous 
five years are included. According to the study, 4.7 percent represents about 10 million 
individuals, not all of them, of course, victims of credit card fraud.33 Some of them 
experienced more than one type of identity theft over this period, and the survey results 
refer to the most serious incident reported. 

Prescreening and Identity Theft 

For the purposes of this report, the question is not how much identity theft occurs but 
rather how much is due to crimes involving prescreened solicitations for new accounts. 
There is only very limited specific information available about this volume, but it seems 
that, for a number of reasons, identity theft crimes arising from prescreened solicitations 
account for only a small amount of identity theft under either a broad or narrow definition 
of the crime. 

First, prescreened solicitations typically do not contain information of a sensitive nature 
that would be useful to a thief. The primary information that would become available to 
a thief is the recipient’s name and mailing address, along with, of course, the information 
that the intended recipient is considered creditworthy by someone. The recipient’s name 
and address are available from many sources, including the telephone book, mailing lists, 
the Internet, and even other mail that might also be stolen, including such mundane items 
as bills, newspapers, and magazines. In addition, evidence of creditworthiness is less 
than a striking revelation about most members of the population because most are 
creditworthy to some degree.34

33 This study separates crimes involving existing credit card accounts from other cases of identity 

fraud, but it does not specifically identify fraud involving new credit card accounts. 
34 The consumer survey results discussed above suggest that as many as 85 percent of households are 

sufficiently creditworthy to receive prescreened solicitations for credit cards. Some of the remainder have 
opted out. As noted earlier, credit scores indicate that more than 73 percent of consumers in the Board 
sample of credit reports would be regarded prime borrowers in many credit programs.
