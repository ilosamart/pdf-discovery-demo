nonbank financial firms has been stable. That said, there are indications that the use of 

leverage has been increasing at some institutions; for example, margin credit provided by 

dealers to equity investors such as hedge funds has expanded.

Reserve has implemented a framework of rules and supervision that requires large, 

interconnected banking organizations to hold substantial capital and liquidity buffers.  

This framework requires banks to be forward looking in their capital decisions and to be 

prepared for the possibility of severely stressed conditions occurring.  The framework is
