banks have reduced existing lines of credit sharply and tightened their standards and 

terms for new credit.  In addition, banks with capital positions that have been eroded by 

losses or those with limited access to capital markets may be reducing risky assets to

information acquired through repeated interactions over time.  When existing lending 

relationships are broken, time may be required for other banks to establish and build such 

relationships, allowing lending to resume.  

The reduction in the availability of credit, however, is not the whole story.  There 

is also less demand for credit.  As businesses reduced inventory levels and capital 

spending, they tended to pay down debt and build cash positions.  Moreover, large firms 

replaced bank debt by accessing the bond market in considerable volume last year.  Even 

small businesses, in a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, report
