conventional monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on the federal funds 

rate, leaving unconventional tools as the only means of providing further monetary 

accommodation.   

However, certain factors could be constraining the channels through which 

monetary policy accommodation affects the economy.  In particular, many small 

businesses appear to be facing unusual obstacles in obtaining credit.  If times were more 

typical, we would expect a smooth transmission in which lower interest rates would fuel 

credit expansion that would be used to finance expanding payrolls, capital investment, 

inventories, and other short-term operating expenses.  Nonetheless, the latest Federal 

Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which was 

taken in October, indicated that although domestic banks continued to ease standards on 

their commercial and industrial loans, the net fraction reporting easing on such loans to 

smaller firms (those with annual sales of less than $50 million) remained low.1  

Moreover, in recent quarters the fraction easing standards for smaller firms generally has 

been below that for loans to large and middle-sized firms.  In its November survey, the 

National Federation of Independent Business continued to indicate a sizable proportion of 

small businesses reporting that credit has become more difficult to obtain.2  These 

businesses not only expect credit to become tighter in coming months but--like other 

businesses--remain concerned about the broader economic outlook.
