Of course, there is considerable variation in how Fed policy actions--whether 

easing or tightening--affect the output of different foreign economies.  Economies with 

more open capital accounts and that keep their exchange rate relatively stable against the 

dollar experience larger positive effects on their GDP of an expansionary Fed monetary 

policy action.  The larger positive spillovers reflect the fact that their own interest rates 

move more in lockstep with U.S. interest rates, while the effects on their traded goods 

sector from the exchange rate channel are smaller.  For example, Hong Kong, which has 

pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate since 1983, is an extreme 

illustration of an economy in which Fed actions pass through almost one to one to 

domestic interest rates.  Conversely, spillovers from U.S. policy actions tend to be 

smaller to economies that have flexible exchange rates and adjust their policy rates based 

on domestic conditions; or, alternatively, to economies with less open capital accounts 

such as China.  

Most of the advanced foreign economies eventually welcomed the positive 

spillovers to their domestic output that were due to U.S. unconventional monetary policy 

easing.  Because these economies generally experienced slower recoveries than the 

United States as well as undesirably low inflation, their central banks also wanted to 

pursue highly accommodative policies and took complementary actions--including 

forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases--to spur economic recovery.      

By contrast, the Fed’s monetary easing presented the EMEs with more difficult 

tradeoffs.  Output in many EMEs expanded rapidly during the recovery from the global 

financial crisis, fueled by strong capital inflows and a boom in oil and commodity prices.  

Given that the Fed’s easing raised equity prices and strengthened the demand for risky
