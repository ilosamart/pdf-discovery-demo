tighter fiscal policy, and the prospect for disruptive events on the fiscal front.7  I 

supported the decision as a reasonable exercise in risk management.  Events since the 

September meeting suggest that the concerns regarding fiscal matters were well founded. 

I would like to push back against the narrative that the decision at the September 

meeting has damaged the Committee’s communications strategy.  In its communications, 

the Committee seeks to influence market conditions over the medium term in a way that 

is consistent with its policy intentions.  As I suggested earlier, as we navigate this 

unprecedented transition back to more normal policy, there may be volatility in the short 

run.  And we will continually strive to improve our communications and avoid surprises.  

But, at the end of the day, my own judgment is that market expectations are now better 

aligned with Committee assessments and intentions.   

The September decision underscored the Committee’s intention to determine the 

pace of purchases in a data-dependent way based on progress toward our objectives.  

Moreover, the modest net tightening in financial conditions since the June meeting has 

likely reduced the prevalence of highly leveraged, speculative positions.  I believe that 

the market is now prepared for a reduction in purchases when the economic outlook and 

the broader situation support it.   

Short term rates have fallen back since the September meeting, and are now better 

aligned with the Committee’s forward rate guidance.  This is particularly important 

because, as the Chairman stressed in September, the Committee views rate policy as its 

stronger and more reliable tool.
