The Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchase Program 
 
 
 

Remarks by 
 

Janet L. Yellen 
 

Vice Chair  
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at 
 

The Brimmer Policy Forum, Allied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting 
 

Denver, Colorado 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

January 8, 2011 






I am delighted to participate in this Brimmer Policy Forum, not least because this 

year marks the 45th anniversary of Andrew’s appointment by President Johnson as a 

Governor of the Federal Reserve Board.  Andrew’s ongoing work in organizing this 

annual forum reflects his long-standing commitment to fostering economic analysis and 

public discourse on key policy issues.   

In my remarks today, I will discuss the rationale for the decision by the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) in November to initiate a new program of asset 

purchases, and I will address some frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding the 

program’s economic and financial effects both here and abroad.1  The purpose of the new 

asset purchase program, like all of the monetary policy actions taken by the FOMC since 

the onset of the global financial crisis, is to fulfill our congressionally mandated 

objectives of promoting maximum employment and price stability.  In pursuit of these 

goals, the FOMC brought the target federal funds rate down close to zero by late 2008; 

conducted large-scale purchases of longer-term securities during 2009 and early 2010; 

and, last summer, modified its reinvestment policy to keep the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet from shrinking as mortgage-related securities matured or were redeemed.  In early 

November, the Committee announced that it intends to purchase an additional 

$600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year. 


                                                 
1 These remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of any other member of the FOMC.  
I appreciate assistance from members of the Board staff--David Bowman, James Clouse, William English, 
Andrew Figura, Steven Kamin, Yuriy Kitsul, Andrew Levin, Fabio Natalucci, David Reifschneider, Clara 
Vega, William Wascher, and David Wilcox--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks.

The Rationale for the Asset Purchase Program 

Macroeconomic Conditions 

To understand the rationale for our asset purchase program, it is helpful to review 

the evolution of macroeconomic conditions over the past several years.  The National 

Bureau of Economic Research has dated the recession as having begun in December 

2007, but the pace of economic contraction accelerated in the wake of the Lehman 

Brothers collapse in September 2008 and the ensuing disruption to global financial 

markets.  As shown in figure 1, the unemployment rate rose from around 5 percent in the 

spring of 2008 to about 10 percent by the autumn of 2009 and has stayed well above 

9 percent since then.  Most observers, including myself, judge this level of 

unemployment to be much higher than levels consistent with full employment and stable 

inflation.  For example, in a recent Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the median estimate of the current level of 

structural unemployment--often referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of 

unemployment (NAIRU)--stood at about 5-3/4  percent, implying that the unemployment 

gap is nearly 4 percentage points. 

In addition, a historically large fraction of the unemployed have been out of a job 

for a very long time.  For example, roughly 4 percentage points of today’s unemployment 

rate reflects individuals who have been unemployed for half a year or more.  Those who 

experience an extended period of unemployment face a risk of losing their ability to 

participate successfully in the workforce, lending additional urgency to the task of 

reviving the demand for labor.

Such low rates of resource utilization are typically accompanied by falling 

inflation.  And, indeed, as shown in figure 2, measures of inflation for personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE) have declined significantly since 2008.  For the total 

PCE inflation rate, the underlying trend is obscured to some extent by large swings in 

energy prices.  However, the downward trend is clearly evident from the evolution of 

core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy.  The 12-month 

change in core PCE prices dropped from about 2-1/2 percent in mid-2008 to around 

1-1/2 percent in 2009 and declined further to less than 1 percent by late 2010.2   

As inflation has trended downward, measures of underlying inflation have fallen 

somewhat below the levels of about 2 percent or a bit less that most Committee 

participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with the FOMC’s dual mandate.  

In particular, a modest positive rate of inflation over time allows for a slightly higher 

average level of nominal interest rates, thereby creating more scope for the FOMC to 

respond to adverse shocks.  A modest positive inflation rate also reduces the risk that 

such shocks could result in deflation, which can be associated with poor macroeconomic 

performance.   

Of course, if incoming information last autumn had been pointing to greater 

momentum in the prospects for economic growth or to a rapid escalation in inflation, then 

the case for further monetary policy easing might have seemed less pressing.  However, 

such was not the case.  The Federal Reserve publishes a Summary of Economic 

                                                 
2 This downward trend in inflation has not been confined to any specific sectors of the economy, such as 
housing.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas constructs a trimmed-mean rate of PCE 
inflation by removing the tails of the distribution of monthly price changes for disaggregated spending 
categories.  That measure of underlying inflation has also declined fairly steadily since mid-2008 and 
dipped slightly below 1 percent last autumn.  Moreover, diffusion indexes of price changes--which subtract 
the percentage of items in the consumption basket with price increases from the percentage of items with 
price decreases--also fell noticeably over this period, providing further evidence that the decline in inflation 
has been widespread across many categories of consumer spending.

Projections (SEP) four times a year in conjunction with the FOMC minutes.  As shown in 

the November SEP, most Committee participants anticipated that the economy would 

recover only gradually and projected that the unemployment rate would still be at around 

8 percent at the end of 2012--an outlook that is shared by most outside forecasters.  

Similarly, Committee participants generally expected inflation to rise very gradually 

toward levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate.  Moreover, continuing 

downside risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation strengthened the case 

for providing additional monetary policy accommodation, thereby reducing the risk of 

another downturn in economic activity or a further decline in inflation.   

The Design of the Asset Purchase Program  

In weighing its policy options last autumn, the Committee gave careful 

consideration to the question of whether further purchases of longer-term Treasury 

securities were likely to be effective in fostering economic recovery and bringing 

inflation back up to levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate.3  In my 

judgment, both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence suggested that such purchases 

could provide effective stimulus by keeping longer-term interest rates lower than they 

would otherwise be.  

The underlying theory, in which asset prices are directly linked to the outstanding 

quantity of assets, dates back to the early 1950s.4  For example, in preferred-habitat 

models, short- and long-term assets are imperfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios, and 

                                                 
3 As indicated in the minutes of the November FOMC meeting, the Committee has also considered the 
potential costs and benefits of setting a peg for a term interest rate.  While targeting the yield on a term 
security could be an effective way to reduce longer-term interest rates, such an approach might require the 
Federal Reserve to make an open-ended commitment to purchasing longer-term securities. 
4 Examples include Culbertson (1957), Tobin (1958), and Modigliani and Sutch (1966); see also Vayanos 
and Vila (2009).

the effect of arbitrageurs is limited by their risk aversion or by market frictions such as 

capital constraints.  Consequently, the term structure of interest rates can be influenced 

by exogenous shocks in supply and demand at specific maturities.  Purchases of longer-

term securities by the central bank can be viewed as a shift in supply that tends to push up 

the prices and drive down the yields on those securities. 

In the context of such an analytical framework, the effect of an asset purchase 

program also depends on investors’ perceptions of the future path of short-term interest 

rates as well as their perceptions of the timing and pace of the central bank’s eventual 

unwinding of its asset purchases.  Thus, central bank communication may play a key role 

in influencing the financial market response to such a program. 

Recent empirical work provides a rough gauge of the quantitative effects of 

longer-term securities purchases.5  For example, event studies have investigated the 

short-term response of asset prices to announcements by the Federal Reserve and the 

Bank of England regarding their respective asset purchase programs.  And regression 

analysis has been used to estimate statistical models that embed predictions from a 

specific theoretical framework.  

Table 1 summarizes the response of selected financial variables on four dates 

associated with the Federal Reserve’s first round of asset purchases.  On November 25, 

2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $600 billion in agency 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt.  On December 1, Chairman 

                                                 
5 A burgeoning literature focuses on the experience of asset purchase programs of the Federal Reserve and 
other central banks; for example, see D’Amico and King (2010); Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack 
(2010); Hamilton and Wu (2010); and Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong (2010).

Bernanke provided further details in a speech.6  On December 16, the program was 

formally launched by the FOMC.7  On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced that the 

program would be expanded by an additional $850 billion in purchases of agency MBS 

and agency debt and $300 billion in purchases of Treasury securities.  As is evident from 

the table, these announcements were generally associated with a substantial decline in the 

10-year Treasury yield and the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities 

(TIPS) as well as in rates on agency MBS and corporate debt.   

Turning now to the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve’s securities 

purchases, there are several distinct channels through which these purchases tend to 

influence aggregate demand, including a reduced cost of credit to consumers and 

businesses, a rise in asset prices that boosts household wealth and spending, and a 

moderate change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that provides support to net 

exports.  The quantitative magnitude of these effects can be gauged using a 

macroeconometric model such as FRB/US--one of the models developed and maintained 

by Board staff and used routinely in simulations of alternative economic scenarios.   

Figure 3 depicts the results of such a simulation exercise, as reported in a recent 

research paper by four Federal Reserve System economists.8  For illustrative purposes, 

the simulation imposes the assumption that the purchases of $600 billion in longer-term 

Treasury securities are completed within about a year, that the elevated level of securities

Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, Austin, Tex., December 1, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm.

the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent.

holdings is then maintained for about two years, and that the asset position is then 

unwound linearly over the following five years.9  

This trajectory of securities holdings causes the 10-year Treasury yield to decline 

initially about 1/4 percentage point and then gradually return toward baseline over 

subsequent years.  That path of longer-term Treasury yields leads to a significant pickup 

in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth relative to baseline and generates an 

increase in nonfarm payroll employment that amounts to roughly 700,000 jobs.10  It 

should also be noted that this exercise is performed as a deterministic simulation and 

hence does not capture the potential benefits of the asset purchase program in mitigating 

downside risks to economic activity and inflation. 

 I would also like to note that the same research paper analyzed the 

macroeconomic effects of the FOMC’s full program of securities purchases, including the 

first round of purchases that was initiated in late 2008 and early 2009, the modification of 

the reinvestment policy that was announced last August, and the second round of 

purchases that was initiated in November.  Those simulation results indicate that by 2012, 

the full program of securities purchases will have raised private payroll employment by 

about 3 million jobs.  Moreover, the simulations suggest that inflation is currently a 

percentage point higher than would have been the case if the FOMC had never initiated 

                                                 
9 In addition, the federal funds rate is assumed to remain unchanged from baseline for several years and 
then to follow the prescriptions of a simple estimated policy rule; for further details, see Chung and others 
(2011). 
10 The simulation results are reported as deviations from baseline and hence eventually return to zero.   
In effect, under circumstances in which the baseline path involves a large and relatively persistent 
unemployment gap, these results can be interpreted as gauging the extent to which the policy stimulus 
accelerates the pace at which the economy returns to its balanced-growth path with maximum sustainable 
employment and low, stable inflation.

any securities purchases, implying that, in the absence of such purchases, the economy 

would now be close to deflation.11 

Addressing Some FAQs about the Asset Purchase Program 

Has the Program Been Effective in Promoting the Economic Recovery?  

 Is the program actually proving effective?  My short answer is yes.  Table 2 

depicts financial market responses during three key phases in the rollout of the program:  

(1) August 10, 2010, when the FOMC announced that the Federal Reserve would begin 

reinvesting principal payments on agency MBS and agency debt by purchasing Treasury 

securities; (2) the period between August 11 and November 2; and (3) November 3, the 

date on which the FOMC meeting statement announced the commencement of the 

program.  

 As shown in the table, the initiation of the securities purchase program at the 

November FOMC meeting occasioned only minimal market response.  The reason is that 

it was largely anticipated by investors, having been the subject of extensive public 

discussions by Federal Reserve officials during late summer and early autumn.  

Importantly, as expectations of the program gradually became embedded in asset prices 

during late summer and early autumn, the 10-year TIPS yield dropped nearly 

1/2 percentage point over the period between the August and November FOMC 

meetings; moreover, equity prices rose and corporate bond spreads narrowed.  Over that 

period, of course, asset prices were also responding to economic news and some 

favorable corporate earnings reports, but the overall pattern of the financial market data 

bolstered my confidence in the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s securities 

purchases in providing additional monetary policy accommodation.  Indeed, market rates 
                                                 
11 See Chung and others (2011) for further details.

might well have backed up significantly following the November FOMC meeting if the 

Committee had decided not to move ahead with the program.12 

As shown in figure 4, longer-term Treasury yields have risen substantially over 

the past couple of months since the FOMC initiated this round of asset purchases.  I 

believe that this increase in Treasury yields likely reflects a number of significant factors, 

including incoming information suggesting a somewhat stronger economic outlook and 

the fiscal package that was announced by President Obama in early December and 

approved by the Congress about two weeks later; that package will not only support 

economic growth next year but will also increase the amount of federal debt issuance.  

Also, investors appear to have scaled back their expectations about the extent to which 

the FOMC will engage in further purchases beyond those already announced; however, 

the effect of that reassessment on market rates tends to bolster the view that the Federal 

Reserve’s securities purchases do indeed affect yields in the direction indicated by 

analytical and empirical studies.13 

Will the Asset Purchase Program Lead to Excessive Inflation? 

A concern voiced by some observers is that the asset purchase program will lead 

to excessive inflation.  One rationale for this view is that the economy is currently 

operating with little slack--that is, an unemployment rate that is not far from the NAIRU.  

A second rationale is that asset purchases have ballooned the Fed’s balance sheet and the 

supply of bank reserves.  I will consider each argument in turn.   

                                                 
12 Consistent with the conjecture that bond yields are affected by expected purchase size, the 30-year 
Treasury yield increased markedly in the days following the November FOMC meeting, as market 
participants reportedly revised downward their expectations of the amount of purchases by the Federal 
Reserve in this maturity sector. 
13 The backup in rates may have been amplified by technical factors such as mortgage-related hedging 
flows and year-end positioning by leveraged investors.

Extent of slack in the economy.  Some proponents of the view that the U.S. 

economy is operating close to the NAIRU point to an apparent outward shift in the 

Beveridge curve--the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--as 

indicating an increase in the structural level of unemployment.  In the simplest 

framework, movements along a downward sloping Beveridge curve are typically 

characterized as cyclical movements in labor market conditions, while persistent inward 

and outward shifts in the curve are frequently attributed to structural forces. 

As shown in figure 5, the Beveridge curve appears to have shifted out in recent 

years.  However, the Beveridge curve can shift out for a variety of reasons, including 

some that are essentially cyclical in nature, so it is important to understand the sources of 

any shift to assess whether it represents persistent structural forces.  

There is some evidence suggesting that structural factors account for a portion of 

the Beveridge curve’s outward shift.  In particular, the shift may partly reflect a decline in 

the efficiency with which unemployed workers are matched to vacant jobs.14  However, 

given that the apparent decline in matching efficiency coincided with a large reduction in 

job vacancies, the two developments may be related.  In particular, weak labor demand 

may be causing the labor market to operate less efficiently than would typically be the 

case, and matching efficiency may return to normal as demand for workers improves.  

Indeed, historically, matching efficiency does appear to move back toward its long-run 

average over time.15  That said, a persistently high level of long-term unemployment 

                                                 
14 On changes in matching efficiency, see Barnichon and Figura (2010) and Davis, Faberman, and 
Haltiwanger (2010).  Possible reasons for a decline in matching efficiency include decreased mobility of 
workers due to the drop in house prices and a mismatch between the skills demanded by businesses and the 
skills offered by unemployed workers.  On the issue of migration rates and mobility, see Kaplan and 
Schulhofer-Wohl (2010). 
15 See Barnichon and Figura (2010).

could lead to a significant increase in structural unemployment over time as individuals 

who are out of work for long periods face the erosion of their skills.  However, such 

effects would take time to materialize and, in any event, would argue for aggressive 

policies to reduce unemployment promptly. 

Another portion of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve is likely due to 

increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which may have induced 

some unemployed workers to be more selective in the job offers they accept.  However, 

recent research suggests that the increase in unemployment due to extended benefits is 

probably small relative to the overall increase in unemployment, and, regardless of its 

magnitude, the influence of extended unemployment benefits will disappear as the 

economy improves and extended benefits expire.16   

Moreover, at least some of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve 

appears to reflect cyclical rather than structural influences.  For example, vacancies 

typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing 

counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in 

the Beveridge curve.  Indeed, as is evident from the figure, such counterclockwise 

movements have occurred in most previous recessions.   

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that most of the co-movement between 

unemployment and vacancies in recent years does not appear especially unusual.  In 

particular, low vacancies and elevated layoffs--likely driven by weak labor demand--can 

account for much of the increase in unemployment that has occurred since mid-2008.17  

                                                 
16 On the effect of extended unemployment benefits on the unemployment rate, see Kuang and Valleta 
(2010). 
17 Declining demand leads businesses with positive trend growth in employment to reduce vacancies--a 
movement down the Beveridge curve--and businesses with flat or downwardly trending employment to 


 - 12 -

This observation is in accord with the recent behavior of inflation, which, as noted above, 

has trended down over the past three years, consistent with a decline in rates of resource 

utilization.  Likewise, nominal wage growth has fallen noticeably over the past several 

years and remains quite low. 

  In sum, while deficient labor demand may not be the only factor boosting 

unemployment currently, and while disentangling the various influences on 

unemployment is not straightforward, weak labor demand appears to be the predominant 

factor keeping the unemployment rate elevated.  This weakness, in turn, implies that 

current resource utilization is likely well below normal levels, mitigating the risk that the 

policy stimulus from our asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation. 

Inflation and bank reserves.  A second reason that some observers worry that the 

Fed’s asset purchase programs could raise inflation is that these programs have increased 

the quantity of bank reserves far above pre-crisis levels.  I strongly agree with one aspect 

of this argument--the notion that an accommodative monetary policy left in place too 

long can cause inflation to rise to undesirable levels.  This notion would be true 

regardless of the level of bank reserves and pertains as well in situations in which 

monetary policy is unconstrained by the zero bound on interest rates.  Indeed, it is one 

reason why the Committee stated that it will review its asset purchase program regularly 

in light of incoming information and adjust the program as needed to meet its objectives. 

We recognize that the FOMC must withdraw monetary stimulus once the recovery has 

taken hold and the economy is improving at a healthy pace.  Importantly, the Committee 

remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the 

                                                                                                                                                 
increase layoffs--an outward shift in the Beveridge curve.  For the response of vacancies and layoffs to 
changes in firm-level employment, see Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2010).

level of 2 percent or a bit less than that, which most FOMC participants see as consistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s mandate.   

In contrast, I disagree with the notion that the large quantity of reserves resulting 

from our asset purchases poses some special barrier to removing policy stimulus when 

the right time comes.  The FOMC will be able to increase short-term rates by raising the 

interest rate that we pay on excess reserves--currently 1/4 percent.  That ability will allow 

us to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten policy when needed, 

even if bank reserves remain high. 

Given the very high level of reserve balances, changes in the interest rate on 

reserves might not be fully reflected in the federal funds rate and other short-term market 

rates.  In that event, the Federal Reserve can use tools it has developed and tested to drain 

or immobilize bank reserves, thereby enhancing our control over the federal funds rate.  

To build the capability to drain large quantities of reserves, the Federal Reserve has 

expanded the range of its counterparties for reverse repurchase operations beyond the 

primary dealers and has developed the infrastructure necessary to use agency MBS as 

collateral in such transactions.  The Federal Reserve has also put in place a Term Deposit 

Facility through which it can offer deposits to member institutions that are roughly 

analogous to the certificates of deposit that these institutions offer to their customers.  We 

have tested both of these tools by conducting several small-scale operations and have the 

ability to initiate them quickly if needed.  The use of reverse repurchase operations and 

the Term Deposit Facility would allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions 

of dollars of reserves from the banking system should conditions necessitate.  We don’t 

think that draining such large amounts of reserves will be necessary for a smooth exit, but 


 - 14 -

it makes sense to be prepared, and hence we have followed this “belt and suspenders” 

approach. 

Finally, we can sell portions of our holdings of MBS, agency debt, and Treasury 

securities if we determine that doing so is an appropriate way of tightening financial 

conditions when the time comes.  The redemption or sale of securities would have the 

effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as well as further 

reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system.  Restoring the size and 

composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term 

objective of our policies. Any such sales would be at a gradual pace, would be clearly 

communicated to market participants, and would entail appropriate consideration of 

economic conditions. 

In short, the range of tools we have developed will permit us to raise short-term 

interest rates and drain large volumes of reserves when it becomes necessary to achieve 

the policy stance that fosters our macroeconomic objectives--including the objective of 

maintaining price stability.   

Will the Asset Purchase Program Result in Adverse Financial Imbalances? 

The Committee’s intention in implementing asset purchases is to hold down the 

level of longer-term interest rates to make credit more affordable for businesses and 

households.  A reasonable fear is that this process could go too far, encouraging potential 

borrowers to employ excessive leverage to take advantage of low financing costs and 

leading investors to accept less compensation for bearing risks as they seek to enhance 

their rates of return in an environment of very low yields.   


 - 15 -

This concern deserves to be taken seriously, and the Federal Reserve is carefully 

monitoring financial indicators for signs of potential threats to financial stability.  While 

there is no single metric we can use to assess these threats, standard financial market 

indicators do not currently signal significant excesses or imbalances in the United States.  

In the stock market, for example, price-to-earnings ratios, by some measures, remain 

below their averages over the past several decades, and other valuation measures also 

indicate that equity prices are not significantly out of alignment with past norms.  In the 

real estate market, price-to-rent ratios for both residential and commercial real estate are 

now within a reasonable range of their long-run averages, in contrast to the severe 

misalignment that occurred prior to the crisis. Again, there is little sign here of 

imbalances relative to fundamentals, at least if history is used as a guide.  In fixed-

income markets, narrow risk spreads and risk premiums could be signs of excessive risk-

taking by investors, and indeed spreads on corporate bonds have dropped dramatically 

since the financial crisis, as the economic outlook has improved and investor sentiment 

has picked up.  Risk premiums on nonfinancial corporate bonds, as measured by forward 

spreads far in the future, are relatively low compared with historical norms, although 

other indicators for this market do not point to overvaluation. 

An alternative way to identify imbalances is to focus more directly on measuring 

credit flows and exposures to credit risk.  Extraordinarily rapid credit growth may be a 

sign that financial institutions are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets.  In recent 

months, nonfinancial corporations have issued large amounts of bonds and syndicated 

leveraged loans, and banks’ provision of consumer credit has shown some signs of 

reviving.  Nonetheless, a portion of the recent corporate issuance has been used to 


 - 16 -

refinance existing debt, including leveraged loans; small business lending remains 

especially weak; and commercial and residential mortgage originations continue to 

shrink.  Thus, there is little evidence that financial institutions are significantly expanding 

the level of credit and liquidity provided to households and businesses on net.  Indeed, 

given the current very low level of interest rates and the continuation of the economic 

recovery, credit flows remain stubbornly sluggish. 

Of course, such aggregate measures provide only an imperfect picture of overall 

credit conditions.  Another type of evidence comes from surveying market participants 

about their practices.  For bank lending, we have the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan 

Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which provides information about 

changes in supply and demand for bank loans to businesses and households.  Recent 

surveys have indicated that banks have only just begun to reverse the historically large 

tightening in standards and terms that they implemented in the aftermath of the crisis.  In 

fact, considerably more easing of terms and standards will probably be required before 

lending conditions return to normal.  

To monitor leverage provided by dealers to financial market participants, last June 

the Federal Reserve launched the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer 

Financing Terms.  This survey provides information on credit terms and availability of 

various forms of dealer-intermediated financing, including funding for securities 

positions and over-the-counter derivatives.  The survey results suggest that over the past 

several months there has been some easing of terms applicable to financing for a range of 

counterparty types and many types of collateral, as well as an increase in demand from 

clients to fund most types of securities.  These results indicate that the availability and

use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions increased somewhat last year.  Overall, 

a variety of indicators suggest that leverage generally remains well below the levels 

reached prior to the financial crisis, but these measures are worth watching closely, and 

the new survey reflects our strong commitment to developing additional tools for this 

purpose. 

The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring many indicators of financial conditions 

to better understand the implications of financial market developments for the economy 

as well as risks to the financial system itself.  We are working with other regulators to 

make the financial system more robust and are attentive in our supervision to 

developments that may affect systemic risk.  If evidence of financial imbalances were to 

develop, I believe that supervision and regulation should provide the first line of defense 

so that monetary policy can concentrate on its longstanding goals of price stability and 

maximum employment.  That said, we cannot categorically rule out using monetary 

policy to address financial imbalances, given the damage that they can cause.   

Will the Asset Purchase Program Have Adverse Effects on Foreign Economies? 

 My final FAQ relates to the concerns that some observers have expressed over the 

potential for the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program to have adverse effects on 

foreign economies.  One specific concern is that these securities purchases might drive 

down the value of the U.S. dollar, thereby diverting demand from our trading partners.  

Although purchases of longer-term securities are a less conventional means of conducting 

monetary policy than the more familiar approach of managing short-term interest rates, 

the goals and transmission mechanisms are actually very similar, and there is nothing

special about these asset purchases that would make them especially likely to weigh on 

the dollar.  

 In fact, the evidence available to date suggests that the asset purchases have had 

only moderate effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  This point is 

illustrated in table 3, which reports the change in U.S. dollar exchange rates against four 

other currencies (the Canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, and yen) on each of the four 

dates referred to in table 1.  These movements in exchange rates are not particularly large 

when compared with the fluctuations that can occur in any given week or month.  Indeed, 

as shown in figure 6, these exchange rate movements are very modest in the broader 

context of developments over the past several years. 

 A related concern raised by some observers is that the Federal Reserve’s asset 

purchases may induce excessive capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMEs)--

inflows that in turn could put unwelcome upward pressure on the currencies of those 

EMEs and perhaps even contribute to asset price bubbles.  As shown in figure 7, net 

private capital flows to Latin American and Asian EMEs (reported as a share of the 

aggregate GDP of those EMEs) were substantial in the second half of 2009 and the first 

half of 2010 but were not obviously outsized compared with levels prior to the crisis.18  A 

similar pattern is evident in figure 8, which depicts the net inflows since 2007 into mutual 

funds investing in EME bonds and equities.  In each case, the strong inflows over the past 

year or so reflect a recovery in the wake of the large outflows that occurred during the 

crisis.  In fact, the stock of claims on EMEs has only returned to its pre-crisis trend.  

                                                 
18 For the purposes of this discussion, the EMEs comprise Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong 
Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and 
Venezuela.

 Accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies, including the 

Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, have likely played some role in widening interest rate 

differentials and encouraging capital flows to EMEs.  But this role should not be 

exaggerated.  Other factors--including a reversal of the capital outflows from EMEs 

during the financial crisis and the EMEs’ longer-term favorable growth prospects--likely 

have also been important.  Moreover, it would be a mistake to portray these capital flows 

as an unmitigated negative for the EMEs.  A rebalanced global economy in which EMEs 

depend more on domestic demand for their growth will likely involve ultimately stronger 

and more sustained capital flows to these economies. 

 Finally, I would like to comment on the critique that our asset purchase program 

is meant to promote U.S. growth at the expense of other nations by depreciating the 

dollar and enhancing U.S. competitiveness.  That argument ignores the fact that 

stimulating growth in the United States is also likely to boost our demand for foreign 

goods and promote growth abroad.  This effect will provide an important offset to the 

other implication of U.S. monetary stimulus that I discussed earlier--that it may lead to 

moderate movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that tend to lower U.S. 

demand for foreign goods.  Whether foreign demand is ultimately boosted or diminished 

by U.S. monetary policy depends on the relative sizes of these two effects and is 

ultimately an empirical question.19  However, given the moderate exchange rate effects 

that we believe the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases have had, it seems likely to me that, 

as seems to be the case with conventional monetary easing achieved by lowering interest 

rates, our decision to purchase assets will not hinder foreign growth.  In particular, given 

                                                 
19 Kim (2001), Canova (2005), and Uribe and Yue (2006), among others, find that U.S. monetary stimulus 
affects aggregate output in emerging market and advanced foreign economies positively.

the importance of the United States in the global economy, it is hard to believe that any 

foreign country would gain if our economy were to fall back into another recession.  Over 

the longer term, the health and vitality of the global economy will depend importantly on 

the sustained, vigorous recovery in the United States that our asset purchase program is 

intended to support. 

Conclusion 

 In closing, let me reiterate that the program of asset purchases initiated by the 

Federal Open Market Committee in November is intended to support economic recovery 

from an exceptionally deep recession and to restore inflation to, but not above, levels that 

FOMC participants consider consistent with price stability.  It will not be a panacea, but  

I believe it will be effective in fostering maximum employment and price stability.
