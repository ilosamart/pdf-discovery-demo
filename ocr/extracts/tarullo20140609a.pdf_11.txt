or financial regulatory statutes.  I shall speak briefly to this possibility after describing some 

examples of the second approach already in place, along with some possibilities for further 

measures. 

Aligning Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation 

 With no claim to comprehensiveness, let me suggest three kinds of regulatory and 

supervisory measures that can better align corporate governance of financial firms with 

regulatory objectives. 

 First, regulatory requirements can be directed at changing the incentives of those making 

decisions within a financial firm.  One good example is incentive compensation for senior 

managers and other bank employees with substantial decisionmaking authority.  Compensation 

arrangements that create high-powered incentives using stock options or other forms of reward 

dominantly based on equity have their origins in efforts better to align management and 

shareholder interests.  Otherwise, managers who stand to suffer reputational or job loss as their 

firm declines or fails may have a more conservative risk appetite than diversified shareholders, 

who value the upside of risk-taking and whose limited liability makes them relatively less 

concerned with catastrophic downside possibilities.  As has been observed by numerous 

commentators,9 however, where these kinds of incentive compensation arrangements have 

succeeded in better aligning the interests of shareholders and employees, they intensify the 

conflict between shareholder and regulatory interests.10  Ironically, regulatory objectives match

Journal, vol. 98 (2), pp. 247-87; and Kenneth R. French, M. N. Baily, J. Y. Campbell, J. H. Cochrane, D. W. 
Diamond, D. Duffie, A. K. Kashyap, F. S. Mishkin, R. G. Rajan, D. S. Scharfstein, R. J. Shiller, H. S. Shin, M. J. 
Slaughter, J. C. Stein, and R. M. Stulz (2010), The Squam Lake Report: Fixing the Financial System (Princeton: 
Princeton University Press).

diversified shareholders are presumed to have.
