flexibility of markets to the quality of the legal and regulatory frameworks.  However, 

innovation and technological change are undoubtedly central to the growth process; over 

the past 200 years or so, innovation, technical advances, and investment in capital goods 

embodying new technologies have transformed economies around the world.  In recent 

decades, as this audience well knows, advances in semiconductor technology have 

radically changed many aspects of our lives, from communication to health care.  

Technological developments further in the past, such as electrification or the internal 

combustion engine, were equally revolutionary, if not more so.  In addition, recent 

research has highlighted the important role played by intangible capital, such as the 

knowledge embodied in the workforce, business plans and practices, and brand names.  

This research suggests that technological progress and the accumulation of intangible 

capital have together accounted for well over half of the increase in output per hour in the 

United States during the past several decades.2   

Innovation has not only led to new products and more-efficient production 

methods, but it has also induced dramatic changes in how businesses are organized and 

managed, highlighting the connections between new ideas and methods and the 

organizational structure needed to implement them.  For example, in the 19th century, the 

development of the railroad and telegraph, along with a host of other technologies, were 

associated with the rise of large businesses with national reach.  And, as transportation 

and communication technologies developed further in the 20th century, multinational 

corporations became more feasible and prevalent.    

Economic policy affects innovation and long-run economic growth in many ways.
