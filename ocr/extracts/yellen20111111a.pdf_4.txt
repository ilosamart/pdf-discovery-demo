infrastructures or activities, whose failure or financial distress could have outsized 

destabilizing effects on the rest of the financial system.  Another form of risk can be 

described as cyclical and includes, for example, elevated asset prices and excessive credit 

growth that arise in robust economic times but can leave the balance sheets of both large 

and small financial firms vulnerable to downturns in the credit cycle.  Attentiveness to 

these various channels is critical in the monitoring of systemic risk and the formulation of 

appropriate macroprudential policy responses.  In particular, some risks are best allayed 

by policies that are structural in nature and thus do not change as economic conditions 

evolve, whereas others are best addressed by policies that are sensitive to economic 

developments.  Indeed, selecting the right policies to address specific forms of systemic 

risk is important for ensuring that reasonable risk-taking and innovation continue to take 

place in financial markets so as to foster broader productivity gains, economic growth, 

and job creation. 

A key question for central banks is how macroprudential policies fit together with 

monetary policy.  The evolving--though by no means settled--consensus is that monetary 

policy is too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address cyclical risks to financial 

stability, and that more-targeted micro- and macroprudential tools should be used to 

address these risks.  I agree that targeted prudential policies should be the first line of 

defense against threats to financial stability.  However, because their effectiveness in 

practice is not yet proven, I would not rule out the possibility that monetary policy could 

be used directly to support financial stability goals, at least on the margin.
