ratio to fall below 100 percent when facing large outflows for fear that doing so might be 

seen by market participants as a sign of weakness. 

By contrast, in a system with something like a CLF, a bank might in normal times 

meet 95 percent of its requirement by holding private-market HQLA and the remaining 

5 percent with committed credit lines from the central bank, so it would have an LCR of 

exactly 100 percent.  Then, when hit with large outflows, it could maintain its LCR at 

100 percent, but do so by increasing its use of central bank credit lines to 25 percent and 

selling 20 percent of its other liquid assets.18  This scenario would be the sort of liquid-

asset drawdown that one would ideally like to see in a stress situation.  Moreover, the 

central bank could encourage this drawdown by varying the pricing of its credit lines--

specifically, by reducing the price of the lines in the midst of a liquidity crisis.  Such an 

approach would amount to taxing liquidity provision more in good times than in bad, 

which has a stabilizing macroprudential effect. 

This example also suggests a design that may have appeal in jurisdictions where 

there is a relatively abundant supply of HQLA-eligible assets.  One can imagine 

calibrating the pricing of the CLF so as to ensure that lines provided by central banks 

make up only a minimal fraction of banksâ€™ required HQLA in normal times--apart, 

perhaps, from the occasional adjustment period after an individual bank is hit with an 

idiosyncratic liquidity shortfall.  At the same time, in a stress scenario, when liquidity is 

scarce and there is upward pressure on the HQLA premium, the pricing of the CLF could 

be adjusted so as to relieve this pressure and promote usability of the HQLA buffer.  

Such an approach would respect the policy objective of reducing expected reliance on the 

                                                 
18 This presumes that the bank in question is able to present adequate collateral to the central bank to secure 
the central bank credit line.
