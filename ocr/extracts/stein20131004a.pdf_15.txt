3. Universal margin requirements 

These sorts of regulatory-arbitrage concerns have motivated some academics and 

policymakers to think about a system of universal margin requirements for SFTs.13  In its 

simplest form, the idea would be to impose a minimum haircut, or down payment 

requirement, on any party—be it a hedge fund or a broker-dealer—that uses short-term 

collateralized funding to finance its securities holdings.  Because the requirement now 

lives at the security level, rather than at the level of an intermediary in the SFT market, it 

cannot be as easily evaded by, say, a hedge fund going outside the broker-dealer sector to 

obtain its repo funding.14  This is the strong conceptual appeal of universal margin from 

the perspective of a fire-sales framework. 

In this regard, it is worth noting that the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has 

recently released a proposal to establish minimum haircut requirements for certain 

SFTs.15  However, the FSB proposal stops well short of being a universal margin 

requirement.  Rather, the minimum haircuts envisioned by the FSB would apply only to 

SFTs in which entities not subject to capital and liquidity regulation (e.g., hedge funds) 

receive financing from entities that are subject to regulation (i.e., banks and broker-

dealers), and only to transactions in which the collateral is something other than 

                                                 
13 A closely related motivation for universal margin requirements is that they might be able to limit 
procyclicality by leaning against increases in leverage during boom times. 
 
14 Of course, there is always the potential for other forms of regulatory arbitrage.  For example, a hedge 
fund that faces a minimum margin requirement when it uses repo borrowing to fund a corporate-bond 
position may instead seek to take a leveraged position in the corporate bond through other means by, for 
example, engaging in a total-return swap with its prime broker.  This is the growing business of “synthetic” 
prime brokerage. Properly harmonized initial margin requirements on uncleared derivatives may help to 
level the playing field between traditional and synthetic prime brokerage activities.
