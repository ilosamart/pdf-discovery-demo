This observation carries an immediate implication:  It makes no sense to allow 

unpriced access to the central bankâ€™s LOLR capacity to count toward an LCR 

requirement.  Again, the whole point of liquidity regulation must be either to conserve on 

the use of the LOLR or in the limit, to address situations where the LOLR is not available 

at all--as, for example, in the case of broker-dealers in the United States.10 

At the same time, it is important to draw a distinction between priced and 

unpriced access to the LOLR.  For example, take the case of Australia, where prudent 

fiscal policy has led to a relatively small stock of government debt outstanding and hence 

to a potential shortage of HQLA.  The Basel Committee has agreed to the use by 

Australia of a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF), whereby an Australian bank can pay 

the Reserve Bank of Australia an up-front fee for what is effectively a loan commitment, 

and this loan commitment can then be counted toward its HQLA.  In contrast to free 

access to the LOLR, this approach is not at odds with the goals of liquidity regulation 

because the up-front fee is effectively a tax that serves to deter reliance on the LOLR--

which, again, is precisely the ultimate goal.  I will return to the idea of a CLF shortly. 

The Design of Regulation 

Once it has been decided that liquidity regulation is desirable, the next question is 

how best to implement it.  In this context, note that the LCR has two logically distinct 

aspects as a regulatory tool:  It is a mitigator, in the sense that holding liquid assets leads 

to a better outcome if there is a bad shock; it is also an implicit tax on liquidity provision 

by banks, to the extent that holding liquid assets is costly.  Of course, one can say 

                                                 
10 The fact that broker-dealers do not have access to the LOLR in the United States is, of course, ultimately 
a policy choice, and one that can be thought of as reflecting exactly the considerations discussed here:  
Whatever its merits, extending the LOLR to broker-dealers would increase taxpayer exposure and 
potentially exacerbate moral hazard problems.  Hence there may be a rationale for restricting its availability 
and relying on regulation instead.
