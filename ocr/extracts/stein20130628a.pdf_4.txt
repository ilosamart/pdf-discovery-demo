be interpreted.  In particular, I view Chairman Bernanke’s remarks at his press 

conference--in which he suggested that if the economy progresses generally as we 

anticipate then the asset purchase program might be expected to wrap up when 

unemployment falls to the 7 percent range--as an effort to put more specificity around the 

heretofore less well-defined notion of “substantial progress.”   

It is important to stress that this added clarity is not a statement of unconditional 

optimism, nor does it represent a departure from the basic data-dependent philosophy of 

the asset purchase program.  Rather, it involves a subtler change in how data-dependence 

is implemented--a greater willingness to spell out what the Committee is looking for, as 

opposed to a “we’ll know it when we see it” approach.  As time passes and we make 

progress toward our objectives, the balance of the tradeoff between flexibility and 

specificity in articulating these objectives shifts.  It would have been difficult for the 

Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program 

started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty 

about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.  However, as we get 

closer to our goals, the balance sheet uncertainty becomes more manageable--at the same 

time that the market’s demand for specificity goes up.   

In addition to guidance about the ultimate completion of the program, market 

participants are also eager to know about the conditions that will govern interim 

adjustments to the pace of purchases.  Here too, it makes sense for decisions to be data-

dependent.  However, a key point is that as we approach an FOMC meeting where an 

adjustment decision looms, it is appropriate to give relatively heavy weight to the 

accumulated stock of progress toward our labor market objective and to not be
