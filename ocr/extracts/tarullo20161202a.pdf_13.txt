the information and risk management systems of all banks have improved substantially, though 

work remains to be done at some of the largest banks. 

A fourth key element of the post-crisis regulatory regime is to develop credible options 

for resolution so that even one of the largest financial firms could be allowed to fail without 

bringing the financial system down.  Without such options, market discipline will remain 

lacking.  Moral hazard will lurk in the background, since market actors will doubt that a large 

institution would be allowed to fail.  Moreover, government officials must themselves have 

confidence in the viability of orderly resolution and bankruptcy procedures, or else during 

periods of high stress, they will be tempted to use some form of government help to keep the 

firm solvent.   

Next Steps 

While it is perhaps a bit soon for a full evaluation of the regulatory regime for large 

banks, several studies affirm its beneficial economic effects, particularly when the destructive 

impact of a financial crisis is taken into account.13  This assessment should obviously be adjusted 

as warranted by new studies and data.  But even as this work proceeds, we should continue to ask 

two questions.   

First, are we reasonably confident that the largest U.S. banks could weather a period of 

stress, and, in the more remote event they could not, that they would no longer present the
