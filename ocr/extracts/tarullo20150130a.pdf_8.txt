as in the requirements applicable to matched books of large firms that are important providers of 

liquidity to financial markets, some overtly macroprudential provisions have been incorporated 

in the NSFR.   

A third set of regulatory measures of relevance to systemic risks from large financial 

institutions concerns the potential failure of these institutions.  These include, among others, the 

orderly liquidation authority given the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under title 

II of the Dodd-Frank Act and proposals to assure the availability of debt that is convertible into 

equity should a firm fail, thereby providing for absorption of losses and possible recapitalization 

without need for the injection of public capital.4  I suspect these and similar measures do not 

appear on many lists of macroprudential tools.  And it may be hard to decide whether to classify 

them as resiliency tools or as structural measures designed to retard the build-up of systemic risk.  

Yet, with their purposes of ensuring that even the largest firms can fail and be wound down in an 

orderly fashion, and of countering too-big-to-fail perceptions associated with systemically 

important financial institutions, they belong on those lists.   

One such tool that has gotten more attention in the past year is the resolution planning 

process established by section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Federal Reserve and the 

FDIC have identified substantial shortcomings in many of the plans submitted to date.  In the 

next round of submissions, due this summer, these firms will need to produce plans that show 

they could be resolved in bankruptcy in an orderly fashion.  Meeting this requirement will entail 

significant changes in some combination of corporate structure, inter-corporate relationships, the 

mix and extent of activities, and the legal locus of certain bank activities.
