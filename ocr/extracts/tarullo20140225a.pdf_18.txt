Finally, it may also be worth considering some refinements to our monetary 

policy tools.  Central banks must always be cognizant of important changes that may 

result in different responses of households, firms, and financial markets to monetary 

policy actions.  There is little doubt that the conduct of monetary policy has become a 

good deal more complicated in recent years.  Some of these complications may diminish 

as economic and financial conditions normalize, but others may be more persistent.  

Central banks, in turn, may want to build on some recent experience, adapted for more 

normal times, in addressing the desire to contain systemic risk without removing 

monetary policy accommodation to advance one or both dual mandate goals.  

One example would be altering the composition of a central bankâ€™s balance sheet 

so as to add a second policy instrument to changes in the targeted interest rate.  The 

central bank might under some conditions want to use a combination of the two 

instruments to respond to concurrent concerns about macroeconomic sluggishness and 

excessive maturity transformation by lowering the target (short-term) interest rate and 

simultaneously flattening the yield curve through swapping shorter duration assets for 

longer-term ones.  

Conclusion 

 In reviewing the relationship between financial stability considerations and 

monetary policy, I have suggested that monetary policy action cannot be taken off the 

table as a response to the build-up of broad and sustained systemic risk.  But I have also 

tried to suggest that the development of existing supervisory tools, the judicious use of 

macroprudential measures, the adoption of some structural measures affecting certain 

forms of financing, and perhaps some refinements of monetary policy tools can together
