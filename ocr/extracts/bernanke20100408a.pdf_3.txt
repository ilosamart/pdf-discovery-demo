history is never a perfect guide. 

 The first lesson--economic prosperity depends on financial stability--seems 

obvious, but this connection was not always well understood.  After the stock market 

crash of 1929, many thought a financial and economic crisis was necessary--even 

desirable--to wring out speculative excesses that had built up in the 1920s.  Remarkably, 

despite the fact that the Federal Reserve had been founded to mitigate financial panics, 

the central bank made essentially no effort to prevent the wave of bank failures that 

paralyzed the financial system at the start of 1930s.  Indeed, the Treasury Secretary at the 

time, Andrew Mellon, believed in the tonic effects of weeding out weak banks and 

famously advised President Herbert Hoover, “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate 

the farmers, liquidate real estate … It will purge the rottenness out of the system.”1 

Economists themselves have not always fully appreciated the importance of a 

healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in short-

term economic dynamics.  Even after the Depression, some economists found it useful to 

think of the financial system as a “veil,” which helped allocate the returns to physical 

assets but did little to affect so-called real economic outcomes.  In contrast, more recent 

work on the subject, to which I contributed, showed that the health of the financial 

system and the performance of the broader economy are closely interrelated, both in the 

short run and in the long run.  Indeed, in a historical context, some of my own research 

on the Great Depression showed that countries such as the United States that, for 

institutional or other reasons, suffered severe banking problems, had significantly worse
