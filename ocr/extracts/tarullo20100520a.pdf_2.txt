Chairman Meeks and Chairman Watt, Ranking Members Miller and Paul, and other 

members of the subcommittees, thank you for the invitation to participate in this hearing on the 

European sovereign debt problems and related international stabilization efforts. 

Coming as it does on the heels of the financial crisis that began in 2007, and with 

economic recovery here in the United States proceeding at only a modest pace, the European 

sovereign debt problems are a potentially serious setback.  It is thus important to understand the

overnight, its origins were long in the making.  For years many market participants had assumed 

that an implicit guarantee protected the debt of euro-area members.  For a number of euro-area

underpricing of risk, which made debt cheaper to issue than it probably should have been.  

Although strictures against excessive fiscal deficits and debts were built into the Maastricht 

Treaty, the European Union (EU) has had relatively weak mechanisms to enforce them, as EU 

officials themselves have recently acknowledged.   Little provision was made for fiscal transfers 

across members of the euro area in the event that financial support for members became necessary.  

The global financial crisis created an environment in which the presumed EU guarantee was more 

likely to be tested, as stimulus measures and lost revenue led to sizable fiscal deficits and the rapid 

accumulation of debt across euro-area members. 

 Nowhere were these problems with the EU’s fiscal framework more evident than in 

Greece.  Greece’s entry into the euro area in 2001 was associated with a sharp decline in Greek
