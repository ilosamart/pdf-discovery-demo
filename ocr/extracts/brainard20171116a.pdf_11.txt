retirement accounts, college savings accounts, and other investment platforms in order to enable 

a fintech advisor to offer a consumer a single, near complete picture of his balances and cash 

flows across different institutions.  

In reviewing the advertising, terms and conditions, and apps of an array of fintech 

advisors, it appears that many of these tools offer advanced data analysis, machine learning, and 

even artificial intelligence to help consumers cut down on unnecessary spending, set aside 

money for savings, and use healthy nudges to improve their financial decisions.  For instance, a 

fintech advisor may help a consumer automate savings “rules,” like rounding up charges and 

putting the difference into savings, enabling these small balances to accumulate over time or 

setting a small amount of money aside every time a consumer spends money on little splurges. 

The early stages of innovation inevitably feature a lot of learning from trial and error. 

Fortunately, as the fintech ecosystem advances, there are useful experiences and good practices 

to draw upon from the evolution of the commercial internet.  To begin with, one internet adage is 

that if a product is free, “you are the product.”34  In this vein, fintech advisors frequently offer 

free services to consumers and earn their revenue from the credit cards and other financial 

products that they recommend through lead generation.  

Of course, many fintech advisors are not lead generators.  Some companies offer fee-for-

service models, with consumers paying a monthly fee for the product.  Other companies are paid 

by employers, who then provide the products free of charge to their employees as an employee 

benefit.  In these cases, they likely have quite different business models.
