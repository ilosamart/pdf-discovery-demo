At the other end of the spectrum, I would urge a strong, though not irrebuttable, 

presumption of denial for any acquisition by any firm that falls in the higher end of the list of 

global systemically important banks developed by the Basel Committee for purposes of assessing 

capital surcharges.39 Firms at the lower end of the Basel Committee list, or that U.S. authorities 

may later designate as domestic systemically important banks under a parallel Basel Committee 

exercise,40 might have a slightly less robust, but still significant presumption against acquisitions.  

I would not apply the presumption in the case of certain de minimis acquisitions or in cases 

where asset dispositions were judged to offset any increase in systemic risk from the proposed 

new acquisition.   

It is reasonable to ask why these negative presumptions are appropriate, given my general 

view that the absence of both experience and consensus theory make a case-by-case approach 

necessary.  One answer is that, notwithstanding the fact that analytic tools for assessing a firm's 

systemic footprint are in a relatively early stage of development, everything we do know 

suggests that the firms on the Basel Committee list strongly implicate the kinds of systemic 

considerations mentioned by Congress.  Second, it does seem incumbent on us to provide at least 

some guidance to firms where we can, particularly to inform smaller, less connected firms of the 

kinds of mergers that are unlikely to raise financial stability concerns and, conversely, to give 

firms that are already of systemic importance a sense of which mergers will face very close 

scrutiny. 

A third answer is that, once an acquisition is consummated, Dodd-Frank provides only 

narrow authority to order divestiture on financial stability grounds.  Though the Board can 

recommend action by the FSOC, I have already noted that the test for such action is  "grave 

threat to financial stability," presumably a significantly higher standard than the "risk to financial
