level in the baseline scenario.4 [Footnote 4. Based on the year-to-year variability in house prices since 1900, and 
controlling for macroeconomic factors, there is roughly a 10 percent probability that house prices will be 10 percent 
lower than in the baseline by 2010. End footnote 4.] 
Since the announcement of the SCAP in late February, the economy has deteriorated somewhat 
and professional forecasters have revised their outlooks for GDP growth and the unemployment rate in 
2009 and 2010. New information on house prices suggests that the market's expectation for house 
price declines is similar to what was anticipated in February. A large share of projected losses at banks 
are expected to be related to house prices, and the specified path for house prices in the more adverse 
scenario still represents a severe level of stress. Although the likelihood that unemployment could 
average 10.3 percent in 2010 is now higher than had been anticipated when the scenarios were 
specified, that outcome still exceeds a more recent consensus projection by professional forecasters for 
an average unemployment rate of 9.3 percent in 2010.
