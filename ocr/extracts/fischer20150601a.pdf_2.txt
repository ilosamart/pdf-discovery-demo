There have been many economic and financial crises since the Mexican crisis that 

began in December 1994.  Michel Camdessus, then Managing Director of the IMF, called 

the Mexican crisis “the first economic crisis of the twenty first century” – by which he 

meant that it was the first emerging market country crisis whose immediate roots were 

more in the capital account than in the current account of the balance of payments.   

The Mexican crisis was followed by the crises of East Asia, including Thailand, 

Indonesia and Korea that started in the second half of 1997.  The crisis also affected 

Malaysia, which by imposing capital controls and other measures avoided having to enter 

an IMF program.  The current Japanese crisis began in the 1990s, but was not then seen 

as a possible forerunner of crises among the industrialized countries of North America 

and Europe.   

The problems of East Asia were followed by crises in Russia, Brazil, Turkey and 

Argentina.   All these took place during the Great Moderation, the moderation being the 

decline in inflation and greater stability of output that occurred in much of the 

industrialized world.  The Great Moderation was ascribed primarily to the switch in many 

countries to an inflation targeting approach to monetary policy. 

The Mexican crisis began within four months of my joining the IMF.  I left the Fund 

at the end of August 2001, and a few months later the string of crises seemed to be 

drawing to its close after Argentina abandoned the peg of its peso to the dollar.  For a few 

years it seemed that whatever measures had been put in place to deal with the myriad 

crises had been successful, as the frequency and intensity of crises declined in the first 

half of the aughts.
