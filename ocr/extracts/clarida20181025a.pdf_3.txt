in the economy may well be faster and the structural rate of unemployment lower than I 

would have thought several years ago.  Let me elaborate. 

First, let’s look at the demand side of the economy.  Consider the benchmark 

revisions to the household saving rate.  Recently revised Commerce Department data 

now show that the aggregate household saving rate is running at 6.7 percent of disposable 

income.  This revised estimate is nearly double the previous estimate.  The higher level 

suggests that, in contrast to the previous economic expansion from 2001 to 2007, when 

households were borrowing to maintain consumption while income growth slowed, 

households today, at least in the aggregate, are well positioned to maintain or even 

increase consumption relative to gains in income.  To me, at this stage in the business 

cycle, a historically high household saving rate is a tailwind for the economy, not a 

headwind.  And, of course, recent reductions in personal income tax rates are also a 

tailwind for the economy. 

Productivity and investment data provide another vantage point from which to 

assess both the demand and supply sides of the current expansion.  Over the past few 

years, we have seen some pickup in productivity growth, albeit from a very depressed 

pace.  By contrast, at a comparable stage in both the 2001-07 and 1982-90 economic 

expansions, productivity growth (as measured by an eight-quarter moving average) was 

actually slowing relative to its contemporaneous peak-to-present pace.   

I should also note that this recent pickup in productivity has coincided with a 

rebound in business investment, and that this increase in capital spending has been 

evident in both the equipment and intellectual property categories; it is not just an “oil 

patch” story.  Business investment is being supported by recent changes in the tax code
