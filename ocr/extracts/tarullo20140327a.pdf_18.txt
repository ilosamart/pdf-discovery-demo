dependence on short-term wholesale funding and in building capital.  To some extent, the new 

requirements are intended to preserve this progress.  

 Third, the capital and liquidity requirements that do apply are wholly consistent with the 

responsibility of host-country supervisors to assure financial stability in their own markets.  

Collectively, foreign banks with a large presence in the United States conduct activities of a 

scope, and at a scale, that could lead to problems for the U.S. financial system should they come 

under stress.  Realistically, exposures and vulnerabilities in a large host-country market are much 

more difficult for home-country supervisors to assess.  Indeed, U.S. regulators count on the 

expertise and proximity of U.K. regulators in overseeing the London operations of large U.S. 

financial institutions to enhance the effective consolidated supervision and regulation for which 

we are responsible. 

On the issue of home-host-country coordination in regulating large, globally active 

banking organizations, I would make three additional points.  First, our FBO capital 

requirements, like those of the EU for foreign commercial and investment banks, are based on 

the capital rules agreed to in the Basel Committee.

  Thus, there is an overall compatibility 

between national and international rules with respect to applicable definitions, standards, and 

required ratios. 

 Second, home countries must implement and enforce faithfully at a consolidated level 

these same capital rules.  More broadly, home-country supervisory expectations for strong 

consolidated capital levels, liquidity positions, and risk-management practices are likely to 

facilitate compliance with domestic requirements for large FBOs of the sort applicable in the 

United States and the EU.  It is also important that home countries assure the credibility of

 As a technical matter, the relevant FBOs are subject to the traditional 4 percent U.S. leverage ratio, but it is very 

likely that this requirement will be less binding than the 3 percent international leverage ratio because of the 

inclusion in the denominator of the latter of off-balance-sheet activities and exposures.
