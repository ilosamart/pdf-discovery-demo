firmsâ€™ large competitors were to fail.  In performing these kinds of analyses, we will draw on the 

extensive work on systemic risk we have already done in connection with our development of 

capital requirements, the designation of systemically important firms by the Financial Stability 

Oversight Council, and other matters.     

It is important to note that, while Congress instructed us to consider the extent to which a 

proposed acquisition would pose a greater risk to financial stability, it clearly did not instruct us 

to reject an acquisition simply because there would be any increase in such risks.  Instead, it 

appears we have been instructed to add any increased systemic risk to the list of adverse effects 

that could result from the merger and then determine whether the benefits to the public of the 

acquisition outweigh these adverse effects.  If, for example, there are few indications that scale 

or scope efficiencies would be gained, then anticipated adverse effects on systemic stability 

could be expected to have a greater impact on our ultimate decision.  If, on the other hand, there 

are genuine scale or scope efficiencies to be realized, then a more complicated set of trade-offs 

may  be needed.  The more developed our knowledge about economies of scale and scope in 

large financial conglomerates becomes, the more nuanced an analysis of these effects we will be 

able to make. 

The new authority for orderly liquidation of systemically important institutions is a 

second example of a systemic regulation in which an understanding of scale and scope is 

important.  At least some advocates of orderly liquidation regimes seem to favor resolution plans 

that silo activities as much as possible.  However, in the presence of significant economies of 

scope, this approach might result in loss of efficient forms of organization.  In these 

circumstances, resolution plans that seek to preserve the scope economies even as a firm is 

dismembered might result in better liquidation outcomes.  In addition, siloing activities in the
