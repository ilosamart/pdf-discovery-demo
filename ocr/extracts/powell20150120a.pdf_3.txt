Proper market functioning is really a public good that relies on confidence and trust 

among market participants and the public.  Bad conduct, weak internal firm governance, 

misaligned incentives, and flawed market structure can all place this trust at risk. 

One of the ways we have to influence incentives is through compensation 

practices at supervised institutions.  Many have argued that pre-crisis compensation 

practices at the largest financial firms allowed or created misaligned incentives.  In 

response, many firms have changed their compensation practices since the crisis to better 

align incentives between individuals and firms, particularly through enhanced deferral of 

incentive compensation, with delayed vesting and the possibility of more robust forfeiture 

in a broader set of circumstances.  We have strongly encouraged these reforms in our 

supervision of these institutions.  In my view, the reforms are both essential and generally 

on target.  The U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, are also preparing 

for public comment a proposed new rule on incentive compensation that will codify and 

strengthen these initiatives.  

As the Review notes, greater transparency can also help curb market abuses and 

strengthen competition.  In the United States, we have had over a decade of experience 

with the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) in over-the-counter 

corporate bond, MBS and ABS markets.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 

provides similar data for municipal bonds.  The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed rules 

requiring greater transparency in over-the-counter derivatives markets through the use of 

central clearing, trade repositories, and swap execution facilities.  Given the issues 

around OTC derivatives during the recent crisis, these clearly are important initiatives.  

But despite significant progress, there are still a number of impediments to sharing trade
