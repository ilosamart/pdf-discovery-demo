Fourth, it is important that an enhanced requirement be met with high-quality capital.  

Our presumption is that this means common equity, which is clearly the best buffer against loss 

and is what markets focused on during the crisis when evaluating the viability of financial firms.  

Some have suggested that a form of contingent capital instruments (“CoCos”) could be a partial 

or complete substitute for common equity.  There is surely conceptual appeal in so-called “going 

concern” CoCos that convert from debt to equity early enough to forestall a run on a firm and 

keep it a viable financial intermediary even under stressed conditions.  However, for all the 

attention paid to CoCos in the last few years, it is even now not clear as a practical matter that an 

instrument can be developed which would be cheaper than common equity but still structured so 

as to convert in a timely, reliable fashion.v  Furthermore, as the history of Tier 1 capital under the 

original Basel Accord teaches, there is considerable risk that once some form of hybrid is 

permitted, a slippery slope effect ensues, whereby national regulators approve increasingly 

diluted forms of capital under political pressures.vi 

Fifth, U.S. requirements for enhanced capital standards should, to the extent possible, be 

congruent with international standards.  The severe distress or failure of a foreign banking 

institution of broad scope and global reach could have effects on the U.S. financial system 

comparable to those caused by failure of a similar domestic firm.  The complexities of cross-

border resolution of such firms, to which I alluded earlier, apply equally to foreign-based 

institutions.  For these reasons, we have advocated in the Basel Committee for enhanced capital 

standards for globally important SIFIs.   

Achieving and implementing such standards would promote international financial 

stability while avoiding significant competitive disadvantage for any country’s firms.  I would
