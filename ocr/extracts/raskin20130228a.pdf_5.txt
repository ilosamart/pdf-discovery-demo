The Financial Crisis and the Reputation of Financial Institutions  

It has been more than five years since this country began experiencing a financial crisis 

that reverberated well beyond Wall Street.  This crisis was unique, and many of its marks on 

individuals and communities remain.  It was a crisis in which significant numbers of both 

subprime and prime mortgage defaults quickly spread across whole cities and regions until the 

impact was felt throughout the country.  The devastation was magnified by waves of 

foreclosures, significant drops in house values, job losses, and, ultimately, significant reductions 

in household wealth, which have been responsible, in part, for the slow recovery we confront

from the brink of depression only through a massive and unprecedented infusion of public 

dollars, American taxpayers feel that they were forced into a position of accepting that the 

government had to put a lot on the line to save the financial system from ruin.  And many of 

those taxpayers are still unhappy about such a massive government intervention that seemed to 

aid banks that were not held to account, while distressed households were left to pay the price.

extends beyond financial institutions to the government officials that oversee them.  For example, an American
