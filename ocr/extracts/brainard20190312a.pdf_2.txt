It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to discuss how we can preserve what is 

working well with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and make it better.1  In 

recent months, we have seen a high level of engagement from banks and community 

organizations in discussions and comments about revising the CRA regulations, which 

serves as testament to the value of the CRA and provides valuable suggestions for 

improving our regulatory approach.  The one message that comes through most clearly is 

that the CRA is highly valued by bankers and community groups alike.  A second 

message is that the CRA could be even more effective in mobilizing community and 

economic development. 

Purpose and History 

Before offering some thoughts on what we have learned and some possible ways 

forward, I want to begin by recalling why the CRA was established and what it was 

designed to achieve, as well as the important role it has played for over 40 years in low- 

and moderate-income communities across this country.  

The CRA was one of several landmark pieces of legislation to address inequities 

in the credit markets in the wake of the civil rights movement.  The Fair Housing Act of 

1968 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 addressed lending discrimination in 

mortgage and consumer credit based on race, sex, and other personal characteristics, 

while the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975 and later amendments 

recognized the importance of data in making these laws enforceable.  In 1977, Congress 

passed the CRA to address the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
