Prevailing Theory of the Case:  Empowering Regulators 

The prevailing theory has it that financial firms, particularly the largest and most 

systemically significant, engaged in practices that begat the financial crisis.  To redress these 

wrongs, regulatory powers should be substantially expanded, the theory goes.  The incumbent 

regulators lacked sufficient authorities, or were not up to the task.  But the structure in which 

their successors operate will purportedly make them masters of the craft.  Apparently, a new 

grant of broad and sweeping regulatory powers will treat the infirmities that ail us.  In my view, 

this theory has some understandable appeal--and begins to shed light on some important truths--

but the narrative and recommended reforms are still deficient.  Let me explain. 

  First, the Panic of 2008 that exacerbated the recession is the result of a multitude of 

flawed private and public practices, with regulatory error being only one part.  Some meaningful 

blame should be placed at the doorstep of regulators, here and abroad.  But the investigation 

should not cease at the first signs of fault.   

The mortgage finance system is owed far stricter scrutiny to gather a fuller appreciation 

of the causes of the crisis.  The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac, for example, were given license and direction to take excessive risks.  They were 

granted conflicting missions and governed by competing masters.  And their funding backstop 

was predicated on “constructive ambiguity,” which turned out to be neither constructive nor 

ambiguous.  Money market mutual funds, too, managed their liquidity risks in an environment of 

unclear support.  Ultimately, if the diagnosis of the crisis fails to account for some of the broader 

failings of public policy, of which the GSEs are just one part, the prescription is unlikely to be 

effective.
