For others, college is seen as an important pathway to middle-class economic 

security.  The average wealth of households with a college degree significantly exceeds 

the average wealth of those without a college degree (figure 10).  A key reason is that 

college graduates generally have higher incomes.  Graduates with a bachelor’s degree 

have median weekly earnings that are about 65 percent higher than high school graduates 

and unemployment rates that are 2 percentage points lower, and they are often better 

positioned to adapt to changes in the labor market.30   

However, the cost of higher education has been rising, placing an increasing 

financial burden on many middle-income households.  Between 2008 and 2018, tuition 

and fees at four-year public colleges rose more than six times faster than real median 

incomes.31  Moreover, as Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Evans discussed, 

while there are benefits associated with attending college, there are also some financial 

risks, and the returns to education vary widely.  While two-thirds of individuals with a 

bachelor’s degree or more say that the lifetime financial benefits of their education 

exceed its costs, those who do not complete their degree are half as likely to report net 

benefits from their studies.32  And some groups face higher barriers in accessing college:  

Children of parents who did not attend college are far less likely to attend college due to

between 2018 and 2019 (according to data from the College Board, which are available on its website at

while income increased about 7 percent in the same period (as indicated by U.S. Census Bureau data,
