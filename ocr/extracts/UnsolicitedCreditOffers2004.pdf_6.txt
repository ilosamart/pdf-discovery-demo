5.	 the potential effect on the following factors if further restrictions are imposed 
on the ability of creditors and insurers to make written offers: 
o the cost consumers pay to obtain credit or insurance 
o the availability of credit or insurance 
o consumers’ knowledge about new or alternative products and services

been traditionally underserved

congressional request. 

STUDY APPROACH 

In conducting the required study, the Board undertook three tasks, the results of which 
are summarized in this report. First, to examine the ability of consumers to avoid (or “opt 
out” of) receiving unsolicited offers of credit or insurance, the Board obtained from one 
of the three national CRAs the credit records of a large, nationally representative random 
sample of individuals (excluding identifying personal or creditor information). The 
sample was obtained for two reasons: (1) to examine what it revealed about the extent to 
which consumers have exercised their statutory rights to opt out, that is, decline to 
receive prescreened solicitations and (2) to determine the credit use and other 
characteristics of consumers who had or had not opted out. 

Second, to learn about the views of consumers concerning their experiences with mailed 
prescreened solicitations, the Board sponsored a May 2004 nationwide survey of 
consumers on this issue through the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers 
program. This survey covered consumers’ behavior with respect to such solicitations 
when received, their attitudes toward such offers, their knowledge about the contents of 
such solicitations, and their knowledge about their right not to receive such solicitations. 

Third, to obtain the views of creditors, insurers, and other interested or concerned parties, 
the Board requested public comments on these issues through a notice in the Federal 
Register that creditors, insurers, and others could further publicize through the trade 
press, consumer newsletters, and other sources.2 This request specifically asked for 
comments on the following topics: 

•	 the extent to which insurance providers send prescreened solicitations to 
consumers
