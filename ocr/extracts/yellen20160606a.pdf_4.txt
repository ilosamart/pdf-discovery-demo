So the overall labor market situation has been quite positive.  In that context, this 

past Friday’s labor market report was disappointing.  Payroll gains were reported to have 

been much smaller in April and May than earlier in the year, averaging only about 80,000 

per month.2  And while the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further in 

May, that decline occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people 

reported that they were actively seeking work.  A broader measure of labor market slack 

that includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time 

who would prefer full-time work was unchanged.  An encouraging aspect of the report, 

however, was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private 

sector increased 2-1/2 percent over the past 12 months--a bit faster than in recent years 

and a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up.3   

Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me 

emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly 

report.  Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive.  For 

example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which 

can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low, 

and the public’s perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various 

consumer surveys, remain positive.  That said, the monthly labor market report is an 

                                                 
2 Payroll employment is now reported to have increased 123,000 in April and 38,000 in May.  According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, payrolls in May were held down about 35,000 by workers on strike at 
Verizon; thus, the strike can account for a relatively small portion of the slowdown in payroll growth in 
May.  The Verizon workers are now back on the job and should be included in the June payroll counts.   
3 Hourly compensation in the business sector (a measure that includes benefit costs as well as wages) is 
now reported to have increased about 3 percent over the year ended in the first quarter of 2016, somewhat 
above the average increase in this series over the preceding several years.  In addition, according to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “wage growth tracker,” wage gains for continuously employed full-time 
workers have been gradually trending higher in recent years and were 3-1/2 percent over the 12 months 
through April.  However, the employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs, 
has remained quite soft, rising only 1-3/4 percent over the year ended in March.
