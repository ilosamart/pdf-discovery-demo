1.63 percent.  The 25th percentile of the distribution across respondents was 1.38 percent, 

and the 75th percentile was 1.88 percent, suggesting a fairly tight range around the 

median expectation.  The reported range was even tighter for the market participants 

around a median projection of 1.63 percent.      

However, it would be a mistake to infer from the narrowness of these ranges a 

firmness in expectations.  As shown in figure 4, when respondents of each survey were 

asked to indicate the percent chance assigned to different fed funds target levels when the 

change in policy is announced, the average of all of their reported distributions was wide 

and flat.  The primary dealer survey places roughly equal weight on rates between 1.26 

and 2.00 percent.  In the underlying nonpublic data for the individual responses, the 

reported distributions were somewhat narrower but still reflected significant uncertainty, 

with no primary dealer placing more than 50 percent probability on any particular target 

range.  Like the dealers, the market participants also report wide individual distributions 

of beliefs.        

Likewise, when primary dealers were asked about the timing of the announced 

change in reinvestment policy, the average of their responses was a relatively flat 

distribution of possible dates, with almost equal probability on the announcement 

occurring in the fourth quarter of 2017, the first two quarters of 2018, or the second half 

of 2018 (figure 5).  Again, the individual distributions were narrower but still showed a 

significant amount of uncertainty.  Highlighting the usefulness of also surveying market 

participants, expectations in the market survey are distinctly shifted toward an early 

announcement date relative to the expectations of the primary dealers.
