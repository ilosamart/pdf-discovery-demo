number of further reform proposals.3  Continuing the work of my former Fed colleague 

Jeremy Stein, I recently took over as co-chair--along with Martin Wheatley, chief 

executive officer of the FCA--of the international group that drafted the report and is now 

charged with implementing its recommendations.4  Today I will discuss the reasons why 

further reforms are necessary and how those reforms should proceed, and I will focus on 

U.S. dollar LIBOR.5  As is made clear in the FSB report, while the goals and principles 

of the official sector participants are uniform, specific plans for reference rate reform will 

vary by currency, depending on differences in markets and institutions. 

I will share my conclusion at the outset.  While there have been significant 

reforms, much remains to be done.6  First, U.S. dollar LIBOR needs to be updated to 

reflect current practices in unsecured funding markets and to be better anchored in actual 

transactions.  Second, and equally important, regulators need to work with market 

participants to encourage them to develop and adopt alternative reference rates that better 

reflect the current structure of U.S. financial markets, in which borrowing and derivatives 

transactions are much more likely to be secured with collateral.  Going forward, these 

alternative rates could replace LIBOR as the reference rate for new interest rate 

derivatives and some other contracts denominated in U.S. dollars.  These dual transitions 

will need to be managed very carefully to avoid disrupting the financing markets on 

which borrowers and lenders depend.  But I believe that they are crucial to strengthening 

the stability of our financial system and to helping restore the public’s faith in its

Sector Steering Group or those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
