An example of tailoring generally applicable regulations is the revised capital guidelines 

that were issued in 2013.9  It was clear in the wake of the financial crisis that strong capital 

positions were essential for banks of all sizes, including community banks.  But a number of 

changes that were appropriate for large banks did not make sense for community banks.  As I am 

sure you all recall, community banks gave us quite a bit of help in identifying which portions of 

the originally proposed rule were, and were not, appropriate for community banks.  Following 

publication of the final capital rule, the three federal banking agencies developed a streamlined, 

supplemental Community Bank Guide to assist bank management in understanding the 

applicability of the rules to smaller, non-complex institutions.10  This exercise is an example of a 

broader effort to be explicit as to how prudential regulations that are sometimes quite detailed 

apply to community banks.  By including such explanations in the introductory portions of 

broadly applicable regulations, our hope is that community bankers will be relieved of the task of 

wading through extensive regulatory texts just to find out what portions apply to their banks.   

This is a good point at which to note that the federal banking agencies have, in 

accordance with the terms of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act 

(EGRPRA), recently launched a review to identify banking regulations that are outdated, 

unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.11  One theme that has already been notable is the belief of
