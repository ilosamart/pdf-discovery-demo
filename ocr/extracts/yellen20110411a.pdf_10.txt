Consequently, the direct effects of the surge in commodity prices on headline consumer 

inflation should diminish sharply over coming months. 

Over time, I anticipate that the recent surge in commodity prices will also affect 

the prices of a broader range of consumer goods and services that use these commodities 

as inputs.  Many firms are seeing such costs escalate and will pass along at least part of 

these increased raw materials costs to their customers.  Nevertheless, I expect the overall 

inflationary consequences of these pass-through effects to be modest and transitory, 

provided that longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Moreover, labor 

costs per unit of output--the single largest component of the unit cost of producing goods 

and services in the business sector--are essentially unchanged since 2007, owing to both 

moderate wage increases and solid productivity gains.  I expect that nominal wage 

growth and labor costs will continue to be restrained by slack in resource utilization.  

Indeed, it would be difficult to get a sustained increase in inflation as long as growth in 

nominal wages remains as low as we have seen recently.   

My expectation regarding the transitory effects of commodity price shocks on 

consumer inflation is supported by simulation results from the FRB/US model--a 

macroeconometric model developed at the Federal Reserve Board and used extensively 

for policy analysis.  Starting from a situation in which inflation is running at 2 percent 

and households and firms expect the FOMC to keep it there in the longer run, the model 

predicts that a persistent increase of $25 per barrel in the price of crude oil--that is, a rise 

similar to what weâ€™ve experienced since last summer--would cause the PCE price index 

to rise at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent over the first two quarters following the
