Importantly, evidence--including the evidence of our eyes--shows that foreign 

asset markets have been significantly affected by the Fed’s purchase programs.11  For 

example, event studies of announcements associated with the Fed’s purchase programs 

have found that they prompted inflows into investment funds holding both foreign debt 

and foreign equity securities.  For asset prices, the strongest evidence came in the form of 

reduced foreign bond yields, but valuations of foreign currencies and stock prices also 

increased appreciably in some cases.  The largest market reactions occurred after 

announcements in late 2008 and early 2009 associated with the initial program of 

quantitative easing, commonly referred to as QE1, likely at least in part because global 

financial conditions were extremely stressed at that time, but also perhaps because QE1 

demonstrated that it was still possible to ease policy, even when the federal funds rate 

was constrained by its effective lower bound.12   

Although much of the recent commentary on spillovers has focused on the United 

States, it bears mentioning that other countries’ monetary policy announcements can 

leave an imprint on international asset prices, with market reactions to new initiatives 

announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) in the past few weeks the most recent 

example.13  However, event studies tend to find larger international interest rate 

spillovers for U.S. policy announcements than for those of other central banks.14

Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014).  Also, Ahmed and Zlate (forthcoming) show that both 
conventional and nonconventional U.S. monetary expansion have driven capital flows into EMEs.

evidence.   
14  See, for example, Rogers, Scotti, and Wright’s (2014) recent event study of central bank announcement 
effects on sovereign yields in different countries.  Similarly, earlier work by Ehrmann and Fratzscher 
(2005) finds larger reactions in euro-area interest rates to U.S. rate changes than vice versa.
