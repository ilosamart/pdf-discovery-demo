significant degree by policy actions to support aggregate demand.  And, of course, EMEs 

have policy tools to limit the expansion of credit. 

Another area of potential concern is excessive valuations in property markets.  

Chart 7 displays inflation-adjusted house prices for several Asian economies.  The most 

striking increases have occurred in Hong Kong, which, through its open capital account 

and essentially fixed exchange rate, is tied most directly to U.S. financial conditions.  Of 

course, the degree of Hong Kongâ€™s exposure to U.S. financial conditions is a policy 

choice, and other factors have also contributed to the run-up in its property prices.  House 

prices have also resumed their rise in China.  But, as with credit growth, this rise seems to 

reflect domestic developments as opposed to spillovers from global financial conditions. 

In light of these potential financial stability concerns, it is encouraging that EME 

policymakers have devoted substantial effort since the Asian financial crisis of the late 

1990s to bolster the resilience of their banking systems.  Banks in many EMEs have 

robust earnings and solid capital buffers.13  Compared with past experience, emerging 

market banking systems also generally enjoy improved management and a proactive 

approach by authorities to mitigate risks.  Nevertheless, in an environment of volatile 

global markets, regulators should guard against the buildup of vulnerabilities, such as 

excessive dependence on wholesale and external funding, declining asset quality, and 

foreign currency mismatches. 

To summarize my discussion so far, EMEs clearly face challenges from volatile 

capital flows and the attendant moves in asset prices.  Accommodative monetary policies 

in the advanced economies have likely contributed to some of these flow and price 

pressures, and may also have contributed to the buildup of some financial vulnerabilities
