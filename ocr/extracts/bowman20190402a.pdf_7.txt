tell those of you who have also found a lot of merit in such tours that it is an enormous 

advantage to find out what is on the minds of those in the field. 

The second, very straightforward reason to foster better communication with all

argues strongly for better coordination.  To a much greater extent than in other nations, in 

the United States financial oversight is divided between the federal government and 

subnational authorities--the states.  At the federal level, responsibility is further divided 

between different agencies, such as the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the 

Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration.  This system evolved over time, 

and as things stand, there are some advantages to this specialization.  But this division of 

labor may, at times, inhibit information sharing, and as a general principle, better 

communication can help overcome this challenge. 

More specifically, better communication and information sharing between state 

banking commissioners and the Federal Reserve can further improve the early 

identification and resolution of emerging issues at community banks.  Harnessing and 

sharing these sometimes divergent views can serve to strengthen a financial regulatory 

system that shares responsibility among many state and federal agencies.  Better 

communication and information sharing will benefit both you and the Federal Reserve,

for chartering and co-supervising the large majority of community banks, they can 

provide a broader perspective into local community banking issues and trends.  

Let me pause here for a moment and say that improving communication doesnâ€™t 

necessarily mean that the Federal Reserve and the CSBS members will always agree.  We
