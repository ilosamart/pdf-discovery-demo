that left many of them incapable of dealing with financial stress and necessitated unprecedented 

government intervention.  A primary focus of post-crisis financial reform has been strengthening 

capital and liquidity buffers at large banking institutions, which has bolstered the safety and 

soundness of these institutions and reduced systemic risk more broadly.   

In terms of liquidity, not only do our largest firms now have the right kind and amount of 

liquidity calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in stressed conditions, but 

they also are required to know where it is at all times and to ensure it is positioned or readily 

accessible where it is most likely to be needed in resolution.  Prior to the crisis, many of the 

largest firms did not even have a good handle on where their liquidity was positioned.  For 

example, our largest banking firms have increased their holdings of high quality liquid assets 

from 12 percent of assets in 2011 to 20 percent of assets in 2017, and they have reduced their 

reliance on short-term wholesale funding from 37 percent of liabilities in 2011 to 25 percent of 

liabilities in 2017.2  This, combined with critical reforms to money market funds and other vital 

short-term funding markets, have reduced the vulnerabilities in the financial system associated 

with liquidity mismatch and maturity transformation. 

In terms of capital, the quality of capital has improved with a particular focus on common 

equity, the most loss-absorbing form of capital.  The quantity of capital also has increased 

through higher minimum requirements and new capital conservation buffers that require banking 

firms to keep their capital levels well above the minimums in order to maintain full flexibility to 

allocate profits to capital distributions and employee bonus payments.  These buffers increase the 

ability of banking organizations to absorb losses and continue to lend to households and
