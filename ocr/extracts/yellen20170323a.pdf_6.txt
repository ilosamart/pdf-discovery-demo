Third, and finally, other presenters will explore issues around skill development 

of youths and young adults, workforce outcomes, and the implications for the broader 

economy.  They will ask how we understand which formative experiences most affect the 

ability of young people to successfully move to the next chapter in their lives, whether 

that means college, a job, or other paths such as self-employment.  What role does a 

range of programs--starting with early childhood education all the way through youth 

vocational or apprenticeship training--play in affecting job readiness?  How effective are 

different approaches, and what are the returns on investment?  We should also pay 

attention to how well young people form the sorts of “soft skills”--things like teamwork, 

communication, and the ability to handle conflict--that are so valued by employers.  And, 

for young people whose paths become difficult, such as those who get caught up in the 

juvenile justice system, what effect do such experiences have on their futures as workers 

and consumers, and what are the most promising approaches to foster a course 

correction?   

I hope that the data and other evidence presented today and tomorrow are of use 

to you in your work.  Community development professionals attending this conference 

may consider how the design and implementation of their programs may be improved.  

Policymakers may look more closely at how kids are affected--purposefully or 

unintentionally--by public policies.  And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new 

work that can shed further light on these important topics. 

I think it is important that we better understand these issues, and I applaud you for 

taking the time to be here to share your knowledge and to learn.  Our young people are 

the future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and
