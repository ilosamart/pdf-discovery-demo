Thank you for having me.1  I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak to 

this distinguished group and look forward to my discussion with Greg Ip.  Now almost 

exactly a year into my appointment as Vice Chairman for Supervision, I have, as might 

be expected, spoken publicly most often about banking and the financial system more 

generally.  However, supervision and regulation are not all that I do at the Federal 

Reserve, and I welcome this opportunity to speak to another part of my day job, as a 

member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Today I would like to offer 

my take on the economic outlook, which is optimistic, and explain how I view my 

optimism as consistent with the continued gradual pace of policy tightening that many 

Committee participants have projected.  In particular, I will explain how my views on 

potential growth help shape my outlook, both for the economy and for the appropriate 

path of monetary policy.  Relatedly, I will discuss the uncertainties that arise when a 

central element of the outlook--in this case, the potential capacity of the economy--is 

unknown and largely unobservable.  Such uncertainty can complicate policymaking in 

even what appears to be a very healthy economy, providing a further argument for 

gradualism.   

Where We Are Now 

In previous remarks on the economic outlook, delivered at a National Association 

for Business Economics conference in February, I characterized the U.S. economy as 

being in a “good spot” and asked if the economy had reached a positive turning point 

                                                 
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System.
