A BLUEPRINT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY

The prior speakers have covered a wide variety of topics 

at this conference, including energy, labor, world trade, and many 

aspects of the United States economy as related to those items.

My assignment is the U.S. economy as a domestic matter and with some 

comments on the international. By the very title of the subject,

I suspect that the organizers of this conference expected me to pre­

sent an outline of the United States economy for the year ahead and 

the pitfalls which might threaten the forecasted posture.

First, economic recovery is under way in the United States. 

It has been supported by near completion of inventory liquidation 

and is being supported to some extent by a modest accumulation in 

certain lines. It is further supported by growth in private housing 

starts and heavy Federal Government expenditures. Increased 

industrial production— up more than 8-1/2 percent over the low 

of the spring of 1975— has also been a product of this recovery.

But the recovery over the past six months and in fact for the en­

tire recovery period has rested heavily upon increased consumer 

spending. You will recall that about a year ago there were tax 

refunds to 1974 taxes in the amount of nearly $26 billion and, 

on top of this, Congress added special payments to Social Security 

recipients and special tax rebates as stimulants to recovery.
