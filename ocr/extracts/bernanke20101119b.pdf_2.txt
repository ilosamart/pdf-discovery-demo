years ago, I sat on a distinguished panel much like this one to help mark the 10th 

anniversary of the euro.  Even as we celebrated the remarkable achievements of the 

founders of the common currency, however, the global economy stood near the precipice.  

Financial markets were volatile and illiquid, and the viability of some of the world’s 

leading financial institutions had been called into question.  With asset prices falling and 

the flow of credit to the nonfinancial sector constricted, most of the world’s economies 

had entered what would prove to be a sharp and protracted economic downturn.   

 By the time of that meeting, the world’s central banks had already taken 

significant steps to stabilize financial markets and to mitigate the worst effects of the 

recession, and they would go on to do much more.  Very broadly, the responses of central 

banks to the crisis fell into two classes.  First, central banks undertook a range of 

initiatives to restore normal functioning to financial markets and to strengthen the 

banking system.  They expanded existing lending facilities and created new facilities to 

provide liquidity to the financial sector.  Key examples include the ECB’s one-year long-

Reserve ultimately established swap lines with 14 other central banks.  Central banks also 

worked to stabilize financial markets that were important conduits of credit to the 

nonfinancial sector.  For example, the Federal Reserve launched facilities to help stabilize
