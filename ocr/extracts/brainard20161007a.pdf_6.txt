Although many private and inward-facing projects are being explored, the 

industry has also recognized the need to collaborate at early stages of development.  An 

important positive development is that industry participants are actively engaging with 

each other to look for common approaches.  Some groups are creating standards that 

facilitate common platforms to enable greater interoperability of often proprietary 

applications that are built on them and interoperate through application program 

interfaces, or APIs.   

In coming months and years, innovators, investors, and financial practitioners will 

no doubt make important strides in addressing key challenges such as adopting common 

standards, achieving interoperability between and among legacy systems and evolving 

distributed ledgers, improving scalability and computational throughput, and improving 

cryptographic security.  These are positive developments that we will monitor closely.  

Managing Risks 

All of this activity demonstrates that we are in a very innovative period.  The 

industry is eager to get on with adopting the various possibilities that distributed ledger 

technology may bring.  However, established players and, increasingly, new entrants 

understand that there are important guardrails that have been carefully developed over 

many years in the arena of payments, clearing, and settlement.  The safety and soundness 

of financial institutions, safety and efficiency of the payment system, and broader 

financial stability are critical to a healthy financial environment that fosters innovation 

with broad public benefits over the long run.  We expect the private sector to bear 

important responsibility for developing and deploying new financial technologies in a 

safe and sound manner, even as we all seek an innovative and efficient payment system
