collaboration to help individuals gain skills that the market demands.  Though creating 

opportunities for workers to retrain is always important, it is especially critical now, 

when the high rate of long-term unemployment threatens the longer-term employability 

and productivity of many. 

Providing economic opportunity and rising living standards for as many people as 

possible is, of course, the fundamental rationale for continued economic development.  

From the perspective of government finances, however, healthy local economies will also 

be necessary if state governments are to successfully confront some difficult, longer-term 

fiscal issues.  As you know, with the retirement of state employees that are part of the 

baby-boom generation and the continued rise in health-care costs, states’ retiree pension 

and health-care obligations will become even more difficult to meet in coming years.  

Estimates of states’ unfunded pension liabilities span a wide range, but some researchers 

put the figure as high as $2 trillion at the end of last year.9  States’ unfunded liabilities are 

significantly higher than before the recession and financial crisis because many pension 

fund investments have declined in value, and because many states have found it difficult 

to maintain pension contributions while their budgets are under stress.  Indeed, some 

estimates suggest that, on average, states would need to more than double their typical 

annual pension contributions over the next decade to avoid collectively exhausting their 

pension funds during the next couple of decades. 10
