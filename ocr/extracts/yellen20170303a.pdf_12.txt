federal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back 

accommodation.  

Partly in response to persistently slow wage growth, FOMC participants and 

private forecasters have in recent years lowered their estimates of the normal longer-run 

rate of unemployment.  The median projection of FOMC participants of the longer-run 

level of the unemployment rate fell from about 5-1/4 percent in June 2014 to 

approximately 4-3/4 percent in December 2016.  Other things being equal, a lower 

longer-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to 

create jobs without generating too much inflation.11  Thus, the downward revisions to 

FOMC participants’ views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to 

our assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had 

anticipated in 2014. 

Further Progress since Mid-2016 

The U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse 

shocks in recent years, and economic developments since mid-2016 have reinforced the 

Committee’s confidence that the economy is on track to achieve our statutory goals.  Job 

gains have remained quite solid, and the unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is 

now in line with the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal 

level.  On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look 

encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded 

                                                 
11 The assessment that there was perhaps more room for improvement in the labor market than previously 
thought was reinforced by data showing that the labor force participation rate remained relatively stable in 
2016, rather than declining as many had expected.
