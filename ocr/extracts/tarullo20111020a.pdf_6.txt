Between the business cycle peak in early 2001 and the peak in late 2007, the number of 

payroll jobs rose an average of only about 0.6 percent per year, compared with job 

growth of 1.8 percent per year in both the 1980s and 1990s.  Similarly, the labor force 

participation rate and the percentage of the population employed each peaked around 

2000 and have been on a downtrend path since then.  It is true that a good part of this 

change can be accounted for by demographic factors--notably, lower population growth, 

the aging of the baby boom, and the leveling off of participation rates among women.  

But other, more disquieting factors are also at work. 

Two tendencies in particular suggest that the U.S. labor market has lost some of 

the dynamism that had long contributed to its resilience.  First, it is apparent that job 

reallocation--that is, the sum of the jobs created at some businesses and lost in others--has 

been in secular decline since the late 1990s.  It may seem counterintuitive to include lost 

jobs in a measure of labor market health, and on its own it is obviously not such an 

indicator.  But when combined with new jobs, it forms part of the dynamic of job 

reallocation, an important part of the “creative destruction” that contributes to long-run 

economic growth--for example, as jobs shift from less-productive firms to more-

productive ones.   

Second, the amount of employee movement across jobs has fallen over time.  

Specifically, the rate at which workers move from one firm to another has declined.  So 

has the rate at which workers quit jobs, an indication of the degree to which they believe 

there are better jobs available for them.  In what may be a related trend, geographic 

mobility across counties and states has decreased.3     

                                                 
3 To date, researchers have been hard-pressed to uncover an explanation for all these declines in worker 
mobility.  See, for example, Andrea Bassanini and Pascal Marianna (2009), “Looking Inside the Perpetual-
