the Asian crisis, currency and maturity mismatches were reduced substantially.  In sum, 

stronger macroeconomic and financial fundamentals gave Korean policymakers the 

flexibility they needed to respond to the crisis with more expansionary monetary and

 Improvements in the Bank of Koreaâ€™s monetary framework served the country 

well during the crisis and are likely to provide additional benefits in the future.  Over the 

past decade, many emerging market economies, including Korea, have reoriented 

monetary policy toward domestic price stability and away from a focus on stabilizing 

exchange rates.  The Bank of Korea, indeed, adopted a formal inflation targeting regime 

in 1998.  Since then, the exchange value of the won has become more flexible, inflation 

has declined to an average of about 3 percent, and--as I have discussed today--the ability 

of the Bank to conduct appropriate countercyclical monetary policies has increased. 

This anniversary is also a good time to consider the challenges that the Bank of 

Korea and other central banks will face in the future.  In the medium term, like the 

Federal Reserve and many other central banks, the Bank of Korea will have to manage its 

exit from accommodative policies.  As is typically the case in the early stages of an 

economic recovery, the Bank will have to weigh the risks of a premature exit against

conditions vary, the appropriate timing of the exit is likely to differ across countries.  To 

guide these important decisions, each central bank will have to carefully monitor 

economic developments in its own jurisdiction.  

 Financial reform is another important challenge facing central banks, including 

those in emerging market economies like Korea.  Even though the origins of the recent
