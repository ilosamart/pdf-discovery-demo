regulation and supervision of systemically important firms and markets can help prevent 

risks from migrating to areas where they are difficult to detect or address. 

In the United States, considerable progress has been made on each of these fronts.  

Changes in bank capital regulations, which will include a surcharge for systemically 

important institutions, have significantly increased requirements for loss-absorbing 

capital at the largest banking firms.  The Federal Reserveâ€™s stress tests and 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process require that large financial 

institutions maintain sufficient capital to weather severe shocks, and that they 

demonstrate that their internal capital planning processes are effective, while providing 

perspective on the loss-absorbing capacity across a large swath of the financial system.  

The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate 

excessive reliance by global banks on short-term wholesale funding.   

Oversight of the U.S. shadow banking system also has been strengthened.  The 

new Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated some nonbank financial firms 

as systemically important institutions that are subject to consolidated supervision by the 

Federal Reserve.  In addition, measures are being undertaken to address some of the 

potential sources of instability in short-term wholesale funding markets, including 

reforms to the triparty repo market and money market mutual funds--although progress in 

these areas has, at times, been frustratingly slow.   

Additional measures should be taken to address residual risks in the short-term 

wholesale funding markets.  Some of these measures--such as requiring firms to hold 

larger amounts of capital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-

term wholesale funding--would likely apply only to the largest, most complex
