Here, though, it is important to draw a distinction between the two standards.  In 

recognition of the fact that the NSFR needs considerable work, which is not yet under way, it is 

not scheduled to become effective until 2018.  The LCR, on the other hand, will go into effect in 

2015.  The Basel Committee has recently agreed to accelerate its review of the LCR so as to be 

able to make changes well before that date and, thereby, give firms and markets ample time to 

prepare and, as necessary, adjust.   

In the coming months, the Federal Reserve, after consulting with the other U.S. banking 

agencies, will be making recommendations for changes in the LCR.  We have not yet finished 

developing those recommendations, but I expect that we will, among other things, suggest 

recalibration of certain deposit run-off and commitment draw-down rates, as well as 

modification of the buffer definition to place a greater focus on the liquidity characteristics of 

assets, as opposed to such things as the credit ratings associated with the assets.  We are also 

examining how the regulations might be best applied during liquidity stress events to maximize 

the benefits for financial stability.  Several other possible changes are also under consideration, 

including altering the LCR so as to limit certain arbitrage opportunities that appear possible from 

its current structure. 

Finally, let me turn to the Basel Committee’s framework for calibrating capital 

surcharges for banks of global systemic importance.  It is informed by the fact that failure of a 

systemically important firm would have substantially greater negative consequences on the 

financial system than the failure of other firms, even quite sizeable ones.  Thus, the surcharge 

attempts to reduce the chances of a G-SIB’s failure so as to bring the expected impact of failure 

of such a firm--that is, its expected damage to the system upon failure discounted by the 

possibility that it will, in fact, fail--more in line with that of other sizeable firms.  Moreover, the
