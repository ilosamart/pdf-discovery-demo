prone years of the 1980s and 1990s.  Global monetary conditions are expected to 

normalize only gradually, as the Federal Reserve and other advanced-economy central 

banks continue to stress clear communication and transparency.  And the reaction of 

EME financial markets so far has been benign.  But significant risks of more adverse 

scenarios remain.  The corporate debt situation in EMEs has been worsening, particularly 

in China, and market reactions to even small surprises can be unpredictable and outsized.   

Even with these risks, however, the best thing the Federal Reserve can do--not 

just for the United States, but for the global economy at large--is to keep our house in 

order through the continued pursuit of our dual mandate.  Finally, it bears remembering 

that Fed policy normalization is occurring not in isolation, but in the context of a solid 

U.S. economic recovery, which should benefit all economies around the world.
