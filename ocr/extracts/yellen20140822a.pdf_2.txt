In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made 

considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of 

employment in the United States since the Great Depression.1  More jobs have now been 

created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May 

of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008.  Job gains in 2014 have 

averaged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two 

years.  The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage 

points from its late 2009 peak.  Over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen 

considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace.  These developments are encouraging, but 

it speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the 

labor market has yet to fully recover.   

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy objective is to foster maximum 

employment and price stability.  In this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far 

the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal.  

Judgments concerning the size of that gap are complicated by ongoing shifts in the 

structure of the labor market and the possibility that the severe recession caused 

persistent changes in the labor market’s functioning.     

These and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of 

monetary policy, so I am pleased that the organizers of this year’s symposium chose 

labor market dynamics as its theme.  My colleagues on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) and I look to the presentations and discussions over the next two 

days for insights into possible changes that are affecting the labor market.  I expect, 

                                                 
1 Nonfarm employment contracted by 6.3 percent from its peak in 2008 to its trough in early 2010, 

compared with a 5.2 percent loss in the 1948-49 recession, previously the largest since the 1930s.
