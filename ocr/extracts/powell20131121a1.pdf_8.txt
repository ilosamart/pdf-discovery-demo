implementation have emerged, however, and it will be important to engage with other 

governments to ensure that such differences do not lead to regulatory arbitrage or 

weakened standards. 

Central Counterparty Risk Management and Governance 

The two primary risks facing a CCP are credit risk (the potential for the CCP to 

incur losses after it closes out a defaulter’s positions) and liquidity risk (the possibility 

that a CCP will not have sufficient cash on hand to meet its payment obligations in a 

timely manner).  While credit risk and liquidity risk are interrelated, they are also distinct 

and need to be measured and managed separately. 

To promote sound credit risk management, the PFMIs require that a CCP collect 

variation margin from its members to limit the buildup of current exposures.  In addition, 

CCPs must also calculate and collect initial margin sufficient to cover potential changes 

in the value of each participant’s position between the last collection of variation margin 

and the final closeout of a participant’s position should it default to the CCP.  This 

process involves modeling potential price movements with an appropriate confidence 

threshold, determining the closeout period in the event the participant defaults, and 

numerous other factors.  Given the complexity of this modeling, it is important that CCPs 

rigorously back-test and stress-test the adequacy of their margin models under a wide 

range of extreme yet plausible scenarios.  More broadly, a CCP should test the 

sufficiency of its total financial resources--initial margin, default funds and capital--to 

cover potential credit losses, taking into account evolving market volatility and liquidity 

conditions.
