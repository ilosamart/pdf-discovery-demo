started by “lifestyle entrepreneurs” who want to be their own boss, but who have little 

prospect or desire for high growth; and those founded by transformational entrepreneurs 

who start businesses that aspire to grow dramatically and change their industry.  Before 

2000, the decline in new firm entry was mainly in the first sort; since 2000, it is also 

found among the so-called transformational firms.  While the drop in the formation of 

lifestyle-type firms could be neutral or even a positive for productivity, as in the case of 

the U.S. retail sector, the reduction in the creation of high-performance new firms 

suggests that lower dynamism could be associated with slower productivity growth.10 

Labor Market Dynamism:  While changing jobs can be painful, job changes in the 

aggregate are associated with higher compensation, implying higher productivity.  But 

the rewards to job change may have declined.  Fewer start-ups has meant lower “job 

flows,” as measured by job creation and destruction, and fewer opportunities for workers 

to find better jobs.  And labor market dynamism across many dimensions has declined by 

more than can be explained by the reduction in startups.  Workers have become less 

likely to leave their jobs, change jobs, or move geographically to take new jobs.11
