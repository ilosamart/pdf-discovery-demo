The reaction was just as striking--albeit in the opposite direction--when the 

Federal Reserve first announced its intention to taper asset purchases in 2013.  The taper 

talk coincided with a broad reassessment of prospects in several large emerging markets 

in which some combination of financial, fiscal, and external imbalances had been 

building for some time.  Spillovers through financial channels were immediate despite 

the fact that the anticipated reduction in asset purchases in the United States was expected 

to take place gradually sometime in the future. 

My conjecture is that the widespread perception that unconventional monetary 

policy has large and disruptive spillovers may be a reflection of the discontinuity 

associated with discrete policy changes at the zero lower bound, along with greater 

uncertainty about the policy reaction function, rather than differences in the underlying 

channels of transmission.  When policy rates are in a range comfortably above the lower 

bound, most of the major central banks confront a relatively narrow range of options in a 

relatively familiar framework of decisionmaking and communications.  By contrast, over 

the past six years, decisions by major central banks to initiate asset purchases have 

neither been seen nor communicated as incremental adjustments, but instead as bold new 

initiatives whose cumulative intended scale, duration, or objective were announced at the 

outset, often against the backdrop of a public debate about the efficacy and 

appropriateness of various policy options.  

For example, in its first two asset purchase programs the Federal Reserve 

committed to buying $1.7 trillion and $600 billion of assets, respectively, while in the 

subsequent flows-based program it committed to continuing monthly asset purchases 

until the outlook for the labor market had met a target for substantial improvement.
