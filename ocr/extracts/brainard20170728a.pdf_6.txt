We are working hard at recruitment at the earliest stages of the career-formation 

process.  Every year the Board hires 50 to 60 research assistants (RAs) for two-year 

terms; the 12 Reserve Banks together hire roughly an equal number.  Our research 

assistant program is to some extent an apprenticeship program for economists and also 

for financial analysts and those in related fields.  Our research assistants are typically 

recent college graduates and most are at least considering further study of economics.  

These are sought-after positions because our RAs have the opportunity to work with the 

Board’s leading economists on both research and work that directly supports 

policymaking.   

For the Summer Program students here today, I would encourage you to explore 

the RA program.  Serving as an RA either at the Federal Reserve Board or at one of the 

Reserve Banks has proven to be a good way to learn more about the profession and 

prepare for graduate school.  I can report that five graduates of last year’s program are 

now working at the Board as RAs and several are working at Reserve Banks.   

For the Federal Reserve System, our recruitment of RAs is a great opportunity to 

give a wide range of potential newcomers some exposure to what the career pathway of 

economics looks like.  While not all RAs go on to further economics education and 

training, a considerable share do, and thus our diversity efforts have the potential to 

significantly affect career pathways later on.  Indeed, at the highest levels of that process, 

the Federal Reserve under Chair Janet Yellen and with the strong support of the 

Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents is committed to increasing diversity among the 

top-ranking staff at the Board and among leaders of the Reserve Banks.
