are “there.”  Maximum employment is something that we must learn about by seeing how 

the job market is operating.  That is very different from the longer-run level of inflation, 

which central banks are presumed able to determine over time.      

At our conference in Chicago, we also asked the panelists about our 

communications with the public, and the responses were humbling.  The Federal Reserve 

communicates with the public about monetary policy through a variety of channels.  At 

each of our policy-setting meetings, the FOMC issues a statement, and Chair Jerome 

Powell holds a press conference.  Three weeks after the meeting, the minutes of the 

meeting are published.  Twice a year, the Federal Reserve submits a Monetary Policy 

Report to the Congress.   

We heard in Chicago that most members of the public care a lot about the job 

market and the cost of credit, but they are not aware of our communications about 

monetary policy.8  Of course, the media plays an important role in communicating our 

monetary policy actions and how they affect the economy.  And the Congress, which 

plays an important role in overseeing the Fed, is a key audience as well.  Nonetheless, 

considering how we can provide greater visibility to the public about what we do will be 

one of the issues we will be considering as our policy review continues.
