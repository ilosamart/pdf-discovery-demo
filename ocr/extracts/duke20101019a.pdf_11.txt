It’s hard to believe, but it was only 16 years ago that the FOMC began releasing any 

information immediately after its meeting.  Before 1994, the public wasn’t formally made aware 

of the FOMC’s decisions until the minutes were published many weeks later.  Instead, market 

participants would closely watch the actions of the New York Fed’s trading desk and would then 

infer when policy changes were made.  On February 4, 1994, Chairman Greenspan released the 

first post-meeting statement describing an FOMC policy action.  At that point, the statement was 

the Chairman’s alone, and there were no promises about future statements being released.  A 

year later, the Committee indicated that a statement would be made after each FOMC policy 

change and by January 2000, the Committee decided to make a statement after each meeting, 

regardless of whether a policy change was made.  In March 1997, the statement began being 

released without attribution to the Chairman, connoting that it was a statement of the whole 

Committee. 

I’d note that these early statements were not completely transparent; for example, the 

statements used code such as “the degree of pressure on reserve positions” to indicate a change 

in the interest rate target.  Not until the middle of 1995 did the statements directly state the target 

for the federal funds rate. 

Over time, the Committee began to see the statement as more integral to its mission and 

to pay more attention to the statement wording.  Starting in late 2000, for instance, recognizing 

the public focus on word changes, the Committee began looking at versions of the statements 

that tracked the changes in wording from the prior statement.  As focus on the statement 

language took more time and attention, the Committee got involved in its development at earlier 

stages.  In early 2004, the staff began providing a full set of draft policy statements, one 

associated with each of the policy choices, in the pre-meeting information package distributed on
